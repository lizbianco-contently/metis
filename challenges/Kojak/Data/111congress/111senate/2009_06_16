Mr. President, every day, like every Senator, I get mail \nfrom men and women across my State. People still write letters. It is \nnot all over the Internet. People still send handwritten letters, lots \nof them. People offer advice, criticism, suggestions, and stories. They \nare making sure their representative democracy works the way they \nbelieve it should. Anyone who is watching at home and wondering whether \nthe representatives you send to Washington actually read these letters, \nI can tell you that we do.\n  I can tell you that on no other issue have the letters my \nconstituents have sent me underscored the urgent need to act more than \nthe health care nightmares they have shared with me.\n  For example, Lisa lives in Gardnerville, NV, a beautiful place, right \nunder the Sierra Nevada mountains. It is very scenic and beautiful. She \nlives in Gardnerville with her two daughters. One is 10 and one is 7. \nThe youngest little girl suffers seizures, and her teachers think she \nhas a learning disability. Because of her family history, Lisa, the \nmom, is at high risk for cervical cancer. Although she has been told by \nher doctors that she should get an exam every 3 months, she now goes \nonce a year because she doesn't have the money to go every 3 months. \nWhen Lisa lost her job recently, she lost her health coverage. Now both \nLisa and her daughters miss out on the tests and preventive medicine to \nkeep them healthy. Her long letter ended with a simple plea: ``We want \nto go to the doctor.''\n  Braden lives in Sparks, NV. The 55-hour weeks he works to support his \nfamily just barely cover his bills. He doesn't have enough money to buy \nhealth insurance for his family, so he doesn't buy it. Braden owes a \nhospital $12,000 for a trip to the emergency room--the only place he \ncould go because he has no health care. Braden is brave, though. In his \nletter, he doesn't dread the debt he carries or grumble about how hard \nhe works, but he does fear, ``If I was seriously sick or injured, I \nwould lose it all.''\n\n[[Page S6612]]\n\n  Alysia is a 21-year-old woman from Las Vegas. She needs surgery for \nthe kidney disease with which she has suffered since she was born, but \nbecause she recently lost her job, health care is not part of her life \nanymore. Alysia has done everything she can to try to get help. \nMedicaid tells her she doesn't qualify because she isn't pregnant, \ndoesn't have children, doesn't have disability insurance. Insurance \ncompanies refuse to cover her, calling her kidney disorder a \npreexisting condition. Everyone else calls this a tragedy.\n  These stories are as real as they come. The letters are written by \npeople who play by the rules and don't understand why the health care \nsystem doesn't play by the rules. They are written from the heart, and \nmany are written through pain, tears, and uncertainty. Sadly, though, \nthey are not unique. Many Americans like Lisa skip routine medical \ncheckups or, like Braden, live one accident away from bankruptcy or one \nsickness away from bankruptcy or, like Alysia, fear for the worst as \nthey fight through the redtape.\n  Our Republican colleagues like things, obviously, just the way they \nare, the status quo. They have committed themselves to a strategy of \nmisinformation and misrepresentation. I heard it again on the radio \nthis morning--government health care. In fact, one Senator said that if \nhe heard a Republican Senator say anything other than ``government \nhealth care''--and he instructed them not to use ``public choice'' or \n``public option''--he jokingly said they will have to put some money in \nthe kitty.\n  Misinformation and misrepresentation is not where we should be. This, \ntogether with their attempt to delay, is only going to hurt people like \nAlysia, Braden, and Lisa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/16/senate-section/article/S6612-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the health care system in this country \nis in urgent need of reform. People are frustrated with the soaring \ncost of care, and they are frustrated that so many of their fellow \nAmericans lack the coverage they need that they should be able to \nexpect in a nation as prosperous as ours. People are also worried about \nthe enormous burden rising health care costs is placing on American \nbusinesses, which are being forced to put off pay increases and lay off \nworkers to cope with rising insurance premiums. And now people are \nconcerned that a new government health plan that is being talked about \nwill make all of these problems even worse.\n  For weeks, many of us have been warning about plans for a government \ntakeover of health care along the lines of takeovers we have seen in \nother areas of the private sector. Now the details of those plans are \ncoming to light, and they raise two questions: How much is all this \ngoing to cost, and how are we going to pay for it?\n  Let's take just three proposals in the plan that is currently taking \nshape in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, the \ndetails of which are just beginning to emerge.\n  First, there is a massive expansion of Medicaid. Here is a program \nthat was originally established as a partnership between the Federal \nGovernment and the States to assist the poor and disabled and which has \nbecome fiscally unsustainable. Yet, rather than reform this broken \nprogram, the HELP Committee is proposing a massive new expansion.\n  Second, the HELP Committee bill includes massive new subsidies for \nAmericans with incomes higher than $100,000 a year. The purpose of \nthese subsidies is to help defray the cost of rising insurance \npremiums. We all know health insurance is too expensive, but we ought \nto be working to lower those premiums, not opening the Federal \ncheckbook to drive them up even higher.\n  Third, the HELP Committee bill establishes a new so-called prevention \nand public health investment fund. The details of this fund are a \nlittle murky, but early indications are that it will direct billions of \ndollars to things such as having the government build sidewalks and \ngovernment-subsidized farmers markets. The idea here is to use tax \ndollars to encourage healthier lifestyles. But at a time when Americans \nare buried under medical bills and frightened about losing the coverage \nthey have, farmers markets and sidewalks are not the reforms they have \nin mind.\n  Americans want serious health care reform, not expansion of programs \nthat are already fiscally unsustainable, subsidies that disguise rising \ncosts instead of addressing their causes, and billions for sidewalks \nand asparagus. These are precisely the kinds of proposals that mask the \nunderlying problems and cause people to lose faith in government \nsolutions, and they are simply not acceptable.\n  The details we are seeing from the HELP Committee should make us more \nskeptical of a government health plan, not less, and they should \nunderscore for every American the need for the kinds of real, \ncomprehensive reforms some of us have been calling for over the last \nfew weeks.\n  The irony in this whole debate is that we are being told that \nAmerica's fiscal future will be jeopardized if we do not allow these \npeople who are proposing these outrageous so-called reforms to take \nover the entire health care system.\n  Preliminary estimates for this flawed legislative proposal are simply \nstaggering. Just yesterday, the Congressional Budget Office released an \nestimate of just part--just part--of the HELP Committee bill. Focusing \non just this one section, the CBO determined the bill will spend $1.3 \ntrillion over 10 years, even though 37 million people would still be \nleft without health insurance. Let me say that again, Mr. \nPresident. Just part of the HELP Committee bill would spend $1.3 \ntrillion over 10 years, after which 37 million Americans would still be \nuninsured. Let me say that again, as I just have. One section of the \nbill--one section--$1.3 trillion, and 37 million still uninsured. And \nthis isn't even a complete evaluation of the bill. Large proposals that \nwill have a significant impact on the cost, such as the Medicaid \nexpansion and a government-run plan, have not even been factored in \nyet.\n\n  Moreover, according to details of the HELP Committee plan, a new \nhealth care exchange would result in 15 million Americans losing the \nemployer coverage they already have--further evidence if you like what \nyou have, you may well lose it under a government-run plan.\n  How does the HELP Committee propose we pay for all this? Well, its \nproposal is full of creative new ways to spend taxpayer dollars, but it \noffers little in offsetting the cost of the overall bill. They will \neither charge the money to the national credit card or, more likely, \nraise taxes on working families. In other words, more spending, higher \ntaxes, and even more debt. So far, some of the taxes under discussion \ninclude a new tax on soda, juice boxes, the creation of a new tax on \njobs, and new limits on charitable deductions.\n  Based on the CBO estimate, these taxes would only be the beginning. \nThe health care proposal being put together is not only extremely \ndefective, it will cost a fortune. And that cost will come straight out \nof the taxpayers' pocketbook.\n  The bottom line is this: Under the illusion of reform, Americans will \nbe asked to give up the care they like for something worse, and then \nthey will be taxed to the hilt to pay for it. Americans don't want \nchanges that make the entire health care system as unsustainable as \nMedicaid, and they don't want to go broke covering the cost.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/16/senate-section/article/S6612-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last Wednesday, a few blocks down the \nstreet, a neo-Nazi opened fire at the Holocaust Museum. He murdered a \nsecurity guard and terrorized the museum's visitors, including \nschoolchildren, who had come to learn, to express sympathy, and to \npray. That evil act was the work of a killer who had made his hatred of \nother religions and ethnic groups well known. And it was a reminder \nthat intolerance, ignorance, and anti-Semitism have not yet been \ndefeated in our world.\n  This tragedy reminds us of the need of sound understanding of one of \nthe darkest episodes in the history of the world. Far too many \nmisrepresent the significance of the Holocaust, especially in regard to \nthe State of Israel and her people. And far too many people deny it \nhappened altogether, out of bigotry, hatred, and spite.\n  In the face of so much misunderstanding, I am compelled today to \nspeak up about the role of the Holocaust in Israel's history and \nIsrael's challenges in preventing anti-Semitic murder from continuing \nto happen.\n  The Holocaust was the most sinister possible reminder that the Jewish \npopulation in exile was in constant jeopardy. It was a definitive \nargument that anti-Semitism could appear anywhere, and its horrors \ngalvanized international support for the State of Israel. But let us be \nvery clear: While the Shoah has a central role in Israel's identity, it \nis not the reason behind its founding and it is not the main \njustification for its existence.\n  The extreme characterization of this mistaken view is the following: \nThe Western powers established Israel in 1948 based on their own guilt, \nat the expense of the Arab peoples who lived there. Therefore, the \ncurrent state is illegitimate and should be wiped off the face of the \nmap. This flawed argument is not only in defiance of basic human \ndignity but in plain defiance of history. It is in defiance of ancient \nhistory as told in biblical texts and through archeological evidence. \nIt ignores the history of the last several centuries. Because of what \nis at stake, it is well worth reviewing this history in detail, and let \nme make a modest attempt at a very broad overview.\n  There has been a continuity of Jewish presence in the Holy Land for \nthousands of years. Jewish kings and governments were established in \nthat area that is now Israel several millennia ago. After untold years \nof Jewish sovereignty, based in Jerusalem, the land of the Jewish \npeople fell repeatedly to invaders--Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, \nRomans, and many others. Jews were repeatedly massacred and expelled, \nand the departure of so many from the land they had always called home \ndeveloped into an unparalleled diaspora.\n  From the 16th century until the earliest 20th century, the land that \nis now Israel was under the control of a distant Ottoman caliphate \nbased in Istanbul, and during this time, as earlier, many Jews returned \nto their ancestral homeland. The Ottoman Empire collapsed after World \nWar I, and the treaty granted Great Britain a mandate over the area \nthen known as Palestine.\n  The League of Nations endorsed and clarified this mandate in 1922, \nrequiring Britain to reconstitute a Jewish national home within the \nterritory they controlled, in accordance with the declaration made by \nBritish Foreign Secretary Balfour in 1917, making the restoration of \nJewish communities in that area a matter of international law.\n  By the time World War II had ended, there were more than 600,000 Jews \nliving in the British Mandate of Palestine. In 1947, the United Nations \napproved a plan to partition the territory into Arab and Jewish states. \nThe Jewish Agency accepted the plan. The Arabs did not. On May 14, \n1948, the State of Israel declared its independence. On May 15, five \nArab nations declared war. Despite being surrounded on all sides, \nIsrael prevailed and expanded its borders, providing a small additional \nmeasure of security against attacks which were certain to come--and \ndid.\n  So to be clear, the more than 700,000 Palestinians who left Israel \nwere refugees of a war instigated by Arab governments, bent on seizing \nmore land for themselves. But the Arabs who left Israel after its \nmodern founding weren't the only displaced population in the Middle \nEast. In addition to the hundreds of thousands of Jews who left Europe \nduring and after the Holocaust in the 20th century, more than three-\nquarters of a million Jews fled or were expelled from their homes in \nArab and Middle Eastern nations--in cities that many of their families \nhad lived in for nearly a millennium. Their possessions were taken, \ntheir livelihoods were destroyed, victims of nationalism and hatred of \nIsrael.\n  Several thousand years of history lead to an undeniable conclusion: \nThe reestablishment of the State of Israel in modern times is a \npolitical reality with roots going back to the time of Abraham. And so \nthe way to consider the immeasurable impact of the Holocaust in Israel \nis not to ask whether the State would exist otherwise. It is, at least \nin one sense, to imagine how even more vibrant Israel would be if \nmillions upon millions had not been denied a chance to know it.\n\n  The attacks on Israel have barely stopped since 1948--not just \nattacks by armies but attacks by individuals, attacks by tanks and \nterrorists, attacks that have come in the form of stones and they have \ncome in the form of speeches. Its enemies have attempted to assassinate \nits people with rockets and assassinate its national character with \nhateful rhetoric. Today it is still surrounded by hostility; its back \nis still to the sea. It is surrounded by hostility from Hezbollah in \nLebanon and Hamas in the Gaza strip.\n  In looking at the threat Israel faces on its southwestern border, one \nfact must be absolutely, indisputably, unequivocally clear: There is no \nmoral equivalency between Israel and Hamas. Israel is a sovereign \ndemocratic state of 7.5 million people--Jews, Muslims, and Christians. \nHamas is a terrorist organization. It won control of Gaza after men in \nski masks waged gun battles with another branch of Palestinian \nleadership. It used that control to launch rockets at sleeping children \nin the nearby Israeli cities of Ashkelon and Sterot. This is the thanks \nIsrael got for withdrawing from Gaza.\n  Hamas does not recognize agreements that Palestinian leaders have \nreached with Israel in the past, it does not recognize Israel's right \nto exist at all, and in fact it is ideologically committed to Israel's \nannihilation. Gaza's people thirst for freedom and opportunity but are \nheld hostage to Hamas's thirst for destruction. And even today, after \nthe consequences of menacing Israel became clear in a disastrous war, \nweapons are flowing freely through tunnels into Gaza, Hamas has rearmed \nand is readying itself for the day when it is going to take on Israel \nagain.\n  Hamas and Hezbollah may be the head of the snake when it comes to \nterrorism, but the tail extends much further. The weapons terrorists \nuse were sent from Iran. Money they received was sent from Iran. \nPropaganda supporting Hamas's campaign of terror and calling for \nIsrael's destruction was conceived in, produced by, and broadcast from \nIran.\n  The fundamentalist regime in Teheran isn't just an emerging threat. \nIt doesn't just have the potential to be a threat to Israel's \nexistence. It is a threat to Israel's existence. Under no circumstances \nwhatsoever can we allow that conventional threat to become a nuclear \none. Especially in light of the threat of Iran, and in light of the \nthreat extremists pose to so many innocent civilians around the globe, \nthe importance of Israel as a strategic ally and friend to the United \nStates could not be clearer. It is hard to overstate the value of \nhaving such a stalwart democratic ally in such a critical part of the \nworld--an ally in terms of intelligence gathering, economics, politics, \nand culture. Israel arose in a desert rampant with repression, a force \nof moderation against fundamentalism and extremism. It is an ally we \ncan constantly depend on and count on to\n\n[[Page S6614]]\n\nbe with us in international fora and on the key decisions that affect \nthe safety and security of Americans around the world.\n  For more than six decades, it has been a key U.S. trading partner and \na scientific innovator. We have Israeli engineers to thank for \neverything from advances in solar power to cell phone technology to AOL \nInstant Messenger. Equipment we are using in Iraq to fight terrorism \nand keep American troops safe was developed in Israel. Medical \ntreatments we are using in U.S. hospitals to fight cancer, heart \ndisease, and chronic pain were developed in Israel. Israeli-born actors \nare stars of Hollywood, and an Israeli astronaut has accompanied \nAmericans into space.\n  So it is not only in the interest of Israel to have its full history \nrecognized, it is in the national interest and the national security \ninterests of the United States. It is in our interests to fully \nremember the unbreakable bond that has made us both stronger over the \nlast 61 years and to make it unmistakable that our commitment is as \nstrong as ever.\n  The argument for Israel's legitimacy does not depend on what we say \nin speeches. It has been made by history. It has been made by the men \nand women who have made the desert green, by Nobel prizes earned, by \ngroundbreaking innovations and enviable institutions, by lives saved, \ndemocracy defended, peace made, and battles won. There can be no \ndenying the Jewish people's legitimate right to live in peace and \nsecurity on a homeland to which they have had a connection for \nthousands of years.\n  We can and must move forward in the peace process, and look for ways \nto reach agreement between all sides. But we cannot erase the moral \ndistinctions between tyranny and freedom, and we must not edit history. \nIf we stay true to history and follow our moral compass, I am \noptimistic that talks can lead to understanding and resolution of the \nvery sensitive, detailed, and tough issues we face.\n  The next pages of Middle Eastern history are not doomed to be stained \nby an endless, senseless fight to the death. It doesn't have to be that \nway. Different peoples of vastly different backgrounds have peacefully \nthrived in the Middle East for generations upon generations, and this \ncoexistence can happen once more.\n  Let us remember the words of Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat in \n1978, when he accepted the Nobel Prize for peace--words that not long \nbefore would have seemed incredibly unlikely. He said:\n\n       Let us put an end to wars, let us reshape life on the solid \n     basis of equity and truth. And it is this call . . . of the \n     great majority of the Arab and Israeli peoples, and indeed of \n     millions of men, women, and children around the world that \n     you are today honoring. And these hundreds of millions will \n     judge to what extent every responsible leader in the Middle \n     East has responded to the hopes of mankind.\n\n  I have been to Israel. I have shaken the hands of its citizens and \nvisited its holy places. I know that in the heart of Israelis there is \na strong desire for peace. We can never lose sight of why peace is so \nimportant. After the unspeakable horrors of the Holocaust, the Jewish \npeople would forever be mindful that no one knows what turns history \nwill take and every day we are mindful that anti-Semitism has not gone \naway, whether in the form of a firebombing of a French synagogue, \ndefamatory comments of a government official in South Africa, or a \nsenseless murder in Washington DC.\n\n  Israel is the one place in the world, the one place where anti-\nSemitism can be structurally impossible. It is a field of hope on which \nfear can be vanquished, an island of refuge that can stand firm no \nmatter how stormy the sea of history turns. That is why we must always \nkeep it safe and always keep it free.\n  The United States is not simply allied with a government, it is an \nally of Israel's people. It is an ally of Israel's democratic ideals. \nIt is an ally of its history, of its aspirations for peace and \nprosperity, its can-do spirit, and amazing resilience in the face of \nthreats from all sides. In that sense, we are not just Israel's allies, \nwe are admirers, we are partners, and we are friends.\n  I plan to do everything I can to see that we support this friendship \nthis year, next year, and every year thereafter.\n  Let me close by saying Martin Luther King said:\n\n       The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards \n     justice.\n\n  We know that in Israel's quest for security, there will be trials \nalong the way, there will be setbacks, and there will be dangers too \ntremendous for words. But if we continue the work we do and continue to \nstay true to the values that drive our journey, then the long arc will \neventually rest in place in the land of Israel and it is a just and \nlasting peace that will be at hand.\n  I yield whatever time I have, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this morning the Republican Senate leader, \nMitch McConnell of Kentucky, came to the floor to talk about health \ncare. It is a timely conversation among Members of the Senate about the \nfuture of this important issue. I know Senator Wyden of Oregon is going \nto address it as well.\n  Yesterday, in Chicago, IL, which I am honored to represent, the \nPresident came to speak to the American Medical Association, a \ngathering of doctors from all over the United States, to address this \nsame issue. It is an issue of paramount importance to these medical \nprofessionals. They understand, as we do, that we want to maintain the \nbest quality health care in the world. In order to do that, we have to \nface the realities of the shortcomings of our current health care \nsystem.\n  Although we have many of the best hospitals and doctors and some of \nthe best technology, we lead the world in the development of \npharmaceuticals, we also know the cost of this system is spinning out \nof control. People feel it; whether it is individuals buying health \ninsurance, businesses, governments--State and local and Federal \ngovernments--all understand that if the cost of health care continues \nto rise as it is currently going up, it will literally break the bank, \nnot just for the Federal Government and all the health care programs we \nhave but for individuals and families and businesses. That is the \nreality.\n  If we do nothing, if we ignore this reality, we are doomed to face a \nsituation where more and more of the dollars we earn as employees will \ngo toward health care protection and health care insurance and the \nprotection itself will diminish each year--because that is the other \nreality. As the cost of health insurance goes up each year, the \ncoverage goes down.\n  People know what I am talking about. When the health insurance \ncompany says we have a great plan for you but, incidentally, remember \nthe cancer test you had last year, we will not cover anything related \nto cancer in the future, that is not much when it comes to insurance or \nprotection or peace of mind.\n  They also know that many health insurance companies make this a \ndeadly game of a battle between what your doctor says you need and what \nsome insurance company bureaucrat is going to negotiate. You end up on \nthe phone with some clerk in a distant location\n\n[[Page S6615]]\n\ndebating as to whether there is coverage and whether they can go ahead \nwith the procedure they think is important for you or someone you love \nvery much in your family. That is the reality of where we are today. We \nhave to deal with cost and deal with it in a fashion that is \nappropriate.\n  How do we deal with it? First, this system has a lot of money in it. \nWe spend twice as much as any other country on Earth when it comes to \nhealth protection and health care. Yet when you look at the results, \nthe actual survival rates for many of the serious illnesses that face \nus, it turns out that countries that spend a fraction of what the \nUnited States spends get better results. There is a lesson to be \nlearned. There is waste in this system.\n  One of the articles that is making the rounds on Capitol Hill was \nwritten in the New Yorker magazine on June 1 by a Boston surgeon named \nAtul Gawande. He went to McAllen, TX, and tried to understand why the \ncost per Medicare patient there, at $15,000 a year, was so high, \ndramatically higher than many other comparable cities in the State of \nTexas and around the Nation.\n  What he found, to his surprise and disappointment, was that the \ndoctors and hospitals in those areas were bundling up and charging \npeople as much as possible, ordering procedures that were unnecessary, \ndoing things that were not called for. The reason was obvious: there \nwas money to be made. As long as they kept piling the medical bills on \nthe patients through Medicare, they received more reimbursement. They \ndidn't have healthier people. They didn't have an outcome that \njustified it. But they made a lot more money in the process.\n  What the President has said to us is, with all this money in the \nsystem, we have to find ways to bring in more efficiency. It is one \nthing to say that 48 million Americans currently uninsured will receive \nprotection. I think that is basic. That is moral. That should be one of \nour primary goals. But that costs money.\n  When the Republican leader comes up and argues this is going to be an \nexpensive undertaking, what he is saying is we cannot afford to insure \npeople in America. I think he is wrong. I think there are ways to do \nit, and we must do it because, honestly, if they don't have health \ninsurance, they are still going to get sick. They are still going to a \ndoctor or hospital and all of us are going to pay for it.\n  Right now we estimate that for an ordinary family in America, we are \npaying about $1,000 a year more in health insurance premiums to cover \nthose who are uninsured. In other words, the health insurance policy I \nhave through the Federal Government with the Federal employees costs \n$1,000 more than it ordinarily would so there is more money in the \nsystem to cover those uninsured. If we can bring those uninsured into \ninsurance coverage, it gives them peace of mind, it relieves this \nhidden tax on families across America, and it means, frankly, that \nproviders--hospitals, doctors, and others--are going to be adequately \ncompensated for the care they offer to currently uninsured people.\n\n  When President Obama comes to the AMA and talks about covering the \nuninsured, there is usually a cheer. That is 48 million more paying \ncustomers, people who will actually pay into our system. But he also \ntalks about something that is not as popular with many health care \nproviders and that is reducing the cost of this system.\n  What happened in McAllen, TX, is unacceptable; that you can have \nhealth care providers trying to run up the bill in an effort to make \nmore money for themselves at the expense of the government, at the \nexpense of health insurance companies but, frankly, not to the benefit \nof those who are being treated.\n  The Senator from Kentucky frequently comes here and talks about how \nmuch he dislikes--I will use that word--government-related health care. \nLet's make it clear. I do not know of anyone, including the President \nor leaders of Congress, calling for a government health care plan to \ncover everyone. That is not what we are asking for. We want to make \nsure there is private health insurance that is held accountable and is \ncompetitive so we can help bring down the cost. But to argue there is \nsomething fundamentally wrong with government-sponsored health care, \neven if it is just an option, a voluntary option for customers across \nAmerica, is to ignore the obvious. There are 40 million Americans today \nprotected by Medicare. Forty million seniors and disabled people who \nhave quality health care because of a government plan that has been in \nplace now for over 40 years. There are also a large number of our men \nand women who serve in the military protected by the veterans health \ncare system, another government health care system, who believe--and I \nthink rightly so--that they are receiving some of the best medical care \nin America. I do not believe the Senator from Kentucky is opposed to \nthe Veterans' Administration and the health care it provides, but it is \na government plan.\n  The same is true when it comes to the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. That is health insurance for individual children through \nprivate companies, but the Government has stepped in to make sure these \nkids are covered, and I, frankly, am very proud of the fact that when \nPresident Obama took office, we extended that coverage to 11 million \nuninsured children in America. That was a government effort to make the \nprivate health insurance effort in our country work better.\n  We have to get down to the bottom line here. Are we going to succeed \nor fail when it comes to health care reform? If we ignore the obvious \nand ignore the challenges, there is a genuine chance we may come up \nshort. But if we accept this historic challenge to come together on \nboth sides of the aisle, I think the American people will cheer us on. \nThey want to maintain what is good about the current health care system \nand fix what is broken. They want to make sure, at the end of the day, \nif they have health insurance they like, a plan they think is right for \nthem and their families, that they can keep that. They want to make \nsure the health care reform is centered on patients and families and \nthe doctor-patient relationship, not on a government bureaucracy. They \nwant to end the health insurance company bureaucracies that are so \nfrustrating and so expensive for families across America.\n  When the Senator from Kentucky, the Republican leader, comes to the \nfloor and comes up with a series of criticisms about any attempt at \nreform, I have a question to ask him: What is your option? What would \nyou do? Do you accept the status quo? Do you think this is as good as \nit can be? I do not. I agree with President Obama. We can do better.\n  The President said one last thing that I am going to say; that is, he \nsaid: If this were easy, it would have been done a long time ago. It is \nhard, and it will take bipartisan cooperation for it to succeed. I \nencourage my colleagues to join in that conversation at the Finance \nCommittee, as well as at the HELP Committee, and I hope we can produce \na product this year that shows we are going to move forward together to \nmake sure we have affordable quality health care for every American.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, how much time remains on the Democratic \nside?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 11 minutes 24 seconds.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, many Senators on both sides of the aisle \nare working constructively to fix American health care. For several \nyears, I have spent time listening to colleagues, going to the offices \nof 85 Senators and at least that many in the House, and to thousands of \nothers in the public and private sectors, about their ideas for fixing \nAmerican health care. My aim with these discussions has been to find \ncommon ground and to chart a path so that this Congress and this \nPresident can do something this country has never done before: enact \nreal health reform.\n  Today, I come to the floor to lay out the specifics of real health \ncare reform. The President said yesterday that there has never been a \nbetter opportunity to get the job done; to improve the lives of all \nAmericans and guarantee quality, affordable coverage to all of our \npeople.\n  The question now is will Democrats and Republicans in the Senate rise \nto this challenge? Will this Congress and the President overcome the \nfear tactics\n\n[[Page S6616]]\n\nthat have derailed past efforts? But maybe equally as important: Will \nthis Congress and our President dare to pass real reform?\n  The pitfall, as I see it, is that too often we have been afraid of \nfailure. If we draft legislation with an eye only on what we think can \nget passed, on what we think the American people will buy, if we play \nit too safe, my fear is that we will miss the opportunity for real \nreform. I believe that passing a reform bill that does not reform the \nhealth care system is about as wrong as not passing any bill at all.\n  President Obama said yesterday he will only support legislation that \n``earns the title of reform.'' I agree with the President, which is why \nI am going to use this morning to lay down a similar marker for what I \nbelieve is necessary to ``earn the title of real reform.''\n  First, real reform means that all of us, and especially the powerful \ninterest groups, must accept changes resisted in the past. Insurers are \ngoing to have to change the way they do business. Pharmaceutical \ncompanies will have to be more responsive to purchasers that insist on \nmore value and transparency. Doctors and hospitals will be held \naccountable for the quality of care they provide. Malpractice suits \nwill be held to stricter standards.\n  Individuals will have to take greater responsibility for their \nhealth. Real health reform means changing the way business is done in \nthe private insurance market. It means an end to insurance companies \ncherry-picking, a practice where the companies take the healthy people \nand send sick people over to government programs more fragile than they \nare. No longer should anyone make money by denying care to someone who \nneeds it. That is wrong, and this Congress will make it illegal.\n  Real reform means everyone is guaranteed coverage by their choice of \ninsurer. Under any new system, insurance companies must be required to \ncover everyone and they must be required to price with fairness so you \ndo not get discriminated against because of your gender or your health \nstatus or your age. It means you will no longer be denied coverage or \ncharged more because you were sick 5 years ago or today or you might be \nsick 5 years from now.\n  Real health reform guarantees that all Americans can choose their \ndoctor and their health plan. The President said yesterday: Real reform \nwill give every American access to the insurance exchange where they \ncan choose to keep the care they have or pick a better plan that meets \ntheir families' needs. That means if you like the care you have, you \ncan keep it. But it also means that if you do not like the care you \nhave, you can reject it. You can reject it and choose a better plan.\n  Real reform would not only cover the uninsured, but it will make the \nlives of all of those who have insurance coverage better. Right now the \nmajority of Americans who are lucky enough to have employer coverage \nhave no choice in where they get their insurance. I believe these \nAmericans deserve choices too.\n  Some might say that this undermines the employer-based system. No, it \ndoes not. Rather, it makes the employer-based system more accountable \nat the same time that it makes health care more portable. Real health \nreform means that if you leave your job or your job leaves you, you \nwill not lose your health care coverage.\n  Real reform will once and for all end the entrepreneurial tax in \nwhich Americans are afraid to go into business for themselves because \nthey cannot take their health care with them. The President himself \nsaid it best when he wrote in 2006, ``With Americans changing jobs more \nfrequently, more likely to go through spells of unemployment, and more \nlikely to work part time or to be self-employed, health insurance can't \njust run through employers anymore, it must be portable.''\n  Real reform will guarantee that all Americans can afford quality \nhealth care. No longer should families be forced to pay more for their \nhealth insurance premiums than they pay for their housing. Our goal \nshould not be to exempt those Americans who cannot afford to pay, our \ngoal should be to guarantee that every American can afford the health \ncare they need.\n  Real reform will be affordable for the Nation and for our taxpayers. \nIt will reduce current costs and bring the rate of health care \ninflation in line with economic growth. Failure to meet this test would \nresult in massive new government obligations and no means to pay for \nthem.\n  Real reform must end the health care caste system in which low-income \nAmericans are treated as second-class citizens. No longer should low-\nincome Americans have less access to doctors than their Member of \nCongress or any other American. Today, 37 million adults and 10 million \nchildren effectively lack access to a primary care physician. Those are \nAmericans who have health insurance but who cannot find a doctor to \ncare for them. Real reform means ending the caste system in America \nthat, in my view, discriminates against the most vulnerable and most \nimpoverished among us. Real reform means that when you need a doctor \nyou will be able to see one.\n  Real reform will reward Americans for making smart choices. Americans \nshould be rewarded for choosing the right insurer for their families, \nand they should be rewarded for choosing a healthy lifestyle. This \nmeans creating a health system that no longer focuses primarily on sick \ncare, but puts a priority on prevention as well.\n  Real reform will change the incentives that drive behavior in the \nAmerican health system. It will reduce the demand and desire for \nunnecessary health care services. Health care institutions will no \nlonger profit from the quantity of procedures they run up but will \ninstead be rewarded for quality care.\n  Real reform will take an axe to administrative costs. Americans will \nsign up just once for health care. They will have their premiums taken \nfrom their withholding so they do not have to worry about making \npayments. They will go into large efficient groups so they are no \nlonger left on their own in the individual market.\n  In today's non-system, people are an afterthought to the self-\nperpetuating bureaucracy of medical billing, reimbursement fights, \ncoverage fights, and outright fraud, waste, and abuse. Like the \nPresident said yesterday, real reform will: ``Replicate best practices; \nincentivize excellence; close cost disparities.'' In effect, he wants \nto see health care dollars go to pay for quality, efficient health \ncare. And that is what I have described today.\n  Real reform means providing care. It means guaranteeing that all \nAmericans have good, quality, affordable coverage, coverage that is \nportable. It means ensuring we end the caste system so all Americans \ncan see doctors when they need one. And it means creating a system that \nis more intent on keeping people healthy than profiting from illness.\n  The central question, when it comes to real reform, is not who pays, \nbut how we pay. Because everyone knows that ultimately the American \ntaxpayer is the one footing the bill. It is now Congress's job to \ncreate an accountable system that puts the focus where it belongs, not \non misguided incentives, not on shedding risk, not on quarterly \nprofits, but on providing quality, efficient care for all our people.\n  That is what Americans want from this debate about health care \nreform. That is what I think can bring Democrats and Republicans \ntogether, working with the President under the banner of real reform. \nThe country deserves it. It is time for this Congress to give it to our \npeople.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/16/senate-section/article/S6616-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6616-S6620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, tomorrow the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions will begin consideration of a 615-page \nbill that seeks to reform our Nation's health care system. This bill, \nintroduced by Senator Kennedy and others last week, has very great \nambitions.\n  We all agree that health care reform is necessary. We all agree that \nCongress must act. But we must not act recklessly. We must not act with \nhaste and political expediency. Health care reform will affect each and \nevery American and we must do it right. I strongly believe that we have \nto start over and act in a truly bipartisan manner to address the \nissue.\n\n[[Page S6617]]\n\n  Unfortunately, the legislation before that committee seeks to enact a \nmassive government-run health care program that intrudes into the lives \nof all Americans by making decisions on each American's choice of \ndoctors, employer health plans, and insurance providers, and it leaves \nmajor questions unanswered.\n  Every American should know the answer to how much will this massive \nexpansion of government cost. And every taxpayer should have a clear \nanswer to how are taxpayers going to pay for this massive government \nexpansion.\n  Yesterday the Congressional Budget Office released a letter which \nstated that the Kennedy bill, the bill now pending for markup beginning \ntomorrow in committee, would insure only one-third--would insure only \none-third--of the 47 million Americans who are currently uninsured, for \na cost of $1 trillion--$1 trillion--over 10 years.\n\n  Again that only insures one-third of the uninsured. Let me quote from \nthe Congressional Budget Office report. It says:\n\n       Once the proposal [that is the bill that we are now \n     considering in the HELP Committee] was fully implemented, \n     about 39 million individuals would obtain coverage through \n     the new insurance exchanges. At the same time, the number of \n     people who had coverage through an employer would decline by \n     about 15 million or roughly 10 percent, and coverage from \n     other sources would fall by about 8 million. So the net \n     decrease in the number of people uninsured would be about 16 \n     million, because 47 million are without health insurance in \n     America.\n\n  So this matches an executive summary entitled ``The Impact of the \n2009 Affordable Health Choices Act'' which was completed by the HSI \nNetwork, done by Steve Parente, Ph.D., and Lisa Tornai, M.S.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this report be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. This study authenticates the Congressional Budget Office, \nbecause what it says is, if you want to insure every American, it is \ngoing to be $4 trillion--not $1 but $4 trillion--over a 10-year period.\n  So to insure coverage for all Americans, as proposed in the \nlegislation, it would cost $460 billion annually or $4 trillion over \nthe next 10 years, according to a report issued last week, as I \nmentioned.\n  The best we can tell, the cost of the legislation that we are now \nconsidering is $4 trillion. How are we going to pay for that? How are \nwe going to pay for it? Is there a proposal yet, besides eliminating \nfraud, abuse, and waste?\n  It is unacceptable. It is not health care reform. I believe the CBO \nletter should be a wake-up call to all of us in this Chamber to scrap \nthe current bill and start all over, and start all over in a bipartisan \nfashion with true negotiations.\n  Yesterday the President of the United States said the opponents of \nhis legislation or his proposal were fear mongering. I cannot agree \nwith that assessment nor do I accuse the proponents of this bill of \nthat motivation. This is not health care reform. Any bill that strips \n23 million Americans of their current health care coverage and insures \na mere third of the 47 million uninsured Americans is not what \nAmericans are looking for in legislation.\n  Let me say, Americans are not calling for a massive government \nexpansion. They are not calling for a new government insurance plan \nthat will do away with existing private insurance plans or an act of a \nbroad government panel exerting command and control of individual, \nsmall group and large employer health care plans. They are not calling \nfor new tax cuts to health care services or penalties to individuals or \nsmall businesses if health coverage does not comply with Washington's \nstandards. They are not calling for $1 to $4 trillion to be spent to \nfund the appetite of some who are hungry for more government intrusion \ninto the daily lives of Americans.\n  Americans need health insurance, good and complete health care \ncoverage, the security of knowing they have a job, and even better, a \njob where an employer can afford to provide health care coverage. If \nthe employer does not provide coverage, we need to make it easier and \naffordable to get health care coverage for an American.\n  Two ideas: One, give every American family a $5,000 refundable tax \ncredit and let them go out and get an insurance policy that meets their \nneeds. And let them go across State lines if they feel like doing it. \nThat is pretty simple. It is not real complicated. It can be done in a \nbipartisan way in a matter of weeks.\n  That is not what is happening here, despite all of their calls, along \nwith the President's, for bipartisanship. But it can be done if we \nwanted to solve the problem for the American people.\n  I believe it is time for Democrats and Republicans to come together \nand draft a bill that gets Americans the health care coverage needed at \naffordable rates. This should be our goal, ensuring that all Americans \nhave coverage, not just 16 million as the Congressional Budget Office \nstudy indicates, but have everybody covered, not an unsustainable \ngovernment expansion.\n  Again, I am calling on the White House and the Democrats to scrap \nthis unsustainable bill and sit down and let us start from scratch. \nAccording to news reports in New York, Robert Gibbs states this \nmorning, ``This is not the Administration's bill,'' after the CBO \nletter came out.\n  Well, where is the administration's bill? We are supposed to be \nenacting legislation before the end of July. Where is the \nadministration's bill?\n  We cannot afford this one. We cannot afford the one that is \nsupposedly going to be enacted into legislation that will come to the \nfloor of this Senate. It does not do justice to our taxpayers and their \nchildren. Forty-two percent of U.S. voters say cutting the deficit is \nthe most important priority for the country. The bill that is being \nconsidered tomorrow in the HELP Committee is an extraordinary step in \nthe wrong direction.\n  So let me just say, scrap this bad bill. Pay attention to the \nCongressional Budget Office. Understand it does not achieve the goal of \ncoverage. Understand the costs would be around $4 trillion over a 10-\nyear period for which, so far, there is almost no provision to pay for \nit. Let's sit down together and work together in order to provide \nAmericans with the health care they need at a reasonable cost.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n                   2009 Affordable Health Choices Act\n\n  Independent Assessment by HSI Network LLC, for Public Dissemination\n\n\n                            Summary Snapshot\n\n       The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \n     Pensions (HELP) have proposed a health reform bill called the \n     Affordable Health Choice Act (AHC) that seeks to reduce the \n     number of uninsured and increase health system efficiency and \n     quality. The draft legislation was introduced on June 9th, \n     2009. The proposal provided adequate information to suggest \n     what the impact would be of AHC using the ARCOLA \n     TM simulation model. AHC would include an \n     individual mandate as well as a pay or plan provision. In \n     addition, it would include a means-tested subsidy with \n     premium supports available for those up to 500% of the \n     federal poverty level. Public plan options in three tiers: \n     Gold, Silver and Bronze are proposed in a structure similar \n     to that of the Massachusetts Connector, except that it is \n     called The Gateway. These public plan options would contain \n     costs by reimbursing providers up to 10% above current \n     reimbursement rates. There is no mention of removing the tax \n     exclusion associated with employer sponsored health \n     insurance. There is also no mention of changes to Medicare \n     and Medicaid, other than fraud prevention, that could provide \n     cost-savings for the coverage expansion proposed. Below, we \n     summarize the impact of the proposed plan in terms of the \n     reduction on uninsured, the 2010 cost, as well as the ten \n     year cost of the plan in 2010 dollars.\n\n                   HELP Affordable Health Choices Act\n\n       Insurance is reduced by 99% to cover approximately \n     47,700,000 people.\n       Subsidy-Tax Recovery = Net cost: $279,000,000,000 subsidy \n     to the individual market; $180,000,000,000 subsidy to the ESI \n     market with; Net cost: $460,500,000,000 (annual); Net cost: \n     $4,098,000,000,000 (10 year)\n       Private sector crowd out:  79,300,000 lives.\n       The underlying simulation model used is ARCOLA \n     TM, a proprietary version of a health reform \n     coverage and cost assessment analytic engine. A peer-reviewed \n     presentation of the core model structure is summarized in the \n     journal Health Affairs and a longer version is available as a \n     DHHS report at www.ehealthplan.org\n\n\n                           Scoring Components\n\n       Major policy components considering for scoring:\n       Employers would have to offer health insurance or pay a tax \n     not as yet specified.\n       Individuals would have to be covered by a qualified plan or \n     pay a tax.\n       Medicaid for everyone up to 150% of poverty.\n\n[[Page S6618]]\n\n       Sliding scale subsidy from 150% to 500% of poverty.\n       The government would define a qualified plan with 3 levels \n     of coverage: gold, silver and bronze. We assume the subsidy \n     would be priced at the silver level of benefit design.\n       All plans must use modified community rating: premiums can \n     vary only by geographic region (to be defined), family \n     structure, actuarial value of benefits, and age (maximum 2:1 \n     range).\n       Public plan that pays Medicare rates +10%.\n       Small-employer tax subsidy\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n       The plan lowers the uninsured significantly, to less than \n     1% of the population, but not without a cost of over four \n     trillion dollars over 10 years. There are no provisions in \n     the legislation to offset this course. Even if the most \n     generous estimate of the employer sponsored tax exclusion \n     ($300 billion per year, including collecting FICA \n     contributions from employers) where used and combined with \n     fraud estimates and block granting all of Medicaid (acute and \n     long term care), this would be a challenging proposal to \n     finance with budget neutrality. Finally, the public plans \n     will be quite successful in recruiting large numbers of \n     Americans. They will also likely crowd out at 79 million \n     individual contracts with existing private insurers.\n\n[[Page S6619]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS16JN09.001\n     \n\n\n[[Page S6620]]\n\n              ARCOLA TM Technical Documentation\n\n       The ARCOLATM model is a national health policy \n     impact micro-simulation model designed to estimate the impact \n     of health policy proposals at federal and state levels. The \n     model predicts individual adult responses to proposed policy \n     changes and generalizes to the US population with respect to: \n     (1) health insurance coverage and (2) financial impact of the \n     proposed changes.\n       This model was first used for the Office of the Assistant \n     Secretary (OASPE) of the Department of Health and Human \n     Services (DHHS) to simulate the effect of the Medicare \n     Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) on take-up of high-deductible \n     health plans in the individual health insurance market \n     (Feldman, Parente, Abraham et al, 2005; Parente et al, Final \n     Technical Report for DHHS Contract HHSP233200400573P, 2005). \n     The model was later refined to incorporate the effect of \n     prior health status on health plan choice--a necessary step \n     if one wants to predict enrollment more accurately. The \n     latest model also used insurance expenditures from actual \n     claims data to refine premiums and then predict choices again \n     with the new premiums. The model then iterates the choice \n     model until premiums and choices converge, and then finds an \n     equilibrium state. A subsequent change to the model permitted \n     state-specific predictions of policy changes as well as total \n     federal health policy impact.\n\n\n                    Model Components & Data Sources\n\n       There are three major components to the ARCOLATM \n     model: (1) Model Estimation; (2) Choice Set Assignment and \n     Prediction; and (3) Policy Simulation. Often, more than one \n     database was required to complete the task. Integral to this \n     analysis was the use of consumer directed health plan data \n     from four large employers working with the study \n     investigators.\n       The model estimation had several steps. As a first step, we \n     pooled the data from the four employers offering CDHPs to \n     estimate a conditional logistic plan choice model similar to \n     our earlier work (Parente, Feldman and Christianson, 2004). \n     In the second step we used the estimated choice-model \n     coefficients to predict health plan choices for individuals \n     in the MEPS-HC. In order to complete this step, it was \n     necessary first to assign the number and types of health \n     insurance choices that are available to each respondent in \n     the MEPS-HC. For this purpose we turned to the smaller, but \n     more-detailed MEPS Household Component-Insurance Component \n     linked file, which contained the needed information. The \n     third step was to populate the model with appropriate market-\n     based premiums and benefit designs. The final step was to \n     apply plan choice models coefficients to the MEPS data with \n     premium information to get final estimates of take up and \n     subsidy costs.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Madam President, this week the Senate will be \nconsidering the Travel Promotion Act, which is an important bill for my \nhome State of Florida.\n  Every year, millions of tourists travel to the United States from \noverseas, helping our economy, generating revenues for States and \ncommunities, and creating job opportunities for millions of Americans. \nBut for most of this last decade there has been a huge dropoff in \nvisitors to the United States from other countries. Between 2000 and \n2008, the U.S. tourism industry has experienced an estimated 58 million \nlost arrivals, $182 billion in lost spending, $27 billion in lost tax \nreceipts, and $47 billion in lost payroll. We have also lost 245,000 \njobs. One in eight Americans is directly or indirectly employed by the \ntravel industry. The industry contributes $1.3 trillion to the U.S. \neconomy, and the industry contributes $115 billion in tax revenue.\n  In Florida, home to Walt Disney World, Universal Studios, many \nbeautiful beaches, the Everglades, some of the best fishing and \nsnorkeling in the world, and the oldest settlements in North America, \nthe tourism industry employs no less than 750,000 Floridians and \naccounts for nearly 25 percent of all of the State's sales tax \ncollections. Last year, the United States had 633,000 fewer \ninternational travelers than we had in the year 2000. Florida has taken \na harder hit, losing 1.3 million visitors over that same period of \ntime.\n  Numbers do not lie. Our lack of attention to self-promotion is \ncosting us money, jobs, and opportunities. And it is not that people \nare not traveling. The fact is, people are traveling to some \ndestinations other than the United States. The world competition for \nthe travel dollar is keen. Countries all over the world are doing all \nthey can to attract visitors to their countries. We are competing in a \nworld marketplace.\n  This is an alarming trend we are seeing in the United States, and it \nclearly hurts our economy. But it also has an impact on our image \naround the world. Studies show a person's opinion of our country is \ngreatly improved when they visit our country. We are our own best \nambassadors. But when fewer people visit here, there are fewer \nopportunities for others to see what our Nation has to offer and what \nwe are all about. So increased travel to the United States is not only \ngood for our Nation, it is also good for the way in which we portray \nourselves to the world.\n  One of the best ways to address this is to create a comprehensive \ncampaign to promote the United States as a travel destination. This is \na way of reversing this current trend. This is a way of bringing back \nsome of the declines to a better day so we can increase jobs and \nopportunities in our country.\n  Here is an example of what other nations spend to promote themselves \nin the tourism market around the world. Here is what we are competing \nagainst. This is what the United States is up against as we look to \ncompete for the travel dollar. Our close neighbor of Mexico spent $149 \nmillion promoting travel to Mexico. Our other close neighbor, Canada, \nspent $58 million in promoting travel to its country. China spent $60 \nmillion in promoting travel to its country. Australia spent $113 \nmillion. The countries of the European Union collectively spent $800 \nmillion on self-promotion. How much has the United States spent? We \nhave spent absolutely nothing. We spend nothing in promoting our \ntourism.\n  For years, sectors within the agricultural industry have used so-\ncalled checkoff programs to promote their products. We have heard the \nslogans: ``Pork, the other white meat.'' ``Beef, it's what's for \ndinner.'' ``Milk, it does a body good.'' These are familiar slogans \ncreated by industry-sponsored campaigns. Producers kick in their own \nmoney to create a marketing campaign that benefits all producers. We \nneed the same thing for our tourism, which is why I urge my colleagues \nto support moving forward on the Travel Promotion Act. It will benefit \nour economy, it will complement our Nation's diplomatic efforts and, \nperhaps most importantly, it will help to create new jobs.\n  The Travel Promotion Act will enable the United States to become its \nown ambassador by establishing a public-private campaign to promote \ntourism abroad. The campaign would be led by an independent, not-for-\nprofit corporation governed by an 11-member board of individuals \nappointed by the Secretary of Commerce. Each would represent the \nvarious regions around the Nation and bring their expertise in \npromoting international travel. The program will not use taxpayer money \nbut will instead rely on user fees paid by foreign tourists and in-kind \ncontributions from corporate partners.\n  Additionally, the act will increase coordination among the Commerce, \nState, and Homeland Security Departments to streamline the entry and \ndeparture procedures for our foreign tourists. You see, not only are we \nnot promoting ourselves, we are also doing a lot to complicate travel \nto our country. Because of those things which were done as a necessity \npost-9/11, we have created a lot of layers of complication for foreign \ntravelers to visit our country. We have to continue to have the kind of \nprotection about who visits our land to protect our homeland, but at \nthe same time we need to use some common sense about how this is done \nand incorporate some modern technologies to ensure that the travel \nexperience to the United States is not cumbersome, is not complicated, \nand that it is transparent and enjoyable for those who come to visit \nus.\n  In today's economy, every visitor counts. In the competitive world we \nlive in, every competitive dollar that can be spent out there promoting \ntravel to the United States will inure to the benefit of the job \ncreation we will see in places such as my home State.\n\n[[Page S6621]]\n\nWhen you consider that visitors from overseas spend an estimated $4,500 \nevery time they visit the United States, more visitors will mean more \njobs for Americans at a time when unemployment continues to rise.\n  So I truly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill as \nwe work toward increasing our Nation's presence as a tourist \ndestination around the world. I hope, as the week unfolds, we will have \nan opportunity to engage in conversation and discussion and debate \nabout this very important tourism bill, which will help most States of \nthis country.\n  The fact is we want Florida to be a significant tourism destination. \nWe are proud of that in our State, but the fact is that States around \nthe country all can benefit and do benefit greatly from foreign \ntourists visiting our country. It is a great, green way of promoting \njobs and opportunities in our country and one I think is long overdue. \nIf we are going to compete effectively with countries abroad, we must, \nin fact, also be competitive in how we promote and advertise ourselves \nto the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am looking for a way to offer an \namendment to the health care bill that would sentence every Senator who \nvotes to increase Medicaid eligibility to 150 percent of the Federal \npoverty level to a term of 8 years as Governor in his or her home \nState, so they can have an opportunity to manage the program, to raise \ntaxes, and to find a way to pay for that sort of proposal. If we \nSenators were to increase Medicaid in that way, and go home, we would \nfind first that Medicaid is a terrible base upon which to build an \nimproved health care system, because it is filled with lawsuits. It is \nfilled with Federal court consent decrees that sometimes are 20 and 25 \nyears old and take away from the Governor's and the legislature's \nauthority to make decisions. It is filled with inefficiency. It is \nfilled with delays. Governors request waivers to run their systems, and \nit may take a year or more for approval from the Federal Government for \nrelatively simple requests. And finally, it is filled with an \nintolerable waste of taxpayer money because of fraud that is documented \nby the Government Accountability Office. As much as 10 percent of the \nentire program--$32 billion a year--according to the Government \nAccountability Office is lost to fraud. That is the Medicaid Program.\n  The second thing a Senator who goes home to serve as Governor for 8 \nyears would find is that increasing coverage in this way will require \nmuch higher State taxes at a time when most every State is making a \nmassive cut in services, and a few States are nearly bankrupt. For \nexample, in my State of Tennessee, if the Kennedy bill were to pass, \nwhich would increase Medicaid expansion by 150 percent and increase \nreimbursement rates to 110 percent of Medicare, it would require, based \non our estimates, a new State income tax of about 10 percent to pay for \nthe increased costs just for our State, as well as perhaps adding \nanother half a trillion dollars or so to the Federal debt.\n  Finally, if we were to base new coverage for the 58 million people \nnow in Medicaid, and others who need insurance, upon this government-\nrun Medicaid Program these Americans--who are the people we are talking \nabout in this debate and who are the ones we hope will have more of the \nsame kind of health care the rest of us have--we would find that a \nlarge number of them would have a hard time finding a doctor. Today 40 \npercent of doctors already refuse to provide full service to Medicaid \npatients because of the low reimbursement rates, and if we simply add \nmore to that Medicaid Program, these people will have an even harder \ntime getting served.\n  There is a better idea. Instead of expanding a failing government \nhealth care program which traps 58 million of our poorest citizens in \nthat government-run program that provides substandard care, the better \nway to extend medical care to those low-income Americans now served by \nMedicaid is to give them government tax credits, or government \nsubsidies, or vouchers, or money in their pockets they can use to \npurchase private health insurance of their choice. That sort of option \nfor health care reform is before the Senate, if it could only be \nconsidered. It has been offered on one end by Senator Coburn and \nSenator Burr. It has been offered at the same time by Senator Gregg of \nNew Hampshire. It has been offered in a bipartisan way by Senator Wyden \nand Senator Bennett who have offered a proposal that would basically \ngive these dollars to the people who need help, let them buy their \ninsurance, and according to the same Congressional Budget Office that \nsaid the Kennedy proposal costs at least 1 trillion more dollars, the \nCBO has said that Bennett-Wyden would cost zero more.\n  I ask that I am informed when I have 1 minute left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, during the last 6 months, the four \nwords we have heard most in Washington are ``more debt'' and \n``Washington takeover,'' and all four words apply to the health care \ndebate. We have seen a Washington takeover of banks, of insurance \ncompanies, of student loans, of car companies, and now, perhaps, of \nhealth care. The President insists on a government-run insurance option \nas part of a health care reform plan which would inevitably lead to a \nWashington-run health plan.\n  Why would it do that? Well, putting a government-run and subsidized \nplan in competition with our private health insurance plans would be \nlike putting an elephant in a room with some mice and saying: OK, guys \nand gals, compete. I think we know what would happen. The elephant \nwould win the competition and the elephant would be your only remaining \nchoice.\n  As for more debt, the Congressional Budget Office, in a letter sent \nto Senator Kennedy, estimated that his bill, which is the only \nlegislation the Senate Health Committee is considering, would add \nanother $1 trillion during the next 10 years in order to cover 16 \nmillion uninsured Americans, leaving 30 million uninsured. That is \nanother $1 trillion over the next 10 years that, according to \nyesterday's Washington Post, already is nearly three times as much as \nwas spent in all of World War II. The Post said the proposed new debt \nover the next 10 years, before we get to the health care bill, is three \ntimes as much as we spent in World War II. The Congressional Budget \nOffice estimate didn't even consider the cost of the Kennedy bill's \nproposals to expand Medicaid coverage.\n  So let's talk about Medicaid. Every State offers it. It provides \nhealth care in a variety of ways to low-income Americans who are not \neligible for Medicare. The Federal Government pays about 60 percent of \nthe costs and writes most of the rules; the States pay the rest. Fifty-\neight million low-income Americans are trapped in Medicaid. It is the \nonly place of any significant size where we don't have competition in \nour health care system. Think of the elephant in the room.\n  It was my experience as Governor--I believe it is for most \nGovernors--that it is not only an administrative mess with substandard \ncare, the Medicaid Program, but its costs have spiraled out of control, \nthreatening the viability of public universities and community colleges \nbecause there is no money left for the States to support them.\n  Here is what would happen in Tennessee if the Kennedy bill passed, \naccording to the State of Tennessee's Medicaid director. Our State \ncosts would go up $572 million if we increased coverage to 150 percent \nof Federal poverty. If the Fed pays for this, the Fed's cost would be \n$1.6 billion--I mean the Federal budget paying for all of it, because \nnormally the Federal budget pays two-thirds, the State one-third. If \nthe State has to also provide Medicaid payments to physicians at 110 \npercent of Medicare, this would add another $600 million in costs to \nthe State of Tennessee. Thus, the proposal of the combination of the \nHealth and the Finance Committees' bills that are being considered \nwould be 1.2 billion new dollars for Tennessee. If you add the Federal \nGovernment's increase in costs\n\n[[Page S6622]]\n\njust for the Tennessee program to which the Tennessee program was \nexpanded, it would be $3.3 billion.\n\n  So you can see why the Kennedy bill has been called so expensive. \nThat is not all. The Finance Committee has been discussing turning back \nto the States by 2015 these increased costs, although the Finance \nCommittee is talking about a smaller expansion of coverage. So imagine \na Senator going home to the State of Tennessee--it won't be me, because \nI have already had the privilege of being Governor--but say if one went \nback to be Governor of Tennessee, what would one find if we passed the \nKennedy bill as it is now proposed? We would find a bill by 2015 of 1.2 \nbillion in today's dollars, and where would the Governor get the money? \nWell, when one Governor proposed a 4-percent State income tax in \nTennessee in 2004, a 4-percent income tax would bring in 400 million \nnew dollars. We need $1.2 billion under the Kennedy bill to pay for the \nexpansion of Medicaid. So to raise nearly $1.2 billion, a new State \nincome tax of more than 10 percent would be needed, if all other \nservices were held flat, and the Governor has already said that most \nState functions will see a decrease in funding after the stimulus money \ngoes away.\n  This same problem would be true for all States. The National \nGovernors Association says if we assume that all individuals under 150 \npercent of poverty are covered and there is no change in reimbursement \nrates, the cost to the States would be $360 billion more over the next \n10 years. If you also increase the reimbursement rate for physicians \nfrom say 72 percent to 83 percent, the Governors Association says the \nnew cost is $500 billion more over 10 years.\n  Then there is the fraud in the Medicaid Program. The Government \nAccountability Office says 10 percent of it is fraud--$32 billion a \nyear--about three-fourths of the amount we spend on prescription drugs \nfor all seniors. Then there is the problem of access of care, with 40 \npercent of doctors already not being willing to provide full service to \npatients who are on Medicaid. So why would we expand this government-\nrun program when it is filled with inefficiencies, delay, and waste, \nwhen it would bankrupt States, when it would add hundreds of billions \nof dollars to the Federal debt, and when it would provide substandard \nservice when, instead, we could pass the Coburn-Burr bill, or the Gregg \nbill, or the Wyden-Bennett bill and give to the 58 million low-income \nAmericans who are trapped in a failing government program the dollars \nthey need to purchase private health insurance much like the rest of us \nhave?\n  I hope I can find a way to offer an amendment that would require any \nSenator who votes for a 150-percent increase in Medicaid, who says that \nMedicaid expansion will go to 150 percent of the Federal poverty level, \nwill be sentenced to go home and serve for 8 years as Governor of his \nor her State so they can find out what it is like to manage such a \nprogram or to raise taxes to pay for it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record following my \nremarks the letter from Douglas Elmendorf of the Congressional Budget \nOffice to Senator Kennedy of June 15 stating that his bill would add $1 \ntrillion more over the next 10 years to the debt, and that doesn't even \ninclude the Medicaid expansions I have talked about.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that an article from the Wall Street \nJournal of yesterday talking about State budget gaps, which shows what \ndire straits many States are in be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 15, 2009.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n         Pensions, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \n     and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) have \n     completed a preliminary analysis of the major provisions \n     related to health insurance coverage that are contained in \n     title I of draft legislation called the Affordable Health \n     Choices Act, which was released by the Senate Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) on June 9, \n     2009. Among other things, that draft legislation would \n     establish insurance exchanges (called ``gateways'') through \n     which individuals and families could purchase coverage and \n     would provide federal subsidies to substantially reduce the \n     cost of that coverage for some enrollees.\n       The attached table summarizes our preliminary assessment of \n     the proposal's budgetary effects and its likely impact on \n     insurance coverage. According to that assessment, enacting \n     the proposal would result in a net increase in federal budget \n     deficits of about $1.0 trillion over the 2010-2019 period. \n     Once the proposal was fully implemented, about 39 million \n     individuals would obtain coverage through the new insurance \n     exchanges. At the same time, the number of people who had \n     coverage through an employer would decline by about 15 \n     million (or roughly 10 percent), and coverage from other \n     sources would fall by about 8 million, so the net decrease in \n     the number of people uninsured would be about 16 million.\n       It is important to note, however, that those figures do not \n     represent a formal or complete cost estimate for the draft \n     legislation, for reasons outlined below. Moreover, because \n     expanded eligibility for the Medicaid program may be added at \n     a later date, those figures are not likely to represent the \n     impact that more comprehensive proposals--which might include \n     a significant expansion of Medicaid or other options for \n     subsidizing coverage for those with income below 150 percent \n     of the federal poverty level--would have both on the federal \n     budget and on the extent of insurance coverage.\n\n\n          Key Provisions Related to Health Insurance Coverage\n\n       Subtitles A through D of title I of the Affordable Health \n     Choices Act would seek to increase the number of legal U.S. \n     residents who have health insurance. Toward that end, the \n     federal government would provide grants to states to \n     establish insurance exchanges and--more importantly--would \n     subsidize the purchase of health insurance through those \n     exchanges for individuals and families with income between \n     150 percent and 500 percent of the federal poverty level; \n     those subsidies would represent the greatest single component \n     of the proposal's cost. The proposal would also impose a \n     financial cost on most people who do not obtain insurance, \n     the size of which would be set by the Secretary of the \n     Treasury.\n       The draft legislation released by the HELP Committee also \n     indicates that certain features may be added at a later date. \n     Because they are not reflected in the current draft, however, \n     CBO and the JCT staff did not take them into account. In \n     particular, the draft legislation does not contain provisions \n     that would change the Medicaid program, although it envisions \n     that the authority to extend Medicaid coverage will be added \n     during Senate consideration of the bill. (By itself, adding \n     such provisions would increase the proposal's budgetary costs \n     and would also yield a larger increase in the number of \n     people who have health insurance.) The draft legislation also \n     indicates that the committee is considering whether to \n     incorporate other features, including a ``public health \n     insurance option'' and requirements for ``shared \n     responsibility'' by employers. Depending on their details, \n     such provisions could also have substantial effects on our \n     analysis. (A summary of the key provisions that were included \n     in this analysis is attached.)\n\n\n         Important Caveats Regarding This Preliminary Analysis\n\n       There are several reasons why the preliminary analysis that \n     is provided in this letter and its attachments does not \n     constitute a comprehensive cost estimate for the Affordable \n     Health Choices Act:\n       First, this analysis focuses exclusively on the major \n     provisions on health insurance coverage contained in certain \n     subtitles of title I of the draft legislation. Although other \n     provisions in title I, along with provisions in the other \n     five titles of the legislation, would have significant \n     budgetary effects, the analysis contained in this letter and \n     its attachment is limited to the provisions in subtitles A \n     through D regarding health insurance coverage.\n       Second, CBO and the JCT staff have not yet completed \n     modeling all of the proposed changes related to insurance \n     coverage. For example, the proposal would allow parents to \n     cover children as dependents until they are 27 years old, and \n     our analysis has not yet taken that provision into account. \n     (Other instances are listed in the attachment.) Although this \n     analysis reflects the proposal's major provisions, taking all \n     of its provisions into account could change our assessment of \n     the proposal's effects on the budget and insurance coverage \n     rates--though probably not by substantial amounts relative to \n     the net costs already identified. As our understanding of the \n     provisions we have analyzed improves, that could also affect \n     our future estimates.\n       Third, the analysis of the proposal's effects on the \n     federal budget and insurance coverage reflects CBO's and the \n     JCT staff's understanding of its key features and discussions \n     with committee staff--but does not represent a full \n     assessment of the legislative language that was released by \n     the committee. Although our reading of the draft language has \n     informed our analysis, we have not had time to complete a \n     thorough review of that language, which could have \n     significant effects on any subsequent analysis provided by \n     CBO and the JCT staff.\n       In particular, the draft legislation includes a section on \n     ``individual responsibility'' that would generally impose a \n     financial cost on\n\n[[Page S6623]]\n\n     people who do not obtain insurance--but is silent about \n     whether people are required to have such coverage. On the \n     basis of our discussions with the committee staff, we \n     understand that it was the committee's intent to impose a \n     clear requirement for individuals to have health insurance, \n     and this analysis reflects that intent. However, the current \n     draft is not clear on this point, and if the language remains \n     ambiguous, that would affect our estimate of its impact on \n     federal costs and insurance coverage.\n       Fourth, some effects of the insurance proposals that we \n     have modeled have not yet been fully captured. For example, \n     we have not yet estimated the administrative costs to the \n     federal government of implementing the proposal or the costs \n     of establishing and operating the insurance exchanges, nor \n     have we taken into account the proposal's effects on spending \n     for other federal programs. Those effects could be noticeable \n     but would not affect the main conclusions of this analysis.\n       Fifth, the budgetary information shown in the attached \n     table reflects many of the major cash flows that would affect \n     the federal budget as a result of the proposal and provides \n     our preliminary assessment of its net effects on the federal \n     budget deficit. Some cash flows would appear in the budget \n     but would net to zero and not affect the deficit; CBO has not \n     yet estimated all of those cash flows.\n\n\n                     Likely Effects of the Proposal\n\n       The proposal would have significant effects on the number \n     of people who are enrolled in health insurance plans, the \n     sources of that coverage, and the federal budget.\n       Effects on Insurance Coverage. Under current law, the \n     number of nonelderly residents (those under age 65) with \n     health insurance coverage will grow from about 217 million in \n     2010 to about 228 million in 2019, according to CBO's \n     estimates. Over that same period, the number of nonelderly \n     residents without health insurance at any given point in time \n     will grow from approximately 50 million people to about 54 \n     million people--constituting about 19 percent of the \n     nonelderly population. Because the Medicare program covers \n     nearly all legal residents over the age of 65, our analysis \n     has focused on the effects of proposals on the nonelderly \n     population.\n       People obtain insurance coverage from a variety of sources. \n     Under current law, about 150 million nonelderly people will \n     get their coverage through an employer in 2010, CBO \n     estimates. Similarly, another 40 million people will be \n     covered through the federal/state Medicaid program or the \n     Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Other nonelderly \n     people are covered by policies purchased individually in the \n     ``nongroup'' market, or they obtain coverage from various \n     other sources (including Medicare and the health benefit \n     programs of the Department of Defense).\n       According to the preliminary analysis, once the proposal \n     was fully implemented, the number of people who are uninsured \n     would decline to about 36 million or 37 million, representing \n     about 13 percent of the nonelderly population. (Roughly a \n     third of those would be unauthorized immigrants or \n     individuals who are eligible for Medicaid but not enrolled in \n     that program.) That decline would be the net effect of \n     several broad changes, which can be illustrated by examining \n     the effects in a specific year. In 2017, for example, the \n     number of uninsured would fall by about 16 million, relative \n     to current-law projections. In that year, about 39 million \n     people would be covered by policies purchased through the new \n     insurance exchange. At the same time, about 147 million \n     people would be covered by an employment-based health \n     plan, 15 million fewer than under current law. Smaller net \n     declines (totaling about 8 million) would occur in \n     coverage under Medicaid and CHIP and in nongroup coverage \n     because of the subsidies offered in the exchanges.\n       Budgetary Impact of Insurance Coverage Provisions. On a \n     preliminary basis, CBO and the JCT staff estimate that the \n     major provisions in title I of the Affordable Health Choices \n     Act affecting health insurance coverage would result in a net \n     increase in federal deficits of about $1.0 trillion for \n     fiscal years 2010 through 2019. That estimate primarily \n     reflects the subsidies that would be provided to purchase \n     coverage through the new insurance exchanges, which would \n     amount to nearly $1.3 trillion in that period. The average \n     subsidy per exchange enrollee (including those who would \n     receive no subsidy) would rise from roughly $5,000 in 2015 to \n     roughly $6,000 in 2019. The other element of the proposal \n     that would increase the federal deficit is a credit for small \n     employers who offer health insurance, which is estimated to \n     cost $60 billion over 10 years. Because a given firm would be \n     allowed take the credit for only three consecutive years, the \n     pattern of outlays would vary from year to year.\n       Those costs would be partly offset by receipts or savings \n     from three sources: increases in tax revenues stemming from \n     the decline in employment-based coverage; payments of \n     penalties by uninsured individuals; and reductions in outlays \n     for Medicaid and CHIP (relative to current-law projections).\n       The proposal would not change the tax treatment of health \n     insurance premiums. Nevertheless, the reduction in the number \n     of people receiving employment-based health insurance \n     coverage, relative to current-law projections, would affect \n     the government's tax revenues. Because total compensation \n     costs are determined by market forces, CBO and the JCT staff \n     estimate that wages and other forms of compensation would \n     rise by roughly the amounts of any reductions in employers' \n     health insurance costs. Employers' payments for health \n     insurance are tax-preferred, but most of those offsetting \n     changes in compensation would come in the form of taxable \n     wages and salaries. As a result, the shift in compensation \n     brought about by the proposal would cause tax revenues to \n     rise by $257 billion over 10 years. (Those figures are \n     generally shown as negative numbers in the attached table \n     because increases in revenues reduce the federal budget \n     deficit.)\n       The government would also collect the payments that \n     uninsured individuals would have to make. CBO and the JCT \n     staff assume that the annual amount, which would be set by \n     the Treasury Secretary, would be relatively small (about $100 \n     per person). Moreover, individuals with income below 150 \n     percent of the federal poverty level would not have to pay \n     that amount. As a result, collections of those payments would \n     total $2 billion over 10 years.\n       Finally, although the proposal would not change federal \n     laws regarding Medicaid and CHIP, it would affect outlays for \n     those programs. CBO assumes that states that had expanded \n     eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP to people with income above \n     150 percent of the federal poverty level would be inclined to \n     reverse those policies, because those individuals could \n     instead obtain subsidies through the insurance exchanges that \n     would be financed entirely by the federal government. \n     Reflecting those reductions in enrollment, federal outlays \n     for Medicaid and CHIP would decline by $38 billion over 10 \n     years.\n       I hope this preliminary analysis is helpful for the \n     committee's consideration of the Affordable Health Choices \n     Act.

In general, the government would collect a \n     payment from uninsured people, but individuals with income \n     below 150 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) would be \n     exempt and the payment would be waived in certain other \n     cases. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the staff of \n     the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) assumed that the annual \n     payment amount, which would be set administratively, would be \n     relatively small (about $100 per person).\n       New health insurance policies sold in the individual and \n     group insurance markets would be subject to several \n     requirements regarding their availability and pricing. \n     Insurers would be required to issue coverage to all \n     applicants, and could not limit coverage for preexisting \n     medical conditions. In addition, premiums for a given plan \n     could not vary because of enrollees' health and could vary by \n     their age to only a limited degree (under a system known as \n     adjusted community rating). Existing policies that are \n     maintained continuously would be ``grandfathered.''\n       There would be no change from current law regarding \n     Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).\n       Insurance policies covering required benefits that are sold \n     through the exchanges would have actuarial values chosen by \n     the Secretary of Health and Human Services from specified \n     ranges within three tiers. (A plan's actuarial value reflects \n     the share of costs for covered services that is paid by the \n     plan.) CBO and the JCT staff assumed that the chosen \n     actuarial values would be 95 percent (for the highest tier), \n     85 percent (for the middle tier), and 76 percent (for the \n     lowest tier). Plans would be allowed to offer added coverage \n     or benefits for an extra premium.\n       The subsidies available through the exchanges would be tied \n     to the average of the three lowest premium bids submitted by \n     insurers in each area of the country for each tier of \n     coverage. For people with income between 150 percent and 200 \n     percent of the FPL, the subsidies would apply to that average \n     bid for the highest-tier plans; for people with income \n     between 200 percent and 300 percent of the FPL, the subsidies \n     would apply to that average bid for the middle-tier plans; \n     and for people with income between 300 percent and 500 \n     percent of the FPL, the subsidies would apply to that average \n     bid for the lowest-tier plans.\n       The subsidies would cap premiums as a share of income on a \n     sliding scale starting at 1 percent for those with income \n     equal to 150 percent of the FPL, rising to 10 percent of \n     income at 500 percent of the FPL. Those income caps would be \n     indexed to medical price inflation, so that individuals would \n     (on average) pay a higher portion of their income for \n     exchange premiums over time. Individuals\n\n[[Page S6624]]\n\n     and families with income below 150 percent of the FPL would \n     not be eligible for those subsidies. (The proposal envisions \n     that Medicaid would be expanded to cover those individuals \n     and families but the draft legislation does not include \n     provisions to accomplish that goal.)\n       Subsidies would be delivered by the Department of Health \n     and Human Services via the insurance exchanges with some \n     provisions for income verification. Subsidy amounts would be \n     determined using a measure of income for a previous tax year, \n     implying that subsidies received for a given year (for \n     example, in 2013) would be based on income received two years \n     prior (for example, in 2011). Individuals might be eligible \n     for larger subsidies if their income declined significantly \n     in the intervening period or if other extenuating \n     circumstances arose. (The draft legislation's provisions \n     regarding verification of income are unclear, which is \n     reflected in the analysis.)\n       The proposal does not include a ``public plan'' that would \n     be offered in the exchanges, nor does it contain provisions \n     that would require employers to offer health insurance \n     benefits or impose a fee or tax on them if they did not offer \n     insurance coverage to their workers.\n       In general, individuals with an offer of employer-sponsored \n     insurance would not be eligible for exchange subsidies under \n     the proposal. However, employees with an offer from an \n     employer that was deemed unaffordable could get those \n     subsidies; because the exchange subsidies would limit the \n     share of income that enrollees would have to pay (as \n     described above), CBO and the JCT staff assumed that an \n     ``unaffordable'' offer from an employer would be one that \n     required the employee to pay a larger share of income for \n     that plan than he or she would have to pay for coverage in an \n     exchange.\n\n[[Page S6625]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS16JN09.002\n     \n\n\n[[Page S6626]]\n\n       The proposal would offer subsidies to small employers whose \n     workers have low average wages and who offer health benefits \n     to those workers. The amount of the subsidy would vary with \n     the size of the firm (up to a limit of 50 workers), and firms \n     that contribute larger amounts toward their workers' health \n     insurance would receive larger subsidies. The credit would be \n     available indefinitely, but firms would be eligible to take \n     the credit for only three consecutive years at a time.\n\n\n               Key Provisions Not Yet Taken Into Account\n\n       There are several features of the proposal that CBO and the \n     JCT staff have not yet reflected in their budget estimates. \n     The most significant features of the proposal that have not \n     yet been estimated would do the following:\n       Require insurers to offer dependent coverage for children \n     of policyholders who are less than 27 years of age.\n       Delegate authority to a Medical Advisory Council to \n     establish minimum requirements for covered health benefits \n     and to determine the level of coverage that individuals would \n     need to obtain in order to qualify as having insurance.\n       Require insurers to maintain a minimum level of medical \n     claims paid relative to premium revenues (otherwise known as \n     a ``medical loss ratio''), or to repay certain amounts to \n     policyholders; the HHS Secretary would have the authority to \n     set the minimum medical loss ratio.\n       Apply ``risk adjustment'' (a process that involves shifting \n     payments from plans with low-risk enrollees to plans with \n     high-risk enrollees) to all health insurance policies sold in \n     the individual and group insurance markets.\n       Allow employers to buy health coverage through the \n     exchanges.\n       Require health insurance plans participating in the new \n     exchanges to adopt measures that are intended to simplify \n     financial and administrative transactions in the health \n     sector (such as claims processing).\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 15, 2009]\n\n          States' Budget Gaps Are Another Test for Washington\n\n                         (By Jonathan Weisman)\n\n       As the White House eagerly scans the economic landscape for \n     signs of recovery, a looming drought in the form of state \n     budget deficits could make any ``green shoots'' wilt.\n       States face a cumulative shortfall of $230 billion from \n     this year through 2011, and there is little sign in bailout-\n     weary Washington of any attempt to create yet another aid \n     program to solve that problem. But if the federal government \n     did want to hold that drought at bay, it has options: passing \n     another stimulus plan; assisting states in the bond market; \n     assuming a greater share of Medicaid payments. If the \n     recovery stalls a few months from now, those may suddenly \n     become central to the rescue efforts.\n       While discouraging talk right now of any federal response \n     to state budget woes, the Obama administration is anxiously \n     eyeing state efforts to close persistent budget gaps. So far, \n     42 U.S. states have slashed enacted budgets to cope with \n     rising demand for services and plunging revenue, according to \n     the National Governors Association. About half have also \n     raised taxes.\n       Those policies run counter to Washington's efforts to prime \n     the economic pump, with a $787 billion stimulus plan, plus \n     hundreds of billions of dollars more in new lending, mortgage \n     relief and other efforts. About $246 billion of the stimulus \n     funds are already going to the states, to offset rising \n     Medicaid costs, stave off education cuts and help with \n     infrastructure problems. Friday, the Treasury made $25 \n     billion in bond authority available for state and local \n     governments under the Recovery Zone Bonds program, a little-\n     known piece of the massive stimulus law.\n       But all that money will start drifting away next year, when \n     the administration hopes a recovery will be taking hold. And \n     that is exactly when states anticipate their fiscal problems \n     could be even worse. 'The states have so few options to \n     respond,'' said Nick Johnson, director of the state fiscal \n     project at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a \n     liberal think tank. ``Drawing down reserve funds, various \n     accounting gimmicks--those options are either gone or won't \n     do enough. The remaining options threaten to slow the \n     recovery.''\n       If Washington were inclined to help, the easiest approach \n     would be a second stimulus bill pouring more money directly \n     into state coffers. But with a federal budget deficit \n     approaching $2 trillion, there is little chance of that.\n       So creativity is in order.\n       House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank \n     has been searching for low-cost ways to step in. His staff \n     has looked into a raft of measures to loosen state borrowing \n     and lower the interest rates state governments must offer on \n     their bonds. The Massachusetts Democrat would like to create \n     a reinsurance fund, financed through premiums paid by bond \n     sellers, which would offer bond purchasers additional \n     assurance that their money is safe.\n       Legislation also could mandate that ratings companies such \n     as Standard & Poor's would have to use the same criteria to \n     rate state bonds as are used to rate corporate bonds--a \n     requirement that doesn't exist now, sometimes to the \n     disadvantage of states. 'Where there's the full faith in \n     credit behind these municipal bonds, where the full taxing \n     power of a state or city is behind them, they never \n     default,'' Mr. Frank said, yet the bonds are ``treated as if \n     they're risky.''\n       In the short run, the Treasury or Federal Reserve could use \n     existing programs established to prop up consumer borrowing \n     to underwrite state bond offerings, he said. That would bring \n     more lenders into the state bond market and lower interest \n     costs for cash-strapped states.\n       President Barack Obama suggested in a recent C-SPAN \n     interview that some kind of clever bond-market moves may be \n     in the works. ``We are talking to state treasurers across the \n     country, including California, to figure out are there some \n     creative ways that we can just help them get through some of \n     these difficult times,'' he said.\n       But crafting the right balance would be tough.\n       Treasury officials have told California state legislators \n     that the U.S. is monitoring the situation but isn't keen to \n     provide assistance, according to people familiar with the \n     matter ``It's hard to help just one state,'' says a \n     government official. On the other hand, there is worry about \n     setting up a broad short-term assistance program that some \n     fret could turn into a permanent federal subsidy.\n       The move to bail out California--or any other state--is \n     made harder by the current political climate, particularly \n     opposition from home-state Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n       Rep. John Campbell, one of four California Republicans on \n     Mr. Frank's committee, said a federal intervention would only \n     halt state efforts to come to terms with budgets and could \n     create incentives to spend even more. ``The states are kind \n     of on their own because the bullets are out of the federal \n     gun,'' he said, ``not because they couldn't print some more \n     money but because I hope there's a recognition that printing \n     and borrowing more money is going to have extremely negative \n     consequences.''\n       In response, Mr. Frank shrugs: ``How am I going to get \n     representatives from Pennsylvania and New York to send money \n     to California if Republicans from California are fighting \n     it?''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I decided to come to the floor to talk \nabout a couple of things. One is health care reform and the other is \nthe stimulus package.\n  We are seeing attacks from the party of no, the Republican Party, \nevery day on this floor, and I believe the purpose is to derail health \ncare reform. I think it is perfectly legitimate to debate how we do it, \nbut I think when everything is stripped away, you are going to see the \nRepublicans as the party of the status quo.\n  In relation to health care reform, the status quo has to go, because \nit is hurting our people. I will put a couple of facts out there that \nare irrefutable; they are just facts. The fact is, if we don't act, \nsoaring health care costs are unsustainable for our families. In this \ngreat Nation, we pay twice as much as any other nation for our health \ncare. The fact is we must turn this around. As the wording is now, we \nmust ``bend that cost curve,'' because we cannot sustain the situation \nas it is. It is hurting our families. Premium rises are unbelievable. \nWe all know it in our own circumstances. And we know the uninsured keep \ngrowing. Why? Because they cannot afford the premiums or maybe \ncompanies won't take them because they may have had high blood pressure \nor something, and they don't get the coverage they need. So they don't \navail themselves of prevention.\n  We have too much obesity in this country among our kids and adults. \nWe know that prevention in and of itself could bend that cost curve. If \nsomeone understands nutrition and diet, and they get help in making \nsure they change their lifestyle or that their kids don't eat sugar and \nfattening foods all the time, it has an enormous impact on what happens \nto them when they get older. Diabetes is a major problem. We can turn \nthat around, along with the heart risks that go with it later on, and \nthe stroke risks that go with high blood pressure. These things can be \ncontrolled.\n  We took a first step in prevention when we passed the bill on smoking\n\n[[Page S6627]]\n\nwhich, for the first time, will give the FDA the ability to regulate \ncigarettes and keep these products away from our kids, who are lured \ninto smoking. You know how it is, because I am sure everybody knows \nsomeone who has this addiction, how very difficult it is--those folks \nwho want to quit have such a hard time. Clearly, if we have prevention \nas the name of the game, we are going to see a decrease in costs, we \nare going to see healthier families, and we should see lower premiums.\n  The question is: If we do nothing, can we sustain what happened? If \nwe do so, it ought to stress prevention and also make sure that the \ninsurance companies are kept honest. How do you do that? It seems to me \nyou want to make sure we have some kind of plan out there that has to \nlive by the same rules as the private sector, be it a cooperative, a \npublic plan, but it should live by the same rules so we can test and \njudge whether our people are getting ripped off when they get these \nhuge increases in their premiums. We also need a plan that covers the \nuninsured, however we deal with it, because there is no question about \nit that when people are uninsured, they are still going to get the \nhealth care they need. No doctor is going to turn them away when they \nshow up in the emergency room with a stroke or heart condition that \nprobably has not been looked at for a long time. The signs of a stroke \nyou can find through blood pressure taking. If they haven't done that, \nwhen they show up there, who pays for it? The fact is, those costs come \nright back home to us. Somebody has to pay for it. That is reflected in \nthe premium.\n  So here is the point. I don't think it is that complicated. If you \nstress prevention, and if you have a plan out there--a nonprofit plan--\nthat can keep the insurance companies honest and make sure they are not \novercharging us, and if you cover the uninsured, I think those are the \nprinciples I am looking for. I don't think it is that complicated. But \nwe hear our colleagues on the Republican side come out to the floor day \nin and day out bashing public plans.\n  Let the Republicans introduce a bill to repeal Medicare. That is a \npublic plan. Our seniors love it. The Republicans fought it in the \n1960s. The Democrats passed it under Lyndon Johnson. Why don't they \ncome here and say they want to repeal Medicare?\n  Another public plan is veterans' health care. It is a government \nplan. Why don't they come here and put forward a proposal to completely \ndo away with veterans' health care? I will tell you, the veterans in \nthis country will rise up--the Republican veterans, the Democratic \nveterans, the Independent veterans, the old and young veterans. Why \ndon't they do that, instead of coming here and saying public plans are \nbad?\n  How about SCHIP, the public plan that allows our children to be \ncovered, our poor kids? Why don't they come here and say our children \nshould not be covered and let's repeal it?\n  How about our military? They get free health care through the public \ndomain. Should we now cancel that and contract it out?\n  Look, I am for a robust debate. I am for a bipartisan bill. I want to \nwork toward that. But let me tell you this: If we don't get 60 votes \nfor something, we cannot quit around here. We cannot allow a terrible \ncrisis toward the end of life bankrupt our families. More than half of \nour families who file bankruptcy do it because of a crisis in their \nhealth. We cannot afford that. The fact is that we are on the verge of \nbeing able to do something but not if the party of no comes here every \nday and bashes every idea and starts frightening the American people. \nThey will have their chance, but I hope we won't stop. We will have to \nfigure out a way to do it with a majority vote. That is my feeling. \nThis is too important an issue. Our families cannot take it. They \ncannot take a circumstance where they are now already paying a third of \ntheir money for their mortgage. Are they going to pay another third, or \nhalf, for health care? What is left over to live a life and support \ntheir kids?\n  Come on, get over it, party of no. Come to the table and work with \nus. Don't bash every idea President Obama lays down on the table. He is \nthe President. Give him a chance to move this forward.\n\n\n                          The Stimulus Program\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, speaking of bashing things, my last \ncommentary until we vote is this:\n  Senator Coburn has put out a report in which he bashes the stimulus \nprogram. I think it is very important for the American people to \nunderstand a few things. One, a couple of his examples are right on \ntarget, and we always expect there will be a couple of things that \nwould happen that were wrong. The administration is aware of that. We \ntried to get on top of it and stop it. But we lost over a trillion \ndollars from our economy and we put in this stimulus package--about \n$787 billion--so we can make sure that this great recession doesn't \nturn into a great depression. That is why we have I think 30 inspectors \ngeneral overseeing this program.\n  Despite that, I understand Senator Coburn. He was never for the \nstimulus. He said let the American people work their way through it, \nthat government should stay out. That is fair. Now he is bashing the \nstimulus program. All of the work he has done thus far has identified \n.7 percent--not even 1 percent--that was a problem. Some of those are \nway off base. I want to talk about some of them in California that he \nhas highlighted and has bashed:\n  First, $200,000 to place restrooms at a Black Butte Lake, California \npark. Excuse me. Maybe there is something wrong with me, but I think \nhaving a clean restroom in a State park that is safe and available is \nquite important. But he says that is ridiculous. It creates jobs to \nbuild that, and it is an important hygienic issue that I think needs to \nbe addressed.\n  He talked also about a State park. This is near and dear to my heart. \nIt is $620,000 to build a State park for our children in Long Beach, \nCA. I don't know about Mr. Coburn in Oklahoma--they have fewer people \nthere, true. I have a State of 37 million people. We have a lot of \nkids. We have a lot of kids who get in trouble after school and who \ndrop out of school. We have a problem. They love to skateboard. As a \nmatter of fact, we had a former gang in Oakland come forward and \nactually construct it themselves. Building a State park for our kids is \nnot a boondoggle. It is a safe place for them to go, and you create \njobs when you do it.\n  We are installing energy efficient runway guidance lights at the San \nDiego Airport. Yes, energy efficient lighting saves money. As a matter \nof fact, this thing has a payback. It cost $5 million. It has a payback \nof 2 to 5 years. When you put in efficient lighting, there is a \npayback. It uses less electricity and it lowers the cost. But, no, \nSenator Coburn bashes that. Those are some examples of what he is \nbashing just in my State.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a document \nentitled ``Funding Notification By Program'' for my State of \nCalifornia.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Funding Notifications by Program\n\n       The table below presents breakdown of total dollars \n     allocated to a state by program.

If you go through this, you will see in the largest State \nof the Union, which is suffering with an 11.2 percent unemployment \nrate, projects that are putting people to work today and doing good \nthings. There is a medical assistance program; a clean water State \nrevolving fund grant; a State energy program, which is putting people \nto work; weatherization assistance for low income; working with the \nyouth; and it goes on and on. There are safe drinking water grants, a \nlaw enforcement grant, educational technology grant, adoption \nassistance grant, and a foster care grant.\n  Why is my colleague not coming down here and saying he did find less \nthan 1 percent of a problem, but these other things are good, and these \nother things are putting people to work and they are saving our \nchildren, saving our environment, and saving energy?\n  It is the party of no. No, no, no, a thousand times no. The American \npeople understand that we on this side of the aisle, and our President, \nin reaching across the aisle, are going to continue to work for change. \nChange means getting out of this mess we are in right now--this deep \nrecession. We are going to continue to do it. They are going to say no, \nno, a thousand times no. We will work with them when they want to work \nwith us. If they don't, we have to figure out a way to bring the change \nand jobs to America, the energy efficiency to America, and all that is \ngood that the American people deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/16/senate-section/article/S6628-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, during these tough economic times, \nAmerican families expect and deserve that we will do everything we can \nto get the economy moving again. Of course, that involves investing in \nour country, investing in our infrastructure. It involves getting our \nfinancial system in order. It involves getting credit moving again. But \nwe should not forget that one out of eight Americans is employed in the \ntravel industry.\n  I chair the subcommittee of Commerce, that deals with tourism issues, \nand I cosponsored the bipartisan legislation to bring new visitors and \nnew spending and new jobs to the United States. I thank Senator Byron \nDorgan for his leadership and hard work on this bill, and I also thank \nSenator Ensign for his leadership.\n  I spoke last week, when we first started talking about this bill, \nabout the importance of the tourism and travel industry to our economy. \nTourism creates good jobs that cannot be outsourced. It increases sales \nfor local businesses, and it brings in tax revenue for local and State \neconomies.\n  As I said, one out of every eight Americans is employed by our travel \neconomy. Each year, travel and tourism contribute approximately $1.3 \ntrillion to the American economy. The travel economy contributes $115 \nbillion in tax revenues to State, local, and Federal Governments, and \nlast year travel and tourism exports--which means the people coming \ninto the U.S. to enjoy our beautiful country--accounted for 8 percent \nof all U.S. exports. In fact, tourism is one of the few economic \nsectors where we enjoy a substantial trade surplus.\n  But things are not going as well as they could or they should, \nespecially when it comes to bringing international travel to the United \nStates. I know you know that, Madam President, coming from the State of \nNew York. I see the Senator from Michigan. I have seen their recent ad \ncampaign on ``Enjoying Pure Michigan.'' But we need to bring more \npeople to this country.\n  What does this mean? What is the problem? As you can see, while more \npeople around the world are traveling--there were 48 million more \nglobal overseas travelers in 2008 than there were in 2000--633,000 \nfewer visited the United States. That is unfortunate. You can see more \npeople around the world are traveling, but fewer are coming to our \ncountry. What does that really mean?\n  Since 2000, the U.S. share of the world travel market has decreased \nby nearly 20 percent, costing us hundreds of thousands of jobs and \nbillions of dollars in revenue. You can see what happened here in our \ncountry. This chart is in millions of dollars--$26 million brought in \nin 2000, only $25.3 million in 2008; while for the rest of the world, \n$124 million for the rest of the world in 2000--up to $173 million in \n2008.\n  When a traveler decides to visit another country, to visit someplace \nbesides the United States, there is a ripple effect across our economy. \nFewer airline tickets are sold, fewer cars are rented, hotels and \nlodges rent fewer rooms, tourist attractions have fewer visitors, local \nbusinesses miss out on sales and opportunities, workers lose their \njobs, and it goes on and on.\n  The decline in international travel, combined with the current \neconomic downturn, is hitting our country's travel industry hard. Last \nyear, nearly 200,000 travel-related jobs were lost, and the Commerce \nDepartment predicts we will lose another 247,00 jobs this year. We are \nnot talking about the CEOs of the airline companies. These are hard-\nworking Americans--the people who work in the hotel rooms, the cooks, \nthe janitors, the shop workers, the people who own little flower stores \nnext to the hotels. They are the ones making the beds. They are the \nones making the meals. These are the people we should think about when \nwe talk about the bill before the Senate today.\n  The question before us today is how can we bring international \nvisitors to the United States because--do you know how much they each \nspend when they come? Something like $4,500 when they come to our \ncountry. That is $4,500 that provides jobs for those janitors and maids \nand shop owners.\n  We have just as much, if not more, to offer travelers than anyplace \nelse. We have stunning national landmarks, such as the Grand Canyon--\nand the Statue of Liberty in your home State of New York, Madam \nPresident--centers of fun and entertainment from Las Vegas to Disney \nWorld, scenic country towns and the bright lights of the big cities and \nthose quiet moments in those little towns in my home State of \nMinnesota. But we need to do a better job of promoting the United \nStates as a premier travel destination. We have to face it. We are in a \ncompetition for international travelers, but we are not competing.\n  Look at what is going on around the world when it comes to tourism. \nHere are some examples: Yemen has their own tourism promotion for their \ncountry. Of course, the Bahamas--I think many of us have seen those on \nTV. I certainly have. You see Tourism Australia. I have seen a few of \nthose ads. South Africa, Taiwan, Scotland, India--these countries are \npromoting themselves internationally to bring in other visitors.\n  What do we have right now in our country? We do not have a \ncentralized promotion of our country for tourism. Countries around the \nworld make tourism a national priority because they see it brings jobs \nto their country. They spend millions of dollars on promotion and \nprograms and senior officials to coordinate national tourism policy. \nFor example, Vietnam, Egypt, New Zealand, Lebanon, and Jamaica have \nministries of tourism. Germany has a National Tourist Board, and \nAustralia has a ``Tourism Australia'' program. In 2005, Greece spent \nmore than $150 million on travel promotion; France spent $63 million. \nThat is what we are up against.\n  The Travel Promotion Act would level the playing field so we can \ncompete with the rest of the world and recapture that lost market \nshare. It will create the Corporation for Travel Promotion, a public-\nprivate partnership to promote the United States as an international \ntravel destination and finally establish a coordinated national travel \nprogram.\n  Under the direction of a board of directors made up of \nrepresentatives from the States, the Federal Government, and the travel \nindustry, the corporation would be in charge of a national travel \npromotion, a program with goals to encourage travel to the United \nStates, to communicate our country's travel policies, and to promote \ninternational exposure for parts of America that do not have the \nresources to promote themselves.\n  As I mentioned earlier, our loss in the share of the world travel \nmarket is not a new phenomenon. It actually started after September 11, \nwhere, for good reasons, security measures were put into place, but \nsome of those good\n\n[[Page S6630]]\n\nreasons have turned into very difficult times for tourists to come \nover, and that is what needs to be fixed. That is why part of this bill \nwould make it easier for tourists to get their visas, make it easier \nfor them to visit the country. A lot of times it is just expediting the \nchecks that need to be made, making sure they can get their visas, just \nas they can get one to go to Canada or Mexico or other countries.\n  The bill will establish the Office of Travel Promotion in the \nDepartment of Commerce to work with the Corporation for Travel \nPromotion and secretaries of state and homeland security to make sure \nthat international visitors are processed efficiently.\n  America is a country that wraps its arms around those who come to \nvisit us, and this bill will make sure international visitors know they \nare welcome and wanted. The Travel Promotion Act is about more than \njust encouraging travel. It is also about building our economy. This \nbill is expected to bring in 1.6 million new international visitors \neach year. Since international visitors, as I noted, spend an average \nof $4,500 per person while they are here, this is a huge boost to our \neconomy. That money from overseas coming into our economy, into our \ntowns and cities, into our small businesses is new money. If they are \nnot going to come and spend it here, they are going to go to one of \nthese countries--to the Bahamas, South Africa, Australia. That is new \nmoney coming into our country.\n  The U.S. Travel Association estimates this bill will create 40,000 \nnew jobs, and economists at Oxford Economics expect the bill to \ngenerate $4 billion in new spending and $321 million in new tax \nrevenue.\n  Just as important as how much it will generate is how much it will \ncost, which is zero for American taxpayers. This bill comes at no cost \nto the taxpayer. It will be paid for by a combination of private sector \ncontributions and a $10 fee on international travelers entering the \nUnited States of America--zero cost, big benefit.\n  The Congressional Budget Office just released a report that estimates \nthat this bill will reduce budget deficits by $425 million over the \nnext 10 years--that is the bill pending before this body today. The \nmath is undeniable. For no cost to the taxpayer, we can boost travel, \nboost the economy, and reduce the deficit. That is why this bill has \nsuch strong bipartisan support in the Senate. It also has the support \nof numerous organizations such as the U.S. Travel Association, the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  It has many newspaper endorsements. As you can see, newspapers in \nevery part of the country support this legislation. I will read just a \nfew. The Sacramento Bee:\n\n       The country needs to reclaim its status as a global magnet \n     for visitors, even in the post 9/11 climate, and Congress can \n     help by passing the Travel Promotion Act by the end of this \n     year.\n\n  Dallas Morning News, September 6:\n\n       The Travel Promotion act is a sensible first step toward \n     putting the welcome mat back on America's doorstep.\n\n  Orlando Sentinel:\n\n       Our position, charging international travelers $10 to pay \n     for promotion of travel to bring in all that money makes \n     sense.\n\n  Detroit Free Press, September 25, 2008:\n\n       Doesn't it make sense to encourage, at no cost to \n     taxpayers, foreign visitors to come here and leave some \n     money? There's no good reason not to pass this bill.\n\n  Finally, I leave the best to last, Duluth News Tribune, Duluth, MN, \nMay 18, 2009:\n\n       Ideas to bolster economic recovery without plunging the \n     nation any deeper into debt would be welcomed by taxpayers \n     from coast to coast.\n\n  I know firsthand how important tourism is for the city of Duluth. It \nhas had some very difficult economic times in the seventies and \neighties. At one point it was so bad there was a time there was a \nbillboard that someone put outside Duluth that said, ``The last one to \nleave, please turn off the lights.''\n  That is what they were dealing with. They bolstered their economy \nthrough tourism.\n  I was just up there. I did a field hearing there and they have \nactually seen an increase in their convention and business travel this \nyear. Maybe a few people are going to places such as Duluth. Businesses \nare cutting back a little. But the important part of this is that you \nhave one town just like so many across the country that has benefited \nfrom tourism.\n  This is what we are talking about across the country. I wonder why we \ndidn't pass this earlier, why we haven't been able to get this through. \nI can't answer this question. It makes no sense to me. Sometimes people \ndon't want to talk about tourism because they don't think it is \nimportant, but when one out of eight Americans is employed in this \nbusiness it is important.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it. I hope we can get it through \nintact. I hope we will have a minimum number of amendments and we can \nsimply do something good in a bipartisan way that will help increase \njobs in America where one out of eight people is employed.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is bipartisan. I have offered it along with Senator John \nEnsign, a Republican from Nevada. The two of us, along with many other \ncosponsors, Republicans and Democrats in the Senate, believe this is an \nimportant piece of legislation for the Senate and for the Congress to \npass. Despite that, we had to have a vote this morning on the motion to \nproceed: Shall we proceed to this? A cloture motion had to be filed. It \ntook 2 days to ripen, and then we had a vote. It was 90 to 3. The \nanswer was yes by 90 to 3. And now we have 30 hours postcloture that we \nhave to wait until we can get to the bill. And then have another \ncloture motion filed. It is the most unbelievable, Byzantine example of \nhow this place has sort of fallen off the rails--requiring cloture \nmotions to be filed on things that then get a 90-to-3 vote, and then \nthere is a requirement that we have to spend the next 30 hours waiting \nuntil we can actually get to the bill. Unbelievable. But it is an \nexample of what has happened here. And the minority is requiring this \nof every single piece of legislation. It is a way to require the Senate \nto walk through wet cement and make almost no progress at all. I guess \nwhen you get nothing done and then you are able to boast that nothing \nhas happened, maybe some people feel good. It does not make me feel \nvery good.\n  But having complained about it, now let me at least describe what \nthis bill is. We will get to the bill this week. It will have taken a \ndifficult route to get there. Judging by the 90-to-3 vote, I assume \nultimately, when the Senate passes this legislation, we will have very \nstrong support because it is a bipartisan piece of legislation.\n  I am told Senator Ensign has had to leave today as a result of a \nfamily matter. I think Senator Martinez will be coming to the floor, \nwho is also a cosponsor of this legislation. I appreciate\n\n[[Page S6631]]\n\nvery much working with Senator Ensign and Senator Martinez; on this \nside, Senator Reid, the majority leader, a strong cosponsor, and so \nmany others as well.\n  Let me describe what this issue is. The fact is, there is an effort \nto attract international tourism around this world. Why is that the \ncase? Because international tourists; that is, people who visit other \ncountries, spend a lot of money and create a lot of jobs. They support \nairlines, support hotels, support recreation facilities and theme \nparks. Plus, they have a chance to understand a little about that \ncountry before they go back home. So many countries around the world \nare very actively engaged in saying: Come to our country. They have \nvery aggressive, very sophisticated promotion campaigns saying: Come to \nour country. We do not, but they do.\n  Here is an example of India: One special reason to visit India in \n2009. Anytime is a good time to visit the land of Taj. But there is no \ntime like now. Incredible India.\n  Well, India is very interested, very promotional, saying: Come to \nIndia.\n  But it is not just India. Here is Ireland, big promotional campaign: \nGo where Ireland takes you.\n  A beautiful photograph of the majesty of Ireland.\n  An example of Australia: Looking for an experience to remember? \nArrived. Departed. An adventure we will never forget. Go find yourself \nin Australia.\n  All over the world we have campaigns now, very aggressive campaigns, \nsaying: Come to Italy. Vacation in Italy. Come to Great Britain. Come \nto Spain. See the wonders of Spain.\n  Why are countries doing that? Well, it is interesting. The average \ninternational traveler spends about $4,500 on an overseas trip. When \nthey go to a country, they spend money. This creates jobs. So countries \nare aware of that, and they are very active in trying to encourage \ntravelers to come to their country. Not so with our country so much \nsince 9/11/2001. In fact, it is interesting that in 2008 we had 633,000 \nfewer people come to this country from overseas than we had in 2000. \nLet me say that again. In 2008, 633,000 fewer people from overseas came \nto visit our country than in the year 2000. In fact, here is an example \nof what is happening around the world: visitors to the United States--\nthis is 2000 to 2008--a 3-percent decrease; visitors to other countries \nin international travel, a 40-percent increase. The fact is that we are \nlosing ground and losing shares of the international travelers' tourism \ndollars and the ability also to explain to them a bit, by having them \nsee this country, what America is all about.\n  Well, why is that happening? Headlines like this post-9/11/2001. We \nare very concerned about people coming into this country, and we \ntightened the visa requirements so that there were long lines and very \nlong waits in order to try to come to this country. Here are some of \nthe headlines:\n  Sydney Morning Herald: ``Coming to America is not easy.''\n  The Guardian: ``America--more hassle than it's worth?''\n  The Sunday Times in London: ``Travel to America? No thanks.''\n  Look, the fact is, we want to change that.\n  This legislation is bipartisan. A group of us Republicans and \nDemocrats who want to create jobs in this country and want to attract \ninternational tourism to this country want to change this perception \nthat somehow international travelers are not welcome here.\n  So here is what we believe. We believe that to have people come to \nthis country is to see its wonders. It is the only one like it on the \nface of this planet. It is an extraordinary place. There is so much to \nsee and so much to do. And when we have done polling, and so on, when \ninternational travelers leave this country, they have an unbelievably \npositive impression of the United States of America, and that is very \nimportant. At a time when there has been so much discussion about our \ncountry going it alone and doing this or that, we have suffered some in \ninternational areas. But the fact is, inviting international tourism to \nour country is job creating, it produces a boost to our economy, but it \nalso allows people to come here and understand what this country is \nabout and inevitably leave with a great impression.\n  Here is what we do with this piece of legislation. We set up a \nnationally coordinated travel promotion program. I might say that if \nsomebody says: Well, you are going to set up something new, well, you \nknow what, the Congressional Budget Office has a score for this. They \nhave to decide what everything costs or what the consequences of \neverything will be.\n  This is one of the few pieces of legislation to be brought to the \nfloor of the Senate that the Congressional Budget Office estimates \nwould actually reduce the budget deficit by half a trillion dollars \nover the next 10 years. Let me say that again. This is one of the few \npieces of legislation you are going to get a chance to vote on that \nreduces the Federal budget deficit by $425 million in the next 10 \nyears.\n  How does it do that? Well, the fact is, it creates a private-public \npartnership and it establishes a corporation for travel promotion which \nwill be an independent nonprofit corporation governed by an 11-member \nboard of directors appointed by the Secretary of Commerce. It also \ncreates an Office of Travel Promotion in the Department of Commerce to \ndevelop programs to increase the number of international visitors to \nour country. It sets up a travel promotion fund, and that is financed \nby a private-public matching program. The Federal contributions will be \nfinanced by a $10 fee paid by foreign travelers from visa waiver \ncountries, and it will be collected in the electronic system for travel \nauthorizations which already exists.\n\n  Let me make the point that many other countries do exactly this. It \ndoes not in any way retard international travel. Australia charges a \n$37 departure fee; Guatemala, $30; Mexico, $11 to $38; Thailand, a $14 \ndeparture fee. And the list goes on. We are suggesting a very modest \n$10 fee for international travelers, from the visa waiver countries, \nand that will finance this piece of legislation that we have had now to \nfile a cloture motion on on the motion to proceed to this issue and for \nwhich there was a 90-to-3 vote, an affirmative vote.\n  Here is some discussion about our legislation.\n  I introduced this in the last session of the Congress. We had over 50 \ncosponsors, Republicans and Democrats. We have reintroduced it now with \nwide bipartisan cosponsorship.\n  The Detroit Free Press says:\n\n       Doesn't it make sense to encourage, at no cost to \n     taxpayers, foreign visitors to come here and leave us with \n     some money? There's no good reason not to pass this bill.\n\n  The Dallas Morning News says:\n\n       The Travel Promotion Act is a sensible first step toward \n     putting the welcome mat back on America's doorstep.\n\n  The Orlando Sentinel says:\n\n       Our position, charging international travelers $10 to pay \n     for the promotion, makes sense.\n\n  The Los Angeles Times:\n\n       Considering that the U.S. spends hundreds of millions of \n     dollars on public diplomacy with dubious results, and nearly \n     nothing on promoting tourism, it might do well to invest a \n     little money in wooing travelers.\n\n  The list goes on of newspapers that have endorsed the legislation.\n  This has been a pretty difficult decade for our country in many ways. \nOur country was attacked on 9/11/2001. Several thousand innocent \nAmericans were killed by terrorists. Following that, we suffered a \nrecession almost immediately, then a war in Afghanistan, and then a \nlong protracted war in Iraq that cost an enormous amount of money and \nwas very controversial all around the world. It has been a very \ndifficult decade.\n  As I indicated when I started, 8 years later, we have so many fewer \nvisitors coming to the United States. I think during part of this \ndecade there was a notion by some that we were not welcoming visitors \nto the United States; we did not want them to come here very much.\n  That was not true, but I think that was a sense of some: You want to \ncome to the United States, get in line, it is going to take a long time \nto get a visa. Why? Because we are concerned. We are screening \neverybody. We are doing all of these kinds of things. Well, the fact \nis, no one ever intended to decide we were not going to welcome people \nto this country. By far, the most effective way to describe to the \nworld what America is about and the unbelievable values that exist and \nthe openness and the wonders of this great democracy, by far, the best \nway to do that is to say\n\n[[Page S6632]]\n\nto people from around the world: Come here. Vacation here. You are \nwelcome here. We want you here, to experience and visit America and \nsome of the best attractions and some of the best people and be a part \nof what we are and then go home and remember what the United States is \nabout.\n  So that is what we are trying to do. It has been too long, but \nfinally we are now putting together a piece of legislation that says: \nWe are not willing to go through another 8 or 10 years like the last 8 \nor 10 years where our share of international tourism dramatically \ndecreased.\n  We want the next 8 or 10 years to show a substantial increase in \npeople from around the world coming to visit America. And the fact is, \nit will create substantial numbers of jobs. That is important. I mean, \nas you know, we ran into a financial ditch, have an economic crisis of \nsorts. The number of unemployed Americans rises every month, and we are \nhoping that turns around soon. But in the meantime, this is something \nconstructive and positive and concrete we can do to try to boost this \neconomy. It does not even cost money. This will save almost half a \ntrillion dollars in the next 10 years by reducing the Federal deficit.\n  Again, I wish some of my colleagues were not deciding to see if they \ncould run everybody through the traps for the next few days before we \nget to what I think will be a very positive vote on a very constructive \nidea that will benefit this country. But if it takes 4 days or 2 days \nor 1 day, whatever the moment, I think most of us will feel as if we \nhave done something good for the country.\n  In the midst of all of the other very controversial issues and very \nimportant issues, some of which are urgent, the questions of: How do \nyou rein in increasing health care costs? What do you do about a \ncountry that is 70 percent dependent on oil that comes from foreign \ncountries? What do you do about the issue of protecting our climate and \nclimate change? How do you deal with the Federal budget deficit that \nseems galloping out of control? There are all these big issues.\n\n  In the middle of all that--all of which, in my judgment, we are \nrequired to address in order to put America on a different course \ntoward a better future--in the middle of all that, this piece of \nlegislation, the Travel Promotion Act of 2009, might be one small \nglimmer--just one small bit of hope--for more bipartisanship rather \nthan less. Because this piece of legislation is so persuasive about the \ninterests of this country, we have Republicans and Democrats who have \ncome together to say: Let's do this. Let's do this in the interest of \nthis country's economic future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may \nproceed for approximately 16 minutes as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the distinguished Acting President pro tempore.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. President, last week, I came to the Senate floor to talk about \nthe flawed process of our current attempts to reform the health care \nsystem in this country and the urgent need to fix those flaws.\n  Those efforts included a letter--my letter--which every Republican \nmember of the Finance Committee and the HELP Committee--Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee--signed requesting some very \nreasonable steps to be taken by Chairman Baucus, Chairman Kennedy, and \nSenator Dodd, who is standing in for our friend and colleague, Senator \nKennedy.\n  We asked the chairmen to release the details of their plans to reform \nhealth care. We asked them to do so in a timely manner to allow us time \nto read and understand the policies and to get reactions from our \nconstituents, i.e., the people who will benefit or will not benefit, \nnot to mention the providers of health care. We asked them to give us \nthe estimates of how much their plans would cost and how it would \nimpact everyday Americans. Finally, we asked them to identify how they \nintended to pay for these plans.\n  It was my sincere hope that by receiving this information we could \nbetter participate in the quest to ensure that every American--every \nAmerican--has meaningful access to health care, not to mention patient \nchoice.\n  Well, unfortunately, the health care reform process has been so \ncorrupted by artificial timelines and a ``hurry up'' and a ``riding \nhell for leather'' mentality that it threatens to destroy a health care \nsystem that has served most Americans very well.\n  The American health care system represents one-sixth of our economy, \nwhich has been repeated many times on this Senate floor, offers health \ninsurance coverage to 250 million Americans, and employs over 16 \nmillion people. It leads the world in medical innovations that save \nlives inside as well as far outside our borders. So this actually is an \ninternational health care bill.\n  President Obama has recognized that most people are happy with their \nhealth care. Obviously, they would like some changes, some reforms. But \nhe has repeatedly assured them: If you like what you have, you can keep \nit.\n  Well, because changes to this system have the potential to impact \nevery single American citizen and citizens of other nations, it seems \nto me we must ensure we protect the best of its features when we \nconsider changes to shore up its deficiencies.\n  Careful consideration is required. That is why we ask for more \ndetails. That is why we ask for more time. To date, our requests for \nmore information have not been met, and I think I am starting to \nunderstand why.\n  Yesterday afternoon, the Congressional Budget Office, the CBO, \nreleased its first preliminary analysis of the bill we are scheduled to \nbegin marking up in the HELP Committee tomorrow. Let me repeat this: \nYesterday afternoon--less than 24 hours--if you are a HELP Committee \nstaffer, you are looking at your watch, and you are wondering how come \nyou do not have more time--the Congressional Budget Office released its \nfirst preliminary analysis of the bill that we are scheduled to begin \nmarking up tomorrow.\n  I said in my previous speech, maybe we need a ``process czar,'' a \n``fair play czar'' around here. We have 25 czars in the Obama \nadministration. Maybe we need a czar around here to at least be fair, \ngive us more time, give us more consideration, let us know what we are \ngoing to be voting on.\n  Before I talk about the results of the CBO's analysis of the Kennedy-\nDodd legislation, I need to point out this analysis is incomplete. It \nis incomplete because, despite our persistent requests for more \ninformation from our Democratic colleagues and friends, one day before \nthe markup of possibly the most important health care bill ever to \ncross the Senate floor, they have not released the complete \nlegislation.\n  In fact, even when the HELP Committee begins our markup tomorrow, we \nwill not have a complete picture of what we are marking up. The most \ncontentious components of the bill will not be released until sometime \non Thursday morning--leaving us around 30 hours to digest these \nsignificant policies, vet them with our people back home, take the \nspecifics back home to the health care providers and every constituent \nwho certainly is interested and wants to know the details, and then \nfile amendments to see if we can do better, see if we can actually \ncorrect some things we think are headed in the wrong direction.\n  I said it is hard to digest all of this in 30 hours. This is not \ndigestion, this is not indigestion--this is heartburn. It may develop \ninto a malady much more serious than that.\n  Most egregious perhaps is the fact that we will most likely be \nconsidering these major reforms without any idea of how much they will \ncost or how they will affect the current system. But, as I said, I am \nstarting to wonder whether that is not part of the plan, which leads me \nback to yesterday's CBO release analyzing the cost and effect of just \none of the six titles to the Kennedy-Dodd health care reform bill--and \nan incomplete title at that.\n\n[[Page S6633]]\n\n  According to CBO, the incomplete sections of title I will cost $1 \ntrillion--$1 trillion. That is just for one incomplete title of this \nbill. What will we get for this staggering investment, for a title with \na purpose ostensibly to expand health care coverage to the estimated 47 \nmillion Americans currently lacking insurance?\n  According to CBO, we will only cover 16 million more Americans. Let \nme say that again. According to CBO, we will only cover 16 million more \nAmericans. That does not seem like a very good return for a bill that \nseeks to cover three times that many people.\n  Instead of extending health insurance to 47 million uninsured, we are \nleaving tens of millions still uncovered. And the CBO says that figure \nis around 37 million people. So you can see we have some flaws in this \napproach on this bill.\n  In addition, CBO says that 15 million people would lose their \nemployer-sponsored insurance and another 8 million--again, this is the \nCBO analysis--would lose coverage from their current source.\n  Whom are we going to trust around here? At least when we asked the \nCBO to give some specifics, they are providing some specifics; that is, \n15 million people would lose their employer-sponsored insurance and \nanother 8 million would lose coverage from their current source. That \nis 23 million people. That is a lot of folks. As I said, President \nObama has consistently promised: If you like the health insurance plan \nyou have, you can keep it. Not those 23 million.\n  Under the Kennedy-Dodd bill, 23 million Americans who may like what \nthey have cannot, in fact, keep it--again, according to the CBO, \nnonpartisan.\n  I cannot even imagine how much more this bill will cost taxpayers \nwhen CBO figures in the rest of the initiatives my friends across the \naisle wish to add. I am positive, under the complete plan by my \ncolleagues, millions more Americans will not be able to keep the \ninsurance they like.\n  That is because in addition to the plans that have already been \nreleased, they want to establish a new government-run, taxpayer-\nfinanced insurance plan that is estimated to replace private insurance \nfor over 100 million Americans. They want an expansion of Medicaid for \neveryone up to 150 percent of the Federal poverty level. They want to \nenact dozens upon dozens of new programs.\n  For example, title III of this bill includes--listen to this--a $10 \nbillion per-year-cost in mandatory spending--mandatory spending; this \nis on the appropriators' side--for something called a Prevention and \nPublic Health trust fund for the Appropriations Subcommittee on Health, \nwith very little, if any, direction on what the money would be used \nfor.\n  This is unprecedented and amounts, in my view, to a slush fund, \nregardless of any description.\n  Another section provides an unknown amount of money--``such sums as \nmay be necessary''--to fund something called a community makeover--\nexcuse me--a community transformation grant to build grocery stores, \nsidewalks, and jungle gyms.\n  Sidewalks, jungle gyms, grocery stores? This is a health care bill, \nnot a rural development bill. I am shocked by the numbers that have \ncome out so far, and they are just the beginning.\n  Well, come to think of it, maybe it is related to health care. Maybe \nif you build a better sidewalk, people could walk on that sidewalk, \npass the jungle gym, exercise on the jungle gym, go to the grocery \nstore, have mandates to buy nothing but fruits and vegetables, come \nback past the jungle gym, exercise some more, and since the sidewalk is \nfixed, they could go home, and we would help cure the obesity factor we \nface today. Maybe that is the tie. Maybe that is the tie.\n  I am shocked, as I said, by the numbers.\n  One independent group--now listen again to this; you have to listen \nto this--the group called HSI Network in Minnesota has estimated that \nthe cost of the Kennedy-Dodd bill in its entirety could be $4 \ntrillion--$4 trillion. The Lewin Group has estimated that up to 119 \nmillion Americans could lose their private insurance coverage under a \ngovernment-run plan.\n  I am willing to bet the American public will be as shocked as I am \nonce they understand what has been lurking, lurking, lurking under the \nbanner of reform. The refusal to release information such as this until \nthe very last possible minute, under an unjustifiably accelerated \ntimeline, leaving no time for Senators, let alone the American public, \nto examine the merits of this plan, makes me think the ``health care \nemperor has no clothes.''\n  Let me repeat what the CBO has said. Sixteen million Americans newly \ninsured--a good thing--but 37 million Americans still not insured. \nTwenty-three million Americans lose what they have for $1 trillion. \nThis is the wrong direction. This is the wrong direction. We ought to \nsay: ``Whoa.'' Put a sign up in both committee rooms that says: \n``Whoa,'' and put a sign underneath it that says: ``Do no harm.''\n  To add to this concern I have and the frustration I have in regard to \nhealth care reform, CongressDaily reported Tuesday, June 16--that is \ntoday--that CBO scored a recent version of the Senate Finance \nCommittee--this is Finance, this is not Health. This is not the one I \nam talking about; this is the Finance Committee, and I have the \nprivilege of serving on both--that their overall proposal is at $1.5 \ntrillion over 10 years, not $1 trillion, according to several sources. \nThis is a typical news story. The committee's timeline to release and \nmark up the legislation could slip on the news. Senate Finance Chairman \nMax Baucus cautioned today the CBO numbers, which he did not confirm, \nwere on a bill that is about 2 weeks old and the bill has evolved since \nthen. The chairman indicated it is unlikely he will release a draft of \nhis committee's bill Wednesday, as he previously estimated--that is \ntomorrow. The high score could add more credence to an insurance co-op \nproposal offered by Senate Budget Chairman Kent Conrad as an \nalternative.\n  So we don't know. Is it $1.5 trillion or is it $1 trillion? We don't \nknow. And if an offhand comment, which may or may not be private, but I \ndon't think anymore anything should be private in regard to health care \nreform--the chairman indicated, I think, it was a comment in response \nto Senator Snowe, who said, How do we vote for this bill in committee \nif we don't know how much it costs and how it is going to merge with \nthe Health Committee's bill. Basically the answer coming back, as \neverybody knows is, This bill isn't going to be written here, this bill \nisn't going to be written in committee; it is going to be written in \nconference. It is called ``trust me.''\n  I don't see how we can have much trust when ``the emperor has no \nclothes.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent to be \npermitted to speak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. I also ask unanimous consent to be permitted to speak for \nwhat I hope will be 20 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Finally, I will have two separate subject matters I wish \nto cover.\n  Mr. President, I didn't plan on responding to my colleague from \nKansas, and I won't today, but I still think on health care we have a \nlong way to go. There is still a lot of work to be done in the \ncommittee I am a member of, the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee, and an awful lot of work to do still in the Finance \nCommittee. So we will leave that for another day. But in a general \nsense, I think what we are all trying to do--I know my colleagues on \nthe Democratic side are trying to do this--is to make sure that at the \nend of this debate, the bill that emerges from the Congress has a \ncouple of basic principles. One is it gives people choice in their \nhealth care. If you like what you have, you get to keep it, and if you \ndon't like what you have, you have a choice; and that the bill also \nreflects a cost reduction which is essential if we are going to move \nforward; and finally, that we provide the kind of quality, affordable \nhealth care that every American has a right to expect that we would try \nto provide in this bill.\n  If we keep that in mind, I think we can get to the right place. We \nhave an awful lot of work to do, and I think\n\n[[Page S6634]]\n\nthere are some conclusory statements that have been made in the last \ncouple of days which don't reflect the reality, which is we have a lot \nof proposals, we have draft bills, but we don't have a final product \nyet, so we have a way to go.\n\n\n                           Iranian Elections\n\n  Mr. President, the first subject I wish to discuss is the Iranian \nelections. I wish to convey some brief remarks on the remarkable events \nwe have been witnessing unfolding in Iran in the last couple of days. \nIt is too soon to tell what will happen. We do not know if Iran's \nbrittle theocratic regime will hear out the voices of reform emanating \nin such powerful fashion from the streets of Iran today. We do not know \nif a credible investigation of serious electoral irregularities will \noccur, but I am confident that the events of this past weekend will be \nrecorded in the history books as a major milestone for the democratic \naspirations of the Iranian people. While the hard-liners who continue \nto rule Iran today may further entrench their power in the coming days, \nthey are only planting the seeds for their ultimate defeat by their \nresponse to the democratic voices with the kind of force and \nsuppression we have seen play out on television.\n  It is a promising sign that Iran's supreme leader has called upon the \nall-powerful Guardian Council to review the electoral results and \nassess the claims of serious irregularities, including vote rigging and \nballot fraud, in the national election. However, we should not get our \nhopes raised that justice is imminent.\n  In the last Iranian Presidential election in 2005, there were also \nserious questions of fraud raised after Mr. Ahmadinejad came out of \nnowhere to win the Presidency following a runoff vote. Yet the final \nresults of that investigation were never published, and thereafter Mr. \nAhmadinejad's declared victory stood firm. Because of that precedent, I \nam skeptical that the Iranian regime will engage in an honest review of \nthis election count.\n  President Obama and his senior national security team have refrained \nfrom extensive commentary on the election in recent days. That is as it \nshould be. The U.S. Government should not give the Iranian regime any \nflimsy rationales for further crackdown on protestors and reformist \nleaders. However, administration officials, led by Vice President \nBiden, have made clear that the strategy of diplomatic engagement with \nIran's leadership to bring a peaceful resolution of Iran's nuclear \nprogram will continue, regardless of who may comprise that leadership \nor how they may have assumed power. That, I believe, is the right \nstrategy. We must deal with Iran as it is, not as we may wish it to be. \nFor far too long, the United States deprived itself of the power of its \ndiplomacy on the mistaken insistence that Iran agree to a set of \npreconditions before talks could even commence. Talking to your enemy \ncan never be viewed as a concession. The United States spoke to the \nSoviet Union during the worst excesses of the Cold War, but diplomacy \ncannot be the only option that the United States pursues with Iran. The \nPresident knows this and has reaffirmed that other options are open to \nthe United States on multiple occasions.\n  Any effective strategy toward Iran must offer the regime a clear \nchoice when it comes to its nuclear program, and here is the choice; it \nis either one or the other. Come into compliance with the multiple \nUnited Nations Security Council resolutions and reap the benefits of \neconomic engagement and warmer diplomatic ties, choice No. 1. Or choice \nNo. 2 for the Iranian regime: Face continued economic sanctions and \ninternational isolation that will steadily worsen if Iran continues to \nengage in illicit nuclear activities. It is either one or the other, \nand the regime has a choice to make before the world. Effective \ndiplomacy is successful if it can fully convey that choice to the \ndecisionmakers in Iran.\n  The Congress can also play a useful role here in elucidating the \nconsequences Iran faces when it makes its choice on its nuclear \nprogram. Some might call it the ``good cop, bad cop'' strategy; I \nsimply prefer to call it diplomatic leverage that our negotiators can \nemploy if and when they do sit down at the table with Iranian \nrepresentatives.\n  For those reasons, I am proud to have joined my colleague Sam \nBrownback in introducing the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act. This \nlegislation would authorize State and local governments as they see \nappropriate to direct divestment from, and prevent future investment \nin, companies that hold investments of $20 million or more in Iran's \nenergy sector.\n  There is a growing divestment movement across the country in response \nto Iran's accelerating nuclear program, its support of Hamas and \nHezbollah, and hateful statements against Israel perpetrated by its \nPresident and others in Iran's senior leadership. Unfortunately, the \nFederal courts have ruled that divestment actions undertaken against a \nsingle nation may not predict the President's constitutional authority \nto enjoy exclusive authority over our Nation's diplomatic relations; \nthus, State and local governments undertake divestment measures with \nsome legal jeopardy. The Justice Department has taken legal action \nagainst State and local governments in cases involving other nations. \nThis act, the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act, protects the rights of State \nand local governments to ensure that their pension funds and other \ninvestment funds are not invested in companies that do business with a \nregime such as Iran. It is carefully targeted to focus only on \nfinancial ties with Iran's energy sector, to hit Iran where it is \neconomically most vulnerable.\n  The bill includes a sunset provision to lift this authorization once \nthe President certifies that Iran has ceased providing support for acts \nof international terrorism and has ceased the pursuit of weapons of \nmass destruction. I am proud to have assumed the lead Democratic role \non this legislation, taking over for President Obama, then Senator \nObama, who served in the lead role when he was in the Congress.\n  Secondly, let me also take a brief moment to comment on the Iran \nRefined Petroleum Sanctions Act of which I am proud to be a cosponsor \nwith the majority of the Senate. The bill would clarify existing legal \nambiguity by authorizing the President to sanction foreign firms \ninvolved in supplying Iran with refined gasoline and/or assisting Iran \nwith increasing its refining capacity.\n  Iran is forced to import as much as 40 percent of its annual gasoline \nconsumption due to the fact that much of its refining infrastructure \nwas destroyed during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. Economic sanctions \nin place since then have limited outside foreign investment. Targeting \nIranian gasoline consumption is a promising venue for increasing our \nleverage on Iran's leadership. The Iranian people, I believe, may \nquestion why the regime prioritizes a nuclear program condemned by the \ninternational community at the cost of serious gasoline shortages in \nIran.\n  The images in recent days have been stirring. Just yesterday we \nwitnessed a procession of hundreds of thousands of Iranians, both young \npeople dressed in modern attire and elderly women wearing traditional \nveils, marching in silence throughout downtown Teheran. Indeed, \nwhenever a chant or shout emerged from the crowd, it was quickly hushed \nby the crowd, seeking to avoid any provocation for the riot police \nstanding watch to move and break up the march. It is easy to forget, \nwith all the incendiary rhetoric from leaders such as Mr. Ahmadinejad, \nthat the Iranian people remain fundamentally pro-American and envy our \ndemocracy and personal liberties.\n  This week is a dark moment for the Iranian people as their legitimate \naspirations for greater reform have been apparently sidetracked by the \nregime. But I am optimistic on their future and look forward to the day \nthat the United States and Iran can once again be at peace and enjoy \nmutual respect for and with one another.\n  Mr. President, I would inquire as to the time remaining.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 11 minutes.\n  Mr. CASEY. So I have more time than I thought I did. That is good \nnews.\n\n\n                 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to move to a second topic in the remaining time \nI have with regard to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, but \nespecially in regard to some of the attacks that have been leveled in \nrecent days.\n  In just over 100 days now, the Recovery and Reinvestment Act is \nalready at\n\n[[Page S6635]]\n\nwork doing many things, such as providing immediate relief for hard-hit \ncommunities and families; secondly, creating and saving jobs; and \nthirdly, jump-starting thousands of shovel-ready projects across \nAmerica. Our economic problems were not created in 100 days and they \nwill not be solved in 100 days or even in a little more than 100 days. \nBut thanks to the Recovery Act, we are meeting the greatest economic \nchallenge in a generation head on.\n  There are early signs of progress across the country. Just a couple \nof examples of immediate relief measures under the act are providing \nstability for hard-hit families.\n  First, the Make Work Pay tax credit has increased take-home pay for \n95 percent of working families; 95 percent of working families in \nAmerica are benefiting from that. I note that in Pennsylvania the \nnumber is 4.8 million households are benefiting from that tax credit. \nSecond, unemployment benefits have increased by $25 a week. Third, \nCOBRA health insurance premiums have been cut by 65 percent. Fifty-four \nmillion older citizens across the country have received $250 in \nemergency relief checks in the mail. Finally, in this section, food \nassistance benefits have increased by 13 percent, just when vulnerable \nAmericans need them.\n  Tax credit and other Recovery Act incentives are starting to drive \nnew consumer spending and creating new product demand. Energy \nefficiency and renewable energy tax credits are providing fresh \nopportunities for manufacturers and contractors that make or install \ngreen products. And the $8,000 first-time home buyer tax credit is \nproving to be a bright spot for the hard-hit housing industry.\n  The Recovery Act aid to State governments is helping to protect \ncritical safety net programs and saving teaching and law enforcement \njobs. Over half of the States have qualified for the State fiscal \nstabilization funds that are saving teaching jobs and improving \neducation.\n  State governments are making up shortfalls in Medicaid funds, thanks \nto the Recovery Act.\n  Infrastructure improvement projects funded by the Recovery Act are \nbringing new jobs to hard-hit communities.\n  Over 20,000 Recovery Act projects across the country have been \napproved already. In Pennsylvania, just two quick examples: $725 \nmillion for highway projects has been allocated and $600,000 for \nairport grants.\n  The Recovery Act commitments to develop and commercialize new \ntechnologies that will be the foundation of the new economy are \nstarting to boost confidence and spur some private sector investment \nacross the country.\n  Businesses are converting crisis to opportunity because of the \npromise they see with the Recovery Act. The Recovery Act is already \nmaking life a little easier for families and businesses like these, and \nwork is just getting started.\n  Last week, President Obama and Vice President Biden announced the \nRoadmap to Recovery, 10 new major projects that will define the next 3 \nmonths of the Recovery Act. Here is what the 10 are: help 1,129 health \ncenters in 50 States and 8 territories provide expanded service to \napproximately 300,000 patients; begin work on 107 national parks; start \nrehabilitation and improvement projects at 98 airports and over 1,500 \nhighway locations throughout the country; fund 135,000 education jobs, \nincluding teachers, principals, and support staff; begin improvements \nat 90 veterans medical centers across 38 States; hire or keep on the \njob approximately 5,000 law enforcement officers; start 200 new waste \nand water systems projects in rural America; begin or accelerate \ncleanup work at 20 Superfund sites from the National Priority List; \ncreate 125,000 summer youth jobs; finally, begin 2,300 construction and \nrehabilitation projects at 359 military facilities across the country.\n  Billions of dollars in Recovery Act programs that will shape the \neconomy of the 21st century will launch in the weeks and months ahead--\nfor example, $8 billion for high-speed rail; $4.7 billion to connect \nmore Americans to broadband Internet; $4.5 billion to make a nationwide \nsmart energy grid a reality; $800 million to accelerate the use of \nbiofuels and bring them to market; and $300 million to expand the \nNation's fleet of alternative-fuel vehicles through the Clean Cities \nProgram.\n  These investments will get our economy moving today in a way that \nwill change our economy for tomorrow. The road to recovery is long and \nour economic problems won't be solved overnight, but with every dollar \ninvested and every project started under the Recovery Act, we are \ngetting one step closer.\n  I will conclude with one further comment. Just as was the case when \nwe voted on the Recovery Act, it was a choice between are you for the \nRecovery Act or for the status quo? Fortunately, enough of us voted for \nit so we could jump-start the economy, get it out of the ditch and back \non the road to recovery. We still have a long way to go, and there is a \nlot more work to do, but so far the news is positive in communities \nacross the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and I know in your home State \nof Illinois, Mr. President, and across the country.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I wish to applaud my colleague from \nPennsylvania because he shared not only our dreams for the recovery--\nor, as we call it in Arkansas, the ``jump-start'' bill--but, more \nimportantly, not just our dreams but the things that are actively \nhappening in our States, the great things, whether it is highway \nprojects or for us in Arkansas the new market tax credits, which have \nbeen a tremendous boost for capital infusion into small businesses and \nfor entrepreneurs. We can also look at the SBA 7(a) Loan Program, which \nis tremendous for small businesses. Education alone--I met with \nprincipals and administrators last week when I was home, talking about \nthe opportunities for education and the infusion of resources coming \nfrom the Recovery Act, along with water projects and broadband. The \nSenator from Pennsylvania did an excellent job in mentioning those and, \nmost importantly, focusing on the fact that this will help us get our \ncountry and our economy back on track and get Americans back to work or \nkeep them in the jobs they are clinging to. I appreciate him coming to \nthe floor and mentioning some of that, all of which many of us have \nbeen seeing as we travel home to our States over the weekend or during \nthe breaks.\n  Mr. CASEY. I thank the Senator.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. LINCOLN pertaining to the submission of S. Res. \n186 are located in today's Record under ``Submissions of Concurrent and \nSenate Resolutions.'')\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                        Systemic Risk Regulation\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the state of our \nfinancial system and to provide some thoughts on systemic risk \nregulation, as we set about crafting an overall reform to our financial \nregulatory approach.\n  Yesterday, Treasure Secretary Timothy Geithner and the Director of \nthe National Economic Council, Lawrence Summers, published an editorial \nin the Washington Post laying out the broad outline of their proposal \nfor regulatory reform. I share their views on how we arrived at this \nmoment. I share the broader goals they discussed and look forward to \nworking with the administration on comprehensive and timely regulatory \nreform. However, I wish to speak today about one area where I disagree, \nand that is how to address systemic risk.\n  Let me step back for a moment.\n  In the past 2 years we have witnessed events that have shaken our \nfinancial system to its core, altered our markets in ways that we still \nstruggle to understand, and imposed costs that will burden our economy \nand our taxpayers for decades to come. We have grown numb to the news, \nbut let me briefly recount these events.\n  The investment banking sector that built our capital markets has \ncollapsed. Two of our largest investment banks have failed. Another has \nmerged\n\n[[Page S6636]]\n\nwith a commercial bank to avoid failure. Two others became commercial \nbanking organizations.\n  Our residential mortgage finance sector has collapsed. The largest \nmortgage banks in the country have failed. Our two largest savings and \nloan associations have failed. Our two largest housing GSEs are \noperating under Federal Government conservatorship.\n  Our commercial banking sector has avoided collapse only through the \ninfusion of hundreds of billions of dollars in equity support from the \nU.S. Treasury and massive liquidity support from the FDIC and the \nFederal Reserve. And despite these interventions, some of our largest \ncommercial banks continue to face an uncertain future and dozens of \nsmaller commercial banks have failed. Our insurance sector has been \nbadly damaged. The largest insurance organization in the United States \nhas been nationalized to avoid collapse. Other major insurers have \nreceived billions of dollars from the Treasury.\n  The magnitude of the events of the past 2 years strains \ncomprehension. I believe what we have seen over the last couple years \nis the equivalent, in economic terms, of the 100-year flood. Millions \nof families and retirees have lost their financial security. Millions \nof people are out of work. Each day, we read about more layoffs, more \nlosses, more bankruptcies, and more bank failures. We call this a \nfinancial crisis, but for the American people it is a very personal \ncrisis of lost homes, derailed careers, forgone education, deferred \nretirement, communities less cared for, and at its core, the confidence \nof the American people has been shaken.\n  This crisis has uncovered the flaws of our current regulatory model \nand has revealed a shadow financial system which lies beyond the \ncurrent regulatory structure.\n  We all share the hope that we will soon return to healthy, \ncompetitive financial markets and a vibrant economy. We have seen some \npositive signs that markets are stabilizing. But for our long-term \nprosperity, we do need a new model. What has happened to our financial \nsystem and our economy should not have happened. We must find and adopt \nreforms that will ensure that it never happens again.\n  We cannot shrink from the needed reform because it will be difficult \nor because some will oppose it. Right now there is a lack of faith in \nour system or its long term prospects. You can see that in our bond \nmarkets. We are not turning to the financial sector as a source of \npositive innovation so that the broader economy can grow. You can see \nthat in the lack of credit in our markets, and the jobs lost every \nmonth.\n  To innovate and create jobs, not only in the financial system but \nacross our whole economy, we do need comprehensive reform. Quality will \nattract capital, but only change will restore the quality of our \nmarkets.\n  This is the fundamental challenge facing the Banking Committee, of \nwhich I am a new member. However, before I joined this Banking \nCommittee, before I joined this August body, I did spend 20 years in \nthe private sector around the financial system, taking companies \npublic, looking at and learning about the markets. So I came to this \nbody, I believe, with some background. But only since that time have I \nlearned how complex the problems and the challenges are of trying to \nget financial reregulation or financial reform right.\n  Since joining the Banking Committee, I have been working to educate \nmyself, meeting with a range of experts to learn more about the issues \nand to collect their thoughts on potential solutions to financial \nreregulation. There are a number of things we must do, including \nproviding full regulatory coverage for all markets, ending too big to \nfail with a robust resolution authority, and ending regulatory \narbitrage.\n  Today I would like to speak about one issue I discussed at length \nwith these experts--systemic risk regulation. I hope, in the coming \ndays, to come back to the floor and discuss other parts of securities \nand banking regulation.\n  ``Systemic risk'' is a term that, quite candidly, probably most of us \neven around the financial markets had not even heard of or thought very \nmuch about until the last couple years. Obviously, systemic risk is not \nthe only area we need to address, but it is an area in which the \ncurrent system has unequivocally failed.\n  Systemic risk is a tricky concept. Systemic risk is not a specific \nkind of risk at all. It is a catchall phrase that includes risks of all \nkinds, united only by the possibility that if left uncontrolled, they \ncould have consequences for entire markets or even our entire financial \nsystem. Counterparty exposures can present systemic risk. So can \ninterest rate shifts. So can bad laws and regulations. Because they \ncome in all shapes and sizes, we should not expect to control systemic \nrisks with a rigid, one-size-fits-all approach.\n  Our current system has failed to provide checks and balances and has \nreplaced healthy competition with a system where a handful of firms are \ncalled too large to fail, and these so-called too-large-to-fail firms \ncan threaten the safety of the entire system and, unfortunately, enjoy \nan implicit or even now even more explicit government guarantee that \ndestroys any notion of market competition.\n  Secretary Geithner and Professor Summers have proposed empowering the \nFederal Reserve to manage systemic risk. But as I have discussed this \napproach with a number of experts, they have raised a number what of \nwhat I think are very serious and legitimate concerns.\n  My primary concern with placing this added new responsibility with \nthe Federal Reserve is structural. There are already tensions between \nthe Federal Reserve's responsibilities for the conduct of monetary \npolicy and its responsibilities for bank supervision. No less an \nauthority on this matter than Paul Volcker told the Joint Economic \nCommittee last year that broadening the Federal Reserve's \nresponsibilities ``would be a way of destroying the Federal Reserve in \nthe long run, because it does need independence.'' Adding this \nadditional responsibility on the Federal Reserve, I believe, is a step \ntoo far.\n  My other concern is rooted in the governing philosophy of this \ncountry, which I think has, quite honestly, served us well. That \nphilosophy is that too much economic power placed in one place puts our \nsystem of government at risk.\n  Our Founding Fathers opposed that concentration of power, economic or \notherwise, and favored a system of checks and balances. Thomas \nJefferson famously wrote that ``[t]he Central Bank is an institution of \nthe most deadly hostility existing against the principles and form of \nour Constitution.'' That is why America, unlike so many European \ncountries, never created a single, all-powerful national bank. We have, \nconsequently, even since that time, resisted creating that all-powerful \ncentral bank. The experience of countries which have concentrated too \nmuch power in one entity I think should serve as cautionary tales.\n  Also, we should not ignore that the Fed has had some responsibility \nfor systemic risk regulation under the current structure. Over the \ncourse of the past year, we have seen the Federal Reserve and the \nTreasury strike private deals with our largest and most powerful \nfinancial institutions--deals that might have protected the \nshareholders and creditors of those banks, but, consequently, by those \nactions, put smaller and less powerful and often better run \ninstitutions at a competitive disadvantage and undermining the long-\nterm vitality of our financial system.\n  An old African proverb says that when elephants dance, the grass gets \ntrampled. We have a trampled grass problem at this point, and I don't \nthink we can solve it with bigger elephants, whether those bigger \nelephants are regulators or institutions. If we do not give the Federal \nReserve the responsibility for systemic risk regulation, what should we \ndo instead?\n  I believe the answer to this question has two parts. The first part \nis that many systemic risks already lie squarely within the \nresponsibilities of the day-to-day financial regulators. We did not \njust discover systemic risks. We have been discovering them for \ngenerations. We have passed laws to deal with them, and we have \nentrusted those laws to the administration of substantial regulatory \nagencies.\n  We need to make sure our current regulators, the folks who, for the \nmost of the last century, have done their jobs well, have clear \nmissions, including managing risks within their regulated institutions \nand markets, and we\n\n[[Page S6637]]\n\nmust ensure that these regulators do their jobs.\n  But that is only half the problem. Even if we get the day-to-day \nprudential regulator to be more efficient in evaluating particular \ninstitutions' risk profile, we have to recognize that some part of \nsystemic risk may lay outside of the regulator's day-to-day \nresponsibilities and actually fall between the cracks of our existing \nregulatory system.\n  Working with folks across the financial spectrum, they have suggested \nthe creation of a systemic risk council. I don't mean to claim on this \nfloor that a systemic risk council is a silver bullet, but it avoids \nthe pitfalls of entrusting the systemic risk responsibility in one \nagency that already has responsibilities and can be a potential source \nof conflict. Instead, a council can see across the horizon and gather \nall the information and expertise can flow to it, thereby addressing \nour stovepipe problem of our various regulatory agencies and making \nsure, as well, by having this council, it would have the intrinsic \nconflicts that would come if you also have to have responsibility for \nmonetary policy. Making sure we have this council would also avoid the \nvery real challenge of regulatory capture. Let me briefly outline this \nconcept.\n  Our belief would be the systemic risk council would consist of the \nTreasury Secretary, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and the heads \nof the major financial regulatory agencies. It would be charged with \nthe responsibility for working to improve our understanding and control \nof systemic risks and, in a narrow set of circumstances or emergencies, \nit would have the ability to act.\n  People would say: What does this look like? It builds on the model of \nthe President's working group on financial markets. The idea is, the \nsystemic risk council would have an independent chair appointed by the \nPresident and approved by the Congress and supported by a permanent \nstaff. The best analogy of the systemic risk council might be the \nresemblance it might bear to the National Transportation Safety Board \nor the National Security Council. Just as the NTSB leaves rulemaking on \na day-to-day basis to the FAA, the systemic risk council would leave \nmost of the day-to-day rulemaking to the financial regulatory agency.\n  I understand criticism of the council's approach today is we don't \njust want a debating society at moments of crisis. That is why it needs \nthis independent chair, independent staff, and resources. We must \nensure it could act.\n  It would have the authority to review every bit of information that \nthe individual, prudential, day-to-day Federal regulatory agencies \npossess, to require those agencies to collect information from the \ninstitutions they regulate.\n  It would also have, as I mentioned, an independent staff capable of \nanalyzing this data, understanding how the pieces of the regulatory \nsystem work together, and then at that council level, at that staff \nlevel, feed that information up to the council so it could identify \nweaknesses or gaps within our system or potential systemic risks that \nmight be arising outside the purview of the independent Federal \nregulatory agency.\n  The council would also have the authority to require the financial \nregulators to develop clear, written plans for dealing with potential \nfinancial crises. In effect, it would have the potential to ask any \ninstitution to come forward with a winddown resolution plan for its \nparticular circumstances. These plans would be created in advance of \nany crisis, maintained and even simulated from time to time to make \nsure they are adequate.\n  Again, if we put in place these kinds of credible plans to handle the \npotential failure of every systemically important financial \ninstitution, then we will no longer have the excuse that we have \nconstantly heard over the last few months: Gosh, it is tough we have to \nput up this much public money to support this institution, but it is \ntoo big to fail.\n  As we have seen time and again in this crisis, because we didn't have \nthese plans in place, unfortunately, the American taxpayers have taken \non unfounded, quite honestly, financial risk in shoring up these \ninstitutions.\n  Because a systemic risk council would not directly interact with our \nmajor financial institutions on a day-to-day basis, it would be less \nprone to capture than the financial regulatory agencies. During normal \ntimes, the council could help to determine how to regulate new products \nand markets in order to minimize regulatory gaps, regulatory arbitrage, \nand the blind spots that currently exist in our system. As we know at \nthis point, too many of those blind spots exist and have allowed the \ncreation of some of the financial products that led to the financial \nmeltdown we have seen.\n  The council will not identify firms that are too big or too large to \nfail but instead will work to prevent firms from becoming too large to \nfail. It would do this specifically in two ways.\n  First, it would have the authority to establish systemwide, \ncounterparty exposure limits, increased capital requirements, reduced \nleverage, and strengthened risk management requirements--all of these, \nin effect, to put not an absolute prescription but at least barriers on \nthose institutions that choose to get so large that they might \npotentially fall into that ``too big to fail'' category.\n  Second, it would ensure that the resolution authority would be able \nto resolve any institution that got to that size and then potentially \nposed a systemic risk.\n  In a crisis, the council could work with its member organizations to \npromote coordinated and comprehensive responses. The systemic risk \ncouncil's responsibilities would be clear and focused. Systemic risk \nwould be its only job.\n  Using a council, prudential regulators would remain empowered and \nresponsible for systemic risks that arose in their jurisdiction. If \nthey encountered a risk that extended beyond their authority they could \ngo to the council to ensure coordinated and comprehensive action. On \ntop of that, if the evidence of risk is spread across different \nagencies like pieces of a puzzle, the council would have the \ninformation and expertise to spot it, and the ability to coordinate \naction in order to address it.\n  What I am proposing today boils down to a simple, commonsense idea. \nIf we want to do something constructive about systemic risk, we should \ncreate a mechanism that can help ensure our regulators do their jobs on \na day-to-day basis, avoid conflicts of interest, and fully leverage our \nexisting regulatory resources to promote the proactive identification \nand control of systemic risks.\n  Let me acknowledge at the outset that there are many details that \nstill need to be worked out, and I will, as I mentioned, have a series \nof other ideas of how we can modernize our financial system in the \ncoming weeks ahead. But I believe the general approach I have outlined \ntoday, in terms of a systemic risk council, hopefully, will spark the \ndebate so we do not simply default to further empowering an already \nextraordinarily important and critical institution, in terms of the \nFederal Reserve, without a thorough debate about this issue.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the problems with the current state of health \ncare in America are well known. Republicans do not need to be convinced \nof a case for reform. We hear from our constituents who have concerns \nabout their own health care dilemmas and those of their neighbors and \nwe all agree the millions of uninsured Americans need access to high-\nquality health care. But though we all agree on the need for reform, we \nhave disagreements on how best to accomplish our goals.\n  Republicans favor a patient-centered approach that allows individuals \nto choose their own insurance, keep it if they like it, and never have \nto get permission from a Washington bureaucrat to get the test or \ntreatment their doctor says they need. President Obama wants Congress \nto pass a sweeping new Washington-run health care system that we \nbelieve would jeopardize the care most Americans already have. Such a \nsystem would likely lead to the collapse of private insurance and \nreplace it with an enormous Washington bureaucracy that would ration \nhealth care for all Americans.\n  I have discussed my concerns that Washington-run health care would \ndiminish Americans' access to quality\n\n[[Page S6638]]\n\ncare, lead to denials, shortages, and long delays for treatment, and \nwould give power to Washington to dictate what medications and \nprocedures Americans could get and when they could get them. It is \nalready in the works.\n  A recent National Institutes of Health project description states:\n\n       Cost-effectiveness research will provide accurate and \n     objective information to guide future policies that support \n     the allocation of health resources for the treatment of acute \n     and chronic conditions.\n\n  ``Allocation of health resources'' is a euphemism for rationing--\ndenying care based on cost. To that end, Senator McConnell and I have \nintroduced legislation that would bar the Federal Government from using \ncomparative effective research to delay or deny care to anyone. That is \na bare minimum that we should do to prevent rationing of care. Our \nbill, incidentally, is endorsed by the American Medical Association.\n\n  Mr. President, government-run and rationed approaches have caused \nmuch pain to people in other countries--in Canada, for example. In an \narticle for the Manhattan Institute's City Journal, Dr. David Gratzer \nwrote of the long waits that Canadians endure for just about any \nprocedure or diagnostic test: seniors who lay on stretchers for 5 days \nin a hospital waiting room; a 3-year wait list for a hernia operation; \na 2-year delay for sleep apnea treatment; a year-long delay for a hip \nreplacement, and so on.\n  It is one thing for Washington to take over car companies. Getting it \nwrong there usually would not lead to life-or-death problems. But it is \nan entirely different matter to allow Washington to go into business as \nthe Nation's health care provider. Who is going to protect you when \nthey get it wrong? To whom are you going to appeal?\n  In his health care speeches, President Obama has stressed that if you \nlike your current health care, you can keep it if you don't want to get \non the Washington-run plan. That sounds all well and good, but it would \nnot play out that way, according to health experts.\n  The Lewin Group produced a study that shows, if enacted, the \nPresident's public option--the government-run insurance company--would \ndisplace 119 million happily insured Americans. Their companies could \ntake the easy route and simply pay a fine, tell their employees to sign \nup for Washington-run health care, even if they do not want it. How \ndoes that square with the President's assurances that patients will get \nto keep what they have?\n  Most insured Americans like their coverage. A May 14 Rasmussen poll \nshows that 70 percent of Americans rated their coverage as excellent--\n70 percent. Another 23 percent rated it as fair. So most folks are \nhappy with their current insurance and would not appreciate being \npushed into Washington's health care bureaucracy, with all of its \ncomplex rules and hours of waiting on hold and webs of impenetrable \nbureaucracy.\n  Then there is the matter of cost. How much will it cost to add 47 \nmillion people to the health care rolls? Who will pay? To not know the \nanswers to these questions is to be fiscally irresponsible. Yet we \ndon't even have precise estimates from the Congressional Budget Office \nwhose responsibility it is to tell Congress how much legislation will \ncost the taxpayers. The preliminary estimate of the Congressional \nBudget Office shows that only a part of the Health, Education, Labor \nand Pensions Committee bill will cost $1 trillion, but it only reduces \nthe number of uninsured by 16 million people--$1 trillion for 16 \nmillion people. The remainder of the bill, by the way, has not even \nbeen scored.\n  My math shows that is $62,250 per person, and that only covers about \none-third of the 47 million who are said to lack insurance. It doesn't \ntake into account the estimated 119 million insureds who will be \nswitched from the private coverage they currently have to the \ngovernment program. So what will the total cost be?\n  Mr. President, there is another concern that hasn't been much \ndiscussed but needs to be raised. It is a major concern for America's \nseniors. Over the weekend, the administration proposed trimming \nMedicare's budget to pay for this new public plan. This is exactly the \nwrong thing to do and can only mean one thing: rationing and waiting \nlists for America's seniors. Seniors want Congress to strengthen \nMedicare, make it more efficient and, importantly, make it solvent. \nThey want it to serve as intended--to pay for the health care of \nseniors. They do not want its resources drained to pay for a massive \nnew plan for the 47 million uninsured, plus the 119 million currently \ninsured but soon to be displaced into the government system.\n  Seniors rightly ask: Won't the new demands for care greatly diminish \nthe quality of care seniors now receive and lead to dangerous waits for \ntests and treatment?\n  President Obama has acknowledged that Medicare's promises of \ntreatment are financially unsustainable. We learned recently that \nMedicare's liability; that is, the amount of benefits promised that are \nnot covered by taxes, is $38 trillion over the next 75 years. One \nlesson we can draw from Medicare's financial troubles--and veterans \nhealth care, for that matter--is that health care plans run by \nWashington bureaucrats are not very efficient or cost effective. They \nhave no incentive to be. In fact, the economic principle of ``the \ntragedy of the commons'' applies. Since the money doesn't belong to any \none individual or group, no incentive exists to be cost efficient, to \neliminate waste, or to streamline the bureaucracy.\n  Another way to say it is: Who washes their rent-a-car?\n  Mr. President, seniors and veterans, private insurance holders, small \nbusinesses, and employers that insure their workers, the uninsured--in \nfact, all Americans--should be given the chance to review, discuss, and \nprovide feedback on any legislation as important as this health care \nreform. It will affect the way we all get our health care.\n  I look forward to an ongoing dialogue about the health care reform \nthat we all want, but we must not rush to churn out and then hastily \npass a plan that will lead to rationing and the displacement of \nmillions from the insurance they currently enjoy. It is of paramount \nimportance that the principles of quality care, choice, freedom, and \nputting patients first triumph in the reform we all want.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I think virtually everybody in our \ncountry understands that America is in the midst of a major health care \ncrisis. We have 46 million Americans without any health insurance. We \nhave even more who are underinsured, and we have, in addition to all of \nthat, some 60 million Americans--20 percent of our population--who do \nnot have access to a doctor on a regular basis. The result of that \nparticular fact is that we lose over 18,000 Americans every year, \nAmericans who die needlessly--who should not die--because they do not \ngo to the doctor when they should and get the treatment they need. That \nis six times every single year the number of people we lost on 9/11--\npeople who should not die because they do not have access to a doctor.\n  Mr. President, in the midst of this horrendous lack of coverage--\nunique, I should mention, among major nations on Earth--the United \nStates spends far more per capita on health care than any other nation, \nand those costs continue to soar. So when people make international \ncomparisons of the United States with other nations on how well or not \nwell we are doing--and that is good to do--we should always remember we \nare spending almost twice as much per capita on health care as any \nother country. There is certainly something wrong and dysfunctional \nabout a system which spends so much and yet leaves so many people \nuninsured, underinsured, or without access to a doctor or a dentist or \nother preventive health care.\n  At $2.4 trillion and 18 percent of our gross domestic product, the \nskyrocketing cost of health care in this country is unsustainable both \nfrom a personal point of view--the needs of individual Americans--and \nalso from a\n\n[[Page S6639]]\n\nmacroeconomic perspective of what is happening to our entire economy. \nAt the individual level, the average American today spends about $7,900 \nper year on health care. Can you believe that? Close to $8,000 per \nperson on health care?\n  We all know folks who are out there making $20,000, $25,000, or \n$30,000 a year, and we are spending, on average, almost $8,000 per \nperson.\n  Despite that huge outlay--unprecedented in the world--a recent study \nfound that medical problems contributed to 62 percent of all \nbankruptcies in 2007. I should add that most of the people who went \nbankrupt had health insurance. They had health insurance. But what they \nhad was inadequate health insurance.\n  From a business perspective--as opposed to the needs of an \nindividual--General Motors spends more money on health care per \nautomobile than they do on steel--more money on health care than on \nsteel--which might lead us to understand why they are where they are \ntoday.\n  Small business owners in the State of Vermont and around this country \nare forced to divert hard-earned profits into health coverage for their \nemployees rather than new business investments. Many small businesses \nare trying to do the right thing for their employees, spending more \nthan they have for health coverage so they do not have the money \navailable to make the investments they need to make their businesses \ngrow. The result of that, of course, is as a result of soaring health \ncare costs--going up 10, 15, 20 percent a year--many small- and medium-\nsize businesses are cutting back drastically on their level of health \ncare coverage or, in some cases, they are doing away with it entirely.\n  More and more businesses in America are simply saying: I cannot \nafford to provide health insurance to my workers. Despite all of that--\nthat we spend almost twice as much per person on health care as any \nother country--people will say: Since you spend all that money, the \nresults must be great. But that is not the case. The bottom line is we \nget poor value for what we spend.\n  According to the World Health Organization, the United States ranks \n37th in terms of health system performance. We are far behind many \nother countries in terms of such important indices as infant mortality, \nlife expectancy, and preventable deaths.\n  So we are spending almost double what any other country on Earth is \nspending. We have 46 million without any health insurance, we have more \nwho are underinsured, we have thousands who die because they cannot get \nto a doctor, and then in many other health care outcomes we are behind \nmany other countries around the world--some of which are spending far \nless per person than we are spending.\n  It seems to me, as the health care debate in Congress heats up, we as \na nation have to ask two fundamental questions. Different people will \nhave different answers to them, but here are the two questions I think \nwe have to ask: First, as a nation, should all Americans be entitled to \nhealth care as a right? That is the first question.\n  Honest people will have differences of opinion. Some people will say: \nYou know what. Some people have big cars, some people have small cars. \nSome people have big houses, some people have small houses. Some people \nhave good health insurance, some people have no health insurance. That \nis the way life goes. Some people hold that view.\n  I do not. I think in America we should understand that every single \nperson should be entitled to quality, comprehensive, affordable health \ncare. In fact, I think most Americans believe the same thing.\n  Second, if we are to provide quality health care to every man, woman, \nand child in this country, how do we do it in a way that does not \nbankrupt the Nation? How do we do it in a cost-effective way? Those are \nthe two questions that we have to ask ourselves.\n  I think the answer to the first question is pretty clear and, in \nfact, it is one of the reasons Barack Obama was elected President of \nthe United States. Most Americans do believe all of us should have \nhealth care and nobody should be left out of the system. We have a hard \ntime understanding that Joe Smith who works for one company has good \nhealth care, and his neighbor, Mary Evans, who works for another \ncompany, does not have any health insurance at all. What sense is that?\n  I think as a nation we are coming to understand all of our people are \nentitled to health care as a right, as Americans, and the challenge we \nface is how do we do it in a cost-effective way. In that regard, I \nthink--and I obviously speak just for myself--the evidence is \noverwhelming that we must end the private insurance company domination \nof health care in our country and move toward a publicly funded, \nsingle-payer, Medicare-for-all approach. I think the evidence is \noverwhelming that if you want universal, comprehensive, quality health \ncare for all people, that is actually the only way you can do it.\n  Our current private health insurance system is the most costly, \nwasteful, complicated, and bureaucratic in the world. Just today--not \nyesterday, just today--I spoke to an individual who has a law degree, a \nvery smart guy. His wife has a Ph.D. They went through the Federal \nemployee benefit package. Between a Ph.D. and a lawyer, they spent \nhours trying to figure out what particular program could work best for \nthem.\n  All over America, people are spending countless hours trying to \nfigure out: Is it this program? Is it that program? I am young; I might \nnot get sick but, you know, I have a history of cancer in my family. \nShould I get comprehensive? Should I get a high deductible? If I am a \nsmall business I can only negotiate this, if I am General Motors I can \nself insure. What should I do?\n  The answer is, there are 1,300 separate private insurance companies \nin America peddling thousands and thousands of different plans. Let's \nbe very clear, if in fact, anybody has not caught on yet; the function \nof a private health insurance company is not to provide health care. It \nis to make as much money as possible. That is what its reason for \nexistence is about.\n  In fact, when a private health insurance company denies health care, \nit makes more money. In fact, the record is pretty clear that private \nhealth insurance companies have given bonuses to people, their own \nemployees, who are successful in throwing people off of the insurance \npolicy because those people were running up high health care costs. \nThus, we have the insane phenomenon of something called a preexisting \ncondition.\n  What a term that is, preexisting condition--meaning a person cannot \nget coverage for the illness they need to be covered for most. The \nperson who had cancer 3 years ago and is worried about a recurrence of \ncancer--sorry, we can't provide insurance to you.\n  Then you have other circumstances where somebody gets really sick, \nruns up a high medical bill, and the insurance company says: Oh, we \ndon't want to continue your policy because we had to pay out so much \nmoney. We want to go to some young guy who can run the marathon and \npromises us never to get sick. Those are the guys we want to cover.\n  This is an insane system. It is a wasteful system. It is a \nbureaucratic system. How many people are spending half their lives on \nthe telephone, arguing with insurance companies to cover the claims \nthey thought they were covered for? So people on one end of the phone \nare spending huge amounts of time and money doing that, and at the \nother end of the phone we are paying someone to tell us we don't have \ncoverage for what we thought we did have coverage.\n  With thousands of different health benefit programs designed to \nmaximize profits, not provide health care, private health insurance \ncompanies spend an incredible 30 percent of each health care dollar on \nadministration and billing, exorbitant CEO compensation packages, \nadvertising, lobbying, and campaign contributions.\n  One of the lovely things the insurance companies do and the \npharmaceutical companies do is, after they rip you off and they make \nhuge profits, they take some of that money to hire all these fancy guys \nin Washington, DC, to protect the status quo.\n  The bottom line is--and all of the evidence makes this clear--public \nprograms such as Medicare, Medicaid, the SCHIP Program, and the \nVeterans' Administration are administered for far less money than are \nprivate health insurance companies.\n  In recent years, while we have experienced an acute shortage of \nprimary\n\n[[Page S6640]]\n\nhealth care doctors, nurses, and dentists, we are paying for a huge \nincrease in health care bureaucrats and bill collectors. Here is the \ninsanity, the dysfunctionality of the current system: We do not have \nenough primary health care doctors, we don't have enough dentists, we \ndo not have enough nurses, we do not have enough medical personnel--we \ndon't have enough of those people, but over the last three decades we \nhave seen an explosion in the number of health care bureaucrats and \npeople who are bill collectors.\n  To my mind, I would rather see somebody hired who can help somebody \nget well or prevent disease, not somebody on the telephone billing or \narguing about what we owe or do not owe. The fact is, over the last \nthree decades the number of administrative personnel has grown by 25 \ntimes the numbers of physicians--25 times more bureaucrats than \nphysicians. We do not need health care bureaucrats pushing paper. We \nneed primary health care doctors delivering babies, taking care of the \nelderly, and taking care of those people who are sick.\n  Not surprisingly, while health care costs are soaring, so are the \nprofits of private health insurance companies. From 2003 to 2007, the \ncombined profits of the Nation's major health insurance companies \nincreased by 170 percent. Health care costs are soaring, profits of the \nhealth insurance companies are also soaring, and while more and more \nAmericans are losing their jobs and health insurance, the top \nexecutives in the industry are receiving lavish compensation packages. \nIt is not just William McGuire, the former head of United Health, who \nseveral years ago accumulated stock options worth an estimated $1.6 \nbillion.\n  OK, $1.6 billion a few years ago for the CEO of United Health and we \ndo not have enough money to provide health care to people who are \nuninsured? It is not just the head of Cigna, Edward Hanway, who made \nmore than $120 million in the last 5 years. The fact is, CEO \ncompensation for the top private health insurance companies now \naverages over $14 million apiece.\n  Moving toward a national health insurance program which provides \ncost-effective, universal, comprehensive, and quality health care for \nall will not be easy. It is the major political struggle that we face \nright now. The powerful special interests--and they are all over \nCapitol Hill. The lobbyists are here. In the midst of the recession, I \nwould suggest that while unemployment in general is soaring, my strong \nguess is that unemployment for health care lobbyists and pharmaceutical \nindustry lobbyists is going down. Those guys have plenty of work, and \nthey are making plenty of money. I am quite confident that those \nlobbyists will wage an all-out fight to make sure we maintain the \ncurrent dysfunctional system which enables them, the insurance \ncompanies and the drug companies, to make millions and billions of \ndollars in profits.\n\n  In recent years they have spent hundreds of millions on lobbying, \ncampaign contributions, and advertising with unlimited resources. We \nhave no reason to believe they will not continue to spend as much as \nthey need. But at the end of the day, as difficult as it may be, the \nfight for a national health care program will prevail. Decade after \ndecade, all over this country people fought for a civil rights movement \nwhich said we will judge human beings not on their color but on their \ncharacter, who they are as a human being. The struggle for women's \nrights went on decade after decade before women had the right to vote \nor had a seat at the table.\n  In my view, the struggle for health care is the civil rights struggle \nof today, and I believe 30 years from now, 50 years from now, people \nwill look back and say: I don't believe there was a time in America \nwhere people who got sick couldn't find a doctor, where people went \nbankrupt because they committed the crime of being sick or having \ncancer. I do not believe that.\n  Our job is to bring that day when every American has health care as a \nright in a comprehensive, cost-effective manner. Our job is to make \nthat day come sooner rather than later. If we work together and if we \nhave the courage to stand up to the big money interests who want to \nmaintain the status quo, we, in fact, can do that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/16/senate-section/article/S6640-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6640-S6646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TREASURY BOND YIELD UPDATE\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, about 2 weeks ago I spoke on the floor \nabout the unprecedented budget deficits this country is now facing and \nthe fact we are spending money we do not have. I specifically discussed \nthe impact that is having on Treasury yields.\n  What we know is that President Obama's budget has been scored by the \nCongressional Budget Office, which is our group, and I think they do a \npretty good job. They take pride in being independent and fair. The \nhead of it was selected by the Democratic majority in the Senate. It is \ncertainly not a Republican organization. They are just fair, trying to \ndo the best they can to try to calculate the numbers.\n  What they calculated was that at the rate of deficit spending we are \nnow undertaking, the total American debt will double in 10 years, from \n$5.7 trillion to over $11 trillion. In 10 years it will triple to $17 \ntrillion.\n  That is a lot of debt. You might ask how do you do that? How do you \nspend more money than you take in? The way we do it is we borrow it, \njust like other people do. The Government borrows it. The way it does \nis, it puts out an auction or sale of Treasury bonds or bills, T-bills \nthey call them, and people buy those things if they choose to do so, \nand the Government pays them a certain interest rate, whatever the \ninterest rate is at the time.\n  On short-term debt instruments--short term are under a few months--\nthose interest rates are still rather low because people are panicked \nover the economic situation. They are afraid to put their money in the \nstock market, so they bought Treasury bills. Other people around the \nworld did too. They are not getting much interest, but they believe the \nGovernment will pay them back in dollars, eventually.\n  So what has been happening to the 10-year Treasury bill, one of the \nfoundations of our borrowing, is the rate has continued to go up. Two \nweeks ago, I pointed out that the 10-year Treasury yield had increased \n54 percent this year, at that time from 2.4 percent in January, to 3.7 \npercent. Barron's, a major financial publication, predicted a few weeks \nago that Treasury yields could top 4 percent this year.\n  Well, guess what. Treasury yields topped 4 percent last week. The \nWall Street Journal in a front-page article on June 11 said that the \n10-year Treasury yield briefly hit 4 percent yesterday afternoon before \nclosing at 3.94 percent. That would be a 67-percent increase in the \nTreasury bill interest rate just this year.\n  Why are the rates going up? It seems there is some disagreement \nbetween Washington and Wall Street. The Wall Street Journal article \nsays this:\n\n       Many policymakers see the rise in Treasury yields as a sign \n     that investors are optimistic that the economy is on the \n     mend. But many market participants say higher long-term bond \n     yields indicate investors are increasingly worried about \n     inflation.\n\n  So I interpret that to mean that the Washington politico crowd, \nlooking to see a positive vision here, say it is because the economy is \ndoing better. And that could be a factor. But the folks on Wall Street, \nwho are buying the T bills, say differently.\n  Is the government responsible for this increase in interest rates? It \nseems that is a real possibility. The Federal Reserve is creating \ninflation concerns through its massive asset purchase program. The Fed \nplans to purchase $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities, $200 \nbillion in Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae debt, and $300 billion in \nTreasury bills this year. Since there are not enough people who want to \nbuy the Treasury bills, the Federal Reserve is stepping in and buying \nthem in an attempt to keep the rate down.\n  So far the Fed has purchased $481 billion in mortgage-backed \nsecurities, and $130 billion in Treasuries. The intention of the \nprogram is to reduce the Treasury yield and interest rates, but it may \nbe backfiring. A Forbes.com article on May 28 quotes former Federal \nReserve Governor Lawrence Meyer on how this kind of action could \nactually have a different impact. It could actually cause inflation and \neven cause a rise in the Treasury bond yield.\n  This is what he said:\n\n       This can become counterproductive. To the extent that you \n     stoke inflation fears and you\n\n[[Page S6641]]\n\n     get an inflation risk premium built in [to the bond yield] \n     you can't ease that away. You do have to be careful and more \n     measured than that.\n\n  In other words, when there is a perception which may be reality that \nnot enough people are willing to buy these Treasury bonds at lower \nrates, because they think even 4 percent may not be enough because they \nmay fear that inflation is going to be 6 or 7 percent down the road, \nthey do not want to lock themselves in for 10 years at a 4-percent \ninterest rate that is below the inflation rate. So the Fed steps in and \nbuys some of this to keep it low, and that may be having the perverse \nincentive of causing a belief to occur in the marketplace that \ninflation is on the way, and scares people even more.\n  Also let me say this about the voluntary purchase of Treasury bills \nby citizens of the United States, people in China, the Middle East, and \naround the world. They do not have to buy Treasury bills. We are going \nto be offering amounts, these kinds of bills, in volume we have never \noffered before in the history of the Republic.\n  So the question is, who wants to buy them? Who wants to hold a \nmortgage on the United States? What if we inflate our currency? Maybe 4 \npercent is not enough. Maybe they want more. Maybe China, which had a \nhuge trade surplus a few years ago, is deciding they are not going to \nbuy so many Treasury bills in the United States. Maybe they decide they \nneed to invest in their own economy, which is not doing as well as it \nhas done in the past.\n  The same about the Middle East. They used to have huge reserves of \nAmerican money as a result of the high price of gasoline and price of \noil on the world market. That price dropped some. So perhaps they do \nnot have as much money to buy our Treasury bills either.\n  So who is going to buy them? We are not talking about a little bit, \nwe are talking about going from $5 trillion in total debt today to $11 \ntrillion in 5 years, and $17 trillion in 10 years. So we are talking \nabout over $10 trillion in new debt we have to sell to someone in the \nworld market.\n  Also, what is the impact of the Federal Reserve, that entity we have \ncreated by law, when they buy Treasury bills? What occurs there? I \nremember hearing Mr. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve Chairman, talking \nabout this on ``60 Minutes.'' Some of you may have seen him being \ninterviewed on that program. I went back and had the transcript of that \nprogram called up, and we reviewed it. It is what I thought he said. In \nresponse to reporter Scott Pelley's question, Chairman Bernanke said \nabout the Fed's programs:\n\n       It's much more akin to printing money than it is to \n     borrowing.\n\n  Mr. Pelley replied:\n\n       You've been printing money?\n\n  And Mr. Bernanke replied:\n\n       Well, effectively.\n\n  And he added:\n\n       And we need to do that, because our economy is very weak \n     and inflation is very low.\n\n  So if you want to know the definition of printing money, that is it. \nSome people say that is not a fair thing to say; we are not printing \nmoney. Mr. Bernanke says we are printing money. He is the Chief of the \nFed. He is the guy who does it.\n  Why does this matter to the average American? Even those who are not \nplanning to buy a Treasury bill any time soon will be affected. That is \nbecause mortgage interest rates--what we pay to borrow money to buy a \nhouse with--track the 10-year Treasury yield. So as the 10-year \nTreasury goes up, mortgage rates go up too, and it is much harder for \npeople to buy a home or to refinance. Or if you want to sell a home, it \nis harder for the person who wants to buy it to borrow the money. He \nhas got to pay considerably more for a house in the interest rate. In \nfact, according to the Wall Street journal, 30-year mortgage rates have \ngone up 16 percent in the past 2 weeks, from 5 percent to 5.79 percent. \nThis is the money, when you go out, you have to borrow money to buy a \nhouse with. What we need to happen in America is people buying homes \nand taking them off the market.\n  There is a huge difference between 5 percent and 6 percent. On \n$100,000, 5 percent interest would be $5,000 a year you pay in \ninterest; $400-plus a month. On 6 percent interest, it is $6,000 a \nyear, or $100 more a month on $100,000. For a $200,000 mortgage it \nwould be twice that. It would be $2,000 or $3,000 more a year you would \npay in interest alone because the rate went up a bit.\n  We were hoping that the interest rates would stay low to encourage \npeople to buy homes, encourage people to refinance, and be able to live \na better life. The Wall Street Journal article said that this \nincrease--from 5 to almost 6 percent--will cut the number of people \nwith an incentive to refinance their homes and save money by paying \nless interest by half.\n  Let me mention one more thing. One of the things that is interesting \nin all of this is the impact our spending has had on the economy. We \nall hoped it would have a pretty dramatic impact. But it is not being \nnearly as effective as people thought. Even I thought we would have \nsome impact in the short term.\n  But I believe that CBO is correct. When we passed the $800 billion \nstimulus package that was supposed to put money out into the economy to \nbuild roads and bridges, we found out only 4 percent of the money went \nto roads and bridges, 96 percent went to other kinds of government \nspending, but that $800 billion was supposed to create a good bit of \njobs and get this economy moving.\n  I want to say things are not going as well as we would like. I remain \noptimistic. The Fed is doing all of these things, the spending is \ncoming along. Surely we are going to have a benefit from that in the \nnear term.\n  But this shows the deficit surge. The deficit, by which I mean how \nmuch more money we are spending than we take in. This goes through \nMarch of this year. You can see how the deficit is increasing, how much \nour shortfall is. And by March, it has already topped $953 billion.\n  That is more than twice the biggest deficit President Bush ever had. \nAnd he was criticized for his deficit. That is twice. We have not \ngotten to the end of the fiscal year yet.\n  What the CBO projects--this is our own Congressional Budget Office, \ntheir numbers, and they are running the tally of how much we are \nspending and how much is coming in. They calculate by the end of the \nyear the deficit will be $1.8 trillion, which is about four times the \nhighest deficit President Bush ever had.\n  I say that because people say: Well, President Bush had deficits too. \nYes, he did. A lot of that was not justified, in my opinion. But we \nnever had deficits like this in the history of the American Republic. \nAnd you do have to borrow this money.\n  This is in March. By September 30, we are looking at a deficit of \n$1.8 trillion this year alone. And the whole debt of the American \nRepublic, since its founding, is about 5.7 trillion before this year \nstarted. What is that? That is one-third in 1 year.\n  We hoped that spending and this activity would help improve the \nunemployment rate. But you can see, it is going up. It was 6.6 and it \nhas gone up to 8.5. Well, it is not 8.5 percent. That was in March. The \nlatest number is 9.4 percent.\n\n  So I do not know how much real boost we have gotten from this \nreckless spending. So much of it we knew was not job creating, and we \ndebated that. It was clear that a lot of this was the kind of spending \nthat would not create jobs. As I said, you heard about roads and \nbridges. Well, only 4 percent of the money went to roads and bridges. A \nlot of it went to all kinds of programs that are not job-creating \nprograms. So I am concerned about that.\n  This is a vibrant country, and I think we have the capability of \nbouncing back from hard times. I will just say, we are at 9.4 percent \nunemployment. Unemployment in the early 1980s, under President Reagan, \nwhen they had to break the back of surging inflation, they broke the \nback of 13-percent inflation. Unemployment hit 10.8 percent. So it is \nnot as bad as it was in the 1980s, and we bounced back from that, and \nwe can bounce back from this.\n  But I have to say to my colleagues, if we do not have fiscal sanity \nin how we do our business, if we do not have a possibility of showing \ngrowth in revenues from economic growth and the containment of \nspending--and our deficits are surging for as far as the eye can see--\nthen I am not sure we will have the kind of healthy, robust resurgence \nwe would normally expect to occur after a recession.\n\n[[Page S6642]]\n\n  Look at these numbers. This is very disturbing. We borrow all this \nmoney, and we spend it today. I know a great lawyer who has written a \nbook, ``The Case for Character.'' He said: This is a question of \ncharacter, what I am going to talk to you about here. It is a question \nabout the moral character of the Congress and the President of the \nUnited States and how we approach our duties in a responsible manner.\n  In 2009, this year, we expect that the taxpayers of the United \nStates--on the $5.7 trillion we have borrowed--will pay $170 billion in \ninterest. That is a total loss. That is money that goes out to people \nwho have loaned us money. It is interest, just like on your credit card \nor on your mortgage--$170 billion. And look how it goes up. This is a \nchart I have of the interest each year. And 10 years from now, if we \nfollow the President's budget, it will be $806 billion, according to \nthe Congressional Budget Office.\n  All right. That is just money. How much is that? How much is $806 \nbillion? Let me tell you what we do today. The Federal highway bill is \nabout $40 billion. The Federal aid to education in all its forms is \nabout $100 billion. So now, since we take money from the future, and we \nspend it today in a reckless way, I think, to get some sort of hope for \nstimulus we have not seen much of, we are going to saddle the people in \n2019 with an annual debt payment of $806 billion--10 times the Federal \neducation budget, 20 times-plus the highway budget. So we do need to be \nfocused on this issue.\n  Let me say one more thing. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the deficit is supposed to drop down in 2 or 3 years, but \nalready it looks as if we will not meet those numbers. The economy is \nnot as strong as they were projecting. It was a rosy scenario. But they \nproject about $600 billion is what the deficit will be 2 or 3 years \nfrom now--30, 40 percent higher than anything President Bush ever had--\n$600 billion. Then it starts up again, and it goes up to the 10th year. \nAnd in the 10th year, under the scoring of the President's budget by \nthe Congressional Budget Office, the deficit will be over $1 trillion \nin that year--$1.1 trillion.\n  That is not sustainable. And they are not projecting an economic \nslowdown. They are projecting modest growth over that period of time, \nsolid growth for the last 5 years during this period. If we have a \nrecession, presumably the deficits would be even larger than that.\n  I guess I would say to my colleagues, this is a matter we need to \nstart thinking about. It cannot be ignored. Nothing comes from nothing. \nIf you get money to spend today, you must spend every dollar of it with \ncare because you have borrowed it from the future, and somebody has to \npay it back. It is not free money. Maybe it feels as if it is free \ntoday because we did not have to pay higher taxes or we did not cut \nsome other spending program to get the money to do what we would like \nto do with it. We just borrowed it. But borrowing has consequences.\n  Every year from here on out, that $806 billion will go up probably \nbecause in 2019 they expect not a balanced budget but an annual deficit \nof that year to be over $1 trillion. So the thing is going to continue \nto worsen. If we do not make some changes, this will continue.\n  By the way, this does not include the spending we are talking about \non health care, which you heard a speech about earlier. I will say this \nabout it: the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee has \nreleased details on a bill. According to CBO, what they have released \nso far scores at $1 trillion. Oh, we just got another $1 trillion not \ncalculated in these numbers. ``Well, everybody just needs to have \nhealth insurance.'' So who is going to pay for it?\n  We have to be smart. We have to see how we can improve health care, \nget more people insured, create a better system with the absolute \nlowest possible cost because we cannot continue this kind of reckless \nspending. Instead of learning a lesson from the already surging \ndeficits, we seem to be blithely going on with a huge new spending \nprogram on top of that.\n  The American people, I think, are uneasy. They think we are out of \ncontrol up here. They do not think they have ever seen anything like \nthis: deficits the likes of which we have never seen in peacetime.\n  The U.S. Government passed a bill last fall that was supposed to buy \ntoxic mortgages from banks, and now they bought a controlling share in \nGeneral Motors. How did this happen? Did Congress ever vote on that? \nNo. We did not vote on it. They took advantage of the language in that \nbill, which I was opposed to and voted against. One of the reasons I \nopposed it was because it was too broad and an unbelievable abrogation \nof congressional power to the Secretary of Treasury, who had already \nhelped lead us into financial catastrophe. But people in panic, they \nall voted and gave him this power.\n  Did anybody know we were going to use that money to buy an automobile \ncompany? No. In fact, Secretary Paulson at one point was asked at a \nhearing: What about buying stock in banks? This was supposed to be \nhelping the banks. In the House committee, he said, no, we did not want \nto buy stock in banks. But a week after that bill passed, he was buying \nstock in banks. And they have not yet begun to buy toxic mortgages. \nMaybe they will begin soon. They say they have a plan now.\n  I am saying the American people are right to be concerned about the \nreckless, irresponsible behavior of this government in Washington. I \nhope they will continue to watch what is going on. I hope the American \npeople will speak out and let the folks up here know they expect us to \ndo something more than deal with the problem next week. They expect us \nto be thinking about the long-term health of the American economy.\n  I heard a well-known financial expert say: Well, you know what? I am \nnot saying there will be reckless inflation occurring, although some \npeople are predicting that. He said: After President Reagan broke \ninflation and we got the economy on a sound track, the economy grew at \nabout 3 percent a year and inflation was about 2 percent. He said: What \nI am worried about is that what we are going to see in the next 10 \nyears is inflation at about 3 percent and growth at about 2 percent. \nThat is not good. You want your growth to exceed the inflation rate.\n  I do not know what will happen. I cannot predict it. But I know this: \nWe are going to have less money to spend on the things we need because \nwe are going to have to be paying a huge amount in interest. Those are \nreal concerns. This matter is not going away. I believe the American \npeople are becoming more and more attuned to these matters. That is \nwhat the Tea parties were about--a sort of spontaneous reaction by the \nAmerican people saying: What are you guys doing up there? Surely you \nknow this is not the way to handle America's business.\n  I will say, I am going to continue to report on things that are \ndeveloping. Surely we will begin to see some improvement in the \nunemployment rate and maybe some economic growth in the weeks to come. \nYou would normally expect that when you pump the kind of money we have \npumped into this economy. But in the long run, this begins to drag down \nthe gains you make in the short run. That is what I am saying.\n  In fact, the Congressional Budget Office said--analyzing the stimulus \npackage alone--it would increase our GDP, our growth for 2 to 3 years, \nbut if you took that over 10 years, the economy would grow less over \nthe 10 years than if we had no stimulus package at all. That is because \nwhen you borrow money, not only do you have to pay interest on it, but \nit crowds out borrowing from the private sector.\n  If a corporation wants to borrow money through the issuance of bonds, \nthey are having to compete with the Treasury bills that are now paying \n4 percent, and they will have to pay a good bit more because people \nthink the Treasury bills are better, safer investments than some \nprivate corporate bonds. It hurts the private sector because now they \nare paying considerably higher interest rates to get people to loan \nmoney to them instead of loaning it to the U.S. Government.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the opportunity to share this. I \nhope and pray we can all figure out a way to work together to do a \nbetter job of being stewards of this economy. It is a high \nresponsibility we have. No one knows everything. No one has a perfect \nanswer to it. We are going to have to go through some tough times. I \nthink that is clear, and there is no need to sugar-coat that.\n\n[[Page S6643]]\n\n  I am not blaming President Obama for everything that has gone wrong, \nand he inherited so much of this. I have talked about Secretary \nPaulson. I do not think Secretary Geithner is any better. He was \nSecretary Paulson's top adviser when they came up with this plan last \nfall.\n  But, at any rate, we need to get our heads together and know one \nfundamental thing: Nothing comes from nothing. There is no free lunch. \nIf you borrow money to spend today, there will be a cost in the future, \nand those costs can outweigh the benefits that are occurring today.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, we live in a world divided. International \ntension, mistrust, and even war too often separate Nation from Nation. \nBut every 2 years, 10,000 athletes from more than 200 countries come \ntogether to celebrate the human spirit. They meet in competition, \narriving on the world stage from all five inhabited continents. Each of \nthese five continents is represented by a single-colored circle--a ring \nintertwined with four others to form the familiar symbol worn by every \nOlympic athlete. The Olympic and the Paralympic games are a powerful \nforce for world unity and a boon to any city that hosts them.\n  In 2016, the summer games will bring millions of dollars and the \ninternational spotlight to one of four world cities. Selected by the \nU.S. Olympic Committee from a broad field of candidate cities, Chicago \nis one of only four finalists for the 2016 Olympics, along with Madrid, \nRio de Janeiro, and Tokyo. The International Olympic Committee will \nmake their final selection this October.\n  We must work hard to bring the Olympic games back to the United \nStates. There is no greater honor than representing your country on the \nworld stage. I am convinced there is no greater city in the world than \nChicago.\n  As President Obama and I can both attest, Chicago is a diverse and \ninclusive city. Situated on the banks of the beautiful Lake Michigan, \nit is the jewel of the Midwest. Chicago has always been a global leader \nin culture, art, architecture, commerce, sports, and even cuisine.\n  The Olympic spirit is alive and well in Chicago. The Chicago 2016 \nOlympic Committee recognizes the importance of the games and in \nrenewing old friendships around the world, as well as establishing new \nones. This ideal and the value of the ``friendship through sports,'' is \nat the heart of the city's Olympic bid. It is a city I am proud to call \nhome, and it showcases much of what makes this country so great. That \nis why it is the ideal site for the Olympic and the Paralympic games.\n  For the athletes, world-class training facilities and event locations \nwould be very close together, allowing for convenience and ease. For \nvisitors, outstanding public transportation and modern infrastructure \nwould make all events readily accessible and easy to attend. For \nresidents of the city and people across the United States, Chicago \nwould shine on the world stage, and millions of dollars would pour in \nfrom across the globe.\n  Especially if we pass S. 1023, promoting travel to the United States \nand relaying better information to visitors, Chicago will be the clear \nchoice for the International Olympic Committee in October.\n  This important legislation, known as the Travel Promotion Act of \n2009, would create a nonprofit corporation as well as a government \nOffice of Travel Promotion. These organizations would work together to \nencourage business, leisure, and scholarly travel to the United States, \nrestoring important components of our struggling economy.\n  Travel and tourism, which generates as much as $1.3 trillion in the \nUnited States every year, has been on the decline since 2001, although \nthe same industries have grown in many other countries. We must act \nswiftly to protect the 8.3 million American jobs that are directly \nrelated to travel and tourism. This means welcoming more overseas \nvisitors each year--visitors who already spend $142 billion inside the \nUnited States on an annual basis.\n  An increase in international tourism would increase the profile of \nthe Chicago Olympic bid. The 2016 Olympics, in turn, would generate \neven more international tourism in Illinois and across the country. S. \n1023 would help this massive influx of visitors travel into the United \nStates with ease. This would create jobs, increase tax revenue, and \nbuild stronger friendships across the globe.\n  There are few international spectacles as singular and as inspiring \nas the Olympic and the Paralympic games. A force for unity in a world \ndivided, these competitions have the power to bring us together as one \npeople, celebrating the human spirit with one voice.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Dorgan and Senator Enzi in \nsupporting S. 1023. This legislation would help to bring visitors from \nall over the world to the United States and would also help bring the \n2016 Olympics to Chicago, IL, because I have a special interest in \nbringing those Olympics to my hometown.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, every year thousands of people \ntravel to Colorado to enjoy some of the most exciting recreation \nopportunities in the world. Although my home State is known for its \nskiing, we are a summertime destination with 4 national parks, 5 \nnational monuments, and 41 State parks for travelers to enjoy. Visitors \ncan go white-water rafting down the Colorado River or hike and climb in \nthe magnificent Rockies. We have Wild West ghost towns, historic \nrailroads, and American Indian cultural sites to visit.\n  Obviously, travel and tourism is an incredibly important sector of \nColorado's economy. For every $1 million spent in Colorado by domestic \nand international travelers, 11 jobs are created. Travel and tourism \ngenerated $13.7 billion in revenue in 2007 in Colorado alone, and \nalmost 150,000 Coloradans owe their jobs to that industry.\n  That is why today I rise to express my support for the Travel \nPromotion Act of 2009. I am a proud cosponsor of this bill, which has \nstrong support from Members across the aisle, and I look forward to \nvoting for its passage later this week.\n  While I have listed just the beginning of the numerous reasons to \nvisit Colorado, the truth is that our tourism and travel industry has \nsuffered in recent years. Many people do not realize it, but across our \ngreat country our tourism industry never fully recovered after \nSeptember 11, particularly when it comes to travel from outside our \ncountry into the United States. That compares with this fact: Travel \naround the world has dramatically increased in the past decade while \ntravel to the United States has dropped. In 2008, we welcomed fewer \nvisitors to our country than we did in the year 2000. Why? Part of the \nproblem is that visitors from overseas have been confused by the new \nprocedures for entering our country. Foreign visitors also say they \ndon't think we are making much of an effort to attract international \ntravelers. That is costing communities across our country billions of \ndollars in lost revenue. In fact, one study suggested over $182 billion \nhas been lost since September 11, 2001.\n  In my State of Colorado, the travel and tourism industry is a strong \neconomic engine. It is one we have to keep strong and in which we have \nto invest. Part of that is in changing the perception that the United \nStates is not interested in hosting foreign tourists. That is the point \nof this legislation. The legislation before us would help revive \ninternational travel to the United States so we can get that economic \nengine revved up to its full capacity.\n  The purpose of the bill is to sell travel to the United States to \noverseas tourists, including areas that are not well-known \ndestinations. Of course, the Presiding Officer's State is also a place \nwhere we want to attract people to its wonderful beaches and wonderful \nhistorical sites in the great State of Delaware.\n  Let me tell you quickly some of the details in this legislation. It \nwould establish a Corporation for Travel Promotion which would be an \nindependent,\n\n[[Page S6644]]\n\nnonprofit corporation governed by an 11-member board that the Secretary \nof Commerce would appoint. It would create an Office of Travel \nPromotion in the Department of Commerce to develop the programs to \nincrease the number of international visitors to the United States. And \nit would set up a travel promotion fund which would be financed by \nprivate-public matching dollars. Much of the cost would be borne by \ninternational travelers who would pay a $10 fee collected through the \nelectronic system for travel authorization.\n  Other countries are spending billions of dollars on travel \npromotions. Those of us who sponsored this legislation and hopefully \nwill vote for it overwhelmingly at the end of this week think we should \nstay competitive with other countries. The Travel Promotion Act would \ndirectly contribute to the economic recovery of our travel and tourism \nindustry. It would spur job growth, and it would contribute to the tax \nbase of local, regional, and State governments, many of which are \nforced to make, as we know all too well, drastic cuts in this tough \neconomic time.\n  As well, before I close, I wish to mention that there are \nnonfinancial benefits to international travel as well. I wish to quote \nthat great American Mark Twain. He said:\n\n       Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-\n     mindedness.\n\n  America's image in the world, as we know, has suffered greatly over \nthe past several years, but travel to our country, to America, is one \nof our most effective tools of public diplomacy. Studies have shown \nover and over that when people come to our country, they return home \nwith a very positive view of not just our country as it is described in \nthe books but the landscapes and the people and the way we live our \nlives. In addition to helping strengthen our economy, this bill would \nstrengthen our place in the world.\n  I end by thanking and acknowledging the chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, Senator Rockefeller, the ranking member, Senator Hutchison, \nand Senator Dorgan for quickly bringing this legislation to the floor. \nI look forward to the passage of the Travel Promotion Act so we can \ncontinue to get travel and tourism and, of course, our economy back on \ntrack.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, once tourists come to West \nVirginia, they often return. From the Appalachian Trail to the \nMonongahela National Forest, the beauty of our State is unparalleled \nand our people are welcoming.\n  Tourism in West Virginia also creates jobs. As a result, our State \nspends money to promote West Virginia in the surrounding States as a \ntourist destination. But we surely would welcome more international \ntourists as well.\n  Increasing overseas travel and tourism is a shovel-ready economic \nstimulus that will create thousands of jobs across the country--\nincluding West Virginia. With the dollar at a low compared to other \ncurrencies, America is a bargain. We are open and ready for business. \nUnfortunately, the rest of the world doesn't know it.\n  Compared to other countries, the United States fails to effectively \nadvertise and promote itself overseas as a tourism destination. In \n1992, the United States attracted 9.4 percent of all international \ntourists; in 2007, the United States attracted only 6.8 percent. Since \n2000, the United States' share of international travelers has declined \nby 20 percent.\n  Meanwhile, the rest of the world is promoting itself--often employing \nthe best Madison Avenue techniques used for marketing heart medications \nand luxury cars. We all see enticing television advertisements to visit \nItaly, Greece, Jamaica, Ireland, Canada, Australia and Brazil. But few \nresidents of those countries see advertisements enticing them to come \nto the United States--and to spend their money in the United States.\n  If the United States had simply kept pace with global travel trends, \n58 million more overseas travelers would have visited the United States \nbetween 2000 and 2008. Those travelers would have generated 245,000 \ntourism jobs in 2008 alone.\n  The average overseas visitor to the United States spends $4,500 per \nvisit. That means every 23,000 overseas visitors pump $100 million into \nthe U.S. economy.\n  We have spent billions of dollars to prevent the collapse of \nindustries and billions of dollars to put people to work. But today, \nthrough the Travel Promotion Act of 2009, just $10 million will plant \nthe seeds for leveraging private sector investment to increase the \nnumber of U.S.-based tourism jobs.\n  Americans always have had a healthy skepticism about the role of \ngovernment--what it should do and what it shouldn't do. To promote \ntravel and tourism, we have long thought that the private sector--the \ncompanies that make money from tourism--should promote themselves. And \nsome of the larger private sector players have promoted their specific \ninterests overseas.\n  But a private sector effort to fund a general ``Come to America'' \ncampaign targeting overseas travelers has never fully materialized. \nWhen a resort or theme park spends advertising money overseas, they \nwant the viewers to visit their destination, not just the United \nStates. Some of our larger States promote themselves overseas. But, as \nyou would expect, the advertisements entice foreigners to visit their \nStates.\n  As a result, potential tourists overseas may not be aware that the \nUnited States has far more to offer than California, New York, and \nFlorida. They likely have never heard of hiking, rafting, or fishing in \nthe mountains of West Virginia. For anyone who has not enjoyed those \nactivities in my State, you are really missing something special.\n  Because the hotels and tourist destinations of States like West \nVirginia cannot effectively launch their own international promotional \ncampaigns, we must find a mechanism to pool and leverage resources so \nthat these States become part of the international tourism economy.\n  After the terrorist attacks of 2001, the subsequent security measures \ndeterred overseas tourists. Many of those entry problems have been \ncorrected now. But the negative perception still remains. Potential \nforeign tourists still are reluctant to deal with what they believe \nwill be a difficult time entering the United States. No private sector \ncompany--and certainly not the hotels and tourist destinations in the \nStates I have mentioned--will spend their own money to promote the \nimproved process for entering the United States. Only a national, \ncoordinated campaign--with some help from the Federal Government--can \naccomplish that goal.\n  We have occasionally appropriated one-shot advertising campaigns to \npromote the United States overseas. But the Travel Promotion Act of \n2009 will create a sustained and stable public-private sector \npartnership in which Federal seed money is leveraged to increase \nprivate investment to promote tourism overseas.\n  The bill would establish a travel promotion fund that is capitalized \nby a $10 fee paid by foreign travelers from visa-waiver countries. The \nbill would require the travel industry to match those contributions--50 \npercent in 2011 and 100 percent thereafter. The fund would receive $10 \nmillion in Federal seed money for 2010. The new fee for foreign \ntravelers would cumulatively provide the means to lure them to the \nUnited States, but is too small to have any impact on an individual's \ndecision whether to come to the United States.\n  The funds would be used for overseas advertising campaigns to promote \ntravel to the United States, including to areas not traditionally \nvisited by overseas tourists. More importantly, the advertising \ncampaigns would educate potential foreign travelers about U.S. visa and \nentry policies. Removing fears about entering the United States would \ndramatically increase tourism among overseas residents who might \nconsider a range of vacation choices. If foreign tourists better \nunderstand U.S. entry and visa policies, the more likely it is that \nthey will come to the United States--and the more likely it is that \nthey will spend their money here, creating the jobs we so desperately \nneed.\n  Drug companies and luxury automakers spend billions of dollars on \nadvertising for one reason: it works. The State of Florida estimates \nthat its own State travel promotion campaign returns $3 in increased \nsales tax revenue for every dollar spent on promotion. The countries \nadvertising foreign tourist destinations on American television\n\n[[Page S6645]]\n\nevery night would not spend the money to do it but for one reason: it \nworks. The United States--with so many spectacular destinations--must \nembark on its own worldwide promotion program because it will work.\n  A sustained and stable tourism promotion program is a small \ninvestment that will generate huge dividends when foreign tourists \nspend their money in the United States, generating jobs and local \nrevenue. Foreigners visiting the first time have the potential to \nbecome repeat visitors and will tell their friends to visit as well.\n  In addition to stimulating jobs, we will improve America's image \naround the world through tourism. People who visit the United States \nare more likely to have a favorable opinion of America when they return \nhome. Developing that kind of good will in a changing world makes \ntravel promotion worthwhile.\n  I would like to thank the sponsors of this bill: Senator Dorgan, \nSenator Inouye, Senator Reid, Senator Klobuchar, Senator Begich, \nSenator Mikulski, Senator Bennet, Senator Udall of New Mexico, Senator \nUdall of Colorado, Senator Ensign, Senator Martinez, and Senator \nVitter.\n  America is open for business. The people who work in our tourism \nindustries are ready to work. Now we need to tell the world.\n\n\n                            vote explanation\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on vote No. 208, had I been present for \nthe vote, I would have voted aye on the motion to invoke cloture on the \nmotion to proceed to the Travel Promotion Act of 2009, S. 1023.\n\n\n                       Jefferson Award Recipients\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise to honor this year's winners of \nthe annual Jefferson Award for Public Service and particularly four \nwinners from my home State of Delaware.\n  The Jefferson Awards were created in 1972 to serve as a kind of Nobel \nPrize for voluntarism and community service in America. Named for our \nthird President, whose embodiment of our Nation's spirit of community \nand service continues to inspire, these awards are presented annually \nfor both national and State winners.\n  The mission of the State Jefferson Awards is to recognize unsung \nheroes in our communities who give their time and their care in service \nto others. On the national level, Jefferson Awards are bestowed upon \nthose who have contributed significantly to advancing these principles. \nPast winners include Colin Powell, Bill and Melinda Gates, Oprah \nWinfrey, and Sandra Day O'Connor.\n  This year, four outstanding Delawareans have won Jefferson Awards. \nThey have contributed to voluntarism in the ``First State'' through \ninnovative programs and a dedication to inspiring their fellow citizens \nto service.\n  Elaine Chester, of Wilmington, has won a Jefferson Award for creating \na program through the Delaware Division of Family Services to help low-\nincome children receive new, wrapped holiday gifts. She matched local \nchildren in need with Delmarva Power employees interested in sending \ngifts.\n  Over the last few years, under Elaine's leadership, this program has \nexpanded to become one of the largest corporate gift drives in \nDelaware. It benefits hundreds of children annually, including those \nwho are terminally ill. Since its expansion to nursing homes, the \nelderly now receive gifts from Delmarva Power employees as well.\n  Leonard Young, also of Wilmington, earned his Jefferson Award for his \ntireless promotion of public health and wellness initiatives. His \nencouragement of others to get regular preventive health screenings has \nled many Delawareans to incorporate healthy living into their daily \nroutines.\n  Leonard has spent a great number of hours educating youth about the \ndangers of substance abuse and how to prevent violent behavior in \nrelationships. He is a leader in the community, and his involvement in \nvarious public health endeavors is far-reaching.\n  I am especially proud that this year's national winner of the \nJefferson Award for Outstanding Service by a High School is the \nSalesianum School in Wilmington, DE. Its efforts were led by two \nseniors, Robert Liszkiewicz and Dominic Taglione.\n  The two led their classmates in an effort to increase youth \nvoluntarism, and they gave their time to mentoring local students, \nvolunteering with the Blue/Gold Foundation for Delawareans with \nintellectual disabilities, and helping at the local Ronald McDonald \nHouse for families with children undergoing medical treatment. The \nefforts of Robert, Dominic, and their fellow students at Salesianum \nhave established a lasting program for youth voluntarism based on the \nprinciples of the Jefferson Awards.\n  I am privileged to have the opportunity to meet Elaine, Leonard, \nRobert, and Dominic at a Senate reception today honoring Jefferson \nAward winners from across the country. I hope my colleagues will join \nme in celebrating their achievements, their commitment to serving local \ncommunities, and their embodiment of that greatest American quality of \nservice above self.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           IRANIAN ELECTIONS\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, as Chairman of the U.S. Helsinki \nCommission, which has had decades of experience monitoring election and \npromoting democracy and human rights, I would like to take a moment to \nspeak on a troubling matter that has filled headlines around the world \nin the last few days.\n  We have all seen the images. Violence and mass protests are erupting \nacross Iran following the hasty vote count of a deeply flawed \npresidential election process in that country. Yet another unfortunate \nchapter is unfolding before our eyes that reinforces Iran's record as a \npolice state and totalitarian regime more concerned with keeping its \ntight grip on power than yielding to the will of the people.\n  I stand with President Obama calling for the government to exercise \nrestraint and the violence to end. Regrettably, at least seven people \nhave been killed and countless others injured. We may never know the \ntrue results of this election, given the lack of international \nmonitoring. But what we do know is that in the last few days we have \nwitnessed tens of thousands of Iranians raise their voices in protest \nto ensure that their vote meant something.\n  On Friday, voters in Iran lined up in unprecedented numbers to choose \ntheir next president. I, like many others, was dismayed on Saturday to \nhear the ruling clerics rush to announce that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had \nwon reelection by a large margin. Regardless of the limited official \nscope of his duties, President Ahmadinejad's consistent pattern of \nnoxious remarks and his belligerent attitude inject understandable \ntension around the Middle East and beyond. He has used the presidential \npodium to instigate conflict with the international community, pursue \nacquisition of nuclear weapons, and spew hatred and intolerance toward \nIsrael and the United States.\n  I cannot say and will not say what could have been or should have \nbeen if any other candidate was elected, but there is no doubt \nwhatsoever as to Ahmadinejad's unfitness as a leader.\n  Equally troubling were the almost immediate reports coming from \nTehran and elsewhere around Iran that there were deep flaws in this \nelection. Elections do not equal democracy, nor do they guarantee that \nthe will of the people will be reflected in their government. But this \nwas not a free and fair election from the start.\n  In Iranian Presidential elections, only a select group of candidates \napproved by a 12-person Council of Guardians are eligible to run. The \nIranian regime, headed by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, continues to \nseverely restrict civil liberties including freedom of speech, \nexpression, assembly, and association. Freedom to discuss ideas without \nthreat of oppression is a fundamental human right that is essential to \na government truly reflecting the will of its people. This freedom is \nabsent in Iran. Typically, Iranian elections and public expressions are\n\n[[Page S6646]]\n\ncarefully monitored and manipulated by the ruling regime to prevent \nchallenges to their authority.\n  The last few days seem somewhat different. The tens of thousands of \npeople lining the streets of Tehran--in an incredible rebuttal to the \nruling powers--want to know that the votes they did cast are counted \nproperly. The deliberate lack of transparency in the vote tabulation \nand the blatant attempts to block mass communications among citizens, \nparticularly youth, are too glaring to ignore. Even Supreme Leader \nKhamenei has been forced to backtrack on his immediate approval of the \nresults and has called for at least the appearance of a recount in some \ndisputed areas.\n  Americans know something about wanting to have their votes counted \naccurately. The difference between our two nations: when the results of \na U.S. election were in dispute, the world spotlight shined bright on \nthe process and the people involved in resolving the conflict--\npeacefully. Transparency and openness is not a hallmark of Iranian \nelections.\n  Even before the presidential election took place, Iran's totalitarian \nregime blocked personal communications like texting and access to the \nInternet. Media have been confined to Tehran, if they haven't been \nasked to leave the country. The regime's ongoing attempts to curtail \ncommunication and silence protests--often with brutal force--\ndemonstrate the regime's fear of losing a grip on power.\n  Allegations of a fraudulent vote count are a symptom of a regime that \nhas survived by an authoritarian power structure that oppresses its \npeople. On June 12, the people of Iran did not vote for the Supreme \nLeader of their country. Under the current system, the Supreme Leader \nand his supporters will continue to dictate policy to the President of \nIran, regardless of who that president is and whatever policy decisions \nthe president is authorized to make.\n  The people of Iran want their voices to be heard and they should be \nassured that the world is listening. I urge those in power in Iran also \nto listen and implement the reforms necessary to allow the will of the \npeople to be expressed.\n  I look forward to a future when the people of Iran have an \nopportunity for a free and fair election of leaders of their choosing. \nIt is my sincere hope that one day this vision will be realized, and \nthe voice of the Iranian people will truly be heard.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen.)

Madam President, in December 2008, Senator Bingaman, \nCongressman Meek, and I visited Haiti. We went to see the public \nhealth, economic, environmental, and political situation in that \nimpoverished Caribbean nation.\n  We traveled for hours into rural Haiti to the town of Cange to \nobserve the incredible work being done by Partners in Health providing \nAIDS treatment and teaching mothers with newborns how to purify water.\n  We visited a school in Cite de Solei--a teeming slum in the capital \nPort au Prince--where Father Hagan and the organization Hands Together \nis providing schooling and meals for some of Haiti's most vulnerable \nchildren.\n  Unfortunately, despite these programs and the efforts of U.N. \npeacekeeping forces to bring some measure of security, the living \nconditions for average Haitians remain desperate: It is the poorest \ncountry in the Western Hemisphere, with nearly 80 percent of its \npopulation out of work; one-half of its 8.2 million people live in \nextreme poverty; Haiti's infant mortality rate is the highest in our \nhemisphere; 1 in 10 children dies before the age of 5 due to \nmalnutrition; the HIV/AIDS situation in Haiti is among the most \nfrightening in the world; the average life expectancy of a citizen of \nHaiti is 61 years, the lowest in the region.\n  To add to these already desperate conditions, Haiti has been \ndevastated in recent years by tropical storms and hurricanes. In 2004, \nHurricane Jeanne struck Haiti, killing nearly 3,000 residents, and \ndisplacing over 200,000 more.\n  Last year, the island of Hispaniola, which Haiti shares with the \nDominican Republic, was hit by four major storms. These storms caused \nmassive flooding and landslides that cut off land routes and hampered \nthe delivery of aid to its desperate citizens. Nearly 800 Haitians lost \ntheir lives and as many as 1 million were left homeless.\n  The world quickly responded to these catastrophes with millions of \ndollars worth of emergency food aid and disaster assistance. The United \nStates alone provided $29 million in aid. This assistance helped Haiti \ncope with these immediate challenges.\n  But one of the underlying causes of this devastation--and contributor \nto Haiti's larger challenge with poverty and disease--is the \ndeforestation of the country's once plentiful tropical forests.\n  This satellite image provided by NASA shows the stark difference \nbetween the amount of forest cover in Haiti and the Dominican \nRepublic--countries that share the same island.\n  The black line shows the border between the two nations. When you \nlook at the lush green of the Dominican Republic and compare it to the \nstark desolation on Haiti's side of the border, it is easy to see why \nHaiti is so much more vulnerable than the Dominican Republic to the \ndevastating effects of soil erosion, landslides, and flooding.\n  It was not always that way. In fact, 85 years ago Haiti's tropical \nforest covered 60 percent of the country. Today less than 2 percent of \nthose forests remain. In the past 5 years, the deforestation rate has \naccelerated by more than 20 percent.\n  Some 30 million trees are cut down every year in Haiti. This \nstaggering level of deforestation happens because 60 percent of the \npopulation of Haiti relies on charcoal produced from cutting down trees \nfor cooking fuel and two-thirds rely on inefficient, small-scale \nsubsistence farming for survival.\n  While understandable, this deforestation has had terrible, unintended \nconsequences. The soil erosion that has resulted from cutting down all \nof these trees has had the perverse effect of substantially reducing \nHaiti's already scarce agricultural land and leaving what remains less \nproductive.\n  This soil erosion also makes the island more vulnerable to floods and \nmudslides like the ones that devastated the country last year. The \nreality of this effect is that far more Haitians than Dominicans lost \ntheir lives and their homes during last year's storms.\n  Haiti's tropical forests, if protected and re-grown, would fight the \ndestructive effects of soil erosion. Saving old and growing new \ntropical forests would help protect Haiti's freshwater sources from \ncontaminants, safeguard Haiti's remaining irrigable land, and save \nlives during hurricane season. Helping Haiti deal with its \ndeforestation is something we can help do.\n  Today, Senator Brownback joins me in introducing the Haiti \nReforestation Act of 2009 in an effort to attack this deforestation. \nThe bill aims to end within 5 years deforestation in Haiti and restore \nwithin 30 years the extent of tropical forest cover in existence in \nHaiti in 1990.\n  While it is important to start putting trees in the ground, this bill \nis about more than just planting trees. Our government has tried that \napproach in the past and has failed miserably.\n  This bill brings the expertise of the both the US AID and the \nInternational Programs Office of the US Department of Agriculture's \nForest Service to help Haiti manage in a measurable, verifiable, and \nreportable way its conservation and reforestation efforts. It does this \nin three ways.\n  First, the bill empowers these agencies to work with the Haitian \nGovernment to develop Haiti-appropriate forest-management ideas that \ncan be implemented in an incremental way.\n\n[[Page S6647]]\n\n  Second, the bill seeks to bring to Haiti market-based reforestation \nprojects that have been successful in other regions of the world. These \nprojects are successful because they share certain characteristics. \nThey: secure the cooperation and engagement of local communities and \norganizations; provide incentives to protect trees through sustainable, \nyet income-generating growth; and provide hands-on management and \noversight of replanting efforts.\n  Conservation groups such as Planting Empowerment, which is doing just \nthis type of work in Panama, provide a model of success and this bill \nwill encourage such groups to bring their efforts to Haiti.\n  Third, the bill expands the ability of conservation groups to work \nwith the Haitian Government and international creditors to trade \nHaiti's international debt for revenue in what are known as debt-for-\nnature swaps.\n  Groups such as Conservation International, World Wildlife Fund, and \nThe Nature Conversancy have successfully used this mechanism globally \nto save other tropical forests--this bill will encourage such groups to \nbring their efforts to Haiti.\n  Preservation of what remains of Haiti's tropical forest, and helping \nre-grow some of what has been lost, has numerous benefits for all of \nus, not just for Haiti. Tropical forests: play a critical role as \ncarbon sinks to reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere; harbor a \nmajor portion of the Earth's biological and terrestrial resources; and \nprovide habitats for an estimated 10 to 30 million plant and animal \nspecies, including species essential to medical research and \nagricultural productivity.\n  But attacking the desperate effect of deforestation in Haiti is the \nmain purpose of this bill. As Haiti's Prime Minister, Michele Pierre-\nLouis, recently said:\n\n       The whole country is facing an ecological disaster. We \n     cannot keep going on like this. We are going to disappear one \n     day. There will not be 400, 500 or 1,000 deaths [from \n     hurricanes]. There are going to be a million deaths.\n\n  We must act to ensure that that day never comes. I urge my colleagues \nto support the Haiti Reforestation Act of 2009.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/16/senate-section/article/S6647-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   234TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE U.S. ARMY\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, on June 14, we celebrate the 234th \nbirthday of the U.S. Army. For more than two centuries, the Army has \nfought to preserve the principles of democracy both here in the United \nStates and around the globe.\n  It was 234 years ago today that the U.S. Army was established to \ndefend our Nation. From the Revolutionary War to operations in \nAfghanistan and Iraq, our soldiers have served with honor and a deep \ncommitment to our Nation's core values and beliefs.\n  In 1946, during an Army Day speech in Chicago, GEN Dwight D. \nEisenhower said:\n\n       This day of tribute to the men and women of the United \n     States Army is a day of national rededication to the ideals \n     they served so well. The Army believes in strength without \n     arrogance; in firmness without discourtesy; in loyalty \n     without servility. It lives with pride in its cherished \n     traditions of service to our commander-in-chief and to the \n     people to whom it belongs.\n\n  This quote is as true today as it was then. Our all-volunteer force \nhas performed superbly during these challenging times and has lived up \nto and exceeded our greatest expectations.\n  This Army birthday is special because it is also the Year of the Non \nCommissioned Officer. Since 1775, the Army has set apart its NCOs from \nother enlisted soldiers by distinctive insignia of grade.\n  Throughout the Army's history, the noncommissioned officer corps has \ndistinguished itself as the world's most accomplished group of military \nprofessionals. Historical and daily accounts of life as an NCO are \nexemplified by acts of courage and a dedication and a willingness to do \nwhatever it takes to complete the mission.\n  I also pay tribute to the families of our Army soldiers who give so \nmuch of their lives for our Nation. The important role families play is \nvital to the Army's success. They have our Nation's deepest \nappreciation for the support and devotion they provide to our men and \nwomen in uniform.\n  Today I wish to celebrate the strength of our Nation and the strength \nof our Army by saluting our noncommissioned officer corps and the \nArmy's soldiers, families and civilians by wishing them a happy 234th \nbirthday!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/16/senate-section/article/S6647-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THANKS TO BERMUDA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, last Thursday Bermuda welcomed to freedom \nfour men who had been wrongly detained at Guantanamo Bay for more than \n7 years. The men are ethnic Uighurs--a minority group from western \nChina that has long suffered discrimination and oppression by China's \nGovernment. Their release is welcome news--our own Federal courts had \ncleared them for release, as did both the Bush and Obama \nadministrations. Bermudian Prime Minister Dr. Ewart Brown and the \nBermudian people have done a humanitarian service, and should be \npraised for it.\n  I strongly support President Obama's decision to close Guantanamo, \nwhich became a rallying cry for al-Qaida and other terrorist groups \nseeking recruits. I am disappointed that the United States did not find \na way to resettle the Uighurs here, as there are Uighur communities in \nseveral States that would have welcomed them and helped them become \nproductive members of society. It would also have been an important \ngesture to other countries that we are asking to accept Guantanamo \ndetainees. All the more reason that we should offer our sincere thanks \nto Bermuda for helping to put this sorry episode behind us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/16/senate-section/article/S6647-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           COMMENDING THE GATTON ACADEMY OF MATH AND SCIENCE\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the State of Louisiana urging Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to maintain the current incentives for the \n     exploration and production of domestic oil and natural gas; \n     to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 15\n\n       Whereas, Louisiana is a key energy state where over three \n     hundred twenty thousand Louisianians are employed in the \n     energy sector, and these jobs support over twelve billion \n     dollars a year in household income; and\n       Whereas, these jobs are from numerous small businesses and \n     include welders, pipe fitters, barge workers, and engineers, \n     and an estimated fifty thousand indirect workers support the \n     energy sector; and\n       Whereas, the current federal budget proposal includes eight \n     separate tax hikes on the energy economy totaling over thirty \n     billion dollars, new fees on energy leases in the Gulf of \n     Mexico, excise taxes on Gulf production, and also repeals \n     several important tax incentives for Louisiana energy \n     producers; and\n\n[[Page S6649]]\n\n       Whereas, ninety percent of domestic oil and natural gas \n     wells are developed by small, independent businesses that \n     would encounter a devastating impact from any change in \n     policy to reduce incentives; and\n       Whereas, these tax increases also reduce our nation's \n     energy security by discouraging new investment in domestic \n     oil and natural gas production and refining capacity and \n     pushing those investments abroad; and\n       Whereas, a reduction in incentives would reduce the amount \n     of domestically produced natural gas and deprive the American \n     people of a clean energy source. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to take such actions as are \n     necessary to maintain the current incentives for the \n     exploration and production of domestic oil and natural gas. \n     Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives, and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-48.

A bill to modify the boundary of the Oregon Caves National \nMonument, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, part of my job as a Senator from a \nbeautiful State like Oregon is to keep that beauty protected for the \nnext generation of Oregonians. Today it is my pleasure to introduce \nthree bills to add environmental protections for three of Oregon's \nspecial natural resources. I have introduced two of these bills before. \nThe Oregon Caves National Monument Boundary Adjustment Act of 2009 and \nthe Lower Rogue Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 2009 were introduced in \n2008 but unfortunately there was not an opportunity to move them beyond \nthe Energy Committee. This year, I look forward to moving these two \nbills forward to final passage, along with a third bill, the Devil's \nStaircase Wilderness Act of 2009. I am pleased to introduce two of \nthese bills with my colleague from Oregon, Senator Merkley. My \ncolleague in the House of Representatives, Representative DeFazio, will \nalso be introducing companion legislation today, joined by \nRepresentatives Blumenauer and Wu.\n  The first bill I am introducing, S. 1270, the Oregon Caves National \nMonument Boundary Adjustment Act of 2009, will expand the boundary of \nthe National Park Service land to create the Oregon Caves National \nMonument and Preserve. Under this bill, the stunning majesty of both \nthe underground and the above-ground treasures found at this National \nMonument site will be protected for future generations.\n  Established by a Presidential Proclamation in 1909, the Oregon Caves \nNational Monument is a 480-acre natural wonder located in the \nbotanically-rich Siskiyou Mountains. It was originally set aside \nbecause of its unusual scientific interest and importance. Oregon Caves \nhas a unique geologic history and is particularly known as the longest \nmarble cave open to the public west of the Continental Divide.\n\n[[Page S6653]]\n\n  A perennial stream, the ``River Styx''--an underground portion of \nCave Creek--flows through part of the cave and is one of the dynamic \nnatural forces at work in the National Monument. The cave ecosystem \nprovides habitat for numerous plants and animals, including some state-\nsensitive species such as Townsend's big-eared bats and several cave-\nadapted species of arthropods found only in only one place on Earth: \nthe Oregon Caves. The caves possess a significant collection of \nPleistocene aged fossils, including jaguar and grizzly bear. In 1995, \ngrizzly bear bones found in the cave were estimated to be at least \n50,000 years old, the oldest known from either North or South America.\n  Today, I am proposing legislation that will enhance the protection \nfor treasures such as these found within the Oregon Caves National \nMonument and that will increase public recreation opportunities by \nadding surrounding lands to the National Park Service site. My bill \nwould expand the park site by 4,084 acres to include the entire Cave \nCreek Watershed, and transfer management of the land from the U.S. \nForest Service to the National Park Service. The newly acquired lands \nwill be designated as a Preserve so that hunters can still use them. In \naddition, my legislation would designate at least 9.6 miles of rivers \nand tributaries as Wild, Scenic, or Recreational, under the federal \nWild and Scenic Rivers Act, including the first subterranean Wild and \nScenic River, the River Styx. This bill would also authorize the \nretirement of existing grazing allotments.\n\n  When the Oregon Caves National Monument was established in 1909, the \nfocus was on the unique subsurface resources, and the small rectangular \nboundary was thought to be adequate to protect the cave. Through the \nyears, however, scientific research and technology have provided new \ninformation about the cave's ecology, and the impacts from the surface \nenvironment and the related hydrological processes. The current 480-\nacre boundary simply cannot adequately protect this cave system. The \nNational Park Service has formally proposed a boundary modification \nnumerous times, first in 1939, again in 1949, and most recently in \n2000. Today, I am happy to again propose legislation to enact that \nboundary adjustment into law.\n  The Oregon Caves National Monument makes a unique contribution to \nSouthern Oregon's economy and to the national heritage. The Monument \nreceives over 80,000 visitors annually and a larger Monument boundary \nwill help showcase more fully the recreational opportunities on the \nabove-ground lands within the proposed Monument boundary. The \nMonument's above-ground lands in the Siskiyou Mountains possess a \nbeauty and diversity that is unique in America, and indeed the world. \nThe Oregon Caves National Monument's approximately 500 plants, 5,000 \nanimals, 2,000 fungi, and over a million bacteria per acre that make \nthe spot have one of the highest concentrations of biological diversity \nanywhere.\n  Expanding the Monument's boundary will also preserve the caves' \nresources by protecting the water that enters the cave. By granting the \nNational Park Service the ability to safeguard these resources, and by \nproviding for a voluntary donation of grazing permits, my legislation \nwill be able to better protect these resources. Over the decades, the \nnumber of allowed livestock has diminished, but the livestock still has \nan impact on the drinking water supply and the water quality of this \nnatural gem. The current grazing permitee, Phil Krouse's family, has \nhad the Big Grayback Grazing Allotment, 19,703 acres, since 1937. Mr. \nKrouse has publicly stated that he would look favorably upon retirement \nwith private compensation for his allotment, which my legislation will \nallow to proceed.\n  The second bill I am introducing is, 1271, the Lower Rogue Wild and \nScenic Rivers Act of 2009, which expands the Wild and Scenic River \nprotections to Oregon's iconic Rogue River and its tributaries.\n  The Rogue River is one of our nation's premier recreation \ndestinations, famous for its free flowing waters and the many rafting \nand fishing opportunities it offers. The headwaters of this great river \nstart in one of Oregon's other great gems--Crater Lake National Park--\nand ultimately empty into the Pacific Ocean near Gold Beach on the \nsouthwest Oregon coast. Along that stretch, the Rogue River flows \nthrough one of the most spectacular canyons and diverse natural areas \nin the U.S. The river is home to runs of coho, spring and fall chinook, \nwinter and summer steelhead, and has the special distinction of being \none of only a few rivers in the country with runs of green sturgeon.\n  The Rogue River received its first protections in the original Wild \nand Scenic Rivers Act in 1968. A narrow stretch of land was protected \nalong the river banks. Since that time, a great deal has been learned \nabout the importance of protecting the tributaries that feed into the \nmain stem of the Rogue. Protecting the Wild and Scenic tributaries to \nthe Rogue River is essential to protecting the backbone of one of \nOregon's most important sport and commercial fisheries.\n  In 2008, American Rivers named the Rogue and its tributaries as the \nsecond most endangered river in the U.S. I'm hoping to change that \ntoday by introducing legislation to protect 143 miles of Wild and \nScenic tributaries that feed the Rogue River with cold clean water. The \nprotected tributaries would include Galice Creek, Little Windy Creek, \nJenny Creek, Long Gulch--and 36 other tributaries of the Rogue.\n  By protecting the tributaries that feed this mighty river, I hope \nthat future generations can enjoy the Rogue River as Oregonians and \nvisitors to our State do today.\n  The third bill I am introducing is, 1272, the Devil's Staircase \nWilderness Act of 2009, which designates approximately 29,650 acres \nsurrounding the Wasson Creek area as Wilderness.\n  Devil's Staircase personifies what Wilderness in Oregon is all about. \nIt is rugged, wild, pristine and remote. So rugged, in fact, that land \nmanagers have repeatedly withdrawn this landslide-prone forest from all \ntimbering activity and intrepid hikers must follow elk and deer trails \nand keep a sharp eye on a compass. The proposed Devil's Staircase \nWilderness is the finest old-growth forest remaining in Oregon's Coast \nRange, boasting huge Douglas fir, cedar and hemlock and a wealth of \nthreatened and endangered species. Wildlife include threatened marbled \nmurrelets and the highest density of Northern Spotted Owls in the \ncoastal mountains.\n  My proposal would not only protect the forests surrounding Wasson \nCreek but would also designate approximately 4.5 miles of Franklin \nCreek and approximately 10.1 miles of Wasson Creek as Wild and Scenic \nRivers. Franklin Creek, a critically important tributary to the Umpqua \nRiver, is one of the best examples of pristine salmon habitat left in \nOregon. Together with Wasson Creek, these two streams in the Devil's \nStaircase area deserve Wild and Scenic River designation by Congress.\n  The ecological significance of this treasure is apparent. The land is \nprotected as a Late-Successional Reserve by the Northwest Forest Plan, \nas critical habitat for the northern spotted owl, and as an Area of \nCritical Environmental Concern by the Bureau of Land Management. \nPreserving these majestic forests as Wilderness for their wildlife and \nspectacular scenery matches the goals of the existing land management \nplans. I look forward to protecting this gem for future generations.\n  Finally, I want to express my thanks to the conservation, recreation \nand business communities of southern and coastal Oregon, and Phil \nKrouse for his strong conservation ethic. All of them have worked \ndiligently to protect these special places. I look forward to working \nwith Senator Merkley, Representative DeFazio, and my House colleagues \nand the bill's other supporters to keep up the fight for these unique \nplaces in Oregon and get these pieces of legislation to the President's \ndesk for his signature.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED:\n  S. 1276. A bill to require investment advisers to private funds, \nincluding hedge funds, private equity funds, venture capital funds, and \nothers to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking. Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\n[[Page S6654]]\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the Private Fund \nTransparency Act of 2009, which requires investment advisers to private \nfunds, including hedge funds, private equity funds, venture capital \nfunds, and others, to register with the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, SEC.\n  The current financial crisis has reinvigorated my long-held concern \nthat the regulation of hedge funds and other pooled investment vehicles \nshould be improved to provide more information to regulators to help \nthem address fraud and prevent systemic risk in our capital markets.\n  Hedge funds and other private investment funds generally operate \nunder exemptions in federal securities laws that recognize that not all \ninvestment pools require the same close scrutiny demanded of retail \ninvestment products like mutual funds. Hedge funds generally cater to \nmore sophisticated investors who are responsible for ensuring the \nintegrity of their own investments, and as a result are permitted to \npursue somewhat riskier investment strategies. Indeed, these funds play \nan important role in enhancing liquidity and efficiency in the market, \nand subjecting them to fewer limitations on their activities has been \nand continues to be a reasonable policy choice.\n  However, the existing regulatory regime for these funds has enabled \nthem to operate largely outside the framework of the financial \nregulatory system even as they have become increasingly interwoven with \nthe rest of the country's financial markets. As a result, there is no \ndata on the number and nature of these firms or ability to calculate \nthe risks they pose to America's broader economy. Over the past decade \nthe SEC has recognized there are risks to our capital markets posed by \nsome of these entities, and it has attempted to require at a minimum \nthat advisers to these funds register under the Investment Advisers Act \nso that SEC staff can collect basic information from and examine these \nprivate pools of capital. The SEC's rulemaking in this area, however, \nwas rejected by a federal court in 2006. As a result, without statutory \nchanges, the SEC is currently unable to examine private funds' books \nand records or to take sufficient action when it suspects fraud. In \naddition, no regulator is currently able to collect information on the \nsize and nature of hedge funds or other funds to identify and act on \nsystemic risks that may be created by these pools of capital.\n  The bill I introduce today is crafted carefully to eliminate these \nregulatory gaps without unnecessarily limiting the beneficial aspects \nof such pools. It would require all hedge fund and other investment \npool advisers that manage more than $30 million in assets to register \nas investment advisers with the SEC. It would also provide the SEC with \nthe authority to collect information from these entities, including \ninformation about the risks they may pose to the financial system. \nFinally, it authorizes the SEC to require hedge funds and other \ninvestment pools to maintain and share with other Federal agencies any \ninformation necessary for the calculation of systemic risk.\n  The financial crisis is a stark reminder that transparency and \ndisclosure are essential in today's marketplace. Improving oversight of \nhedge funds and other private funds is vital to their sustainability \nand to our economy's stability. These statutory changes will help \nmodernize our outdated financial regulatory system, protect investors, \nand prevent fraud. I hope my colleagues will join me in improving the \noversight of hedge funds and other private pools of capital by \ncosponsoring this legislation and supporting its passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1276\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 185\n\n       Whereas Alzheimer's disease is a slow, progressive disorder \n     of the brain that results in loss of memory and other \n     cognitive function and, eventually, death;\n\n[[Page S6655]]\n\n       Whereas Alzheimer's disease is the sixth leading cause of \n     death in the United States and currently affects an estimated \n     2,400,000 to 4,500,000 people in the United States;\n       Whereas the stigma associated with the disease results in a \n     delay of diagnosis, in some cases up to 6 years;\n       Whereas Alzheimer's disease takes an enormous toll on \n     family members, with an estimated 1 in 4 people in the United \n     States acting as caregivers for each individual with the \n     disease;\n       Whereas caregivers for individuals with Alzheimer's disease \n     suffer more stress, depression, and health problems than \n     caregivers of people with other illnesses;\n       Whereas recent advancements in scientific research have \n     demonstrated the benefits of early medical treatment for \n     individuals with Alzheimer's disease, as well as the benefits \n     of early access to counseling and other support services for \n     their caregivers;\n       Whereas with early diagnosis, individuals with the disease \n     can avoid or correct contributing medical problems, commence \n     available therapy, organize current and future care, and \n     enhance self-determination, and caregivers can identify and \n     embrace community support services;\n       Whereas in direct response to research breakthroughs, \n     National Memory Screening Day was established by the \n     Alzheimer's Foundation of America (``AFA'') as a \n     collaborative effort with local organizations and health care \n     professionals across the country to promote awareness, early \n     detection, and early diagnosis of memory impairment, so that \n     individuals can obtain proper medical treatment, social \n     services, and other resources related to their condition;\n       Whereas National Memory Screening Day is held by AFA each \n     November in recognition of National Alzheimer's Disease \n     Awareness Month and on this day, qualified health care \n     professionals administer free, confidential, face-to-face \n     memory screenings at thousands of sites throughout the United \n     States;\n       Whereas memory screening is not used to diagnose any \n     illness but is used as an indicator to determine whether a \n     person might benefit from further examination by a qualified \n     health care provider;\n       Whereas memory screenings are a safe and cost-effective \n     intervention to direct at-risk individuals to appropriate \n     clinical resources, thus reducing the costs of long-term care \n     or hospitalization resulting from undiagnosed complications; \n     and\n       Whereas screenings also greatly benefit those with normal \n     scores, by checking their memory, allaying fears, and \n     promoting chronic disease prevention and successful aging: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the seriousness of Alzheimer's disease and \n     the toll it takes on individuals with the disease and their \n     caregivers;\n       (2) acknowledges that more outreach and education is needed \n     to eliminate the stigma associated with the disease and \n     assist individuals and their caregivers in identifying \n     available screenings, treatments and support;\n       (3) encourages all people in the United States with memory \n     concerns or who want to check their memory to have annual \n     memory screenings at National Memory Screening Day sites or \n     by other qualified health care professionals;\n       (4) congratulates State and local organizations \n     representing individuals with memory problems, caregivers, \n     and health care professionals for their commitment to improve \n     the quality of life of individuals and families confronting \n     dementia by providing optimal care and services; and\n       (5) supports the goals and ideals of National Alzheimer's \n     Disease Awareness Month and National Memory Screening Day, \n     including the development of a national health policy on \n     dementia screening and care.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution in \nsupport of the goals and ideals of National Alzheimer's Disease \nAwareness Month and National Memory Screening Day, including the \ndevelopment of a national health policy on dementia screening and care.\n  As co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer's \nDisease, and as someone with a mother who has been diagnoses with \ndisease, I strongly believe that our health care system needs to do a \nmuch better job of promoting early detection of dementia and other \nmemory problems. Events such as National Memory Screening Day are a \nmeaningful step in raising the awareness needed to move us in that \ndirection.\n  The National Institute on Aging, NIA, estimates that between 2.4 \nmillion and 4.5 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease--a \nprogressive degenerative disorder that attacks the brain's nerve cells, \nresulting in loss of memory, thinking and language skill, behavioral \nchanges, and ultimately, death. Alzheimer's disease is not a normal \npart of aging; however, age is the greatest known risk factor with the \nincidence doubling for every, 5 year interval beyond age 65.\n  Alzheimer's disease exacts a huge toll on caregivers. Nearly 60 \npercent of individuals with the disease live at home under the care of \nfamily members. Caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease face \na variety of challenges and spend more time providing assistance than \ncaregivers of people with other types of diseases, from helping loved \nones with bathing and dressing to managing their legal and financial \naffairs.\n  Alzheimer's disease drains more than $148 billion from the nation's \neconomy each year. If the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease continues \nto increase as expected, the $91 billion spent in 2005 on Medicare \ncosts for care of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and dementia \npatients is projected to increase to $189 billion by 2015.\n  There are serious deficiencies in our current healthcare system \nrelated to diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. A \n2006 editorial in the Journal of the American Geriatric Society \nestimated that missed diagnoses represent greater than 25 percent of \nthe dementia cases and may be as high as 90 percent. This precludes \nmany from getting early treatment which most researchers agree leads to \noptimal therapy with available and emerging medications.\n  Screening is a simple and safe evaluation tool that assesses memory \nand other intellectual functions to determine whether additional \ntesting is necessary. Memory screening can be done in a medical \nenvironment, e.g. dementia clinic, physician's office, or in a \ncommunity setting, e.g. senior center, pharmacy. Such screenings are \nnot a diagnosis, but can indicate whether a complete medical evaluation \nwould be beneficial. Memory can be affected by a number of factors, \nranging from stress, lack of sleep, vitamin deficiencies, depression \nand thyroid problems, to such illnesses as Alzheimer's disease and \nvascular dementia. In general, the earlier the diagnosis, the easier it \nis to treat these conditions.\n  Memory screenings are one of the major focal points of the \nAlzheimer's Foundation of America's, AFA, national initiatives. Since \n2003, AFA has sponsored National Memory Screening Day, NMSD, annually \nin collaboration with community organizations to promote early \ndetection of memory problems as well as Alzheimer's disease and related \nillnesses, and encourage appropriate intervention. It has been held \neach November to coincide with National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness \nMonth. On November 18, 2008, qualified health care professionals at \nnearly 2,200 sites nationwide offered free confidential memory \nscreenings to an estimated 54,000 participants, as well as follow-up \nresources and educational materials about dementia and successful \naging. In 2009, AFA will hold National Memory Screening Day on November \n17.\n  Most people are not inclined to discuss memory concerns with their \nhealth care providers. A survey conducted during AFA's 2007 National \nMemory Screening Day found that 68 percent of respondents had concerns \nabout their memory. However, while more than 44 percent had visited \ntheir primary care physician within the last 6 months, fewer than one \nin four of those with self-identified memory problems had discussed the \nissue with their physician. Primary care providers might be more likely \nto recommend further evaluation if individuals presented their abnormal \nmemory screening results from events like National Memory Screening \nDay. Community screenings such as National Memory Screening Day \ngenerally educate participants about questions to ask their health care \nproviders and empower them to begin a dialogue.\n  With this resolution I hope we can draw attention to these efforts \nand further this important cause. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupport of National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month and National \nMemory Screening Day by cosponsoring this measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/16/senate-section/article/S6655-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6655-S6656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 186--CONDEMNING THE MURDER OF ARMY PRIVATE WILLIAM \n     ANDREW ``ANDY'' LONG AND THE WOUNDING OF ARMY PRIVATE QUINTON \nEZEAGWULA, WHO WERE SHOT OUTSIDE THE ARMY-NAVY CAREER CENTER IN LITTLE \n                     ROCK, ARKANSAS ON JUNE 1, 2009\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself, Mr. Pryor, and Mr. Lieberman) submitted\n\n[[Page S6656]]\n\nthe following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 29\n\n       Whereas John Arthur ``Jack'' Johnson was a flamboyant, \n     defiant, and controversial figure in the history of the \n     United States who challenged racial biases;\n       Whereas Jack Johnson was born in Galveston, Texas, in 1878 \n     to parents who were former slaves;\n       Whereas Jack Johnson became a professional boxer and \n     traveled throughout the United States, fighting white and \n     African American heavyweights;\n       Whereas, after being denied (on purely racial grounds) the \n     opportunity to fight 2 white champions, in 1908, Jack Johnson \n     was granted an opportunity by an Australian promoter to fight \n     the reigning white title-holder, Tommy Burns;\n       Whereas Jack Johnson defeated Tommy Burns to become the \n     first African American to hold the title of Heavyweight \n     Champion of the World;\n       Whereas, the victory by Jack Johnson over Tommy Burns \n     prompted a search for a white boxer who could beat Jack \n     Johnson, a recruitment effort that was dubbed the search for \n     the ``great white hope'';\n       Whereas, in 1910, a white former champion named Jim \n     Jeffries left retirement to fight Jack Johnson in Reno, \n     Nevada;\n       Whereas Jim Jeffries lost to Jack Johnson in what was \n     deemed the ``Battle of the Century'';\n       Whereas the defeat of Jim Jeffries by Jack Johnson led to \n     rioting, aggression against African Americans, and the \n     racially-motivated murder of African Americans nationwide;\n       Whereas the relationships of Jack Johnson with white women \n     compounded the resentment felt toward him by many whites;\n       Whereas, between 1901 and 1910, 754 African Americans were \n     lynched, some for simply for being ``too familiar'' with \n     white women;\n       Whereas, in 1910, Congress passed the Act of June 25, 1910 \n     (commonly known as the ``White Slave Traffic Act'' or the \n     ``Mann Act'') (18 U.S.C. 2421 et seq.), which outlawed the \n     transportation of women in interstate or foreign commerce \n     ``for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any \n     other immoral purpose'';\n       Whereas, in October 1912, Jack Johnson became involved with \n     a white woman whose mother disapproved of their relationship \n     and sought action from the Department of Justice, claiming \n     that Jack Johnson had abducted her daughter;\n       Whereas Jack Johnson was arrested by Federal marshals on \n     October 18, 1912, for transporting the woman across State \n     lines for an ``immoral purpose'' in violation of the Mann \n     Act;\n       Whereas the Mann Act charges against Jack Johnson were \n     dropped when the woman refused to cooperate with Federal \n     authorities, and then married Jack Johnson;\n       Whereas, Federal authorities persisted and summoned a white \n     woman named Belle Schreiber, who testified that Jack Johnson \n     had transported her across State lines for the purpose of \n     ``prostitution and debauchery'';\n       Whereas, in 1913, Jack Johnson was convicted of violating \n     the Mann Act and sentenced to 1 year and 1 day in Federal \n     prison;\n       Whereas Jack Johnson fled the United States to Canada and \n     various European and South American countries;\n       Whereas Jack Johnson lost the Heavyweight Championship \n     title to Jess Willard in Cuba in 1915;\n       Whereas Jack Johnson returned to the United States in July \n     1920, surrendered to authorities, and served nearly a year in \n     the Federal penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas;\n       Whereas Jack Johnson subsequently fought in boxing matches, \n     but never regained the Heavyweight Championship title;\n       Whereas Jack Johnson served his country during World War II \n     by encouraging citizens to buy war bonds and participating in \n     exhibition boxing matches to promote the war bond cause;\n       Whereas Jack Johnson died in an automobile accident in \n     1946;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Wartime Treatment Study \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 102. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) During World War II, the United States Government \n     deemed as ``enemy aliens'' more than 600,000 Italian-born and \n     300,000 German-born United States resident aliens and their \n     families, requiring them to carry Certificates of \n     Identification and limiting their travel and personal \n     property rights. At that time, these groups were the two \n     largest foreign-born groups in the United States.\n       (2) During World War II, the United States Government \n     arrested, interned, or otherwise detained thousands of \n     European Americans, some remaining in custody for years after \n     cessation of World War II hostilities, and repatriated, \n     exchanged, or deported European Americans, including \n     American-born children, to European Axis nations, many to be \n     exchanged for Americans held in those nations.\n       (3) Pursuant to a policy coordinated by the United States \n     with Latin American nations, thousands of European Latin \n     Americans, including German and Austrian Jews, were arrested, \n     relocated to the United States, and interned. Many were later \n     repatriated or deported to European Axis nations during World \n     War II and exchanged for Americans and Latin Americans held \n     in those nations.\n       (4) Millions of European Americans served in the Armed \n     Forces and thousands sacrificed their lives in defense of the \n     United States.\n       (5) The wartime policies of the United States Government \n     were devastating to the German American and Italian American \n     communities, individuals, and their families. The detrimental \n     effects are still being experienced.\n       (6) Prior to and during World War II, the United States \n     restricted the entry of Jewish refugees who were fleeing \n     persecution or genocide and sought safety in the United \n     States. During the 1930s and 1940s, the quota system, \n     immigration regulations, visa requirements, and the time \n     required to process visa applications affected the number of \n     Jewish refugees, particularly those from Germany and Austria, \n     who could gain admittance to the United States.\n       (7) The United States Government should conduct an \n     independent review to fully assess and acknowledge these \n     actions. Congress has previously reviewed the United States \n     Government's wartime treatment of Japanese Americans through \n     the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of \n     Civilians. An independent review of the treatment of German \n     Americans and Italian Americans and of Jewish refugees \n     fleeing persecution and genocide has not yet been undertaken.\n       (8) Time is of the essence for the establishment of \n     commissions, because of the increasing danger of destruction \n     and loss of relevant documents, the advanced age of potential \n     witnesses and, most importantly, the advanced age of those \n     affected by the United States Government's policies. Many who \n     suffered have already passed away and will never know of this \n     effort.\n\n     SEC. 103.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. Res. 186 submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 186) condemning the murder of Army \n     Private William Andrew ``Andy'' Long and the wounding of Army \n     Private Quinton Ezeagwula, who were shot outside the Army-\n     Navy Career Center in Little Rock, Arkansas on June 1, 2009.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to a young \nman, Army PVT William Andrew Long, of Conway, AR. Last week, he was \nlaid to rest at the Arkansas Veterans Cemetery in North Little Rock. He \nwas buried with full military honors and was awarded the Army \nCommendation Medal and the Army Good Conduct Medal.\n  Private Long was a loving son, brother, and friend whose life was \ntragically cut short on June 1 in a senseless attack outside of an \nArmy-Navy Career Center in Little Rock, AR. PVT Quinton Ezeagwila was \nalso injured in the attack. Our thoughts and prayers are with him, and \nwe hope he makes a very speedy recovery.\n  Private Long had recently finished Army training and was set to \ndeploy to South Korea. He had been appointed to the Army's Hometown \nRecruiter Assistance Program in Little Rock and was at the Army \nrecruiting office on that fateful day because he had volunteered to \ntell others about his experience in the U.S. military.\n  Known to his friends and family as Andy, Private Long will always be \nremembered by all of us and all of them for his boundless energy, his \nkeen intelligence, his infectious smile, and his great sense of humor. \nHis country and all Arkansans will remember him as a hero with the \ncourage to serve his Nation during a time of war. He will also be \nremembered as a young man whose life was ended way too soon.\n  Private Long hailed from a fiercely patriotic family, with four \ngenerations of uniformed service to the United States. Andy's great \ngrandfather and grandfather served. Both of his parents served, and his \nbrother, PFC Triston Long, continues to serve today and will be \ndeployed to Iraq later this summer. On behalf of my colleagues in the \nSenate and the people of Arkansas, I wish to take this moment to thank \nthe Long family for their extraordinary dedication and service to our \nNation.\n  On that tragic day, Andy was targeted in what I view as an act of \nterrorism because of the uniform he wore--a uniform that stands as a \nsymbol of this great country.\n  Ours is a nation where we resolve our differences through debate and \ndemocratic elections, not through violence. This is a country where \nfreedom is cherished and liberty is recognized as an inalienable right \nfor all people.\n  Terrorism has absolutely no place in this country, and as elected \nrepresentatives of the people, it is our duty to ensure we are doing \neverything we can to combat terrorism, bring justice to its \nperpetrators, and protect our communities and our families. That is why \nI stand here today to put forth a resolution condemning the murder of \nPrivate Long and condemning the use of violence to achieve political \nends. Additionally, I call for the swift prosecution, to the fullest \nextent of the law, of the perpetrators of this senseless shooting.\n  The men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces risk their lives every \nday, both overseas and here on our own soil in the United States. Let \nit be\n\n[[Page S6666]]\n\nknown that their resolve will not and cannot be shattered. The ideals \nrepresented by the uniform worn by Andy Long, his parents, and the \ngenerations of brave American men and women before them, still serve to \nrepresent liberty and justice for all, and no act of terrorism can \ndiminish that. It can only strengthen our resolve and reaffirm our \ncommitment to America's most basic ideals and values.\n  Our country owes a great debt to Private Long for his service, as \nwell as to the brave men and women in the Armed Forces who protect and \ndefend the freedoms we cherish as Americans each and every day. Our \nthoughts and prayers go out to Private Long's family and to all of \nthose who knew and loved him. We are a grateful nation for incredible \nindividuals like Private Andy Long.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table \nwith no intervening action or debate, and any statements be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 186) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 186\n\n       Whereas on June 1, 2009, Private William Andrew ``Andy'' \n     Long, aged 23, of Conway, Arkansas, was murdered outside the \n     Army-Navy Career Center in Little Rock, Arkansas;\n       Whereas on June 1, 2009, Private Quinton Ezeagwula, aged \n     18, of Jacksonville, Arkansas, was wounded by gunfire outside \n     the Army-Navy Career Center in Little Rock, Arkansas;\n       Whereas there are more than 1,400,000 active component and \n     more than 1,200,000 reserve component members of the Armed \n     Forces protecting the United States;\n       Whereas there are more than 8,000 Army and Army Reserve \n     recruiters and more than 7,000 Navy recruiters serving at \n     more than 1,500 military recruiting stations and centers in \n     United States, Guam, Puerto Rico, and Europe;\n       Whereas the men and women of the Armed Forces risk their \n     lives every day to preserve the freedoms cherished by people \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas service in the Armed Forces demands extraordinary \n     sacrifices from service members and their families and often \n     places service members in harm's way;\n       Whereas members of the Armed Forces are the targets of \n     violence not only abroad but in the United States as well; \n     and\n       Whereas such violence is reprehensible and must not be \n     tolerated: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) offers its condolences to the family of Private William \n     Andrew ``Andy'' Long;\n       (2) hopes for a full recovery for Private Quinton \n     Ezeagwula;\n       (3) urges swift prosecution to the fullest extent of the \n     law of the perpetrator or perpetrators of this senseless \n     shooting;\n       (4) urges the people of the United States to join the \n     Senate in condemning acts of violence; and\n       (5) honors the service and sacrifice of all men and women \n     in the Armed Services who protect and defend our freedom \n     every day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/16/senate-section/article/S6666-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 111-3\n\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to its \nratification, the Protocol Amending the Convention between the United \nStates of America and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation \nand the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion With Respect to Taxes on Income, \nsigned on December 1, 2008, at Washington (the ``proposed Protocol''). \nI also transmit for the information of the Senate the report of the \nDepartment of State, which includes an Overview of the proposed \nProtocol.\n  The proposed Protocol provides for the elimination of withholding \ntaxes on certain cross-border direct dividend payments and on cross-\nborder interest payments to certain financial enterprises. The proposed \nProtocol reduces the existing Convention's 10-percent limit on \nwithholding taxes on cross-border payments of royalties to 5 percent.\n  The proposed Protocol contains a comprehensive provision designed to \nprevent ``treaty shopping,'' which is the inappropriate use of a tax \ntreaty by third-country residents. The proposed Protocol also provides \nfor the exchange of information between tax authorities of the two \ncountries to facilitate the administration of each country's tax laws.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe proposed Protocol and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, June 16, 2009.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/16/senate-section/article/S6666-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, JUNE 17, 2009\n\n  Mr. REID.
