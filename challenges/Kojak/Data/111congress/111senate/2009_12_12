Mr. President, this morning I will vote no on the cloture \nmotion to H.R. 3288. I oppose H.R. 3288 and will not be able to be \npresent to vote no on final passage. The reason I will not be here is \nthat tomorrow my wife and I will be celebrating our 50th wedding \nanniversary with our 20 kids and grandkids.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me congratulate my colleague from \nOklahoma on 50 years of marriage. Your wife must be a saint.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Indeed, she is.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, H.R. 3288 is a consolidated appropriations \nbill which contains almost all of the remaining spending bills for the \nfiscal year 2010. This is a process we had not anticipated. We had \nhoped we could take each bill individually and consider them on the \nfloor and bring them to conclusion. Unfortunately, we ran out of time.\n  We had over 90 different efforts made to stop debate on the Senate \nfloor on a variety of measures. It took us literally 4 weeks to extend \nunemployment benefits. This is something usually done routinely on a \nbipartisan basis, but unfortunately, because of delays and threats of \nfilibusters, it took us 4 weeks to finally come to a vote to extend \nunemployment benefits in the midst of the worst recession the United \nStates has experienced in over 75 years. It is unthinkable, at a time \npeople were sending us e-mails and letters saying: I can't believe the \nSenate won't provide a helping hand. It isn't as if the bill itself was \ncontroversial. When it finally came to a vote, it passed 97 to nothing. \nThere was no controversy associated with it. The controversy was \nmanufactured on the floor of the Senate to delay consideration of such \na very basic bill for 4 weeks.\n  Those 4 weeks could have been spent calling up these appropriations \nbills so we could have had what was needed--a healthy, open debate on \nthe bills. Instead, we were forced to wait until toward the end of the \nsession and consolidate the unpassed bills in one measure and bring it \nto the floor of the Senate today.\n  I will tell Members of the Senate who wonder if these bills have been \ncarefully reviewed that each and every one of them passed \noverwhelmingly from the Appropriations Committee. There was one \ndissenting vote on two or three of these measures, but by and large \nthey passed unanimously. There was little controversy in the \nAppropriations Committee from either side of the aisle.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee, on which I am honored to serve, \nhad been working spring and summer to pass all 12 appropriations bills. \nChairman Danny Inouye is not only a great America hero, he is a great \nAmerican chairman. As the Senate Appropriations Committee chairman, \nthis man has taken up a responsibility which few would shoulder and has \ndone it with an extraordinary amount of talent and dedication. At his \nside has been Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi, who \nworks just as hard to try to make sure what we produce is a great \ncredit to this institution and meets the needs of this great country.\n  There is one bill remaining after these six pass. It may be one of \nthe most important--the Defense appropriations bill. It was passed by \nthe committee in September and represents the only remaining bill left \nfor us to pass this year, which we certainly want to do before we \nadjourn at the end of this period before Christmas.\n  These bills were reported out of committee with overwhelming \nbipartisan votes. Nine of the 12 were reported unanimously. However, \nwhen we moved these bills to the floor, we ran into these obstacles. At \none point when we were considering, for example, the question of \nextending unemployment benefits to millions of Americans who have lost \ntheir jobs, exhausted their savings, lost their health insurance, and \nstand to lose their homes, there was an argument made by one Senator on \nthe other side of the aisle that he didn't want us to call this bill \nuntil he had a chance to offer another amendment--another amendment on \nthe ACORN organization. We have had a series of these amendments. We \nhave flogged this group mercilessly for month after weary month. Yet \nthey were going to hold up unemployment benefits for this Senator to \nhave one more chance, one more swing at this organization. That, to me, \nis not responsible. The responsible thing to do is to recognize all of \nthese families who were counting on us.\n  Time was lost that could have been used not only to provide \nunemployment benefits in a more expeditious manner but also to consider \nthese appropriations bills. Appropriations bills in the past, and not \ntoo distant past, used to take 1 or 2 days before the Senate. Members \nwould come to the floor, amendments would be offered, debated, end of \nstory. We would have a final vote, and we would move on. Now even \nroutine bills with no controversy take weeks because of amendments to \nbe offered which, frankly, have little or no relevance to the nature of \nthe bill before us.\n  We brought up the Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill on \nOctober 6. We didn't finish that bill until November 5. This is a \ncritically important one, one for which most Members would gladly \nendorse its mission.\n\n[[Page S13069]]\n\n  These appropriations bills have taken longer because, unfortunately, \nthe minority will not agree to reasonable time limits to consider \namendments and finish debate. Instead, we find ourselves consistently \nsidetracked.\n  So here we are. We have 21 days before the end of the calendar year, \nand we need to finish the business of the Congress. To do so, we \nengaged Republican Members of the Appropriations Committee and worked \non reasonable compromises on the differing bills in the House and \nSenate. I am troubled that some of the very Republican Members of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee--not all of them; three of them stood \nup and voted to move this process forward--some of the very Members of \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee who have sat through the \nsubcommittee hearings, the full committee deliberations, have made \nvaluable contributions to the bills themselves, now want to stop the \nprocess. It makes no sense. If we are going to do this in an orderly \nfashion, we should do it in a bipartisan fashion. I hope that is what \nwill happen today.\n  This package of appropriations bills is a result of a truly bicameral \nand bipartisan effort. It represents the priorities of our Nation. It \ninvests in students, veterans, and law enforcement, just to name a few. \nIt makes college education more affordable for students by increasing \nPell grants to $5,500 a year. Is there a better time for us to do that, \nto say to children and families that don't have a lot of money: Now is \nthe time to hone your skills, to create new talents in a more \nchallenging economy. Go to school. If you will go to school, we will \nhelp you. This package of bills increases the amount of money available \nfor the children in those families. I hope Members on both sides of the \naisle will support it.\n  The conference report also helps local governments fight crime and \nput more police on our streets. Take a look at the budgets of cities \nand towns, of counties, of States, and you will realize they are in a \ndeath struggle to provide basic services. We have increased grants for \nlocal law enforcement by $480 million over last year. Many of the \ncritics of our efforts say: You are spending more money. Yes, we are \nspending more money to keep cops on the street, to keep neighborhoods \nsafe so that families feel secure. I think it is money well spent. \nMoney spent to help our first responders, firefighters, and policemen \nis a critical investment. This bill makes that investment. That grant \nprogram was cut by almost $2 billion by the previous administration. We \nare trying to restore that money so we can put more people on the \nstreet protecting our citizens. This conference report sets the right \npriorities by helping States and local police departments fight crime. \nWe also include $298 million for the COPS Program to put more cops on \nthe beat. This funding will help hire and retain approximately 1,400 \npolice officers. The COPS Program has helped train nearly 500,000 law \nenforcement personnel.\n  The conference report also helps veterans. It is not enough to give \nspeeches on the floor about how much we love our men and women in \nuniform and honor our veterans. It is not enough to wear a lapel pin \nand participate in parades and then come to the floor and vote against \nthe bills that provide the money for the Veterans' Administration.\n  What we provide here is increased funding to the Veterans Affairs \nDepartment of $5.3 billion over last year's level. Those who come and \ncriticize the level of spending in this package of bills are \ncriticizing the additional investment to help our veterans when we need \nto more than ever. Returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injuries, amputations, these \nmen and women need our help. This package of bills provides that help. \nWe will provide increased access to quality care for all of our \nveterans. The conference report increases discretionary spending at the \nVA by more than $5 billion to help them care for 6.1 million veterans \nthey expect to see in 2010.\n  If I understood the unanimous consent order, we were equally dividing \ntime between now and 9:30. I ask how much time I have remaining on the \nmajority side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will proceed under my leader time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday may well have been a seminal \nmoment in this debate. We heard from CMS. And for those who do not know \nwhat that is, who may be watching C-SPAN 2, that is the Centers for \nMedicare & Medicaid Services. They did an analysis of the Reid health \ncare bill, a rather detailed analysis. The important part I will \nsummarize. It says: We estimate that total national health expenditures \nunder this bill would increase by an estimated $234 billion during the \ncalendar years 2010 to 2019. In other words, it will increase the \ndeficit. We know there was a letter to Chairman Baucus from six \nDemocrats on September 17, 2009, saying:\n\n       There are many, wide-ranging options to address the broad \n     and complicated issue of runaway health care costs, and we \n     pledge our support to you in making the necessary and tough \n     decisions. This is our number one priority. If we pass health \n     [care] reform legislation without addressing the issue of \n     health care spending, we will have failed.\n\n  That letter was signed by Senator Kohl of Wisconsin, Senator \nMcCaskill of Missouri, Senator Pryor of Arkansas, Senator Begich of \nAlaska, Senator Bayh of Indiana, and Senator Klobuchar of Minnesota to \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee, saying: ``If we pass health care \nreform legislation without addressing the issue of health [care] \nspending, we will have failed.''\n  We know from CMS, the actuary at the Department of Health and Human \nServices, that the Reid bill fails the test of Senators Kohl, \nMcCaskill, Pryor, Begich, Bayh, and Klobuchar. So we know what CMS \nthinks.\n  We also know what CNN thinks. We know where the American people are. \nWe have watched the public opinion polls dramatically shift against the \nReid proposal. The well-respected Quinnipiac poll a week or so ago had \nthe proposal disapproved by 14 percent; the week before that, Gallup \nhad it disapproved by 9 percent. And now CNN, just yesterday, the \nlatest poll: people oppose the Senate bill 61 to 36.\n  We have heard from both CMS and CNN. When will our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle respond to either cold, hard facts or the \nAmerican people? They argue: ``to make history.'' It is clear this \nwould be a historical mistake of gargantuan proportions--a historical \nmistake of gargantuan proportions. The only history we would be making \nhere is a historical mistake.\n  We know from the experts it will not achieve the goal. We know from \nthe American people they do not want us to pass it. It is time to stop \nthis effort and to start over and go step by step to fix the problems \nthe American people sent us here to fix regarding the American health \ncare system.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, time will be charged equally.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to speak for a moment about the vote \nwe are about to take here to proceed with the so-called Omnibus \nAppropriations Act, H.R. 3288. This is the bill which for those who \nhave not been following closely cleans up a little bit of a mess that \nthe Congress has created because we did not do our work earlier in the \nyear.\n  We are supposed to pass appropriations bills to run the government, \nto run the various Departments, and we did not get around to doing \nthat. So right here, at the very end, we have to combine all kinds of \nthose bills together in what is called an omnibus bill--six bills in \ntotal.\n  I find it ironic we are talking about a bill which is nearly $500 \nbillion--to be exact, it is $446.8 billion in new spending--at a time \nwhen our national deficit is $1.4 trillion, the health care bill we are \ndebating in its first 10 years of implementation is $2.5 trillion and, \nnext week, we are going to be asked to raise the debt ceiling in this \ncountry by something like $1.8 trillion.\n\n[[Page S13070]]\n\n  I saw a bumper sticker that said, ``Don't Tell Them What Comes After \nA Trillion.'' We used to think in billions. When I first came to \nCongress, millions were a big deal. Now we are talking trillions, and \nit is being tossed around as if it is nothing. Now another $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion spending bill.\n  Well, obviously we need to run the government. But do you suppose the \ngovernment could be a little bit like families and be a little bit \nprudent in how much it spends or how much it increases its spending \nover the previous year?\n  Let me give you some examples. The bill for Transportation and HUD \nreceives a 23-percent increase over last year--23 percent. The State \nForeign Operations bill receives a 33-percent increase over last year. \nIncluded in that bill is a 24-percent increase for the State \nDepartment's salaries and operations. A lot of Americans would like to \nsee their salaries and operations increased by 24 percent. Commerce, \nState, and Justice receives a 12-percent increase over last year.\n  You might say, well, the government is in tough shape. We need, for \nsome reason, to increase our spending by 33 percent. No, not with what \nis in this bill.\n  My colleagues have done a little bit of a check to see if there are \nany earmarks in this bill, for example. And guess what--5,224 earmarks \nand those earmarks alone are over $3.8 billion.\n  I gave some examples of those earmarks, and I do not want to \nembarrass any of my colleagues by citing them today. But I think it \nwould be appropriate for us to at least have the opportunity to strike \nsome of these earmarks and save a little bit of money. Because the \nargument is always made: Well, we can't save money. We have to keep \nspending what we are spending. There is nothing in there to cut.\n  There is a lot in there to cut. So the point I want to make to my \ncolleagues here today, before we vote to proceed with this legislation, \nis we could do better. There is no argument that we have to spend 33 \npercent more on the State Foreign Operations bill or 23 percent more on \nwhat we call affectionately around here the THUD bill, when we have \nthis deficit of $1.4 trillion, when we have to increase the national \ndebt by $1.8 trillion, when we are talking about spending another $2.5 \ntrillion, and that is just for the first 10 years of operation on the \nhealth care bill. I have not even mentioned the bills earlier this \nyear--bailing out AIG, the insurance companies, General Motors, \nChrysler, and the stimulus package, and well over $1 trillion when you \nadd in the interest.\n  By the way, I did not mention interest. Part of the problem is we do \nnot have this money. We are borrowing it. We have to borrow this money \nin order to pay it to these folks, and that means you have to pay \ninterest. I have not even included the interest cost, which for all \nthese bills amounts to several hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  There is a point at which, if you are talking about your own family \nand your own credit card, instead of asking the credit card company to \nexpand the limit so you can put even more money on your credit card--\nwhich is what we are doing here--you would start paying that credit \ncard down and you would be a little bit more careful about your \nspending.\n  All I am asking is: Can't we be a little more careful about our \nspending so we do not have to increase Departments of government by 23 \npercent, 33 percent over last year's spending? I do not think that is \ntoo much to ask on behalf of our taxpayers.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority whip is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to make a point of pulling out the \ncalendar here and reading the membership on the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee. I thought for sure there were Republicans serving on that \ncommittee, and it turns out there are 12 of them. They serve on the \ncommittee. They are on the subcommittees. They sat on the full \ncommittee deliberations, and they include the Republican minority \nleader.\n  Of the six appropriations bills which have come before us today for a \nvote, they were voted out of the Appropriations Committee by \noverwhelming votes. In fact, three of the bills were unanimous, meaning \nthat at least the minority leader was counted as voting for the bills \nwhich the Senator from Arizona has just criticized, and three of them \nhad a 29-to-1 vote, so I will not suppose what the minority leader's \nvote was.\n  But to come before us today and argue that the majority is cramming \nthese votes and bills down the throats of Members without giving them \nopportunity is to ignore what came before it: the fact that there were \nsubcommittee hearings, the fact that there was a vote in the \nAppropriations Committee on each of the bills, and they passed \noverwhelmingly.\n  So at least at an early stage, an important stage in this process, 11 \nor 12 Republican Senators signed on and approved the bills. To argue \nthat we are bringing something before the Senate, pushing it through \nquickly without deliberation, on a partisan basis, does not stand up.\n  And to listen to the Senator from Arizona, I would tell you, bluntly, \nthe increases in spending in this bill--some of them I hope the Senator \nfrom Arizona would not characterize as unwise. I know he feels as I do \nabout veterans in this country. There is a substantial increase in \nmoney for veterans for their care. We want to do that. I will be honest \nwith you, we need to pay the real cost of war, and that includes the \ncommitment we have made to men and women who serve our country.\n  The same thing, I am sure, is true when it comes to law enforcement. \nI am sure the Senator from Arizona feels as I do.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I urge my colleagues--when this comes for a vote in a few \nmoments--to support the cloture motion. Let's move this forward. Thank \nyou.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona has 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Let me respond to my friend, the majority whip now. Two plain points. \nFirst of all: that Republicans also serve on the Appropriations \nCommittee. That is true. If the majority whip, however, wants to defend \nthis bill, that is his prerogative. He can do that. I have the right to \nvote against it.\n  I do not serve on the Appropriations Committee, and I do not think it \nis a good bill. There may be some Republicans who do. I did not contend \nthis was strictly a partisan activity, but I said it was wrong. When \nour constituents, who pay the taxes in this country, ask us to be more \nfrugal, we could be more frugal than this.\n  Secondly, undoubtedly, in a bill of almost $500 billion, there are \ngood things. In fact, I know there are some good things in this bill. \nAnd I certainly suspect that the increase in veterans spending the \nmajority whip referred to is probably supported by everybody in this \nbody. That is the problem, however. When you do not do these \nappropriations bills one at a time, so you can vote on each one on its \nown merits, you are relegated to combining them into one giant bill. \nThat is why it is called an omnibus bill, and you cannot differentiate \nbetween the things you support and the things you oppose. So what you \nhave to end up doing is accepting all of the bad stuff in order to be \nable to support the good things.\n  That is a time-honored tradition around here. If you cannot get it \nall passed on its own merits, then bundle it up with a whole bunch of \nother stuff, and we will have to accept a lot of bad policy and bad \nspending because we do not want be accused of not supporting our \nNation's veterans.\n  Some of us are willing to say--and I, in fact, have had this \nconversation with veterans before: Would you rather have us vote \nagainst a bill which includes veterans spending but is way more than we \nshould be spending or vote for that bill simply because it has veterans \nspending in it? I used to have this conversation with veterans when I \nwas in the House of Representatives because they always combine \nveterans spending with HUD, and it was hard to pass the HUD bill but \neasy to pass the veterans bill. That is why they did it that way. My \nveterans were very understanding when I voted against that bill.\n  We have to be a little bit more courageous around here and a little \nbit more honest with our constituents in the way we set these bills up, \nso we do not argue to them: Oh, you don't want to\n\n[[Page S13071]]\n\nvote against veterans, do you? No, nobody wants to vote against \nveterans. But if you get to the point in the year where you have not \ndone your work, and you have to combine all these bills together--and \nyou have some good spending, for example, for veterans, but you are \nalso raising the State Department by 33 percent--I think a lot of folks \nwould say: That is too much. And we could actually save money by being \nmore discreet in supporting some things and opposing others.\n  That is why it would have been better if the majority could have \ngotten these bills to us one at a time rather than combined into one \nomnibus bill.\n  So, I do think, at a certain point in time, our constituents can \ndemand of us more fiscal prudence, more responsibility in the way we \nvote. The only way Republicans have to oppose a process by which all of \nthese things came together at once, and the only way other Democrats \nwho wish to demonstrate their prudence in spending to their \nconstituents can do that, is to vote ``no'' so we do not proceed to \nthis bill, so we could try to break it apart and vote on veterans, if \nyou want to vote for veterans, but not a 33-percent increase in the \nState Department bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and to do this in a more \nresponsible way so we do not have to go home and say to our \nconstituents: Well, we voted for a 33-percent increase in the State \nDepartment over last year. I know it is tough for you, but the State \nDepartment needed that money. So I hope you will forgive us for doing \nthat.\n  I do not think we want to do that. I hope my colleagues will vote \n``no.''\n\n\n                     Project Attribution Correction\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to join with my ranking member, \nSenator Bond, in a colloquy to correct clerical errors in the \nattribution table accompanying division A of H.R. 3288. Senator Merkley \nand Senator Wyden are listed as having requested the Oak Street \nExtension, Schereville, IN, project under surface transportation \npriorities. My staff has confirmed that this project was not requested \nby Senator Merkley or Senator Wyden, and, as such, Senator Merkley and \nSenator Wyden's names should not be listed as requestors.\n  Mr. BOND. My colleague and chair, Senator Murray, is correct. The \nnames were added as a result of a clerical error, and Senators Wyden \nand Merkley should not be listed as sponsors.\n  In addition to this project, there are additional projects for which \nSenate names were inadvertently left off of the attribution table. I \nhave confirmed with my staff that the Senators listed below did request \nthe following projects, which have been properly disclosed and for \nwhich they have certified that they have no pecuniary interest. \nSpecifically, the projects, the account in which they are funded, and \nthe additional sponsors are as follows:\n\n       I-49 North, LA, interstate maintenance, Senator Vitter;\n       Interstate 69, LA, interstate maintenance, Senator Vitter;\n       I-12 Interchange at LA-16, LA, interstate maintenance, \n     Senator Vitter;\n       I-20 Lincoln Parish, LA, Delta Regional Transportation \n     Development Program, Senator Vitter;\n       Clearview at Earhart drainage, LA, Delta Regional \n     Transportation Development Program, Senator Vitter;\n       Rail spur extension--Greater Ouachita Parish, LA, rail line \n     relocation and improvement, Senator Vitter;\n       Greater Ouachita Port Surface Development Project, LA, \n     Economic Development Initiative, Senator Vitter;\n       Earthworks Engineering Research Center--EERC, Iowa State \n     University, IA, transportation planning, research, and \n     development, Senator Grassley;\n       Jet engine technology inspection to support continued \n     airworthiness--JET, Iowa State University, IA, transportation \n     planning, research, and development, Senator Grassley;\n       Interstate 74 corridor construction, IA, interstate \n     maintenance, Senator Grassley;\n       Alice's road extension/Ashworth Road to University Avenue, \n     IA, surface transportation priorities, Senator Grassley;\n       Construct four lane highway 20 West of U.S. 71, IA, surface \n     transportation priorities, Senator Grassley;\n       Iowa Highway 92 reconstruction, surface transportation \n     priorities, Senator Grassley;\n       Roger Snedden Dr. extension/grade separation--phase 1, IA, \n     surface transportation priorities, Senator Grassley;\n       University Boulevard widening, Clive, IA, surface \n     transportation priorities, Senator Grassley;\n       Iowa Highway 100 extension and improvements, Cedar Rapids, \n     IA, surface transportation priorities, Senator Grassley;\n       I-480/Tiedeman Road interchange modification, OH, \n     interstate maintenance, Senator Voinovich;\n       I-76 Access/Martha Avenue connection, Akron, OH, surface \n     transportation priorities, Senator Voinovich; and\n       Warrensville/Van Aken Transit Oriented, OH, surface \n     transportation priorities, Senator Voinovich.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, Senator Bond, is correct. My staff has \nconfirmed that the changes to the attribution table should be made so \nthat the Senators listed above can be appropriately recognized as \nhaving requested the projects cited above.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the chair for her assistance in this matter.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the conference \nreport before us, which contains six of the seven remaining \nappropriations bills. Division D of the conference report contains the \nFinancial Services and General Government appropriations bill. As \nranking member of the subcommittee responsible for writing this \ndivision, I want to thank Senator Durbin for his leadership and \ncollegiality throughout the past year. Since joining this subcommittee, \nI have seen Senator Durbin demonstrate the kind of bipartisan \ncooperation that is the hallmark of the Appropriations Committee. He \nand I worked in a collaborative fashion to produce a bipartisan bill.\n  The Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee has \njurisdiction over a diverse group of agencies, many of which have a \nprofound impact on the financial stability of our economy and on the \nlives of most Americans. This appropriations bill is a key part of \nefforts to restore the stability of, and the public confidence in, \nAmerica's financial institutions. It makes needed investments to \nstrengthen the Securities and Exchange Commission's ability to enforce \nrules governing our financial markets and to detect and prosecute \nfraudulent schemes. It also increases the Federal Trade Commission's \ncapacity to protect consumers from scams and anticompetitive behavior.\n  Senator Durbin and I share many of the same concerns about the \nability of our financial regulatory institutions to protect small \ninvestors and market participants. For years, the SEC's funding and \nstaffing levels had declined, even as its oversight responsibilities \nrapidly increased. As a result, staffing shortages and an environment \nof lax oversight and enforcement at the SEC contributed to our current \nfinancial crisis. Funding shortfalls have hampered the ability of this \nagency to fulfill its mission of protecting the public through \nenforcement of securities laws.\n  We have included a 16-percent increase in funding for the SEC that \nwill help the agency better fulfill its mission by giving it the \nresources to increase staffing levels and to make information \ntechnology upgrades.\n  The conference report also provides important increases above the \nPresident's budget request for the Consumer Product Safety Commission \nand the Federal Trade Commission. The CPSC protects American consumers \nfrom defective and unsafe products, while the FTC protects consumers \nfrom unscrupulous marketing scams.\n  The bill also provides ample funding for the Small Business \nAdministration. Our economic strength and future are tied to the \nstrength of small businesses. The conference report funds important SBA \nprograms like Women's Business Centers, Veterans' Programs, Native \nAmerican Outreach, and HUBZones above the President's budget request. \nAs a former regional administrator of the SBA, I am particularly \nsupportive of the increase of $16 million over the President's request \nfor the Small Business Development Center Program. Each year, the SBDC \nnetwork of over 900 service centers provides management and technical \nassistance to an estimated 1.2 million small business owners and \naspiring entrepreneurs.\n  The conference agreement includes an important provision that \nprotects the due process rights of auto dealers. The auto dealers are \nessential to the success of the auto manufacturers because the dealers \nfacilitate distribution, sales, and servicing of hundreds of millions \nof vehicles annually. It is in the best interest of the public to have \na competitive and viable automobile distribution network throughout the \ncountry, including in urban, suburban,\n\n[[Page S13072]]\n\nand rural areas. It is also in the interest of the local economies, the \nnational economy, and our economic recovery to preserve jobs at \nsuccessful small businesses.\n  Senator Durbin and I share similar views about the funding priorities \nfor most of the agencies within this bill. One of the few areas where \nhe and I disagree is the DC school voucher program. We both respect one \nanother's different positions on this issue, but I am disappointed that \nthis bill effectively ends this successful program.\n  The DC Opportunity Scholarship Program has provided additional \neducational options for some of the District's most at-risk, low-income \nchildren who had previously attended some of the lowest-performing \nschools in the country.\n  Sadly, DC's public schools continue to underperform despite a per-\npupil expenditure rate that is the third highest in the Nation. Experts \nhave carefully studied the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program and \nconcluded that the educational success of the program's participants in \nreading has outpaced those in DC public schools.\n  Of the $75.4 million for DC public schools in this bill, $42.2 \nmillion is to improve the District's public schools, $20 million is to \nsupport DC public charter schools, and $13.2 million is for Opportunity \nScholarships. Unfortunately, the conference report contains language \nthat would only allow currently enrolled students to remain in the \nprogram. No new students would be permitted, despite the fact that the \n$7,500 per student cost for scholarship children is less than one-half \nthe $15,511 per student cost for DC public schools.\n  In May, Senator Lieberman and I held a hearing in the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee during which we heard \ncompelling success stories of current and former participants in the \nprogram. Their testimony helped to highlight the real world \nimplications of discontinuing the program. The fear about this program \nending was poignantly stated by a little girl wearing a T-shirt asking: \n``What About Me?''\n  By all accounts, students are succeeding and thriving in their \nscholarship schools, and their parents are overwhelmingly satisfied \nwith the education that their children are receiving. So I do not see \nthe wisdom of blocking new students from participating in this \nsuccessful program.\n  I am disappointed that the full Senate never had an opportunity to \ntake up, debate, and amend the Financial Services and General \nGovernment appropriations bill when it was reported out of committee.\n  This is unfortunate, especially since Senator Durbin and I worked \nhard to write a bipartisan bill which had overwhelming support in the \ncommittee. The Senate has had time to consider all 12 Appropriations \nbills. Chairman Inouye and Vice Chairman Cochran both worked hard to \ncomplete and report all 12 bills out of committee by September. For the \nrecord, the Financial Services bill was reported out of committee on \nJuly 9.\n  Next year we must return to regular order so that all Senators can \nhave an opportunity to debate these important bills.\n  I thank the Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee \nstaff: Marianne Upton, Diana Hamilton, Melissa Petersen, and Richard \nBurkard with the majority; and Mary Dietrich and Rachel Jones with the \nminority.\n  Turning to Division A of the conference report, I would like to speak \nin support of a provision I authored. This provision will increase \nsafety, save energy, and decrease vehicle emissions by creating a 1-\nyear pilot project to allow trucks weighing up to 100,000 pounds to \ntravel on Maine's interstates. This provision also requires an analysis \nby the U.S. Department of Transportation and the State of Maine of \nprovision's impact on safety, road and bridge durability, energy use, \nand commerce.\n  By way of background, let me explain why this pilot project is \nneeded. Under current law, trucks weighing 100,000 pounds are allowed \nto travel on the portion of Interstate 95 designated as the Maine \nTurnpike, which runs from Maine's border with New Hampshire to Augusta, \nour capital city. At Augusta, the Turnpike designation ends, but I-95 \nproceeds another 200 miles north to Houlton. At Augusta, however, heavy \ntrucks must exit the modern four-lane, limited-access highway and are \nforced onto smaller, two-lane secondary roads that pass through cities, \ntowns, and villages. The same problem occurs for Maine's other \nInterstates like I-295 out of Portland and I-395 in the Bangor-Brewer \narea.\n  Diverting trucks onto these secondary roads raises critical safety \nconcerns. In fact, there have been several accidents, some of which \nhave tragically resulted in death, which have occurred after these \nlarge trucks were diverted onto secondary roads and through smaller \ncommunities. For example, In May 2007, a 17-year-old high school \nstudent from Hampden, ME, lost her life when her car was struck by a \nheavy truck on Route 9. The truck driver could not see the car turning \nonto that two-lane road as he rounded a corner. Interstate 95 runs less \nthan three-quarters of a mile away, but Federal law prevented the truck \nfrom using that modern, divided highway, a highway that was designed to \nprovide ample views of the road ahead.\n  A year earlier, Lena Gray, an 80-year-old resident of Bangor, was \nstruck and killed by a tractor-trailer as she was crossing a downtown \nstreet. Again, that accident would not have occurred had that truck \nbeen allowed to use I-95, which runs directly through Bangor.\n  While improving safety is the key objective, a uniform truck weight \nlimit of 100,000 pounds on Maine's interstate highways also would \nreduce highway miles, as well as the travel time necessary to transport \nfreight through Maine, resulting in economic and environmental \nbenefits. Moreover, Maine's extensive network of local roads would be \nbetter preserved without the wear and tear of heavy truck traffic.\n  Interstate 95 north of Augusta, ME, where trucks are currently \nlimited at 80,000 pounds, was originally designed and built for \nmilitary freight movements to Loring Air Force Base at weights much \nheavier than 100,000 pounds. Raising the truck weight limit would keep \nheavy trucks on the interstates, which are designed to carry more \nweight than the rural State roads.\n  Current Maine law requires that vehicles carrying up to 100,000 \npounds on state roads be six-axle combination vehicles. Current Federal \nlaw requires that vehicles carrying 80,000 pounds be five-axle. \nContrary to erroneous assumptions, six-axle 100,000 pound vehicles are \nnot longer, wider or taller than the five-axle 80,000 pound vehicles. \nThe six-axle 100,000 pound vehicles, which include an additional set of \nbrakes, allow for greater weight distribution thereby not increasing \nroad wear and tear. Further, stopping distances and safety are in no \nway diminished, and preliminary data from studies conducted by the \nMaine State Police support this statement. That is why Maine's \nCommissioner of Public Safety, the Maine State Troopers Association, \nand the Maine Association of Police all support this pilot project.\n  A higher weight limit in Maine will not only preserve our rapidly \ndeteriorating roads, but will provide economic relief to an already \nstruggling trucking industry. Trucks weighing up to 100,000 pounds are \npermitted on interstate highways in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and \nNew York as well as the Canadian Provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec. \nMaine truck drivers and the businesses they serve are at a competitive \ndisadvantage.\n  Last year, I met with Kurt Babineau, a small business owner and \nsecond generation logger and trucker from Maine. Like so many of our \ntruckers, Kurt has been struggling with the increasing costs of running \nhis operation. All of the pulpwood his business produces is transported \nto Verso Paper in Jay, ME, a 165-mile roundtrip. This would be a \nconsiderably shorter trip if his trucks were permitted at 100,000 \npounds to remain on Interstate 95. Instead, his trucks must travel a \nless direct route through cities and towns. Kurt estimated that \npermitting his trucks to travel on all of Interstate 95 would save him \n118 gallons of fuel each week. At last year's diesel cost of \napproximately $4.50 a gallon, and including savings from his drivers \nspending less time on the trip, he could have saved more than $700 a \nweek, and more than $33,000 and 5,600 gallons of fuel annually. These \nsavings would not only be beneficial to\n\n[[Page S13073]]\n\nKurt's bottom line, but also to his employees, his customers, and to \nour nation as we look for ways to decrease the overall fuel \nconsumption.\n  An increase of the Federal truck weight limit in Maine is widely \nsupported by public officials throughout Maine, including the Governor, \nthe Maine Association of Police, and the Maine Department of Public \nSafety, which includes the State Bureau of Highway Safety, the Maine \nState Police, and the Bureau of Emergency Communications. The Maine \nLegislature also has expressed its support for the change having passed \nresolutions over the past several years calling on Congress to raise \nthe Federal truck weight limit to 100,000 pounds in Maine. I look \nforward to passage of this important provision, which has been long \nawaited in my State.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I rise today to speak in support of \namendment No. 2795, which would repeal the antitrust exemption for \nhealth insurance and medical malpractice insurance. I thank my \ncolleague Chairman Leahy for championing this legislation, which is \ncrucial to health reform and to working families around the country who \npay too much in health insurance premiums.\n  We are on the verge of expanding health insurance to 31 million more \nAmericans--an accomplishment that would be truly historic. But as \nheartened as I am about the relief this will bring to families, I am \ndeeply concerned that this expansion could be a windfall for insurance \ncompanies if we don't include additional checks and balances. We should \nbe putting significant Federal funds towards health insurance--but that \nmoney should go towards helping people afford health insurance, not \ntowards lining the pockets of insurance companies and their CEOs.\n  As a country, we have long understood the profound importance of \neconomic competition. Competition leads to greater entrepreneurship, \ncreativity, and productivity for businesses. It leads to lower prices \nand higher quality for consumers. Competition is why America has \ncreated so many of the most innovative businesses in the world. It is \nalso why we enacted antitrust laws--because we need to protect this \nvalue we hold dear, and we know that competition won't always happen on \nits own.\n  Because I understand the value of competition, I am extremely \nconcerned about the antitrust exemption in current law for health \ninsurance and malpractice insurance. It is indisputable that health \ninsurance premiums have gone through the roof in recent years. From \n1999 to 2008, median income rose about 24 percent, but insurance \npremiums grew by 131 percent. It is no wonder that so many American \nfamilies are struggling to afford insurance.\n  These high premiums are directly connected to the lack of competition \nin statewide health insurance markets. Ninety-four percent of State \nhealth insurance markets are considered ``highly concentrated,'' \naccording to the U.S. Department of Justice. In 16 States, the two \nbiggest health care insurance companies controlled 75 percent or more \nof the market in 2007. In Hawaii, that figure was 98 percent. In Rhode \nIsland and Alaska, it was 95.\n  But while American families suffer, insurance company profits \ncontinue to rise. From 2000 to 2008, the major insurance companies made \nover $59\\1/2\\ billion. Their profits rose by 428 percent from 2000 to \n2007. And their CEOs are making big bucks themselves--in 2007, the CEO \nof Aetna took home $23 million, while the CEO of CIGNA took home $25.8 \nmillion.\n  The antitrust exemption for health insurance and malpractice \ninsurance may have had a purpose at one point in time--it gave the \nhealth insurance companies time to respond to a major change in the \nlaw. When Congress passed the McCarran Ferguson Act in 1945, it was \nresponding to a 1944 Supreme Court case that upended the insurance \nindustry as they knew it. The bill passed without any hearings in the \nSenate and with very little debate in the House.\n  Most indications suggest that both the House and the Senate expected \nthe antitrust exemption to be temporary. But somehow, through the \nconference report, this ``temporary fix'' became permanent--and health \ninsurance markets have become more and more concentrated as a result.\n  This cannot continue. Senator Leahy's amendment gives us the \nopportunity to further the American ideal of competition, and help \nworking people in the process. I urge my colleagues to bring this \namendment up for a vote, and to vote to repeal the antitrust exemption. \nThis issue is just too important for us to wait any longer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I rise to speak on the pending bill \nbefore us, one of the great porkbarrel, earmark-filled pieces of \nlegislation I have seen come before this body.\n  I would like to quote from ABC News, by Jonathan Karl and Devin \nDwyer, ``Tis the Season of `Pork': Congress Gifts $4 Billion in \nEarmarks.''\n\n\n[[Page S13074]]\n\n\n       Just weeks before returning to their districts for \n     Christmas, Congress is poised to give the gift of pork--\n     roughly $4 billion of it.\n       More than 5,000 earmarks were included in the $447 billion \n     omnibus spending bill passed yesterday by the House, funding \n     ``pet projects'' of key members of Congress from both parties \n     and all regions of the country. The Senate will vote on the \n     bill this weekend. . . .\n       Independent analyses of the bill reveal a whopping 12 \n     percent increase in government spending for 2010 while the \n     inflation rate in the country remains near zero.\n\n  Really, isn't that remarkable? A 12-percent increase in spending when \npeople are out of jobs, out of their homes. They cannot afford, \nbasically, what they need to sustain their lives, and we have increased \nspending by 12 percent and 4,500 earmarks, about $4 billion of it.\n\n       ``This Congress has not shown that they are at all serious \n     about the budget deficit in any way,'' said Brian Riedl of \n     the Heritage Foundation. ``The spending spree is continuing \n     even as the deficit escalates to $2 trillion.''\n       The earmarks are all explicitly listed in the bill--right \n     next to the members of Congress who inserted them: $800,000 \n     for jazz at New York's Lincoln Center, for Rep. Jerold \n     Nadler, D-N.Y., and Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. Harkin, and Rep. \n     Leonard Boswell, D-Iowa, got $750,000 for exhibits at the \n     World Food Prize Hall in Iowa. Hawaii Democratic senators Dan \n     Inouye and Daniel Akaka helped get $3.4 million for a rural \n     bus program in Hawaii.\n       ``The country needs to be tightening its belt, just like \n     the rest of America,'' said Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for \n     Common Sense.\n       Republicans have criticized the spending package, but many \n     Democrats say it funds key priorities.\n       Two of the biggest earmarks are from Republican senators \n     Thad Cochran and Roger Wicker of Mississippi at a cost of $8 \n     million for improvements to four rural State airports. One \n     airport serves fewer than 100 passengers a day and another--\n     the Mid-Delta Regional Airport--sees even less.\n\n  By the way, I have seen the pork extended to both of those airports \nover the years.\n\n       The new funds would come on top of $4.4 million the \n     airports just received from the stimulus package.\n\n  I am not making this up.\n\n       ``We obviously have huge aviation and transportation needs \n     in this country and stuffing millions of dollars in small, \n     little-used airports in Mississippi is not a wise use of \n     funds,'' said Ellis.\n       President Obama had promised to curb the inclusion of \n     earmarks in government spending bills but he has yet to issue \n     the threat of a veto.\n\n  My friends, do not wait for the threat of a veto.\n\n       In March, Obama signed a $410 billion spending package that \n     contained nearly 8,000 pet projects.\n       ``I am signing an imperfect omnibus bill because it's \n     necessary for the ongoing functions of government,'' Obama \n     said at the time. ``But I also view this as a departure point \n     for more far-reaching change.''\n\n  What has changed? What has changed? Nothing. Nothing has changed.\n  Senate majority leader Harry Reid said about the last omnibus: We \nhave a lot of issues we need to get to after we fund the government--\nsomething we should have done last year but could not because of the \ndifficulty we had working with President Bush.\n  Difficulty working with President Bush? Whom did the majority leader \nhave trouble working with this time?\n  Again, I repeat, a 1,350-page Omnibus appropriations conference \nreport, 6 bills, spends $450 billion, 4,752 earmarks totaling $3.7 \nbillion, and a full 409 pages of this conference report are dedicated \nto listing congressional pork-barrel spending. Spending on domestic \nprograms in this bill is increased 14 percent over the last fiscal \nyear, while spending on military construction and care for veterans has \nincreased by only 5 percent.\n  Let's look at a little bit of it. Transportation, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment contains 1,400 earmarks totaling over $1 billion. Commerce-\nJustice-Science contains 1,511 earmarks totaling $715 million. The list \ngoes on and on. Here we are with a deficit of $1.4 trillion, a debt of \n$12 trillion, unemployment at 10 percent, nearly 900,000 families lost \ntheir homes in 2008, yet there is every indication that the aggregate \nnumbers for 2009 will be worse. With all this, we continue to spend and \nspend and spend. Every time we pass an appropriations bill with \nincreased spending and load it up with earmarks, we are robbing future \ngenerations of Americans of the ability to obtain the American dream. \nForty-three cents out of every dollar spent in this bill is borrowed \nfrom our children and our grandchildren and, unfortunately, generations \nafter theirs. This is the greatest act of generational theft committed \nin the history of this country.\n  Let me go through a few of these, if I might, and remind people of \nthe context this is in. In my home State of Arizona, 48 percent of the \nhomes are ``underwater,'' meaning they are worth less than the mortgage \npayments people have to pay. We have small businesspeople losing credit \neverywhere. Instead of trying to fix their problems and helping them \nout, it is business as usual in the Senate of the United States of \nAmerica and the Congress.\n  For example: $200,000 for the Washington National Opera, Washington, \nDC, for set design, installation and performing arts at libraries and \nschools; $13.9 million on fisheries in Hawaii--there is always Hawaii--\nnine projects throughout the islands ranging from funding bigeye tuna \nquotas, marine education and training, and coral research; $2.7 \nmillion--one of my favorites--to support surgical operations in outer \nspace at the University of Nebraska. As I have said many times--the \ncommon theme--you will always have a location designated for these \nprojects. That is why some of them may be worthwhile, but we will never \nknow because they don't compete them. They earmark them for the \nparticular place they want to help. Unfortunately, that shuts out other \npeople. There may be other places besides the University of Nebraska \nthat can support surgical operations in outer space. I suggest we get \nDr. Spock and Bones out there to help at the university. I don't know \nif they live in Omaha or not. I am sure to them and all the others on \n``Star Trek,'' surgical operations in outer space may be one of their \npriorities. It certainly isn't a priority of the citizens of my State.\n  One of the great cultural events that took place in the 20th century \nwas the Woodstock Festival. In order to do a lot more research on that \ngreat cultural moment, we are going to spend $30,000 for the Woodstock \nFilm Festival Youth Initiative; $200,000 to renovate and construct the \nLaredo Little Theater in Texas--people from all over America are \nflocking to the Laredo Little Theater, and they want to invest $200,000 \nof their tax dollars into the Laredo Little Theater. The money would be \nused to replace worn auditorium seating and soundproofing materials. \nAnybody got a little theater that warrants soundproofing? Maybe they \nshould apply to the Senator from Texas.\n  Continuing: $665,000--I am not making this one up--for the Cedars-\nSinai Medical Center in Los Angeles for equipment and supplies for the \nInstitute for Irritable Bowel Syndrome Research. I have a lot of \ncomments on that issue, but I think I will pass so as not to violate \nthe rules of the Senate. There is $500,000 for the Botanical Research \nInstitute of Texas in Fort Worth. I am sure the Botanical Research \nInstitute in Fort Worth is a good one. I would like to see other \nbotanical research institutes able to compete. There is $600,000 for \nwater storage tower construction in Ada, OK, population 16,008; \n$200,000 for a visitor center in Bastrop, TX, the population is 5,340; \n$292,200 for elimination of slum and blight in Scranton, PA--that may \nhave been put in by the cast of the office--$229,000 for elimination of \nslum and blight in Scranton; $200,000 for design and construction of \nthe Garapan Public Market in the Northern Mariana Islands; $500,000 for \ndevelopment of a community center--$\\1/2\\ million--in Custer County, \nID, population 4,343; $100,000 for the Cleveland Municipal School \nDistrict--they just picked one and gave them $100,000--$800,000 for \njazz at the Lincoln Center; $300,000 for music programs at Carnegie \nHall; $400,000 for Orchestra Iowa Music Education, Cedar Rapids, IA, to \nsupport a music education program; $2.5 million for the Fayette County \nSchools in Lexington, KY, for a foreign language program; $100,000 to \nthe Cleveland Municipal School District in Cleveland, OH, to improve \nmath and language skills through music education; $700,000 for the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service for the project Shrimp Industry \nFishing Effort Research Continuation; $1.6 million to build a tram \nbetween the Huntsville Botanical Garden and the\n\n[[Page S13075]]\n\nMarshall Flight Center in Alabama--how many places need $1.6 million to \nbuild a tram, it will probably go out to the statue of Vulcan--$250,000 \nfor the Monroe County Fiscal Court for the Monroe County Farmers Market \nin Kentucky; $750,000 for the design and fabrication of exhibits to be \nplaced in the World Food Prize Hall of Laureates in Iowa; $500,000 to \nsupport creation of a center to honor the contribution of Senator \nCulver, an Iowa State Senator, at Simpson College; $400,000 to recruit \nand train closed captioners and court reporters at the AIB College of \nBusiness in Iowa; $250,000 for renovating the Murphy Theatre Community \nCenter in Ohio.\n  There is a lot more, and I will go through them briefly. The point \nis, you will notice several things. One, the preponderance of these \npork-barrel and earmark projects is allocated to members of the \nAppropriations Committee, which is fundamentally unfair. Second, you \nwill find these are designated to a certain place, to make sure none of \nthat money is spent somewhere else where the need may be greater. \nThird, it breeds corruption. It is a gateway drug. What we are talking \nabout is a gateway drug. It is especially egregious now.\n  Continuing: $300,000 to monitor and research herring in Maine; \n$200,000 to study Maine lobsters; $250,000 for a Father's Day rally \nparade in Philadelphia. I scoff and make fun of a lot of these but \n$250,000 for a Father's Day rally parade in Philadelphia. There is \n$100,000 for the Kentler International Drawing Space, an art education \nprogram in Brooklyn. Here is a deprived area, $75,000 for art projects \nin Hollywood Los Angeles Park; $100,000 for a performing arts training \nprogram at the New Freedom Theater in Philadelphia; $100,000 to teach \ntennis at the New York junior tennis league in Woodside, NY; $2.8 \nmillion to study the health effects of space radiation on humans at the \nLoma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA; $200,000 for the Aquatic \nAdventures Science Education Foundation in San Diego; $100,000 to \narchive newspaper and digital media at the Mississippi Gulf Coast \nCommunity College in Perkinston, MS; $3.9 million on researching \nweaving and knitting at Clemson University, Raleigh, NC, Philadelphia \nUniversity, UC Davis in Davis, CA; $90,000 for a commercial kitchen \nbusiness incubator at the El Pajaro Community Development Corporation \nin Watsonville, CA; $500,000 to study vapor mercury in the atmosphere \nat Florida State; $1 million to examine sea scallops fisheries at the \nMassachusetts Marine Fisheries in Bedford; $300,000 for seal and \nstellar sea lion biological research; $300,000 for Bering Sea crab \nmanagement; $500,000 to upgrade the Baldwin County Courthouse security \nin Fairhope, AL; $900,000 for the operational costs and capital \nsupporting the Alien Species Action Plan cargo inspection facility in \nMaui; $2 million to streetscape the city of Tuscaloosa, AL; $100,000 \nfor an engineering feasibility study of a bike connector in Hiran, OH; \n$400,000 for a pedestrian overpass in Des Moines; $300,000 for a bike \npath in Cuellar, TX; $900,000 for a river freight development study in \nMissouri; $800,000 for a scenic trail in Monterey Bay, CA, another \ndeprived area; $750,000 for the Philadelphia Museum of Art \nTransportation Improvement Program, Brady, PA; $500,000 for park-and-\nride lots at Broward County, Meek, FL; $487,000 to restore walkways in \nNewport Cliff, RI, another low-income area; $974,000 for Regional East-\nWest and Bikeway in Albuquerque.\n  The list goes on and on and on, up to nearly $4 billion. The problem \nis, among other problems, in the last campaign, the President \ncampaigned for change, change you can believe in. There is no change \nhere. It is worse. It is worse because of the conditions Americans find \nthemselves in--out of their homes, out of jobs, high unemployment, \ntough economic conditions. It is business as usual, spending money like \na drunken sailor, and the bar is still open.\n  I tell my colleagues, again, what I keep saying over and over: There \nis a peaceful revolution going on. They are sick and tired of the way \nwe do business in Washington. They don't think their tax dollars should \nbe spent on these pork-barrel earmarked projects. They are mad about \nit. We are not getting the message. We are not hearing them. We are not \nresponding to the problems and the enormous challenges the American \npeople have. We are continuing this kind of obscene process, which not \nonly is wrong on its face but breeds corruption in Washington.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the AP story ``Senate Set to Advance \n$1.1 trillion Spending Bill'' be printed in the Record, as well as the \nABC News story and the FOX News story ``Watchdogs Cry Foul Over \nThousands of Earmarks in Spending Bills.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Senate Set To Advance $1.1T Spending Bill\n\n                           (By Andrew Taylor)\n\n       Washington.--The Senate is poised to clear away a \n     Republican filibuster of a huge end-of-year spending bill \n     rewarding most federal agencies with generous budget boosts.\n       The $1.1 trillion measure combines much of the year's \n     unfinished budget work--only a $626 billion Pentagon spending \n     measure would remain--into a 1,000-plus-page catchall \n     spending bill that would give Cabinet departments such as \n     Education, Health and Human Services and State increases far \n     exceeding inflation.\n       After a 60-36 test vote on Friday in which Democrats and a \n     handful of Republicans helped the measure clear another GOP \n     obstacle, the bill was expected to win on Saturday the 60 \n     Senate votes necessary to guarantee passage. A final vote is \n     expected Sunday.\n       The measure provides spending increases averaging about 10 \n     percent to programs under immediate control of Congress, \n     blending increases for veterans' programs, NASA and the FBI \n     with a pay raise for federal workers and help for car \n     dealers.\n       It bundles six of the 12 annual spending bills, capping a \n     dysfunctional appropriations process in which House leaders \n     blocked Republicans from debating key issues while Senate \n     Republicans dragged out debates.\n       Just the $626 billion defense bill would remain. That's \n     being held back to serve as a vehicle to advance must-pass \n     legislation such as the debt increase.\n       Saturday's bill would offer an improved binding arbitration \n     process to challenge General Motors' and Chrysler's decisions \n     to close more than 2,000 dealerships, which often anchor \n     fading small town business districts. It also renewed for two \n     more years a federal loan guarantee program for steel \n     companies.\n       The bill also caps a heated debate over Obama's order to \n     close the military-run prison for terrorist suspects at \n     Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. It would permit detainees held there to \n     be transferred to the United States to stand trial but not to \n     be released.\n       The bill would also void a long-standing ban on the funding \n     of abortion by the District of Columbia government and \n     overturns a ban on federal money for needle exchange programs \n     in the city. It also phases out a D.C. school voucher program \n     favored by Republicans and opens the door for the city to \n     permit medical marijuana.\n       It would also lift a nationwide ban on the use of federal \n     funds for needle-exchange programs.\n       Federal workers would receive pay increases averaging 2 \n     percent, with people in areas with higher living costs \n     receiving slightly higher increases.\n       Once the bill clears the Senate, it would advance to \n     President Barack Obama's desk.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     Watchdogs Cry Foul Over Thousands of Earmarks in Spending Bill\n\n       Republicans and taxpayer watchdogs are railing against the \n     thousands of earmarks included in the omnibus spending bill \n     that passed the House Thursday and is awaiting a vote in the \n     Senate.\n       Republicans and tax watchdog groups are railing against the \n     thousands of earmarks included in the omnibus spending bill \n     that the House passed Thursday and is awaiting a vote in the \n     Senate.\n       The $1.1 trillion bill includes $447 billion in operating \n     budgets for 10 Cabinet departments. Mixed in are more than \n     5,000 earmarks totaling $3.9 billion, according to watchdog \n     Taxpayers for Common Sense.\n       Pork-watchers are only just beginning to sort through the \n     earmarks, which typically are goodies set aside for the \n     districts of members of Congress, as the bill tracks toward a \n     final vote. So far, they've uncovered gems ranging from \n     $700,000 for a shrimp fishing project in Maryland to $30,000 \n     for the Woodstock Film Festival Youth Initiative to $200,000 \n     for a visitor's center in a Texas town with a population of \n     about 8,000.\n       ``Let's stop the madness,'' House Republican Leader John \n     Boehner said, before the bill passed without any GOP support. \n     Twenty-eight House Democrats also opposed it.\n       House Minority Whip Eric Cantor, R-Va., wrote to President \n     Obama urging him to veto the bill, and pledging that \n     Republicans would stand by him if he did.\n       Obama in March waved off controversy over a $410 billion \n     spending bill that also was riddled with earmarks, arguing \n     that it represented ``last year's business.'' This time \n     around, Boehner said, the president needs to crack down on \n     the pork under his watch.\n       Republicans, though, have hardly shied away from the \n     earmarks. Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., is pushing $200,000 for \n     the Washington National Opera. Sen. Judd Gregg, a fiscal \n     hawk, is behind a $1 million earmark for renovation at the \n     Portsmouth Music Hall.\n\n[[Page S13076]]\n\n       Taxpayers for Common Sense reports a total of 5,224 \n     earmarks in the 2010 spending bill, which also includes \n     funding for Medicare and Medicaid. Groups like Citizens \n     Against Government Waste, as well as Sen. John McCain's \n     staff, have drawn attention to dozens of items they consider \n     questionable. Here's just a sampling:\n       --$150,000 for educational programs and exhibitions at the \n     National Building Museum.\n       --$400,000 for renovation of the Brooklyn Botanical Garden.\n       --$150,000 for exhibits at the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural \n     Site Foundation in Buffalo, N.Y.\n       --$500,000 for Mississippi River exhibits at the National \n     Mississippi River Museum and Aquarium in Dubuque, Iowa.\n       --$200,000 for the Washington National Opera.\n       --$30,000 for the Woodstock Film Festival Youth Initiative.\n       --$2.7 million for the University of Nebraska Medical \n     Center, to support surgical operations in space.\n       --$200,000 for a visitor's center in Bastrop, Texas.\n       --$700,000 for a project called, ``Shrimp Industry Fishing \n     Effort Research Continuation,'' at the National Marine \n     Fisheries Service in Silver Spring, Md.\n       --$292,200 for the elimination of blight in Scranton, Pa.\n       --$750,000 for exhibits at the World Food Prize Hall of \n     Laureates in Iowa.\n       --$1.6 million for a tram between the Marshall Flight \n     Center and Huntsville Botanical Garden in Alabama.\n       --$655,000 for equipment at the Institute for Irritable \n     Bowel Syndrome Research in Los Angeles.\n       Republicans have been on a tear over earmarks and excessive \n     spending over the past week, particularly as Congress \n     prepares to take up a new jobs-creation package and raise the \n     debt ceiling by nearly $2 trillion.\n       Rep. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., and Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., on \n     Thursday named what they called the 11 most wasteful spending \n     projects considered by Congress so far this year.\n       On Wednesday, four Republican lawmakers demanded an audit \n     of the $787 billion stimulus program following reports of \n     exaggerated or inaccurate accounts of the number of jobs \n     created.\n       McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., on Tuesday \n     released a report on 100 ``questionable'' stimulus projects \n     worth nearly $7 billion.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I am sorry to be repetitive. I know my \ncolleague is waiting, so I will end with this: This is wrong. We all \nknow it is wrong. The American people know it is wrong. People who vote \nfor this kind of porkbarrel spending are going to be punished by the \nvoters, and we are going to end this obscene process, and we are going \nto end it soon, as early as the next election.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, we are now considering a bill that \nrepresents a dramatic expansion in government spending, as the Senator \nfrom Arizona has so eloquently stated. This Omnibus appropriations bill \nrepresents a 12-percent increase over last year--a fiscal year that \nended with the largest deficit in American history of $1.4 trillion.\n  I do not know of any other area in the economy where people are \nspending 12 percent over what they spent last year. Certainly no family \nbudget in America, no business in America is spending 12 percent more \nthis year than they did last year--while we see 10 percent of our \npeople unemployed.\n  Millions of families across the country and small businesses are, in \nfact, tightening their budgets. But the budgets of these Federal \nagencies and of the Federal Government itself keep expanding. There is \na 33-percent increase in spending for foreign operations, a 23-percent \nincrease in Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development.\n  One of the worst things this spending is doing is creating tremendous \nuncertainty, both here at home and in other places such as China which \nare buying our debt, about whether we are ever going to get serious \nabout our fiscal responsibility.\n  The President asked last week why job creators were not stepping up \nand creating jobs. Well, the fact is, people are watching what we are \ndoing in Congress, and they do not know what the rules will be 6 months \nfrom now or a year from now or whether Congress will ever recover from \nthis binge it has been on when it comes to spending.\n  But it is clear we cannot spend--we cannot spend--our way out of this \nrecession. Job creators are scared. They are scared, and they are \nsitting on the sidelines because all of the spending, all of the tax \nincreases, all of the government takeovers coming out of Washington, \nDC, these days leave them with the sense that they do not know what the \nrules are going to be. And why in the world would you want to create a \njob, expand your business, or make an investment when the very premise \nupon which you did so would change because of all the chaos in \nWashington?\n  The facts of our debt crisis are not in dispute. The total public \ndebt stands at about $12 trillion. We have, in 2009, a $1.4 trillion \nfiscal deficit. In other words, we have spent more than $1.4 trillion \nthan the Treasury brought in in fiscal year 2009. Then we are \naccumulating debt even faster during this year than we did last year.\n  According to the Treasury Department, the deficit for the first 2 \nmonths--2 months--of the new fiscal year was almost $300 billion--$300 \nbillion for 2 months--a total larger than the full-year deficits in \n2002, 2006, or 2007. So in 2 months, the deficit was worse than it was \nfor the entire years of 2002, 2006, and 2007.\n  Our deficits will average nearly $1 trillion every year for the next \ndecade--$1 trillion every year for the next decade--according to the \nadministration. This ought to be a shot across our bow.\n  Moody's Investors Service said its debt rating on U.S. Treasury \nsecurities may ``test the Triple-A boundaries.'' The translation of \nthat is they are beginning to doubt whether at some point the U.S. \nGovernment will be able to pay its bills or will default on those bills \nat some point hopefully not any time soon. But this is the sort of \npressure we are putting not only on our ability to create jobs but on \nour future and particularly on our children's future, if we cause \nMoody's Investors Service and others to rate U.S. Treasury securities \nless than a Triple-A rating.\n  Well, we know soon our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \ngoing to ask Congress to vote to lift the debt ceiling. In other words, \nthis is like the credit limit on your credit card. Once Congress is \nbumped up against that $12 trillion debt ceiling, Congress is going to \nhave a vote on whether to ask the American people and people buying our \ndebt whether we can increase the limit of our credit card because we \nhave maxed it out.\n  Media reports indicate that the majority intends to slip this \nprovision into a bill on funding our troops in Afghanistan because, \nfrankly, they are embarrassed to have a stand-alone vote on raising the \ndebt ceiling, especially because they know there are many of us on both \nsides of the aisle who will insist on some measure to effect some \ndiscipline on this spending binge as a condition to voting on the debt \nceiling. But whatever the vehicle the majority leader decides upon, \nthey cannot hide the fact that we are borrowing money so fast that we \nwill have to raise the debt ceiling another 15 percent.\n  Conveniently, this increase will get the government through the next \nmidterm elections, it is reported according to some experts. Not a \ncoincidence. No one, particularly those in control of the Congress, \nwants to have another vote on lifting the debt ceiling or asking the \nAmerican people to raise the credit card limit before the next election \nbecause they know the American people are increasingly angry and \nfrightened by the spending binge they see here, and particularly the \naccumulating debt.\n  That is not even getting to the financial crisis that entitlement \nprograms are facing, such as Medicare and Social Security. We know \nMedicare's unfunded liabilities are roughly $38 trillion. I realize \nthat number is so big that there are perhaps none of us who can fully \ncomprehend how much money that is--but $38 trillion in unfunded \nliabilities for Medicare alone. Yet the proposed Medicare \n``compromise'' among 10 Democrats would roughly double the burden of \nMedicare and not fix it but actually make things worse.\n  Well, I want to mention one other item of fiscal irresponsibility I \nhave witnessed. I think we need to cancel one of the credit cards that \nhas been used by the administration--not just this administration but \nthe past administration--and Congress for purposes Congress never \nintended when it authorized this program, the Troubled Asset Relief \nProgram or TARP.\n  I know the Senator from South Dakota is on the Senate floor. He has \nbeen one of the leaders in this effort\n\n[[Page S13077]]\n\nbecause he believes, I think, as I do, that we cannot amend it, so we \nneed to end it. We need to cut out this revolving credit account that \nis being used for inappropriate purposes known as TARP, the Troubled \nAsset Relief Program.\n  Let's go back and look at why TARP was authorized by Congress in \nOctober of 2008. It is important to remember what the situation was at \nthat time. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve \nChairman Ben Bernanke had many conversations with legislators on both \nends of the Capitol on both sides of the aisle, and they said in their \npublic testimony--on September 23, Secretary Paulson said that Congress \nmust act ``in order to avoid a continuing series of financial \ninstitution failures and frozen credit markets that threaten . . . the \nvery health of our economy.''\n  In private, their diagnosis was even more dire. We were told ``that \nwe're literally maybe days away from a complete [financial] meltdown of \nour financial system'' in the United States unless Congress acts to \nauthorize the Troubled Asset Relief Program.\n  Many of us, including myself, voted for TARP because we were told by \nthe smartest people on the planet that unless we did this, our economy \nwould suffer an economic meltdown. But I must tell you, I am extremely \ndisappointed that the very nature of the program was changed after \nCongress authorized it. For example, we were told by Secretary Paulson \nand others that the money would be used for one purpose, and one \npurpose only; that is, to purchase toxic assets.\n  Well, there is a saying that says: ``Fool me once, shame on you. Fool \nme twice, shame on me.'' And we were fooled into believing that the \nTARP would be used to purchase these toxic assets and get them off the \nbooks as a way of protecting pensions, savings, and investments of \nhard-working American taxpayers.\n  Unfortunately, the very people who promised us and told us what \npurpose the TARP would be used for misled us because two \nadministrations now--the previous administration and this \nadministration--have used TARP as if it were a big government slush \nfund. They ignored the clear language of the TARP legislation, and they \nhave repeatedly defied the will of Congress.\n  Let me briefly mention how the TARP funds have been used in a way \nthat Congress never authorized and never intended.\n  Only weeks after TARP was enacted, the Bush administration abandoned \nthis stated goal of purchasing toxic assets. Instead, the \nadministration funneled billions of dollars directly into some of the \nNation's largest financial institutions, making huge purchases of stock \nand warrants of some of the Nation's largest financial institutions.\n  The Federal Government, in other words, began acquiring ownership, \nstakes in banks, financial institutions, and, yes, even car \nmanufacturers, with the full support of the Obama administration. In \nfact, the Obama administration has even gone so far as to use TARP to \nset executive pay at several companies. During the reorganization of \nGeneral Motors, the Obama administration has used that leverage to \nbenefit its union allies over the rights of secured bondholders who had \nloaned their money to these companies. I have been a vocal opponent of \nthis misuse of TARP by both administrations.\n  In December 2008, I joined my colleagues in voting against the \ngovernment bailout of the auto industry, a vote ignored by both the \nprevious administration and the current administration.\n  Earlier this year, I supported a TARP disapproval resolution that \nwould have stopped the program dead in its tracks because of this \nmisrepresentation of the purpose for which these funds would be used. I \nhave also supported several initiatives that would have increased TARP \ntransparency and congressional oversight.\n  Then, in September, I joined many of our colleagues in sending a \nletter to Secretary Tim Geithner, at Treasury, asking him not to extend \nhis TARP authority beyond the end of this year, as the law allows him \nto do. This would have eliminated the need for the government to borrow \nmore money through this program. But, unfortunately, Secretary Geithner \nnotified Congress that he has extended TARP authority until next \nOctober.\n  Now we read that the administration is proposing using repaid TARP \nfunds; that is, money that was loaned to these large financial \ninstitutions that is now being repaid--that Treasury anticipates using \nthis for a second stimulus plan. Well, I guess that is because they \nthink the first stimulus plan worked so well.\n  You will recall, the stated objective was to hold unemployment below \n8 percent. Well, it has gone above 10 percent and, frankly, I think we \nneed to learn from our mistakes as well as things we have done right. \nIt would be a mistake to put more money, particularly TARP money, into \na new stimulus plan and have it work so ineffectively, as the first \nstimulus plan did.\n  Repaid TARP dollars cannot pay for anything. TARP is like a credit \ncard. Every dollar spent is a borrowed dollar, adding up additional \ndeficits, additional debt. Using TARP on new spending would break the \npromise the President made when he voted for TARP in this very Chamber. \nAt that time, then-Senator Obama said:\n\n       [I]f American taxpayers are financing this solution, then \n     they have to be treated like investors. They should get every \n     penny of their tax dollars back once the economy recovers.\n\n  That was then-Senator Obama, now President of the United States.\n  I would just conclude by saying, Congress should help the President \nkeep his promises, even when it seems he has changed his mind now, by \nsuggesting that we extend TARP and use TARP on a purpose that Congress \nhas never authorized and never intended.\n  It seems like the bad ideas never end when it comes to spending and \ndebt out of Washington, DC, these days. In addition to all of these \nother problems I have mentioned, I have not talked about this health \ncare bill, which would exacerbate and make much worse the deficits and \ndebt situation, and not make it better--all the time while not bending \nthe cost curve down but making things worse, raising premiums, raising \ntaxes, cutting Medicare.\n  We need to end TARP because, frankly, it is being misused in ways \nthat Congress has never authorized and never intended and, indeed, over \nthe very objections of Congress. We need to learn from our mistakes. \nFrankly, the stimulus spending, which I voted against because I thought \nit was based on an academic theory which had not been proven, which was \nthat Congress knew better than the American people how to get the \neconomy working again--by direct spending, by spending borrowed money, \nthe $1.1 trillion in the stimulus plan--we need to end these free-\nspending ways and show some fiscal responsibility. The best way we \ncould do that, in my opinion, would be to end this program which has \nbeen the subject of so much abuse and misuse.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following letter, dated January 15, \n2009, from then-Director-Designate of the National Economic Council, \nLawrence H. Summers, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            The Office of the President Elect,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 15, 2009.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Speaker,\n     House of Representatives.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Republican Leader,\n     House of Representatives.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Madam Speaker, Leader Boehner, Leader Reid and Leader \n     McConnell: Thank you for the extraordinary efforts you have \n     made this week to work with President-Elect Obama in \n     implementing the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of \n     2008. In addition to the commitments I made in my letter of \n     January 12, 2009, the President-Elect asked me to respond to \n     a number of valuable recommendations made by members of the \n     House and Senate as well as the Congressional Oversight \n     Panel. We completely agree that this program must promote the \n     stability of the financial system and increase lending, \n     preserve home ownership, promote jobs and economic recovery, \n     safeguard taxpayer interests, and have the maximum degree of \n     accountability and transparency possible.\n       As part of that approach, no substantial new investments \n     will be made under this program unless President elect Obama \n     has reviewed the recommendation and agreed\n\n[[Page S13078]]\n\n     that it should proceed. If the President elect concludes that \n     a substantial new commitment of funds is necessary to \n     forestall a serious economic dislocation, he will certify \n     that decision to Congress before any final action is taken.\n       As the Obama Administration carries out the Emergency \n     Economic Stabilization Act, our actions will reflect the \n     Act's original purpose of preventing systemic consequences in \n     the financial and housing markets. The incoming Obama \n     Administration has no intention of using any funds to \n     implement an industrial policy.\n       The Obama Administration will commit substantial resources \n     of $50-100B to a sweeping effort to address the foreclosure \n     crisis. We will implement smart, aggressive policies to \n     reduce the number of preventable foreclosures by helping to \n     reduce mortgage payments for economically stressed but \n     responsible homeowners, while also reforming our bankruptcy \n     laws and strengthening existing housing initiatives like Hope \n     for Homeowners. Banks receiving support under the Emergency \n     Economic Stabilization Act will be required to implement \n     mortgage foreclosure mitigation programs. In addition to this \n     action, the Federal Reserve has announced a $500B program of \n     support, which is already having a significant beneficial \n     impact in reducing the cost of new conforming mortgages. \n     Together these efforts will constitute a major effort to \n     address this critical problem.\n       In addition to these commitments, I would like to summarize \n     some of the additional reforms we will be implementing.\n       1. Provide a Clear and Transparent Explanation for \n     Investments:\n       For each investment, the Treasury will make public the \n     amount of assistance provided, the value of the investment, \n     the quantity and strike price of warrants received, and the \n     schedule of required payments to the government.\n       For each investment, the Treasury will report on the terms \n     or pricing of that investment compared to recent market \n     transactions.\n       The above information will be posted as quickly as possible \n     on the Treasury's website so that the American people readily \n     can monitor the status of each investment.\n       2. Measure, Monitor and Track the Impact on Lending:\n       As a condition of federal assistance, healthy banks without \n     major capital shortfalls will increase lending above baseline\n     levels.\n       The Treasury will require detailed and timely information \n     from recipients of government investments on their lending \n     patterns broken down by category. Public companies will \n     report this information quarterly in conjunction with the \n     release of their 10Q reports.\n       The Treasury will report quarterly on overall lending \n     activity and on the terms and availability of credit in the \n     economy.\n       3. Impose Clear Conditions on Firms Receiving Government \n     Support:\n       Require that executive compensation above a specified \n     threshold amount be paid in restricted stock or similar form \n     that cannot be liquidated or sold until the government has \n     been repaid.\n       Prevent shareholders from being unduly rewarded at taxpayer \n     expense. Payment of dividends by firms receiving support must \n     be approved by their primary federal regulator. For firms \n     receiving exceptional assistance, quarterly dividend payments \n     will be restricted to $0.01 until the government has been \n     repaid.\n       Preclude use of government funds to purchase healthy firms \n     rather than to boost lending.\n       Ensure terms of investments are appropriately designed to \n     promote early repayment and to encourage private capital to \n     replace public investments as soon as economic conditions \n     permit. Public assistance to the financial system will be \n     temporary, not permanent.\n       4. Focus Support on Increasing the Flow of Credit:\n       The President will certify to Congress that any substantial \n     new initiative under this program will contribute to \n     forestalling a significant economic dislocation.\n       Implement a sweeping foreclosure mitigation plan for \n     responsible families including helping to reduce mortgage \n     payment for economically stressed but responsible homeowners, \n     reforming our bankruptcy laws, and strengthening existing \n     housing initiatives like Hope for Homeowners.\n       Undertake special efforts to restart lending to the small \n     businesses responsible for over two-thirds of recent job \n     creation.\n       Ensure the soundness of community banks throughout the \n     country.\n       Limit assistance under the EESA to financial institutions \n     eligible under that Act. Firms in the auto industry, which \n     were provided assistance under the EESA, will only receive \n     additional assistance in the context of a comprehensive \n     restructuring designed to achieve long-term viability.\n       The incoming Obama Administration is committed to these \n     undertakings. With these safeguards, it should be possible to \n     improve the effectiveness of our financial stabilization \n     efforts. As I stressed in my letter the other day, we must \n     act with urgency to stabilize and repair the financial system \n     and maintain the flow of credit to families and businesses to \n     restore economic growth. While progress will take time, we \n     are confident that, working closely with the Congress, we can \n     secure America's future.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Lawrence H. Summers,\n\n                                               Director-Designate,\n                                        National Economic Council.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, we have in front of us \nappropriations bills. We have heavy matters of the deficit. We have \nheavy matters of how we are going to get the U.S. Government to get its \nfiscal house in order.\n  I remind the Senate the last time we had a surplus was in 2001. If we \nhad been wise and had not cut the revenue of this country so \nsignificantly, we could have been good stewards of that healthy surplus \nand we could have paid off the national debt over a 12-year period, and \nwe wouldn't be where we are today, but we are. While these matters are \nweighing heavily on us, it seems our attention is being continuously \ndiverted to other things, such as White House party crashers and the \nunfortunate circumstance that one of the most famous athletes, Tiger \nWoods, finds himself in.\n  We have a debate about the health care bill and it seems that during \nthe course of last summer, the whole health care debate was about one \nsubject and that was the question of the public option. We now know, \nbecause all the experts are telling us, that if we have a public option \nas a part of this health insurance exchange, the exchange itself will \nonly cover something like 15 to 20 percent max of the people, and the \npublic option would only include something like 4 million or 5 million \npeople, and that we are talking about 1.5 percent of the total folks in \nthe country. Yet the debate raged all summer as if that were the only \nissue about health reform.\n  So here we find ourselves trying to pass a health reform bill with so \nmuch attention diverted elsewhere, with people pushing and pulling and \ntugging--all the special interests--how in the world can we bring this \ntogether? How do we bring it together so we can get the high threshold \nof 60 votes in the Senate?\n  On the one hand, there are the insurance companies. The insurance \ncompanies have a huge stake. Now the insurance companies are running TV \nadvertisements all over the country trying to kill this bill because \nthey realize there is going to be a limitation on their ability to do \neverything they want to do and to charge what they want to charge and \nto cancel at will, and to have frivolous reasons such as a skin rash as \na preexisting condition and therefore we are not going to insure you. \nThat is what has led to us getting to the point of saying, ``Enough. We \nare going to pass a health insurance reform bill.''\n  Then, of course, what comes to light is suddenly, in this package \nthat was not in the package that came out of the Senate Finance \nCommittee but is in this package, there is actually a nod to the \ninsurance industry in the form of a limitation on the amount of \npayments that could be made on anyone's insurance policy in one year. \nWell, again, there is a lot of opportunity for mischief and abuse. We \nhave to correct things such as that.\n  Is there anyone who doubts that we don't need health insurance reform \nand health care reform, even though we are getting the opposite \nmessages from the insurance companies; that we are getting the opposite \nmessages from anybody who is a special interest that doesn't get \nentirely what they want? What are some of those? Hospitals, doctors, \nall kinds of health providers, medical device manufacturers, and the \nvarious interests of patients. But if you look at it, you can't get all \nthat you want, Mr. Special Interest, and instead, keep in mind the goal \nwe are trying to achieve, and that is take a system that is near tilt \nand get it on the road to reform.\n  There is another part of this reform we have to do and that is that \nthe U.S. Government cannot afford the cost escalation that is going on \nin its payment of Medicare and Medicaid. So there are reforms we can \nenact, many of which are in this bill, such as accountable care \norganizations that will follow the patient; electronic records\n\n[[Page S13079]]\n\nthat will modernize records so that any doctor or health care provider \nwho sees the patient will have up-to-date access to what has been the \ncare so that records are not lost; emphasis on a primary care physician \nwho can do a lot of preventive care before the emergency ever gets \nthere; then, of course, utilizing a lot of the miracles of modern \nmedicine including pharmaceuticals to hold off conditions so that we \ndon't get to that emergency; so that if you are not insured you end up \nat the emergency room, or even if you are insured you end up at the \nemergency room, which is the most expensive place to get care.\n  Is there a lot we can do? Yes. It is what we must do. With the hurdle \nin this Senate being so high that we have to get 60 votes to close off \ndebate, we have to be successful. It will not be pretty and it will not \nbe perfect, but it will be a step in the right direction.\n  There are portions of this proposed law that will take effect not \nimmediately but a year or two or three down the road, and if we have \nmade mistakes, we can correct those mistakes, but we must be \nsuccessful. For us to turn back now, no matter who is arguing against \nit, for us to protect a special interest, no matter who is arguing for \nit, at the expense of the greater good of health care reform, would be \na drastic mistake. Not one of us will be happy going home to our \nfamilies for Christmas if we don't enact this. It is for those reasons \nthat I feel very strongly we will be successful, as difficult and as \ntortuous as this process is. This Senator will keep pressing forward \nuntil we get that final passage.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I understand that maybe I will have my \nspeech interrupted by a unanimous consent request from the leadership, \nso if that happens, I ask that my remarks be continuous throughout the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. There has been a lot of talk over the past few days \nabout Senator Reid's so-called compromise. Although he said he has \nbroad agreement, I have yet to see any specific details. In fact, it \nsounds as though Members of his very own caucus, the Democratic caucus, \naren't aware of these details either.\n  I find it quite hard to understand how there can be ``broad \nagreement'' on something when they don't know what is in it. Of course, \nI hope we will see details very soon. An issue such as health care \nreform affecting 306 million Americans and restructuring one-sixth of \nour economy is something that should not be done in secret. And when \nthe so-called compromises come out, I would expect we would have the \nsame 72 hours on the Internet for the public and the 99 Members of this \nbody other than the leader to review them in the totally transparent \nway we have always been promised, and as this 2,074-page bill has been \ntransparent, as well as all of the amendments. Because this is one of \nthe biggest and most important pieces of legislation I have worked on \nin all of my years in the Congress. So I hope Senator Reid is not \nplanning to keep the details of his compromise under wraps and then ask \nus to vote on it. This piece of legislation is going to touch the lives \nof every single American, from the cradle to the grave, so we owe it to \nour constituents to make sure we have sufficient time to study any \nchanges to the underlying bill. We all need to remember that it is \ntheir money, the taxpayers' money, that is being spent on this bill, \nnot ours.\n  As I have said, so far, Senator Reid is keeping this ``broad \nagreement'' under wraps. So today I can only talk about what I have \nheard from my colleagues or read in the newspaper, and who knows \nwhether what the newspaper or our colleagues are surmising what this \ncompromise might be actually is.\n  I have heard the majority leader is planning to expand the already \nunsustainable Medicare Program. The idea has been met with, of course, \nstrong opposition, as we would expect from hospitals, doctors, and \nother health care providers, particularly from rural America, because \nexpanding Medicare to people ages 55 to 64 and paying Medicare rates is \ngoing to make it even more difficult for our hospitals to survive \nbecause the Federal Government only reimburses 80 percent of costs.\n  Today, with people over 65, with the government not paying more than \n80 percent, it can be offset by private sector charges by the hospitals \nto a greater amount to make it up. But if you load another tens of \nmillions of people on Medicare--and it is just about broke anyway--you \ncan see that this deficit of our hospitals is going to be greater and \nit is going to be even more difficult to make up because there will be \nfewer private-paying people to make up the deficit.\n  I said the hospital, doctors, and health care providers are bringing \nstrong opposition to this idea of expanding the Medicare Program \nbecause they fear that the largest expansion of Medicaid in history and \nan expansion of Medicare to people age 55 to 64 will drive providers \nout of business. And then what, of course, does that do for our \nseniors? It makes it even harder for low-income Americans under \nMedicaid and seniors under Medicare to have access to care. What are \nthe promises of the Federal Government in Medicare worth if you don't \nhave doctors to provide the services to the seniors when they get sick?\n  I have already spoken over the last few days about why I agree with \nthese providers and why I oppose that part of Senator Reid's so-called \ncompromise. Of course, now we have the administration's own Chief \nActuary confirming that the Medicare cuts already in this bill--in \nother words, the 2,074-page bill, without even considering the so-\ncalled Reid compromise, which we don't know what it is--the Chief \nActuary confirmed that the Medicare cuts already in the bill are so \nsevere that providers might, even now, end their participation in the \nprogram, even before you add on all the people who are 55 to 64. If the \ncompromise expands Medicare even further, then this is going to make \nthis problem even worse.\n  I also find it curious that some would even consider this a \ncompromise. For instance, Speaker Pelosi could not convince House \nDemocrats to support a government-run plan paying Medicare rates, but \nthat is exactly what Senator Reid's compromise is proposing, I have \nbeen told. That doesn't sound like much of a compromise to me.\n  In fact, let me quote another Congressman, Anthony Weiner of New \nYork, who doesn't see it as a compromise either. In fact, he sees it as \na big step toward their ultimate goal of a single-payer health plan \nwhere government is going to run everything. And you will have one \nchoice: the government plan. You won't have choices the way we have in \nAmerica today.\n  Congressman Weiner said this:\n\n       This exchange would perhaps get us on the path to a single-\n     payer model.\n\n  I don't see this as a compromise to a government-run plan. In fact, \nin some ways, it is worse because this could harm seniors' access to \ncare starting not down the road but on day one.\n  I don't want to spend too much time today talking about Medicare \nexpansion. I think I have made my feelings on this idea pretty clear. \nInstead, I would like to focus on another aspect of the supposed new \nReid compromise we are hearing about.\n  This is what we are hearing about--that the newest Reid proposal \nwould have the Office of Personnel Management operate a national health \ninsurance plan. This may sound pretty harmless at first glance, \nespecially since Senator Reid has refused to release any details, but \nthere are some very big problems with a proposal like having the Office \nof Personnel Management take over.\n  Around here, we use the term ``OPM'' for the Office of Personnel \nManagement. It is the office in charge of the Federal Government's 2 \nmillion-person workforce. One could consider OPM as the human resource \nagency or department for all of the Federal Government, dealing with \neverything from salaries to the operation of the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Program, which I think is the reason Senator Reid \nthinks this agency would be well equipped to run the largest insurance \ncompany in the country.\n  Unfortunately, a former Director of OPM disagrees. He was asked about \ngiving new responsibilities to the Office of Personnel Management. This \nformer Director, Linda Springer, said this:\n\n       I flatout think that OPM doesn't have the capacity to do \n     this type of role.\n\n\n[[Page S13080]]\n\n\n  Federal employees have also expressed concern. People in this body--\nparticularly the other party--ought to be listening to the National \nTreasury Employees Union or the National Active and Retired Federal \nEmployees Association. They have come out in opposition to this \nproposal of OPM running a national health insurance company.\n  In a Washington Post story highlighting union opposition, the author \nwrites that unions raise these concerns:\n\n       . . . legitimate concerns about expanding the size and \n     scope of OPM beyond its capacity.\n\n  So there are already concerns from a former Director and more than 5 \nmillion Federal workers and retirees and dependents that OPM is not \nequipped to handle this new responsibility. That alone should make any \nMember pause before signing on to this so-called broad agreement.\n  I also think it is important that Members are aware of some of the \nchallenges the Office of Personnel Management faces with its current \nresponsibility, without loading it down with a lot more, because being \nthe human resources department for the Federal Government is, \nobviously, no easy task. In fact, I would imagine it is a pretty \nthankless job that entails a lot of long hours.\n  Please don't misconstrue my comments as an attack on OPM, its \nDirector, or any of its employees. They do the best job they can under \ndifficult circumstances. But they are going to have real problems if \nSenator Reid's compromise does include a government-run insurance plan \noperated by OPM. If he is going to come out of nowhere with a new \nproposal to hastily hand the American health insurance system over to \nthis government agency, I think it is important for the American people \nto know what they are getting into.\n  We need to be asking some hard questions. Is this expansion of the \nFederal Government necessary? We are about to vote to raise the debt \nceiling by $1.8 trillion because the national credit card has maxed \nout. Some Members of the Senate seem intent upon increasing the size of \nthe Federal Government even more.\n  There is a second question beyond the generic one of, can you afford \nto expand the Federal Government role and expenditures. It is, should \nthe OPM, a government agency, be handed the key to the largest health \ninsurance plan in the entire country? I don't know that the current OPM \nDirector--and I would imagine he is a very nice person, and since I \ndon't know him, I don't want him to take offense to what I say. But I \nthink it is fair to point out that his position, just prior to taking \nover at OPM, was running the National Zoo. Does this really mean we \nshould put him in charge of the national health insurance plan?\n  The Office of Personnel Management has been consistently criticized \nfor being out of date and being inefficient on everything from \nprocessing national security projects to administering Federal \nbenefits. We have all heard about the massive backlog in people waiting \nfor Social Security disability benefits. Some 833,000 Americans are \ncurrently on a waiting list to see if they qualify for government \ndisability benefits, and some Members blame OPM for this backlog.\n  I am going to put a chart up here from a person whom I trust in the \nHouse of Representatives, Representative Earl Pomeroy. I think he does \nvery excellent work. He heard about this backlog. He made some comments \nabout OPM. Congressman Pomeroy is a Democrat from North Dakota and a \nmember of the very powerful House Ways and Means Committee. He said:\n\n       The Office of Personnel Management is fiddling around, \n     years go by before they can even get around to all the things \n     they have to get around to. . . .\n\n  This seems to reinforce what the government unions and the former \nDirector have expressed about OPM's ability to handle this new \nresponsibility.\n  I want to continue to quote Congressman Pomeroy:\n\n       People are being hurt, some of the most vulnerable people \n     in this country are being hurt every day because of \n     bureaucratic bungling at OPM. . . .\n\n  Senator Reid hasn't provided enough details, but Congressman \nPomeroy's comments certainly raise concerns.\n  Undermining the availability of disability benefits is bad enough, \nbut do my colleagues want to also be responsible for setting up an \nunworkable system that leaves hundreds of thousands of Americans on the \nwaiting list for their health care benefits?\n  Government agencies, whether it is the Office of Personnel Management \nor some other agency, do not have an impeccable track record. As \nPresident Reagan often said, the nine most terrifying words in the \nEnglish language are ``I'm from the government and I'm here to help.'' \nThink of a health care system with the responsiveness of Hurricane \nKatrina or think of the efficiency of the Internal Revenue Service or \nthe customer service at the department of motor vehicles. That doesn't \nsound like a recipe for real health reform to me.\n  The OPM has also taken considerable criticism for its handling of \nretiree benefits. The agency's own 2008 financial report stated:\n\n       [The Office of Personnel Management] had increased \n     difficulty keeping up with retirement claims and had a \n     decrease in the number of customers satisfied with their \n     services.\n\n  That is coming directly from the agency, saying how it is coming up \nshort responding to the needs of the American people, and particularly \ngovernment employees, and that is before we are talking about adding a \nnew government health insurance program to the responsibilities of OPM.\n  The Hill newspaper wrote this last week:\n\n       Watchdogs maintain the program is riddled with \n     inefficiencies that ultimately cost both the agency and the \n     Federal Government money.\n\n  So I think there are legitimate concerns about whether this Federal \nagency is even equipped to take on the additional responsibilities of a \nwhole new government countrywide program that is obviously a massive \nundertaking.\n  I also wonder why this proposal is even necessary. The bill already \nsets up government-run exchanges that would offer a choice of competing \nfor-profit or not-for-profit plans. My colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle have compared this system to the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program. This bill already has provisions that encourage \nnational health plans. This leads me to ask the question: Why does this \nbill need another layer of bureaucracy to create a national plan run by \na government agency?\n  Some have suggested this is just another backdoor attempt to end up \nwith a government-run plan. Another detail that has been reported \nsupports this claim. We have been told that if not enough not-for-\nprofit plans agree to contract with the Office of Personnel Management \nor if they do not meet certain affordability standards, the Office of \nPersonnel Management will have the authority to establish its own \ngovernment-run plan.\n  With some of the other provisions that are in this bill, this trigger \napproach seems to be rigged. There are at least two reasons why this is \nthe case. First, the bill undermines any ability to avoid the first \ngovernment plan trigger to make health coverage more affordable. The \nbill puts in place a bunch of new regulatory reforms, a bunch of fees, \nand a lot of taxes that will drive up premiums, making it impossible \nfor health plans to meet new affordability requirements.\n  Again, you are going to say you question this Senator's judgment \nsaying that. Do not take my word for it. The nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office, a group of professionals who do not care about politics, \npredicts premiums will be 10 to 13 percent more expensive as a result \nof this bill.\n  Then, of course, we have the second government plan trigger which \ngives the Office of Personnel Management the authority to create a \ngovernment-run plan if not enough not-for-profit national plans \ncontract with OPM.\n  Senator Reid failed to mention in announcing his broad agreement that \nthere is not one national plan in existence today, for-profit or not-\nfor-profit--not one national plan--that is offered in all 50 States. It \ndoes not exist.\n  Once again, it sounds to me like this so-called trigger is being \nrigged to shoot. I can only assume this backdoor attempt to shoehorn in \na government-run plan at the last minute happens to be an act of \ndesperation. Senator Reid and his colleagues have seen the facts. You \nhave heard them from our distinguished Republican leader. According\n\n[[Page S13081]]\n\nto a CNN poll from December 2 and 3, 61 percent of Americans oppose \nthis 2,074-page bill. At a time when the Democratic leadership is \npushing a $1.8 trillion increase in the debt limit, we learn from the \nWhite House's own Actuary that this $2.5 trillion bill, this 2,074-page \nbill bends the cost curve up by increasing health care spending. If you \ngo back to day one of this year, when we first started talking about \nhealth care reform, one of the overriding goals was to bend that cost \ncurve down. After 11 months of activity, we have a bill with that cost \ncurve going up--not one of the major goals we set out to do 11 months \nago.\n  This bill is also under pressure from opposition by the National \nFederation of Independent Business, speaking for the small businesses \nof America, the ones that do 70 percent of the net hiring. It is also \nopposed by the National Association of Manufacturers, the Chamber of \nCommerce, the National Retail Federation, and almost every other \nbusiness group across the country.\n  Because of this last-minute, desperate attempt to appease the far \nleft, this rumored new compromise now is being opposed by hospitals, \ndoctors, and other health care providers. These people were on board \nthrough most of these 11 months promising their support, and now they \nsee it going in the wrong direction.\n  With all those factors, I do not see how anyone, let alone 60 \nSenators, can vote for this bill, this last-minute, desperate attempt \nto expand Medicare and hand over private health insurance systems over \nto a Federal agency, the Office of Personnel Management. This step, if \nit materializes, has made a bad bill even worse.\n  I have another part of the bill to which I wish to speak. We have \nthis 2,074-page bill before us, and I wish to refer to just a few words \non page 2,034, way at the tail end of the bill, in section 9012 of the \nReid bill. It only takes up eight lines, but it could have a major \nimpact on millions of retirees and even on the entire U.S. economy.\n  Listen to this. The AFL-CIO, the Americans Benefits Council, and the \nBusiness Roundtable have all joined in opposition to this provision, \nsection 9012. How often do we have the AFL-CIO, the American Benefits \nCouncil, and the Business Roundtable--that roundtable is the big \ncorporations in America--joining in opposition to anything? But they \nare in opposition to section 9012 of the bill.\n  This would prohibit businesses from fully deducting a subsidy they \nreceive to maintain retiree drug coverage. The Medicare Modernization \nAct of 2003 created this subsidy to encourage businesses to keep \noffering retiree drug coverage once the Part D benefit was established \nbecause back in 2003, our goal in passing the prescription drug bill \nfor seniors was not to disturb people who already had drug coverage and \nthey liked what they had and they wanted to keep it. We did not want \nthese big corporations dumping these people off into something with \nwhich they were unfamiliar. So we helped to encourage companies and \nsave the taxpayers money. I will refer to those specific dollar figures \nin a minute.\n  In Federal tax policy, it is very unusual to provide a deduction for \na business expense, such as retiree health costs, if that expense is \nsubsidized by a Federal program. But in this case, the conferees \ndecided to provide this unusual tax treatment for compelling health \npolicy purposes, some to which I have already referred.\n  If people are satisfied with what they have, we should not pass a \nbill pushing people out of a plan they like. But it was also to save \ntaxpayers' dollars because the rationale was, it was cheaper to pay a \n$600 subsidy than to have these people forced out of their corporate \nplan and then to have the taxpayers pay an average of $1,100 that it \nwill cost if the retiree joined the Part D government plan.\n  You know what. After 6 years, so far it has worked. Millions of \nseniors have been able to keep their retiree coverage as a result of \nthis subsidy, and the Part D Program continues to come in under budget \nand also to receive high marks from our senior citizens.\n  But the provision tucked away in this 2,074-page bill on page 2034 \ncould change all that and, in fact, have severe consequences and, let \nme say, unintended consequences not just on those retirees but for the \nentire U.S. economy.\n  In an effort to pay for this massive expansion of a government-run \nhealth plan, the Reid bill proposes to eliminate the tax deductibility \nof this provision. This could cause employers all across the country to \ndrop retiree coverage. This will not only break the President's promise \nby preventing millions of seniors from keeping what they have--remember \nthat promise during the campaign--it will also cause the costs of the \nPart D Program to go up.\n  In addition, accounting rules for retiree benefits require that the \nbusinesses that do keep offering plans, offering these benefits, will \nhave to report the total revised cost on the day the bill becomes law.\n  We have an op-ed written in the Wall Street Journal about this point. \nThis could cause businesses to post billions of dollars in losses and \nsignificantly impact an already struggling economy.\n  Is this something we want to do when we still have 10-percent \nunemployment? I think the majority ought to give second thought to \nthat.\n\n  A letter sent on December 11 from the chief financial officers of \nsome of the largest employers in the country stated:\n\n       The impact of the proposed Medicare Part D changes would be \n     felt throughout the overall U.S. economy as corporate \n     entities and investors would be forced to react.\n\n  Another letter signed by the AFL-CIO stated this provision would \n``unnecessarily destabilize employer-sponsored benefits for millions of \nretirees.''\n  Once again, how often do we get these large corporations and the AFL-\nCIO singing off the same song sheet?\n  This simple provision tucked away on page 2034 is just one more in a \nlong list of policies that could have serious unintended consequences \nfor American businesses and retirees.\n  At this point, it appears the majority is so determined to get a bill \nat any cost that they will put in place bad policies and promises to \nsomehow clean up the mess later on. That is not the way to write \nlegislation. That is not what the American people were hoping for when \nthey were told Congress was going to fix the health care system. This \nprovision is just one more reason we need to scrap this product and go \nback to the drawing board.\n  In finishing, I will say what I have probably said two or three times \nbefore. We are trying to fix the health care system, health care \nreform. The word ``reform'' implies all of that. If you were having a \ncoffee klatch in rural New York or rural Iowa this very morning and one \nof us Senators dropped in on it and they started asking us about a bill \nbecause they were already talking about health care reform and any one \nof us told them it would increase taxes, it would increase health \ninsurance premiums, that it would not do anything about decreasing \ninflation of health care--in other words, costs are going to go up \nyet--and we are going to take $464 billion out of Medicare, a program \nthat is already in distress, to set up a whole new government program, \nyou know what. Every one of those people around the table would say: \nThat doesn't sound like health care reform to me. Let's not denigrate \nthe word ``reform.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe AFL-CIO.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 November 2, 2009.\n     Re Retiree health coverage\n\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Speaker: We are writing to express our serious \n     concerns regarding two provisions included in H.R. 3200, The \n     Affordable Health Care for America Act, and urge that they \n     not be included in legislation approved by Congress. Section \n     110 would curtail the ability to change retiree health \n     coverage and Section 534 would change the tax treatment of \n     subsidies provided to employers who provide retiree drug \n     coverage. Both provisions would likely have the unintended \n     effect of discouraging the provision of employer-sponsored \n     retiree health coverage, thereby undermining one of the goals \n     of health reform legislation and placing the cost and burden \n     of providing this vital coverage onto the federal government.\n\n\n                              Section 110\n\n       Retiree health coverage has long been the subject of \n     collective bargaining and is an important part of the overall \n     package of benefits and compensation negotiated between\n\n[[Page S13082]]\n\n     labor and management. By severely restricting the ability to \n     modify retiree health coverage this provision limits the \n     flexibility that parties have during negotiations. In some \n     situations, existing labor agreements already contain cost \n     sharing arrangements that would be unilaterally overridden by \n     this provision.\n       This restriction could unintentionally result in employers \n     dropping sponsorship of retiree health coverage altogether to \n     avoid future restrictions. Rising health costs and financial \n     accounting rules have resulted in a steady erosion of \n     employer-sponsored retiree coverage; and no doubt this \n     decline is the motivation for this provision. It would be \n     disastrous for millions of Americans still covered by retiree \n     health plans to see those plans severely limited or \n     eliminated altogether as employers seek to avoid being locked \n     into a particular benefit in perpetuity.\n\n\n                              Section 534\n\n       This provision of the bill would cease the current tax \n     excludability of the 28% subsidy provided to employers who \n     continue to provide prescription drug coverage to their \n     retirees. The $3 billion in federal tax revenue estimated to \n     be raised from this provision is highly unlikely to be \n     realized. The current tax treatment was included in the \n     Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 precisely to encourage \n     employers to continue sponsoring drug coverage--not only \n     helping to preserve this important benefit, but also \n     resulting in savings to the federal government by avoiding \n     the necessity of many retirees to obtain Medicare Part D \n     coverage. If only the tax revenue to be collected is \n     calculated, but not also the federal outlays to provide the \n     comparable benefit, then the actual cost to the government is \n     not being accurately considered.\n       Moreover, Congress must consider the impact of this \n     provision in the context of a\n     reformed health system, as opposed to the current system. \n     Other features of H.R. 3200, including the aforementioned \n     limits on the ability to modify retiree health coverage, \n     could well lead to an unintended and precipitous decline in \n     some of the most comprehensive health coverage protection for \n     retirees available today.\n       Finally, Congress has not considered at all the negative \n     impact, required under Financial Accounting Standard 106, on \n     the financial statements of companies that currently provide \n     retiree health coverage. Regardless of the ultimate effective \n     dates of Sections 110 and 534, accounting rules dictate that \n     immediately upon being signed into law, these provisions \n     would substantially increase the FAS 106 liability for the \n     very companies providing the most comprehensive coverage to \n     current and future retirees. In the current economic \n     environment, this would be particularly ill-advised and \n     disruptive.\n       Health care reform must be about stabilizing and expanding \n     the employer-sponsored health benefits system. These two \n     provisions would unnecessarily destabilize employer sponsored \n     benefits for millions of retirees at a time of unprecedented \n     changes in health coverage. Whatever differences the \n     undersigned organizations may have on other aspects of \n     pending health care reform legislation, on these two matters \n     both labor and management are in full agreement. We \n     respectfully urge that both these provisions be deleted from \n     the legislation under consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Diann Howland,\n       Vice President, Legislative Affairs, American Benefits \n     Council.\n     William Samuel,\n       Director, Department of Legislation, AFL-CIO.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we had indicated to Senators Reid and \nDurbin that we wanted to see if there was a way to develop some path \nforward on the health care bill, and I wish to at this point propound a \nconsent agreement that might well give us a way to move forward on some \nof the amendments that have been pending for quite some time, some of \nwhich are both supported and opposed on each side.\n  Having said that, I ask unanimous consent that after the vote on the \nadoption of the pending conference report, the Senate resume \nconsideration of H.R. 3590 under the following order; there be 2 hours \nof debate equally divided between the two leaders or their designees \nand following the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate proceed \nto a series of stacked votes in relation to the following amendments or \nmotions; a Baucus sense-of-the-Senate amendment related to taxes, the \npending Crapo motion--which I might add parenthetically has been out \nthere since last Tuesday--the Crapo motion to commit the bill related \nto taxes, then the Dorgan amendment, which is on the drug importation \nissue, No. 2793, and then a McCain amendment, No. 3200, on the same \nsubject.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the above referenced motion and \namendments be subject to an affirmative 60-vote threshold, and if they \nachieve that threshold, they become agreed to; further, if they do not \nachieve that threshold, they be withdrawn; finally, I ask that no \namendments be in order to any of the mentioned amendments and motion.\n  Before the Chair rules, I wish to make a quick point. The majority \nleader has been proposing a series of votes, which regretfully has not \nheld to our pattern of alternating back and forth. We have many people \ninterested in the pending amendments, and under the agreement I put \nforward, each side would get two votes, as we have tried to operate \nthroughout the health care debate, and then we would move forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask \nunanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with the minority leader. \nPerhaps there will be a better understanding of his unanimous consent \nrequest before I make my final decision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I wish to ask, as I understand it now, when it comes to--\nand let's set aside Crapo-Baucus and assume there is commonality in \nthat. As I understand it now, the Dorgan amendment, which would allow \nfor the importation of pharmaceuticals and drugs into the United \nStates, has been offered on our side as well as a Lautenberg amendment, \nwhich has some history in the Senate. It was previously offered by \nSenator Cochran of Mississippi and establishes a standard for \ncertification of safety of the drugs coming in.\n  Could the Senator from Kentucky describe to me what the new McCain \namendment No. 3200 does?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Well, fortunately, Senator McCain is on the floor at \nthis time, and I will ask him to describe it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I wish to say to my colleague, first of all, as is well \nknown, side-by-sides have been one side of the aisle and the other side \nof the aisle. If the Lautenberg amendment were in order on the Dorgan \namendment as a side-by-side, that would obviously be a change from what \nwe have been doing.\n  Basically, what my amendment does is make some perfecting changes to \nthe underlying Dorgan amendment. It has some sense-of-the-Senate \nprovisions and several other provisions which I think would help make \nit more effective. I have to be very honest with my friend from \nIllinois, it doesn't undermine the Dorgan amendment. I think it \nsupplements the Dorgan amendment, just as the Bennet amendment to \nMedicare costs supplemented the position we had that Medicare benefits \nwouldn't be cut.\n  So side-by-side amendments aren't necessarily in contrast with each \nother; sometimes they perfect, and I think my amendment makes it a \nbetter amendment--makes the Dorgan amendment a better proposal.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to expand the colloquy to include \nSenator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Does the amendment of the Senator from Arizona, No. 3200, \ninclude the existing language of the Dorgan amendment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes, plus some perfecting language, as far as the Senate \nis concerned, about other procedures that would expedite the Dorgan \namendment as well.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is the Senator from Arizona prepared to offer the \nLautenberg language in his amendment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. No, obviously not, because I don't agree with the \nLautenberg language in my amendment, as you know. But what we are \ntrying to do is, obviously, make the Dorgan amendment better, just as \nother amendments that are side-by-sides have tried to make amendments \nbetter. They do not necessarily cancel them out but make them better.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is the Senator from Arizona a cosponsor of the Dorgan \namendment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes, a proud cosponsor.\n\n[[Page S13083]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator from Arizona consider offering whatever \nis different in 3200 as a separate amendment to the Dorgan amendment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I guess what I am not sure--if I understand my friend, I \nam offering an amendment as a side-by-side in order to, in my view, \nimprove the Dorgan amendment; again, in all candor, not to undermine \nbut to make it better.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Well, Mr. President, I have an obligation to not only my \nleader but obviously to Senator Lautenberg, who is being dealt out of \nthe picture here with this unanimous consent request, and he has been \noffering an amendment which is well known and has been offered \npreviously by Senator Cochran of Mississippi, a Republican. At this \npoint, if Senator Lautenberg is offering--I think at this point I am \nconstrained to object based on this new McCain amendment, and we will \ndiscuss it with Senate leadership as to whether we can find a path \nthrough this.\n  This is the third day we have been struggling with this. It appears \nthere is a lot of credence put in the belief that we have to have \nexactly the same number of Republican and Democratic amendments, and I \nunderstand that from the minority point of view.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Maybe I have a solution to the problem. It actually \ninvolves my side agreeing to a procedure we have not followed \nthroughout this bill, but let me suggest the following, which I think \nwould get us out of this conundrum we seem to be in: that even though \nwe have alternated from side to side, we would agree to both Dorgan and \nLautenberg in conjunction, right after Crapo and Baucus; and then we \nget in the queue our next two--which I believe you are already familiar \nwith, because they have been discussed on the floor--the Hutchison-\nThune amendment, and then a Snowe amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And I withdraw, with great reluctance and great anger, my \namendment, because I think the Lautenberg amendment would be in \nviolation of what we have agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. In other words, Mr. President, putting it another way, \nwe are basically conceding to what the Senator had earlier proffered as \na way to get moving on the bill, and then we would get back into our \nprocess of going side to side. And we want you to know that our next \ntwo--as we have been letting each side know what the other side was \ngoing to offer--our next two would be the Snowe amendment and the \nHutchison-Thune amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me suggest this. I will formally object to the \noriginal unanimous consent request, and I will then take what I \nconsider to be a good-faith offer from your side as to the next two \namendments to the majority leader. We will review the amendments, and I \nhope even today we will be back to Senators and suggest whether that is \na path out of this.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I be clear with the Senator from Illinois that what \nthis means is we would move forward with the side-by-side Dorgan and \nLautenberg--we would agree to that--and then we would also expect \nagreement on following amendments so that we could lock those in for \ndebate and votes?\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I ask whether the two amendments the minority leader \nmentioned, which would be Thune and Hutchison, and the other amendment, \nSnowe, we would be allowed to have side-by-sides to those?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Of course.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If you would be kind enough----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If you so chose.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If you are kind enough to give us time to review that \nproposal, we will be sure to get back to you.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I understand capitulation when we do it, and we have \nessentially said to the majority we will go along with what you had \nearlier requested and we would like for you to take ``yes'' for an \nanswer and for us to wrap this up and have a sense of where we are \ngoing from here.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I promise we will get back in a timely fashion.\n  I object to the initial unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is noted.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the vote we had earlier this morning, \nmoving forward onto the omnibus spending bill that is before us, is a \nstunning statement that we are not listening to the American people; \nthat we are unaware or indifferent to the level of spending that is \noccurring in this country, which is unlike anything that has occurred \nbefore. Many have complained that President Bush overspent, and on some \noccasions he did. One expert told me recently that they have compared \nPresident Bush's misdemeanors to felony murder when you look at the \nseriousness of the spending levels that we are now undertaking in the \nbaseline budgets of the various Federal agencies.\n  This is different from the stimulus package that is already out \nthere--to spend $800 billion in stimulus funding that has been poured \ninto this economy--on top of the baseline budget spending items. So not \nonly do we have this unprecedented stimulus package from earlier this \nyear--the largest single spending bill in the history of the American \nRepublic--but we are now moving forward with baseline budget items that \nhave increases that are stunning, unjustified, irresponsible, and put \nus on a pathway to double domestic spending in far less than 10 years. \nThis is unthinkable.\n  I have to go back to the core threat we are facing, as more and more \nexperts and economists are reminding us of it. This is based on the \nCongressional Budget Office study; it is based on the budget presented \nby the President of the United States over 10 years. Earlier this year, \nhe presented us a budget. And what did it show? It showed our total \nAmerican debt in 2008 was $5.8 trillion. That is a tremendous amount of \nmoney. That is what the total debt from the founding of the American \nRepublic was--$5.8 trillion. They project that by 2013 that debt will \nincrease to $11.8 trillion--doubling in 5 years--and increasing to \n$17.3 trillion in the year 10 of the President's budget--tripling the \nnational debt.\n  They say: Well, we have an economic recession. Well, we have had \nrecessions before. We have a recession more often than every decade. We \nhad thought that, hopefully, we could maybe figure a way to avoid them, \nbut we haven't done that yet. I guess blame can go around to a lot of \ndifferent people. But I would say this does not project another \nrecession in the 10 years we are tripling the debt.\n  As I have said, we are on an unprecedented course of spending that \nhas never been seen in our country before. The only thing like it was \nduring World War II and we were in a life-and-death struggle, fighting \nwars on both the Pacific and Atlantic, and Africa--around the world. \nVirtually every able-bodied person was either in the military or \nbuilding ships and airplanes and weaponry to send to our soldiers. The \nwhole country was mobilized.\n  We never did this to our deficit then, and we did it in a way that \ncommenced a pay-down of those debts after it was over. What I wanted to \nemphasize was--many of my colleagues have heard it stated, people seem \nto all admit it--we are on an unsustainable path. This is not a \nsustainable spending schedule. Then how do we get off of it? When do we \nget off of it, if it is unsustainable?\n  Is it by producing a bill that we just voted on that increases \nspending at 12 percent, a rate of spending that would double those six \ndiscretionary spending bills' accounts in 5, 6, or 7 years? It would \ndouble it. Is that the way to get spending under control? I don't think \nso.\n  Remember, I am not counting in this 12-percent increase the stimulus \npackage that was passed. I would also note, under the budget the \nPresident submitted, the deficits in the outyears are not going down. \nThere is no projection in those 10 years that we would have a \nrecession, but there is also no projection that the deficits would be \nfalling. In fact, the deficit, in 1 year, in 2019, would be over $1 \ntrillion. So these are stunning numbers.\n  The highest deficit we have ever had was at $450 billion. The year \nbefore this year--we just concluded in September 30 of this year--$1.4 \ntrillion. Next year it will be $1.5 trillion. There should be some dip, \nwe hope, for a few years, and then it is going back up on an \nunsustainable path. It is just stunning. We cannot do this. That is one \nof the big things that is occurring in the streets of America with our \ntea parties and others. People are saying: Congress, what is the matter \nwith you? Don't you understand you are mortgaging our children's \nfuture; you are\n\n[[Page S13084]]\n\ndevaluing the dollar; you are placing our economy at risk, as virtually \nevery expert economist you talk to says, including Mr. Bernanke--not \nvery aggressively, in my view, but he said that recently. This is a bad \npath.\n  What does that mean when you have a big debt? The debt goes up. How \ndo you get the money? Where does the money come from? You have to \nborrow it. We put on the market Treasury bills and notes, and we ask \npeople to loan us the money so we can spend, spend, spend more than we \ntake in, year after year.\n  Some say it is the entitlements that are causing this, and \nentitlements are growing. That is our Social Security and our Medicare. \nOne reason those are growing is, frankly--it is a very serious reason--\nwe have more seniors and they are living longer. They have been going \nup 6 or 7 percent a year. We are troubled by that. But the truth is, \nSocial Security and Medicare have been in surplus.\n  What has happened to the surplus? It has been spent on discretionary \nspending. We are spending the Social Security surplus and Medicare \nsurplus--but it is going caput. Medicare is fading fast, and by 2017 \nthe trust fund will be exhausted. So we are not going to have a surplus \nto spend. So you borrow the money; this is what you do.\n  In 2009, we paid interest on the money that people loaned us--much of \nit from China and oil-rich States, many of which are not friendly to \nus. We are paying them huge amounts of interest--$170 billion. How much \nis that? That is a lot of money. My State of Alabama is about an \naverage size State. We are a frugal State. We don't have huge \ngovernment. We have some pretty good economic growth as a result of \nthat. But we have a $2 billion annual general fund budget--$2 billion. \nWe paid $170 billion, the United States of America, in interest alone \nin 2009.\n  Look what CBO says, our objective Budget Office. It is under the \ncontrol, really, of the Democratic majority, but they take pride in \ngiving us numbers that are valid and reliable. I think they do that for \nthe most part.\n  Look at this. They say by 2019, the interest we will be paying on the \ndebt will not be $170 billion but $799 billion because we cannot stop \nspending. It is just unthinkable.\n  People say we have to do better. This is unsustainable. We need to do \nsomething.\n  When? We just voted this morning for a bill. I don't have a chart on \nthat, but I will just read the numbers to you. It increases spending on \n6 of the 13 appropriations bills. We try to pass them individually, 13 \nappropriations bills that fund the Federal Government. When we get to \nthe end, it is easier sometimes for the leadership just to cobble all \nsix of them together in a big package and put it out there and say vote \nup or down. That is what we have done. That is not a good policy. We \nneed to do better than that. We really need 2-year budgeting, and then \nwe would have time to bring up these bills one by one and give them the \nscrutiny they deserve. But if we look at the overall spending in these \n6 bills, 6 of the 13 that have been put together in a package, it shows \nthat the percentage of growth in spending on the baseline level is 12 \npercent.\n  That is a stunning figure, when you think about it. What is the \ninflation rate today? Zero. We do not have inflation. The last number \nwas .2 percent deflation over the past year. The average family is \ncontaining their spending. Ask the average city mayor. Aren't they \ntrying to contain spending and be more efficient and be leaner and more \neffective? What about our State governments? The same thing. They are \nfacing real problems, and they are trying to contain the growth of \nspending and we increase it by 12 percent.\n  What kind of increase did the average working American get in their \nsalary? Probably zero and lucky to hold it. If they had been getting \novertime, they are probably not getting overtime today. Maybe in the \nfamily two people were working, maybe now only one is working.\n  What about the State Department and foreign operations, what kind of \nincrease did they get? A 33-percent increase in spending, most of which \nI assume will be spent around the world somewhere.\n  What about Transportation and HUD? I have a chart on that. I just \nhave the last 2 years since our colleagues have been in the majority. \nLast year it was a 12.3-percent increase--a stunning increase. Look at \nthis year, 2010--23-percent increase on HUD, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, and Transportation; 23 percent on top of 12. This is the \nkind of spending that would double the HUD budget in 3 to 4 years. The \nforeign operations, I just mentioned, at the rate of increase we have, \nit would double in 2 to 3 years. The whole budget would double in 2 to \n3 years.\n\n  Let's talk about Transportation/HUD. Did they get any money out of \nthe stimulus package? You are counting that in here, aren't you, \nSenator Sessions, the money that Transportation/HUD got out of it?\n  No, I am not. This is baseline spending. What did they get? The total \nTransportation/HUD budget--I hope my colleagues will think about these \nnumbers--is $68 billion this year. Remember, I just noted interest in \n2019 would be $800 billion. That gives some perspective on the level of \nspending we have. But, again, that is just the baseline spending, and \nit does not count the $62 billion of spending that came out of the \nstimulus package, according to this chart. Remember, only a small \npercentage of the stimulus package went to highways. They said it was \nfor bridges and infrastructure and highways, and I think about 4 \npercent of the overall amount went to highways. Now they are claiming \nwe don't have enough money for highways and they talk about another \nstimulus bill of another couple of hundred billion dollars--just \nanother $100 billion, $200 billion.\n  Remember, $100 billion--the entire Transportation-HUD expenditure \nthis year is $68 billion.\n  I don't think this is any kind of exaggeration. I am not an alarmist, \nbut I am alarmed because I am telling the truth about these numbers.\n  What have we done on previous spending bills that have come through \nthe Senate? Two other bills have already come through the Senate and \nhad stunning increases in them. Look at this. This is Interior and the \nEnvironment expenditures--Department of the Interior and the \nEnvironment--EPA, basically. Look at that: 16.6 percent increase in 1 \nyear. It had a tight budget last year, but it had a 16-percent increase \nthis year. The EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, which now is \nclaiming the ability to regulate CO2, they got a 33-percent \nincrease in spending. EPA got a 33-percent increase in spending. We \nhave never seen those kinds of numbers before.\n  Look at these expenditure growth items over the last number of years. \nWhen President Bush was in, everybody said he was a spendthrift, that \nPresident Bush put us in debt.\n  Democrats say: We are not doing anything. This is a President Bush--\nit is all his fault. He was a big spender.\n  I criticized him some for overspending. A lot of Republicans have. \nBut look at his averages for those Interior and Environment \nappropriations.\n  It averaged 1 percent from 2001 to 2009, so he was holding the line. \nHe had some 5-percent years, 5.6, but some negative years too. So the \naverage was a modest 1 percent. Remember, 16 percent growth in spending \nat a time when inflation is zero.\n  Another example of that--let's take the Agriculture bill. I believe \nin agriculture. I have tried to support most of these bills. I have \nworried sometimes that we were spending too much on agriculture. But I \ncan't vote for this. We have already moved this legislation through the \nSenate, the Agriculture appropriations discretionary spending. Here we \nhad in 2004 a minus 1 percent, zero in 2005, zero in 2006, a 6-percent \njump in 2007, 1.1 percent in 2008, now 15 and 14.5 percent increases. \nHow can we say we are responsible when we are doing that? We were \nhaving deficits through these years.\n  We have never seen deficits averaging $1 trillion a year, which is \nbasically what is going to occur under President Obama's budget. I wish \nit weren't so. I wish I didn't have to make this speech, because these \ndeficits are dangerous to the American economy.\n  These numbers remain here are stunning numbers. The only one that got \na modest increase was for the men and women in uniform of the Defense \nDepartment. But State and Foreign Ops,\n\n[[Page S13085]]\n\n32.8-33 percent; Interior, 16.6; Commerce-Justice-Science, 12.3 \npercent; T-HUD, 23 percent; Agriculture, 14 percent; Defense, 4.1. That \nshould tell us something about maybe where the priorities are around \nhere. It is troubling to me.\n  What do the American people think about this? I have heard a lot of \nmy colleagues say: We have a recession and we have this war that is \ngoing on. We just have to spend more. The American people understand \nthat. It is all right. We just want to do this, and let's do it.\n  Look at this poll that came out recently. Actually, it was November, \nlast month, a CNN poll. The question was, Which of the following comes \nclose to your view of the budget deficit: The government should run a \ndeficit, if necessary, when the country is in a recession and at war or \nthe government should balance the budget even when the country is in a \nrecession and is at war. Sixty-seven percent say balance the budget. \nFirst, they know this isn't World War II. We have a very expensive war. \nWe need to make sure our men and women are well funded. But it is not \nthe driving factor in the deficits we are having today. Only 30 percent \nsaid, run a deficit. Four percent had no opinion. Sixty-seven percent \nsaid we ought to have a balanced budget, even in a time of war and \nrecession.\n  There are other problems. There are ramifications that arise from \nthis kind of reckless spending. It has been a catch line for a number \nof our colleagues who support this health care bill that it would \nreduce the deficit. Past history with entitlements has shown that is \nnot so. Estimates don't prove to be accurate, No. 1. No. 2, there are \ngimmicks in this health care bill that hide its true cost. I will \nmention one of them for the moment.\n  One of the big ones is that we don't pay the doctors. The doctors are \nprojected, after this next year and for 9 years under this budget \nscheme, to take a 23-percent cut in their payments for the work they do \nfor Medicare--a 23-percent cut. Many doctors already are leaving \nMedicare and Medicaid because they are not paid enough. They are paid \nsubstantially less by the U.S. Government for Medicare and Medicaid \nthan private insurance companies pay them for the work they do.\n  That was part of the plan to fix Medicare, to fix permanently the \npayments for our physicians. When the numbers didn't add up--and if you \npaid the physicians what you are supposed to pay them, it would cost \n$250 billion over 10 years--they attempted to take the doctor fix \npayment and put it in a separate bill, every penny of it going to the \ndebt, saying: Our health care bill is deficit neutral. The health care \nbill is deficit neutral. I am voting for a bill that is not going to \nimpact the debt.\n  Well, when you move a $250 billion hole out of your bill and put it \nover here, that is one way to hide what you are doing. If you count \nthat, we have a $120 billion deficit in the bill by the scoring of our \nown colleagues. They just took that out because the numbers wouldn't \nadd up if it were in. It is wrong. It is the kind of gimmicks and \nmanipulation the American people are getting tired of. Some people are \ngoing to pay at the ballot box for continuing this kind of thing.\n  Let me give some examples of how even the estimates of these bills \nfundamentally turn out to be wrong. In 1967, the estimate for how much \nMedicare would cost in 1990 was $12 billion. They projected how much \nMedicare would cost in 1990. What was the actual cost in 1990? It was \n$98 billion, not $12 billion. That means the estimates were off by a \nfactor of 8. In 1987, Congress estimated that Medicaid payments to \nhospitals would cost $1 billion in 1992. That was just 5 years out. The \n5-year projection was Medicaid payments to hospitals would be $1 \nbillion. What was the actual cost? It was $17 billion, meaning the \nestimate was off by a factor of 17 in only 5 years.\n  This kind of recklessness jeopardizes our economy. I don't think this \nspending is helping our economy because I think what is occurring is \nthat people who invest in the future, hundreds of millions, maybe \nbillions of dollars in big factories, are worried about our \nrecklessness. They are worried about future economic stability. They \nare not as willing to invest because we are not acting responsibly.\n  Stanford University economist Michael Boskin stated in a recent \neditorial in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       The explosion of spending, deficits and debt foreshadows \n     even higher prospective taxes on work, saving, investment and \n     employment. That not only will damage our economic future but \n     is harming jobs and growth now.\n\n  There is too much truth in that.\n  Brian Riedl at the Heritage Foundation, on October 6, in the \nWashington Times, did an op-ed that said that estimates on the size of \nthe deficits I have just given are likely to be wildly optimistic. When \nI said the debt triples from $5.8 to $17.3 trillion, I am not including \nhealth care in those numbers. It hasn't passed. That is not current \nlaw. They didn't count that in the numbers when they were scoring it. \nHe notes that the President assumed that spending would only increase \nat the rate of inflation for 9 years after 2010, after he included an \n8-percent increase for spending in 2010.\n  The President's deficit estimates also assume interest rates lower \nthan those in the 1980s or 1990s. Once all the factors in Mr. Riedl's \nanalysis are added up, he projects a total deficit for the next 10 \nyears to be $13 trillion--an unsustainable level for sure and well \nabove what CBO has scored. He is projecting higher interest rates on \nthe debt because so much money would be borrowed worldwide. How do you \ninduce people to loan you money? You have to offer them higher interest \nrates to get them to loan you money. They will not be loaning money at \nthe low interest rates we have today because of this economic slowdown. \nInterest rates are going up. CBO acknowledges that in their score. The \nHeritage scholar said it is going to go up higher than CBO had scored.\n  An October 14 New York Times article said that the reason we are not \npressing China to appreciate its currency, to stop devaluing its \ncurrency against ours is because we rely on them to purchase our debt.\n  Dong Tao, an economist at Credit Suisse, said:\n\n       Obama's interest is not to push China to appreciate its \n     currency, but to get them to pay the bills.\n\n  In other words, to get them to keep buying our Treasury bills so we \ncan keep borrowing money.\n  Small manufacturers all over the country, including Alabama, have \nsuffered from China's undervalued currency. They not only have a wage \nadvantage over us to a significant degree, they also don't have the \nenvironmental laws we have. They also devalue their currency--all of \nwhich makes them more able to undercut American companies' \nmanufacturing and adversely compete against them. I am constantly \nhearing about it from my State. I know others are hearing the same \nthing.\n  However, China and other countries may not be able to keep financing \nour debt in the future. Professor Allan Meltzer, a well-known scholar \non the Federal Reserve and monetary policy, noted in a column in the \nWall Street Journal that our current and projected deficits are too \nlarge relative to current and prospective world savings to rely on \nother countries being able to finance them for the next 10 years. We \njust can't expect to be able to have that much wealth out there in \nterms of our own citizens saving money to buy the Treasury bills and \ndebt of the United States. Other countries are not going to have it \neither.\n  In a Budget Committee hearing on budget reform, November 10, former \nComptroller of the Currency and GAO David Walker testified that by \n2040--time flies faster than we like to admit--we will have to double \ntaxes to keep current with our commitments. This is the former \nComptroller General of the United States, the head of the GAO, the \nGovernment Accountability Office. He knows these numbers, and he has \nbeen very concerned about our reckless spending for quite a number of \nyears. He is basically committing himself to trying to get this country \non a sound financial track. Mr. Walker stated that in 12 years, \ninterest will be the single biggest line item in the budget, even \nassuming interest rates don't change from today's low rates. But \ninterest rates are going to go up, at least some. He also said that \ndebt and deficits are the public's largest concern by 20 points in the \nopinion polls.\n  That is what I am hearing from my constituents. They want some \nleadership up here. They want us to say: We would like to be able to \nprovide more\n\n[[Page S13086]]\n\nfor this, that, and the other. But we simply have to get our house in \norder. And in the long run, if we hold the line now, we can get this \nhouse back into order. I believe we can. But we cannot on the path we \nare today. In a Financial Times editorial in May of this year, Mr. \nWalker warned that the United States is in danger of losing its triple-\nA financial credit rating. Well, is that possible that the United \nStates of America would not have the highest credit rating in the \nworld? Mr. Walker said it is possible. He made that comment in May of \nthis year.\n\n  Of course, if you do not have the highest credit rating, you have to \npay higher interest rates to get people to buy your debt, to loan you \nmoney. So if you want to loan two people money, and one is rock solid, \nyou might loan it to them for 4 percent. But if another person is \nrisky, you may want 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 percent from them.\n  So Moody's rates people to see how reliable they are in paying their \ndebt back with dollars worth the same as you loan them. Mr. Walker \nwarned that our reckless spending was putting us on a path where we \nwould no longer have our triple-a credit rating.\n  Well, sure enough, in a report just this week, the big rating \nservice, Moody's, stated that the U.S. is in danger of losing its \ntriple-A credit rating. Pierre Cailleteau, chief international \neconomist at Moody's, stated that unlike several years ago, ``now the \nquestion of a potential downgrade of the U.S. is not inconceivable.''\n  Well, that would make the interest payment of $799 billion for 1 \nyear, in 2019, be low. If we get downgraded, that interest payment is \ngoing to go up.\n  So under the most pessimistic scenario put forward by Moody's, the \nUnited States would lose its top rating in 2013.\n  This is a great country. We have such dynamic people and economy. \nThey are willing to work. They are willing to compete. They are willing \nto save and all. But we need some leadership, and we need some \nleadership from Congress. We are oblivious to what the American people \nare telling us, and we are oblivious to the massive debt increases we \nare putting on the American people.\n  Therefore, this bill that cloture was invoked on today, should not \npass because having a 12-percent increase in spending, which would \ndouble that whole bill's financial spending in--what?--5, 6, or 7 \nyears, is unthinkable at this point in time, and I am against it. I \nhate to be against it. I see a lot of things in there I like. But I do \nnot believe the Republic is going to sink into the ocean if we would \nhave a 1- or 2-percent increase in spending for these six bills. I do \nnot believe everything is going to collapse if we were to have a little \nfrugality around here--give up some of our pork spending, give up some \nof our special projects and focus on what is the national interest for \na change, and try to contain the surging growth of spending.\n  I do not know when it is going to occur. Everybody says we have to \nstop. So when? I say now. I say, let's send this bill back. Let's do \nnot pass this bill. Let's send it back to the conferees and the \nappropriators and say: Come back with a bill that is more responsible. \nThen we will pass it. We are not going to not pass legislation to fund \nthese things. Don't let anybody say that.\n  But the question is, What kind of increases can we justify? I am \nworried about it. The American people are worried about it. Soon \nCongress needs to get worried about it. If not, we are going to have \nsome new people in Congress, and some new people are going to fix it \nbecause it can be fixed if we show determination.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak about health \ncare and the bill that is on the Senate floor that we have been \ndebating now for a number of days, the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act. I want to provide, first, a brief overview, but in \nparticular to focus on provisions that relate to our children and then \nget into some detail about those provisions and the important programs \nthat are contained within those parts of the bill.\n  First of all, as we all know from the debate, what this side of the \naisle has been trying to do is not just to pass legislation, but to do \nit in a way that meets the goals we set forth many months ago and, as \nwell, what President Obama indicated much earlier this year in terms of \nsome basic goals.\n  I will just cite a few of those: To make sure when we are enacting \nlegislation that we do not add to the deficit; that we at least break \neven, so to speak. But the good news is, on the scoring done by the \nCongressional Budget Office, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct will actually lower--lower--the deficit over 10 years by some $130 \nbillion, and then lower it even further over the course of the next 10 \nyears, by one estimate, over $600 billion. So that is good news about \ndeficit reduction as it relates to this bill. Even if we broke even, it \nwould be significant.\n  Also, we are obviously trying to cover tens of millions of Americans \nwho do not have coverage. The foundation of the bill on that issue is \nthat some 94 percent of the American people will be covered, adding \nsome 30 million to 31 million in terms of coverage. That is also a \ngoal. I think we are going to be able to meet that.\n  Then there are a whole series of things we have talked and talked \nabout for years and have never done. We talk about how we have to \nenhance health care quality. We have not done much about it, and we are \ngoing to be able to make changes in this bill to do that.\n  Certainly prevention. Everyone knows--the studies on this are, in a \nword, irrefutable--that prevention is not only good for a patient and \ngood for his or her own family, and good for the economy long term \nbecause you are going to have a healthier worker, but it is also a \ngiant cost saver, sometimes in a way that you cannot quantify or even \noften get credit for from the Congressional Budget Office.\n  I have no doubt--and I think I join a lot of other people who know a \nlot more about prevention than I do--that this will be a huge cost \nsaver in addition to being something that leads to better health \noutcomes. So in terms of quality and prevention and deficit reduction \nand coverage, it is a very strong bill.\n  It is also a strong bill in terms of dealing with what we can call, \nin two words, consumer protections. That does not even begin to \ndescribe what this bill will do in terms of helping at least one \ncategory of Americans. We saw a study a couple months ago that \nindicated over a several-year period of time--if my recollection serves \nme, 3 years--millions of Americans--not thousands or tens of thousands, \nbut millions of Americans--have been denied coverage because of a \npreexisting condition. That is because we have allowed insurance \ncompanies to do it year after year, and in some cases a lot longer than \nthat.\n  Well, we do not need to just talk about it and decry it and condemn \nit, we need to make it illegal. But we also have to make sure we do not \njust pass legislation--a lot of which has to be implemented down the \nroad--and then say to those with preexisting conditions: We have \nchanged the law, but you have to wait several years.\n  One of the immediate benefits under the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act relates to those Americans who have preexisting \nconditions. The act will provide $5 billion in immediate Federal \nsupport for a new program to provide affordable coverage to uninsured \nAmericans with preexisting conditions. Coverage under the program will \ncontinue until the new exchanges are operational. That is good news for \nmillions of Americans who have been denied coverage.\n  I cannot tell you--I think every Senator in this Chamber on both \nsides of the aisle, Democrat, Republican, Independent--has received \nletters from Americans, horrific, tragic stories, in many instances, \nwhere they have been denied coverage, sometimes leading to death, \nsometimes leading to, even if it is not death, the worst of health care \noutcomes. So that high-risk pool, as it is called, for those with \npreexisting conditions will mean immediate benefit under the bill.\n  I will mention a couple of other things that will happen immediately, \nand then I will move to the provisions on children. We hear a lot about \nbusiness on this floor and arguments about who is stronger or who is \nmore of an advocate for small business especially. But what we do not \nsay enough is, this\n\n[[Page S13087]]\n\nact, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, will offer tax \ncredits to small businesses to make employee coverage more affordable, \nand those tax credits will go up to 50 percent of premiums, which will \nbe available to firms that choose to offer coverage.\n\n  That is another not just good reform--good for the small businesses, \ngood for the employee, and really good for our economy short term and \nlong term--but it is one of those immediate benefits.\n  I will cite one more, and then I will move on.\n  This Congress, a couple years ago, passed Medicare Part D, as it is \nknown, adding prescription drug coverage. One of the adverse impacts \nfrom that legislation is, an older citizen gets the benefit of that and \nis able to benefit from the prescription drug coverage, but then they \nfall into the so-called doughnut hole. That is a very innocent-sounding \nphrase, ``doughnut hole.'' It does not sound that bad. It is a \nnightmare for someone.\n  Basically, what it means is that an older citizen has to carry the \nwhole freight for a long time and pay a lot of money at a certain \nperiod of time when they fall within that category.\n  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will reduce the size \nof the so-called doughnut hole by raising the ceiling on the initial \ncoverage period by $500 in 2010. That is another immediate benefit of \nthe enactment of this bill.\n  The act will also guarantee 50-percent price discounts on brand-name \ndrugs and biologics purchased by low-income and middle-income \nbeneficiaries up to the coverage cap. That is another immediate \nbenefit.\n  These are benefits in terms of small business, in terms of covering \nthose with preexisting conditions immediately, as well as helping older \ncitizens deal with and manage the difficult doughnut hole problem so \nmany of them have been suffering from.\n  Let me do a quick summary. I will start with this chart. As shown on \nthis chart, this is just a summary of some of the challenges of where \nwe are now and what happens if we do nothing. It says: Status Quo is \nUnacceptable and Unsustainable. That is an understatement.\n  The first bullet point on there: Every week, 44,230 people are losing \ntheir health insurance coverage. So every week that goes by, every day \nthat goes by, we have Americans losing their coverage--bad for the \nindividual and their family, and it is real bad for our economy.\n  The second bullet point: Between January 2008 and December 2010--\nroughly you are looking there at a 3-year type period--178,520 \nindividuals in Pennsylvania are projected to lose their health care \ncoverage. There is no way to adequately describe the adverse impact \nthat projection and that data point has on the people of Pennsylvania. \nYou cannot have a growing economy if people are losing their health \ncoverage. The numbers are spiraling out of control, not only in \nPennsylvania but across the country. You cannot sustain any economy \nthat way long term.\n  The third and final bullet point: Without reform, family coverage \nwill cost $26,679 in 2016--just 7 years from now--consuming 51.7 \npercent of projected Pennsylvania family median income. The cite is the \nNew American Foundation.\n  That same number for the country--in other words, the percentage of \nmedian family income going to pay for health care--for health care, \nsomething so fundamental and basic in our society--it is 51.7 percent \nin Pennsylvania in 2016. The good news for the rest of the country is \nthat the national average is only--only--a little more than 45 percent.\n  I have not met a person in Pennsylvania or anywhere else in this \ncountry, but I know I have not met a person in Pennsylvania who says: \nDo you know what. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about passing any \nhealth care reform bill. Don't worry about getting it done because in \n2016--I am living in Pennsylvania--I can come up with 51.7 percent of \nmy income for health care. Don't worry about it. I can handle it.\n  We know no one can afford that. Even a family of tremendous means \nmight have trouble affording more than half their income--half their \nincome--to pay for health care.\n  What if the projection is wrong? What if it is off by 10 percentage \npoints? That is 40 percent. What if it is wrong even more? What if it \nis only 30 percent? I do not know of a family who can afford that.\n  So we have a lot of reasons to get this right and to pass the bill. \nThat projection is one of the most horrific.\n  Now I will move to the chart on children.\n  I will give just a quick summary of what the bill does for children, \nand then we will walk through the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  A couple of basic points: pediatric benefit package; that comes with \nthis legislation, including oral and vision coverage for children. Many \nhealth plans do not provide that kind of coverage. It is one of those \nunwritten stories--or if it has been written, it has not been written \nabout enough--where children lose out, sometimes even in a good health \ncare plan for their parents. So it is not good enough to say, well, we \nhave some coverage here and kids will be just OK. Children, as the \nadvocates remind us all the time--these are not my words--are not small \nadults. They have different health care needs, and they have different \nhealth care problems and challenges.\n  Pediatric benefits, as part of the benefit package, is a dramatic \nchange and a very important change.\n  This bill will not only require coverage for basic pediatric services \nunder all health plans but also oral and vision needs, which improve a \nchild's ability to learn and perform in school. So we can't talk about \ngetting better test scores in school and doing all kinds of things that \nare in our education system if a child is not given the basic health \ncare a child needs, not the health care an adult needs.\n\n  The second point under what the bill would do is more pediatric \nproviders. We have to have strategies in place to recruit and \nincentivize and train more pediatricians. You can't just say you want \nmore coverage for kids and throw more money at it; you need to have the \nworkforce to do it. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will \nexpand the workforce, including pediatricians, pediatric nurse \npractitioners, specialists in pediatrics, and pediatric oral health \nprofessionals to give kids what they should have in this country of \nours where we know what works. We know exactly what works when it comes \nto children's health insurance.\n  Then, providing greater quality, improving the quality of coverage \nfor children. The preventive health care we are going to provide for \nchildren is dramatic.\n  Finally, let me make a point about children overall. We hear a lot of \ndiscussion about where health care--what part of the country benefits \nthe most and who will benefit the most. Well, under this legislation, \nthere is not an American, I believe, who will not be positively \nimpacted one way or another, sometimes directly. But one message came \nout loudly and clearly during the debate on children's health insurance \ngoing back a number of years in the Senate. Often, most people think of \nchildren under the benefit of the Children's Health Insurance Program \nas living in urban areas maybe or in a big city because that is where \npoverty is highest and, therefore, lower and middle-income families \nbenefit from Medicaid or children's health insurance. That is largely \ntrue, for sure. But what came through to me in that debate many years \nago--several years ago now--is something I never knew before, which is \nthat one-third of rural children in America are the beneficiaries of \neither Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program. Not many \npeople heard that until a couple years ago. So this isn't about one \nspecific demographic--or geographic, I should say--location where \nchildren are and who need these benefits, where there is Medicaid or \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program. We know this is a problem for \nrural children, for urban children, for children who live in small \ntowns, and even in suburban communities that are perceived to be a \nlittle more secure economically.\n  When I have been talking about what we have to do for children, I \noften point to a line from the Scriptures, a very simple line, but I \nthink it holds us accountable in this debate as it relates to children. \nThere is a line in the Scriptures that says, ``A faithful friend is a \nsturdy shelter.'' The question we\n\n[[Page S13088]]\n\nhave to ask when we are debating how we are going to help our children \nin this legislation is: Will we be a faithful friend to children? It is \nactually a pretty simple question, with profound, almost incalculable \nimplications. Are we going to be that sturdy shelter for children, \nchildren who don't have a voice, who don't have economic power, who \ndon't have a lobbyist showing up on Capitol Hill every day saying: Take \ncare of this child or help this group of children. So the question for \nthe Senate, one of many questions we have to answer by the end of this \ndebate is: Will we be a sturdy shelter for children? Will we be a \nfaithful friend to children?\n  Let me conclude with a couple remarks about the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, in particular. My colleagues can see up here, in \nPennsylvania--this is typical of a number of States but not every \nState--through Pennsylvania's Children's Health Insurance Program \nbenefits, children are guaranteed to receive comprehensive insurance \ncoverage, including the following:\n  Every child should have this. I don't care who they are or where they \nlive or what their economic status is, they should have immunizations. \nThey should have routine checkups, prescription drugs, dental care, \nmaternity care for their mothers, mental health benefits, up to 90 \ndays' hospitalization per year, durable medical equipment, substance \nabuse treatment, partial hospitalization for mental health services, \nand, finally, rehabilitation therapies and home health care. That whole \nmenu of benefits for children is not some theory or some hope, in a \nsense; this is what the Children's Health Insurance Program means to \nAmerica's children, their parents, their family, and, I would argue, \nthis is about economic development in the long run.\n  This is about developing a high-skilled workforce. If a child has \nthese benefits in place, they can make it in life, with a couple other \nbreaks and some other incentives. But if they don't have this list and \nthey don't have the best possible health care, they are going to be in \na lot of trouble. All of us will be in trouble because our economy will \nnever be as strong as it can be and must be unless we do that.\n  Let me go to the next chart, which is a subset of that. This chart \ndepicts what is in children's health insurance now: Well-child visits. \nI have talked about that a lot. It is not a real glitzy subject for \npeople to debate but a critically important part of what children's \nhealth insurance means and the benefits mean, a well-child visit. In \nthe course of 1 year, under the Children's Health Insurance Program--\nunder the program we put in place and Congress enacted almost 15 years \nago and then we reauthorized it just this year and President Obama \nsigned the legislation--it means, instead of 7 million kids covered--\nthat is a great amount and that is great, but in a couple years, we are \ngoing to be able to expand that to 14 million children. I wish to make \nsure--and I am sure this view is shared across the aisle as well--that \nevery child should have six of those well-child visits in a year. It is \na key time for a parent and physician to communicate. Doctors recommend \nsix visits in the first year. They get a complete physical examination, \nincluding height, weight, and other developmental milestones are \nmeasured. Hearing and vision are checked. We have all had the \nexperience where a child doesn't get those kinds of basic checks and \nthey have a hearing problem because it wasn't detected early or a \nvision problem. One of my four daughters had a vision problem. It \nwasn't caught at an early enough stage and we had some real \ndifficulties making sure she had the right care.\n  Important topics discussed, including normal development. What does \nthat mean? A doctor should be able to talk to a parent about that, and \nthe program covers that. Nutrition, sleep, safety, infectious diseases, \nand then general preventive care. Why should there even be a debate \nabout whether children get this? The good news is, we have a program \nthat does that and the good news is also that we have just expanded \nthat program.\n  Here is where the challenge comes in. In the midst of health care \nreform, the House of Representatives did a lot of good things in their \nbill. One thing they did not do well is make sure the Children's Health \nInsurance Program is as strong as it needs to be and must be, and that \nis the reason why I received the following letter. I will not read the \nwhole letter, but this letter came from Barbara Ellis. She is in \nBroomall, PA. I spoke to her a couple days ago about her letter. I will \nnot read all of it, but I think it describes pretty aptly what we are \ntalking about.\n  Barbara and her husband Ben live in Delaware County, PA, in Broomall. \nShe says:\n\n       We are a one income family with two sons, ages 6 and 8. Due \n     to the high price of health insurance my children are \n     currently covered under the free Pennsylvania Children's \n     Health Insurance Program.\n\n  That is the good news. But here is the part where she is worried:\n\n       We qualify for free Children's Health Insurance coverage in \n     Pennsylvania, but my husband's income is greater than 150 \n     percent of the Federal poverty level which means our children \n     won't qualify for the coverage under the House's proposed \n     plan.\n\n  Then she says--probably the most important part of this whole letter: \n``This has us terrified.''\n  So it would any parent who does not have the peace of mind to know, \nwhen they fall asleep at night, they don't have to worry about whether \ntheir children have health insurance. But if we don't do the right \nthing, she will have that sense of terror. She says this as she \nconcludes the letter:\n\n       It would help us tremendously if you could support keeping \n     the Children's Health Insurance provisions intact which \n     would, in turn, support families like ours.\n\n  That is what I have done by way of an amendment to our bill to make \nsure we strengthen what the House did and strengthen even our own bill. \nOur children's health insurance amendment, which I will not go through \ntoday, strengthens and safeguards the program through 2019 and beyond \nto address any changes health care reform may bring.\n  We will talk more about it, but this is key to be able to make sure \nwe have not just a set of benefits for children that are directly tied \nto their care and will help them for decades afterward and help our \neconomy and give their families peace of mind but also that in the \nprocess of making sure we keep these kinds of benefits, we keep the \nprogram strong, not just until 2013 but at least all the way to 2019. I \nthink we can do that. I think we can do that in the midst of this \ndebate and get it right and give families and especially children that \nkind of protection.\n  In a word, what we have to make sure we do is to ensure that the \nSenate and the Congress and this administration do everything they can \nto prove and to demonstrate that we are a faithful friend to children, \nthat we will always be their sturdy shelter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I appreciate the good Senator from \nPennsylvania and his discussion and his clear and constant focus on \nchildren and children's health. I wish to commend him for his good work \nand for always reminding us of the importance of our children in so \nmany aspects of our policies. So I thank him for that.\n  I, too, rise this afternoon to talk about the debate on health care \nand the debate we seem to have ongoing with the numbers. Whether it is \nnumbers that are coming out from the Congressional Budget Office, the \nCBO, or from our States or from other noteworthy entities, there is a \ngreat deal of back and forth as to whose numbers are right, whose \nnumbers are wrong.\n  There has been a great deal of discussion in the past day or so about \nthe numbers we have received and the analysis we received from the \nOffice of the Actuary, from CMS, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices. The Chief Actuary is Mr. Richard Foster. A good deal of \ndiscussion has been had as to these numbers, and the question that \nneeds to be asked is: Why would the numbers from the CMS Actuary be any \nmore significant than, say, what we have seen coming out of the \nCongressional Budget Office?\n  The Chief Actuary of CMS is kind of the independent arbiter, if you \nwill. They look at both the private and public health care \nexpenditures. The Chief Actuary provides actuarial details that I think \nwe recognize can be critically important for certainly my State and\n\n[[Page S13089]]\n\nfor any of our States' economists to develop individual State estimates \nof the financial impacts, the effects of the health care reform \nproposal.\n  As important as discussion on the broader scale is, the people back \nin my State want to know: Well, what does it mean for us in Alaska? \nWhat does it mean for increased access? What does it mean for us in \nterms of our premiums? Are they going up? Are they going down? How do \nwe as a State that is very unique in its markets--geographically \ndislocated, smaller population--how does this health care reform \nproposal impact us? So the numbers and the assessment we have received \nfrom the Office of the Actuary are very important.\n  I have mentioned we all want to know what this Democratic health care \nproposal will mean to us as individuals in terms of the increase to \npremiums, the impact on the long-term sustainability of Medicare, \nwhether it is going to restrict access to care in a State such as \nAlaska or throughout rural America. And ultimately, will this $2.5 \ntrillion bill bend this cost curve down on health care expenses that \nare pricing so many Americans out of the market on health insurance.\n\n  I think it is so important that we be focused on the cost side and on \nthe spending side. That is a bipartisan thing. We haven't done a lot \nthat is bipartisan of late, but it is clear we all want to know we are \ndoing all we can effectively to reduce those costs.\n  I will note a letter that came from six colleagues on the Democratic \nside. This was sent when the Finance Committee bill was being \nconsidered. A letter went out to Chairman Baucus that provided that:\n\n       There are many wide-ranging options to address the broad \n     and complicated issues of runaway health care costs, and we \n     pledge our support to you in making the necessary and tough \n     decisions.\n\n  ``This is our No. 1 priority,'' the letter states. ``If we pass \nhealth care reform without addressing the issue of health care \nspending, we have failed.''\n  I couldn't agree more with my Democratic colleagues who signed that \nletter. We will have failed if we have not addressed the issue of cost, \nthe issue of spending.\n  Again, this takes me back to the report from CMS, the Actuary's \nreport. I want to highlight some of the very important points that were \nraised by the Chief Actuary.\n  First, the Reid bill reduces payment updates to health care \nproviders, which are unlikely to be sustainable on a permanent basis. \nIf you go through the report, on page 9 is a statement that:\n\n       As a result, providers could find it difficult to remain \n     profitable, and absent legislative intervention might end \n     their participation in the Medicare Program. The Reid bill is \n     especially likely to result in providers who are unwilling to \n     treat Medicare or Medicaid patients.\n\n  On page 18, the statement is:\n\n       Providers might tend to accept more patients who have \n     private insurance and fewer Medicare and Medicaid patients, \n     exacerbating existing access problems for the latter group. \n     Either outcome, or a combination of both, should be \n     considered plausible and even probable.\n\n  I can tell you for a fact this is not just some maybe or if, in fact, \nthese things happen; this is happening.\n  I received a call 1 week ago from a practitioner in Alaska, in \nAnchorage, a family care practitioner. I was told that this \npractitioner, who has been practicing for many years in the family care \npractice--that the decision had been made to opt out of Medicare. In \nthe e-mail we received and the followup conversation that was had with \nthis practitioner, it was specifically cited that it is due to what \nis--I am reading from the e-mail we received--``due to what is in the \nReid bill, as it will collapse my practice.''\n  This is incredibly important to us not only in a State such as \nAlaska, where we are in a crisis situation when it comes to providers \nwho are willing to take new Medicare individuals. Right now, in our \nState's largest city, we have 13 providers who will take new Medicare \nindividuals--13. Well, if this individual whom we have communicated \nwith a week ago is making the decision to opt out of Medicare because \nof the low reimbursement rates, because of what is seen developing here \non the floor of the Senate, and the impact that will have on that \nfamily care practice--talk about not being able to sustain things--it \nis not acceptable.\n  When I read the language in the Actuary report that says that \nproviders might tend to accept more patients or might find it more \ndifficult to remain profitable and might end their participation in the \nMedicare Program--to me, I am saying it is not ``might,'' it is \nhappening, it is now, and it is impacting Alaskans' access to care in \nmy State.\n  This is something we should all be concerned about. It is not just \nthis one practitioner. We have heard this has caused a great deal of \nanxiety within Alaska, primarily because that is where I am checking in \nwith folks. But the anxiety about their ability to sustain a practice, \nagain, with Medicare reimbursement rates as low as they are--in our \nState, we don't have a medical school, so it is not as if we are \ngrowing more practitioners to come in. It is very costly to have a \npractice in Alaska. We have a lot of strikes against us.\n  We have to figure out a way we can continue to receive care from \nthese fine professionals. But right now, from a policy perspective, it \nseems as if we are doing everything possible to drive them out.\n  I am talking a lot about the situation in Alaska, but don't think for \na minute that it is isolated to my State. The statement that is made by \nthe Actuary is devastating news for States that are also facing \nproblems of access, in terms of finding a general care doctor to see \nthem, such as Oregon, Nevada, Colorado, and New Mexico.\n  There was a GAO report--granted, this is a 2006 GAO report, but it \ndid an assessment of what is happening in locations across the country, \nand those areas where access is compromised. You look at the statistics \ncoming out of GAO, and their wording is:\n\n       This suggests the distinct possibility of a deepening \n     problem in many of our Western States.\n\n  So it is not just in a few isolated communities. We have States that \nare looking at this and calling the crisis for what it is. What we are \ndoing in this health care bill currently before us is we are using \nMedicare as kind of this guinea pig, if you will, cutting from the \nMedicare--from the health program, even though we all recognize \nMedicare is slated to go broke by 2017--and using the Medicare money to \nexpand Medicaid and, if the Medicare reports are true, expanding \nMedicare as well. So the end result is to harm Medicare patients as we \nexpand Medicaid.\n  Alaska is a little bit unique. We are one of two States where \nMedicaid is actually a better payer, or better in terms of the \nreimbursements, than Medicare. But even still, the economists we have \nat the University of Alaska's Institute for Social and Economic \nResearch have said that Medicare patients will lose access and, as they \nhave suggested, kind of go to the back of the bus, if we expand \nMedicare.\n  I want to use their language specifically. This is from the analyst \nat ISER. He has stated that:\n\n       We can continue to be concerned that the newly enrolled \n     through the Medicaid expansion and the new exchange will \n     create a big surge in demand that could easily create a \n     traffic jam in the health care system and send the Medicare \n     beneficiaries to the back of the line in Alaska due to \n     Medicare's low reimbursement rate. Expanding Medicaid is bad \n     for Alaska.\n\n  The Chief Actuary at CMS is saying Medicare and Medicaid patients \nwill both face limited access to care under this bill. While in Alaska \nMedicaid patients may fare better, what is happening is at the cost, or \nexpense, if you will, of Medicare patients. So you are robbing Peter to \npay Paul.\n  Keep in mind that, as we look at the CMS letter--the Chief Actuary's \nletter--it doesn't even address the Democratic leader's desire to bring \nto the floor the provision that would expand Medicare to those 10 years \nyounger than the current threshold age for Medicare. So what we are \nseeing within this analysis is probably just the floor in terms of what \nthe impact will be if we allow for this expanded Medicare provision, \nthis buy-in, if you will.\n  Again, my State's seniors are absolutely suffering on Medicare, with \nvirtually no primary doctors who will see them in our State's largest \ncity. Now we have experts saying Medicare's patient access to care is \ngoing to suffer.\n  We simply cannot expand broken health care systems. We have to fix \nthe systems. You don't expand a broken thing and hope it will fix \nitself.\n\n[[Page S13090]]\n\n  Yesterday, in our State's largest newspaper, the headline at the \nbottom of the fold was:\n\n       ``Health Bills May Hurt Some Alaskans,'' consultant says.\n\n  And it says:\n\n       Older residents could have more trouble seeing doctors.\n\n  If you don't think that sends chills up and down the seniors in my \nState, knowing that the difficulty they are facing now could be made \nworse--a point that I think is important to add to the conversation \nhere. You might think, well, Alaska, you don't typically have a lot of \nseniors, you are a younger population. We are that, but it should be \nnoted that we are, per capita, the State with the fastest growing \nsenior population in the Nation. We have a situation where, as we have \nour baby boomers aging in, the numbers are increasing dramatically, as \nfar as those who will require the care. The number of patients who are \n65 and older at the health care facilities, Anchorage Neighborhood \nHealth Center, has jumped on the order of 50 percent within a few \nyears. The neighborhood health center saw twice as many Medicare \npatients in 2007 as in 2001.\n  The report also found that older Alaskans have been visiting the \nemergency room in growing numbers. What we are seeing is an expansion \nof those who will be our Medicare consumers. In 2008, there were 49,455 \nAlaskans 65 and older; but by 2015, 5 years from now, the number is \nexpected to increase 50 percent. By 2020, 10 years from now, the number \nis projected to increase to over 86,000 individuals in Anchorage. Yet, \nwe have fewer and fewer primary care doctors who are willing to accept \nthese Medicare patients.\n  The proposal out there is that we are going to cut $\\1/2\\ trillion \nfrom Medicare to pay for a new government entitlement. That doesn't add \nup.\n  Back to the Actuary's report. It goes on to state that:\n\n       We estimate that total national health expenditures under \n     this bill would increase by an estimated total of $234 \n     billion during calendar years 2010 to 2019.\n\n  We know that bending down the cost curve, which has been so essential \nto the health care reform bill, according to our own government's \nexpert, is not going to be achieved in the Democratic leader's health \ncare proposal.\n  Contrary to what Senator Baucus said last week, that Senator \nMcConnell's statement that this bill raises costs was ``a false \nstatement,'' this bill does, in fact, raise health care expenditures, \nand all you need to do is go to the Actuary's statement to determine \nthat.\n  The Actuary's report goes on to provide:\n\n       The new fees for drugs, devices, and insurance plans in the \n     Reid bill will increase prices and health insurance premium \n     costs for consumer. This will increase national health \n     expenditures by approximately $11 billion per year.\n\n  We know this bill is going to raise money on the backs of patient \nconsumers. This is going to happen in my State. It is going to happen \nin every other State. And it is going to be done by taxing the \nindustries that provide us with the prescription drugs, the medical \ndevices, such as tongue depressors, medical thermometers, blood sugar \nmeters, x-ray machines, and the like.\n  Whether or not you agree on taxing these industries, what the CMS \nActuary is telling us is that these additional taxes are going to be \npassed on to the patient consumer to the tune of $11 billion every \nyear. Again, the American people should know that their costs on drugs, \nthermometers, diabetes test strips, labs, and x rays are all going to \ngo up because new penalties imposed by the Federal Government will be \npassed on to the patients.\n  I appreciate the work Mr. Foster, the Chief Actuary, has done in \ngetting us this report. I wrote him a letter on Monday asking if we \ncould get the report so the folks in our respective States could look \nthrough it and better assess and understand. They want to know that \nthey are relying on a good, sound assessment. But I will tell you, \nafter reviewing the Actuary's report, I do not know how anyone could \ncome to a different conclusion other than that these proposals, these \nbills, do not look good for my State, they do not look good for the \nmedically underserved areas of the country, such as urban areas with \nlimited access to care because of their high Medicaid populations or \nfor rural America where general-care doctors just simply are not taking \nMedicare patients.\n  This is just a bad bill. It is a bad bill. It hurts our seniors, it \ndoes not bend down the cost curve, it spends $2.5 trillion, and it \nraises health care costs. We have to figure out a path forward that is \nreform that does not increase the cost to our constituents around this \ncountry, that truly does make a difference when it comes to the \ndelivery of health care costs in this Nation, and that really does \nprovide for expanded access.\n  I have said numerous times that just by giving an individual a card \nthat says: OK, now you are part of a health care plan but you don't \nhave access to a provider, we really haven't done what we have promised \nto do to help you receive good health care.\n  There is a great deal that is floating out there in terms of ``he \nsaid, she said'' type of conversation on the numbers. It is incumbent \non us in the Senate to give thorough vetting, thorough assessment. We \nhave to rely on the experts. We hope we rely on those experts who have \nbeen able to look at the proposals fairly and evenly and give their \nbest assessment. I have a great deal of confidence in our independent \nentity in the State of Alaska, the Institute for Social Economic \nResearch at the University of Alaska. I appreciate what they have done \nto provide more focus on what this national proposal will do to access \nto care in my State and costs that will be borne by my constituents.\n  I think the more time we spend understanding what we have in front of \nus, the more we realize this is a bad deal for America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, yesterday the administration's own \nDepartment of Health and Human Services health analysis warned \nAmericans about the impact of this bill. According to the official \nscorekeepers at CMS, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, \nthe Reid health care bill will actually not only increase our national \nhealth care costs by $234 billion over the next 10 years but will also \nreduce access and cut benefits for our seniors. This nonbiased report \nsimply proves what we have been saying all along: You cannot reform a \n$2.4 trillion health care system simply by spending another $2.5 \ntrillion of hard-earned taxpayer money. Despite all the rhetoric from \nthe other side about this historic legislation, the only thing this \nbill accomplishes, after imposing $\\1/2\\ trillion in new taxes and $\\1/\n2\\ trillion in Medicare cuts, is to simply bend our Nation's health \ncare cost curve up.\n  As a longtime supporter of the Medicare Advantage Program, I offered \nan amendment on the Senate floor to strip nearly $120 billion in cuts \nto the Medicare Advantage Program that provides comprehensive health \nbenefits, including vision, dental, and reduced cost-sharing, to almost \n11 million seniors.\n  Unfortunately, despite statements from the Congressional Budget \nOffice that these cuts would result in reduced cuts for seniors \nenrolled in Medicare Advantage, Democrats in the Senate voted to keep \nthe cuts in the package to finance more Federal spending--$500 billion \nin cuts in Medicare. Whom are they kidding? Medicare has $38 trillion \nin unfunded liabilities.\n  This report is another reminder of why it was a mistake to not adopt \nmy amendment. The CMS Actuary found that the cuts to the Medicare \nAdvantage Program in the Reid bill would not only result in ``less \ngenerous benefit packages'' for our seniors but, more important, it \nwould decrease enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans by 33 percent.\n  Clearly, health care spending continues to grow too fast. This year \nwill mark the largest ever 1-year jump in the health care share of our \nGDP. This jump is a full percentage point to 17.6 percent. You can \nthink of this as a horse race between costs and resources to cover \nthose costs. The sad reality is that costs win year after year.\n  Growing health care costs translate directly into higher coverage \ncosts. Since the last decade, the cost of health coverage has increased \nby 120 percent, three times the growth of inflation and four times the \ngrowth of wages. Rising costs is the primary driver behind why we \ncontinue to see a rising number of uninsured in our country\n\n[[Page S13091]]\n\nand why increasing numbers of businesses find it hard to compete in a \nglobal market.\n  Without addressing this central problem, we cannot have a real and \nsustainable health care reform bill. So what does this $2.5 trillion \ntax-and-spend bill do to address health care costs? Absolutely nothing. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, the premiums for \nAmericans who buy insurance on their own will actually increase by 10 \nto 13 percent, while premiums for small and large groups will largely \nremain unchanged and continue to rise between 5 to 6 percent a year.\n  Furthermore, according to the CMS report, the new fees on \nprescription drugs, medical devices, such as wheelchairs and hearing \naids, and health care plans will not only increase overall health care \nprices but also health insurance premiums for millions of Americans.\n  Let me make this point as clearly as I can. This bill does not \naddress the underlying problem of slowing down the growth of health \ncare costs. It simply spends hundreds of billions of dollars in new \nsubsidies to buy out the cost of these increases for families making up \nto $80,000 a year. Instead of fixing the real problems, this bill \nsimply tries to spend its way out of the problems. Does that sound new \nto you? This administration seems to think that just throwing money at \nthings is going to help.\n  We have been hearing a lot recently about how Democrats are throwing \nthe government-run plan out of their bill to quickly jam this bill \nthrough the Senate before Christmas. The American people need to be \ncareful about believing this propaganda. The Democratic solution to the \ngovernment plan is a Ponzi scheme that would embarrass even Bernie \nMadoff himself.\n\n  I have to be fair here. I have to rely on news reports to discuss \nthese provisions. You heard me right--news reports. Why is that? \nBecause no one knows what is actually in the bill they have sent to the \nCBO. Not even my friends on the Democratic side, by and large, know. \nThe Reid bill was put together by very few Democrats with the White \nHouse in the back rooms of the Capitol. Nobody really knew what they \nwere doing until they came out with it.\n  Once we all saw it, we all realized what a mess that is. They found \nthemselves in trouble, so they have gone and done another bill and \nsubmitted it to CBO, and hardly anybody on the floor knows exactly what \nthe features are in that bill. No one knows actually what is in the \nbill. And despite the continuous claims of transparency our friends on \nthe other side are always talking about, the real bill continues to \nchange on a daily basis behind the closed doors of the majority \nleader's office.\n  I am really glad to know that it is not just the Republicans who are \nin the dark about what is actually in this bill. Democratic Members of \nCongress in this body are also in the same boat. It is really \nunbelievable. We are being asked to move forward on legislation that \nwill reform one-sixth of the American economy and impact every American \nlife and business without knowing what is actually in the bill. We have \nto rely on news reports. I have never seen anything like this in my 33 \nyears of Senate service.\n  One proposal that has come to the floor in recent days is the idea of \nexpanding Medicare to include coverage for Americans 55 and over. \nCurrently, we all know Medicare is for Americans 65 and over. It is a \nbankrupt program. It is well intentioned, it does a lot of good, but it \nis bankrupt. It is a program that can barely pay for the benefits of \nthe 40 million seniors in it today. Medicare is on a path to fiscal \nmeltdown, with Part A facing bankruptcy by 2017. I don't think anybody \ndenies that. It underpays doctors by 20 percent and hospitals by 30 \npercent compared to the private sector, forcing an increasing number of \nproviders to simply stop seeing our Nation's seniors.\n  According to the June 2008 MedPAC report, 9 out of 10 Medicare \nbeneficiaries have to get additional benefits beyond their Medicare \ncoverage.\n  What is Washington's solution to address this problem and crisis? \nTake up to $500 billion out of this bankrupt program and at the same \ntime push millions of Americans into it. Does that sound logical to \nyou?\n  The CMS report states in clear terms that the Medicare cuts in this \nbill could jeopardize our seniors' access to care. The cuts would \nresult in nearly 20 percent of all Part A providers, such as hospitals \nand nursing homes, operating in the red within the next 10 years as a \nresult of these cuts. Twenty percent--that is a pretty big number.\n  It should come as no surprise that this proposal faces strong \nopposition from a wide variety of provider groups, from doctors and \nhospitals that are already under tremendous financial pressure due to \nunderpayments from Medicare.\n  Keep in mind, the AMA here in Washington has backed this monstrosity. \nNow some people think that AMA represents all the doctors. It does \nnot. The average doctor out there is incensed about this. Adding more \nlives to this insolvent Medicare Program will only further limit their \nability to see all Medicare patients, not just the new ones.\n\n  Even more troubling is the impact of this expansion on the premiums \nof our Medicare seniors from this ill-conceived policy. This expansion \nwould encourage an influx of sick Americans in private coverage into \nMedicare, which will simply raise premiums for seniors already enrolled \nin Medicare. So seniors, expect your cost of Medicare to go up.\n  So why are Democrats pushing this idea? Congressman Anthony Weiner \nsaid it best. I think he was very honest; very upfront. He said this:\n\n       Extending this successful program to those between 55 and \n     64, a plan I proposed in July, would be the largest expansion \n     of Medicare in 44 years and would perhaps get us on the path \n     to a single-payer model.\n\n  Well, the Democratic endgame on health care reform is crystal clear: \nMake as many Americans as possible dependent on the Federal Government \nprograms. Democrats believe by making millions of Americans dependent \non big government programs, on the backs of their grandchildren's \nfuture, they are taking a huge leap toward creating a permanent \nmajority for themselves. Why, it would be a natural constituency for \nthem.\n  Well, let me tell you this--America is built on the spirit of self-\nreliance, not government handouts. Poll after poll, especially the CNN \npoll, has said 61 percent of Americans are now opposed to the bill, and \nstudy after study is warning us this is the wrong solution for our \nNation. This unknown bill, which continues to change by the day behind \nclosed doors, is a direct violation of the President's own pledge to \nonly support a reform that would reduce costs, protect benefits, and \nnot raise taxes.\n  I sincerely hope the Democrats will step away from their arrogance of \npower and listen to the will of the American people. It is not too late \nfor us to push the reset button and work on health care reform in a \ntruly bipartisan manner. We are eager and willing, as we have been all \nyear, to work on a responsible solution that every American can be \nproud of. There are all kinds of things we could agree on, that \nRepublicans would work hand in glove with Democrats to solve, if they \nwere willing to do it.\n  But keep in mind the HELP Committee bill was totally Democratic. Not \none Republican was asked to help write it. The House bill, totally \nDemocratic. Not one Republican was asked to help write it. I admit my \nfriend, the Senator from Montana, Max Baucus, worked hard to try to get \na bipartisan bill. But in the end, he did not have enough flexibility \nto reach a deal. All of a sudden, he finds his bill being put \ntogether--between the House bill and the HELP Committee bill--behind \nclosed doors, with very few people involved--all Democrats and the \nWhite House and probably two or three or four or five from the Senate \nbut no more than that.\n  Throughout this debate, I have heard a lot of rhetoric from the other \nside of the aisle how Republicans are opposed to this $2.5 trillion \ntax-and-spend bill because, as the Democrats incorrectly suggest, we \nwant the status quo. Oh, give me a break. We all know this is \ncompletely false. We on this side of the aisle have asked the Democrats \nover and over again to step back and write a new bill with us. But they \nare so consumed with their arrogance of power that they simply want to \npush what they have always wanted; that is, more government and more \ngovernment controls over all our lives. America is a\n\n[[Page S13092]]\n\nfree nation, the greatest Nation in the history of mankind. What makes \nus great is not our reliance on the Federal Government but our \nindividual resolve and strength. Americans want the Federal Government \nto help them, not support them.\n  Well, let me tell you the other side of this. In a recent Gallup \nPoll, Independents around this country opposed this bill 53 to 37. \nThese are Independents. So it would be wise for my Democratic friends \nto realize America is not behind them; not behind this bill. It is time \nfor them to listen to what the majority of Americans want and that is \nnot this bill.\n  I cannot tell you the kind of opposition I have seen in my State to \nthis bill. It is almost unprecedented. I read it in the letters, hear \nit in the calls. At airports and grocery store aisles and on the \nstreets people stop me and say: Don't let that thing pass.\n  Absolute power corrupts, and that is what we are seeing in Washington \ntoday. Democrats control the White House, the House, they have a \nfilibuster-proof Senate and they have used this absolute power to \nrubberstamp this administration's big-government agenda and have \ntripled our deficit within 1 year--1 year. We will run deficits of at \nleast $1 trillion a year for the foreseeable future, while our national \ndebt will triple. We are literally mortgaging the future of this \ncountry to foreign countries as we speak. Enough is enough. Let us step \nback and start over on a plan we can all be proud of and all work on.\n  We hear a lot about how the Republicans are simply standing for big \nand evil insurance companies and how the Democrats are the defenders of \nAmerican families. Well, these days, nowhere is this Democratic \nhypocrisy more clear than the individual, mandated policy that is part \nof this tax-and-spend legislation.\n  Let's be very clear about who would benefit the most from this \nprovision, which would, for the first time in our Nation's history, \ngive the Federal Government the power to force Americans to either buy \nhealth insurance or face a tax penalty enforced by our friends at the \nInternal Revenue Service. There are only two clear winners under this \npolicy, and it is not the American families. First, it is the Federal \nGovernment, that will now use this authority as a blank checkbook to \nincrease the penalty in the future as a new revenue stream for its out-\nof-control spending habits; and, second, are the insurance companies, \nthat will now reap the benefits of having Americans being forced to buy \ncoverage at the decree of the Federal Government.\n  Right now, States are responsible for determining policies that best \nmeet their unique demographic needs and challenges. Massachusetts, for \nexample, has decided to implement an individual mandate, while Utah has \ndecided not to. Under this bill, we are explicitly taking away this \nState flexibility and authority to give the Federal Government the \nauthority to make this one-size-fits-all decision for all 50 States and \nevery American. This is an unprecedented grab of State power by \nWashington--a fundamental threat to the very Federalist vision our \nFounding Fathers used more than 200 years ago to create the greatest \nNation in the history of the world, in the history of mankind.\n  I am gravely concerned about the precedent this policy will set for \nus as a nation going forward. If the Federal Government can force us to \nbuy health insurance, what else can it force us to do? The \npossibilities are endless, just like my concerns, which I share with \nmillions of Americans, on Washington's growing role in our private \nlives and personal decisions. Think about it. Washington has become an \nunwanted houseguest in our homes and lives who will not leave. If it \ndoes not start listening to the families, it will get kicked out, \nsooner rather than later. Think about it.\n  A couple of our friends have even said: Well, it is similar to car \ninsurance. The States require you to buy insurance for your car, and it \nis in the best interest of the community that you do so. Well, the \nreason they do is because you want to drive. It is an activity you want \nto participate in, and so they get away with it. Here, if they have an \nindividual mandate, they are forcing you to buy policies that are \ndefined by Washington. If you don't, you are going to be penalized.\n  This has never happened before in our lives. If they can get away \nwith this, I have to tell you, they can get away with anything. The \nliberties of all Americans are going to be affected by it. This is not \nan activity. This is not something we choose to do necessarily. If we \nchoose to do it on our own, that is great. But to have the government \ncome in and say you have to buy this policy--for the first time in \nhistory--you have to do this, even though you don't want to buy it, is \nunprecedented.\n  Well, let me say, I think it is fair to see I am not very enthused \nabout the health care ideas of our colleagues. But I do wish to end on \na positive note. There are some good things we can all do, some of \nwhich are in the bill. It is not totally bad. It is only about 90 \npercent bad, but there is at least 10 percent we could build on; that \nwe could work together on.\n\n  I am not just saying that. Look, I have been around here a long time. \nI can name all kinds of bills I have worked on with some of the most \nliberal people in the whole Congress to pass. Hatch-Waxman is a perfect \nillustration. That created the modern generic drug industry. Henry \nWaxman is as liberal as it gets but he was willing to face up to these \nrealities with me, and we did Hatch-Waxman. I call it Waxman-Hatch when \nI am around him.\n  I might add the orphan drug bill. We found there were only maybe two \nor three orphan drugs being developed. These are drugs to benefit \npopulation groups of less than 200,000. Well, it is clear the drug \ncompanies can't afford to do it for 200,000 people because it costs \nupward of $1 billion. Biological drugs cost even more than that, and \nthey are not truly drugs. But the fact is, they cost even more than \nthat. We came up with some very small incentives--but they were \nincentives with prestige--and some tax breaks and all of a sudden it \nwas about a $14 million or $15 million bill, as I recall, in the early \n1980s, when I was chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee. \nToday, we have well over 300 orphan drugs being developed, many of \nwhich have been developed, and from some of them blockbuster drugs have \nevolved.\n  Let's take the CHIP bill. That was the Hatch-Kennedy bill. Ted \nKennedy, very liberal. He would have preferred to have the Federal \nGovernment do it all--just like our colleagues do today with this \nenormous number of 60 votes on their side--but he was willing to work \nwith me. I went to him and said: Look, I had two families from Provo, \nUT, come to visit me--husbands and wives. In each family's case, both \nthe husband and the wife work. Neither family's combined joint income \nis over $20,000 a year. At that time, it was too much to have their \nkids qualify for Medicaid and too little for them to be able to buy \nhealth insurance. I said: The only kids left out of the health care \nequation are children of the working poor. Teddy, we have to do \nsomething about that. He saw it, and he said yes.\n  He wasn't happy with the bill, in the end, because it was exactly \nwhat I told him it would be. It would basically be block-grants to \nstates, where the States would handle it in accordance with their own \ndemographics. It has worked amazingly well, until now. They are shoving \nmore and more people into CHIP, other than the children of the working \npoor whom we originally decided to help.\n  Well, I could go on and on and on, on so many pieces of legislation, \nbut I will just mention those few. I am very concerned because I \nactually believe that if we get what they are talking about on the \nother side, it will not only bankrupt the country, it will make more \nand more people dependent upon the Federal Government. Like I say, a \nnatural constituency for the Democratic Party, but it is a matter of \ngreat concern to me.\n  Are our colleagues bad people? No. They simply believe the Federal \nGovernment can do it better. There are some things the Federal \nGovernment can do better, such as defending our national security \ninterests, which is what the Constitution expects the Federal \nGovernment to do.\n  But even there, under this administration, we are not doing as well \nas we should. Although I commend the President for deciding to send the \npeople to\n\n[[Page S13093]]\n\nAfghanistan and for standing on these issues. Once he saw the \nintelligence and the other information, it infused reality into his \ndecision-making process. I give him credit. I am one who believes he \ndeserves great credit for the decision he made. But even in that \ndecision, he had to be very careful how he characterized when we are \ngoing to leave. He did leave it flexible. In that alone, he deserves a \nlot of credit because he knows there may not be enough time to do all \nwe have to do to create the well-trained police and security forces \nthat are necessary to keep Afghanistan free and to keep the world from \nallowing the Taliban and al-Qaida to obtain nuclear weapons.\n  Well, that is another subject for another day. I wish to end by \nsaying I don't believe anybody on the other side is an evil person or a \nperson who doesn't believe they are acting in the best interest of the \ncountry, but I do not see how--I do not see how they can continue to \npush what they are trying to push, I think to the detriment of this \ncountry.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Before my colleague leaves the floor, I wish to ask \nhim a question or two if he wouldn't mind. He has been involved in most \nof the major health issues that have passed this body in the last 15 \nyears. What was the vote margin in the Senate on some of those bills, \non the Hatch-Kennedy, Hatch-Waxman bills? How many votes, roughly? I am \nnot asking you to pull that up from memory, and it may not be fair to \ndo. As I recall, a number of people on both sides of the aisle ended up \nsupporting those bills.\n  Mr. HATCH. On the CHIP bill I can't remember what the exact number \nwas but I think it was between 70 or 80 votes. It was a bipartisan \nbill. In fact, on the Finance Committee when I brought it up only two \nSenators voted against it. It was like 19 to 2.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. In the Finance Committee?\n  Mr. HATCH. Every Republican except two, and every Democrat voted for \nit.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. And Hatch-Waxman? It is longer back.\n  Mr. HATCH. That was unanimous. If I recall correctly, I think it was \ndone through a unanimous consent.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I believe you did a major health care bill with \nSenator Dodd from Connecticut.\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Do you recall the split?\n  Mr. HATCH. They were all bipartisan. That is what gets me, because \npeople know--people such as myself, such as the senior Senator from \nKansas--we are willing to work on it with them. We know we can't get \neverything we want. Our colleagues have different viewpoints than we \ndo. But tell me that I am wrong--I know you can't--that the HELP \nCommittee bill was done solely between a few people at the White House \nand the Kennedy staff, and basically a few Democrats. That was it. No \nRepublicans.\n  The House bill, I wish to ask the Senator, does he know of any \nRepublican who was asked to participate in helping to develop that \nmonstrosity they call the House bill?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If I could respond to my colleague, I do not know of \nany. I don't know of any who were even asked. I know of some who were \ntold you can join this bill, or asked that--OK, can you join our bill \nbut you don't have any input.\n  Mr. HATCH. After they came up with it, but how about the Reid bill? \nDoes the Senator know if any Republicans were involved, able to \nparticipate in that bill, after the discussion between the White House \nand Senator Reid and a few Democrats?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. None. I know of none.\n  Mr. HATCH. None were involved. After they get it they say we want to \nwork with you. After they get it done in the ways that I don't think \nany Republican can support, then they will say, yes, we would like it \nto be bipartisan. Has the Senator seen any acceptance of amendments \nhere on the floor?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I haven't seen any at all, and particularly when we \ntried to work in a bipartisan fashion to add Hyde language into the \nbill that was defeated, not accepted.\n  My point is something I have seen the Senator say in a quote, that a \ngood health care bill should have 70 votes because it is major \nlegislation that affects everybody in the United States. It has huge \ncosts associated with it. So it is not something you do on a single-\nparty basis, it is something you work extensively on over a long period \nof time.\n  I ask my colleague again, over how many years he worked with Senator \nKennedy on getting the Hatch-Kennedy bill, or Waxman--my guess is those \nare lengthy pieces of negotiations that take a period of time to get \nsomething that has bipartisan support.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right. One thing I appreciated very much about \nSenator Kennedy, as liberal as he was--he was the leading liberal lion \nin the Senate, in the whole Congress, in my opinion--he knew unless we \ncould get together in a bipartisan way we could not get the job done. \nThis involves one-sixth of the American economy; one-sixth. We are \nbeing told take it or leave it. That is what I call an arrogance of \npower.\n  I don't want to be mean to my colleagues, I think many of them are \nvery sincere, but it is an arrogance of power to not deal with the \nother side and to not even talk to us about it until after you have \ndone what you want to do. I have to say, this is the worst I have seen \nit in the whole 33 years I have been in the Senate.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If I could ask one more question before my colleague \nleaves--and also a comment that I like the Senator's tie, nice bright \ncolors on a Saturday session.\n  Mr. HATCH. It is a western tie. I thought I would wear it out of \nloudness today.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. What does the Senator think of getting--how many total \nvotes could you get for a bipartisan health care bill along the lines \nof which a number of people on our side have discussed, where you \nexpand access, you try to bend the cost curve down, you try to get more \naccess to low-income individuals? Does the Senator think he could craft \na bipartisan bill that could get well over 60 votes on health care \nreform?\n  Mr. HATCH. I believe we could craft a bill that would get almost 100 \nvotes. I think we would at least get between 70 and 80 votes and \nprobably more if we worked together to do it. I don't think there is \nany question we could do that.\n  Look, we all want prevention, we want maintenance, we all want to \ncover as many people as we possibly can, we all want to correct some of \nthe deficiencies that are in these bills, we all want to take care of \npeople with preexisting illnesses. I could go on and on. Those are \nthings we could build upon in ways that would work.\n  This bill is not going to work very well. But we could build upon \nthat, bipartisan-wise, and build a complete bill We Republicans would \nnot get everything we want. But I think there are Democrats who believe \nwe ought to use the principles of federalism, have 50 State \nlaboratories out there, let them work on their own problems in \naccordance with their own demographics. I know Kansas is not New \nJersey. Neither is Utah. And New Jersey is not Kansas or Utah, to pick \nthree States. You can do that with any three States. But we know one \nthing, if we follow the principles of federalism--that is what we did \nin CHIP, and CHIP worked well by anybody's measure--if we follow the \nprinciples of federalism we would be able to look and pick and choose \nfrom the various States what works and what does not.\n  You would have the usually big Democratic States that probably \nwouldn't function no matter what you do. But even they would benefit. \nEven they would benefit from looking at the other States and saying \nwill that work in our State. Frankly, that is what made this country \ngreat.\n  There are friends on the other side who do not agree with me on that \nbut there are friends over there who do agree with me on that, as you \ncan see, getting 70 or 80 votes on the CHIP bill. There were other \nbills we put through by unanimous consent, because people recognized \nthey were well intentioned, well written, had bipartisan support and \nnobody wanted to vote against them.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I said I would only ask the Senator one more question, \nbut I have one more. My question is you didn't do those bills on the \nfly where you were amending them, saying\n\n[[Page S13094]]\n\nOK, we can't quite find 60, let's go back to a closed room and let's \nrebuild the bill. You built them over a long period of time. You did a \ngood job of working the problems out together, and then you built it as \nit went along. You didn't say OK, let's do it on the fly, let's change \nthis, let's change that. You build a solid piece of legislation and \nmove it forward, not changing it at the 11th hour as we are seeing take \nplace now.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right. When Senator Kennedy and I did the CHIP \nbill, as an illustration, we had to go up and down this country giving \nspeeches everywhere, building constituencies, working very hard \ntogether. It is no secret, in the end it was not everything he wanted. \nIt wasn't everything I wanted either. He wanted the Federal Government \nin control of it. I wanted the States to be in control of it. But in \nthe end I happen to know, as one of the dearest friends of Senator \nKennedy, with all the differences we had--and we had plenty, we fought \neach other most of the time, but in the end he was as proud of that \nbill as any bill he passed or he worked on--even though it was put \ntogether in a way that brought a great number of Republicans on board.\n\n  Frankly, that can be done here. I have no doubt it could be done \nhere. I look at the distinguished Senator in the chair. He is one of \nthe brightest guys in the Senate. He has a lot of experience in this \narea. I personally believe the people such as the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, the Senator from Kansas, myself--if we got together we could do \nthings that our respective States would be proud of and would be \npleased to work on--even though there would be some give and take, and \nthat is what we need to do.\n  Look, I point out one more time, the HELP bill is totally Democratic, \nnot one Republican, until they brought the bill to the committee. The \nHouse bill--totally Democratic, not one Republican was even asked to \ngive input. And this bill, not one Republican. In fact, not many \nDemocrats.\n  I made the point here a few minutes ago, most of the Democrats do not \nknow what is in the bill that was submitted to the Congressional Budget \nOffice. You heard the very competent minority--majority whip, the \nSenator from Illinois, say he did not know what was in the bill either. \nWhen the minority--excuse me, the majority; I have that in my mind, I \nthink. If the majority whip didn't know, how in the world are we \nRepublicans going to know? And how in the world are the rest of the \nDemocrats going to know? These are things that worry me and bother me.\n  I believe they believed with President Obama's aura, with his \nstrength in politics, with all of us wanting to help him and with their \ndistinctive 60-person majority, that they could put over whatever they \nwanted to. This was their opportunity to go to a single-payer system--\nor at least to move the whole system much farther toward a single-payer \nsystem than it even is today.\n  These things bother me a great deal. Frankly, I hope we can get our \ncolleagues to sit down and work with us. I think both sides would have \nto give. Both sides would have to get together. But at least one-sixth \nof the American economy would be treated with respect rather than one \nside saying take it or leave it.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank my colleague from Utah for that explanation \nand also for the years of service he has given, and particularly a lot \nof focus on health care issues. I haven't always agreed with my \ncolleague from Utah. I have always found him, though, very sound in his \nthinking, very knowledgeable in his ways, in knowing how you do this, \nand particularly when you are talking about health care these are \nbipartisan issues in and of themselves and they need to be in this \nbody.\n  He also talked about the principles of federalism, which I think we \nhave deviated from in what we see from this bill. I wish to read from \nthe Constitution, article I, section 8. That is the piece I wish to \nfocus on here for a minute about the constitutional question involved \nin this health care bill. Article I, section 8 reads simply this way, \nthat the Congress shall have--and then it lists a series of enumerated \npowers: power to ``regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among \nthe several States, and with the Indian tribes.''\n  That is our ability to regulate commerce, with the foreign nations, \namong the several States, and with the Indian tribes. There are a \nnumber of people raising the question about whether you can \nconstitutionally require everybody in the United States, by virtue of \ntheir citizenship or status in the United States, to have health \ninsurance. I think it is highly questionable.\n  It appears to me from several legal scholars that this is \nunconstitutional for us to do. It is a major plank in the health care \nlegislation that has been brought forward by the Democratic majority \nand I do not believe it is going to stand constitutional challenge. I \nwant to develop that for my colleagues here today.\n  The Congressional Budget Office said this about the constitutional \nquestion here. They said forcing individuals to buy insurance would be \n`` . . . an unprecedented form of federal action.'' Those are big words \nin a time when we are seeing a lot of what I think are unprecedented \nFederal actions. Then going on to say, ``The Government has never \nrequired people to buy any good or service as a condition of lawful \nresidence in the United States.''\n  You would be requiring, as a condition for lawful residence in the \nUnited States, the purchasing of a good or a service--in this case \nhealth insurance. As laudable as some people may look at that or say \nthat is, that would be what is being required. The Congressional Budget \nOffice does not know of any time where a person in the United States \nhas been required to buy any good or service as a condition simply of \nlawful residence in the United States. I think it raises significant \nconstitutional questions.\n  You have to remember, as everybody does, but I think we have to \nremind ourselves because too often we act as if we don't remember that \nthe Federal Government is a constitutional government of limited \npowers.\n  From James Madison in the Federalist Papers, quoted often but it \nbears repeating because it is a foundational issue:\n\n       [I]n the first place it is to be remembered that the \n     general government is not to be charged with the whole power \n     of making and administering laws. Its jurisdiction is limited \n     to certain enumerated objects.\n\n  Which is what I just read from in article I, section 8.\n  Chief Justice John Marshall, in the famous Marbury v. Madison case, \nstated:\n\n       The powers of the legislature are defined and limited; and \n     that those limits may not be mistaken or forgotten, the \n     Constitution is written.\n\n  We can't violate that. The Federal Government is limited to \nenumerated powers granted by the Constitution. The Founding Fathers who \ndrafted and ratified the Constitution were unwavering in their desire \nto restrict the powers of States and limit the powers of Congress. To \nachieve their goal they created a system that splits State and Federal \nauthority so that one government, Federal or State, does not maintain \ntoo much power over the liberty of the American people. Therefore, the \nFramers created a system with a legislature of limited and enumerated \npowers, the Congress, to enact laws which shall be necessary and proper \nfor the execution of powers. One of those is the commerce clause I just \nread which grants Congress the authority to regulate commerce with \nforeign nations, among the several States, interstate commerce, and \nwith Indian tribes.\n  Many have used the commerce clause to justify the implementation of \nthis unconstitutional mandate. Those individuals often cite the case of \nWicker v. Filburn, a 1942 case. The U.S. Supreme Court decision found \nthat a law prohibiting a commercial farmer growing an additional acre \nof wheat to feed chickens beyond the limits imposed on wheat production \nmandated by the Federal Government was constitutional and fell under \nthe enumerated powers granted by the commerce clause. Filburn was \nordered to destroy his crops and pay a fine to the government for being \ntoo productive.\n  The Supreme Court, interpreting the Constitution's commerce clause, \ndecided that Filburn's wheat growing activities reduced the amount of \nwheat he would buy for chicken feed on the open market and affected \ninterstate commerce and, thus, could be regulated by the Federal \nGovernment. However, that Supreme Court decision, agree with it or not, \nstill does not expand the\n\n[[Page S13095]]\n\npowers of this body under the commerce clause to impose a monetary fine \nor penalty upon a citizen who fails to purchase or enter into a private \ncontract for health insurance. That doesn't expand our authority under \nthe commerce clause. It doesn't change the commerce clause. For us to \nrequire somebody to do something simply as a status of citizenship, the \nCongressional Research Service says:\n\n       Despite the breadth of powers exercised under the Commerce \n     Clause, it is unclear whether the clause would provide a \n     solid constitutional foundation for legislation containing a \n     requirement to have health insurance. Whether such a \n     requirement would be constitutional under the Commerce Clause \n     is perhaps the most challenging question posed by such a \n     proposal, as it is a novel issue whether Congress may use \n     this clause to require an individual to purchase a good or a \n     service.\n\n  To think that the Federal Government can compel any individual to \npurchase a commodity because that individual is alive and breathing is \nunconstitutional and is at least a novel issue that this $2.5 trillion \nproposal is built around. Should we be doing this major change in \nhealth care, $2.5 trillion in spending, \\1/2\\ trillion in reduction in \nMedicare, \\1/2\\ trillion raising in taxes off of a novel constitutional \nquestion involved in the inherent piece of it, that being the \nrequirement for everybody to have health insurance? I think not. Along \nwith all the other problems with it, I think it has an enormous \nconstitutional question right in the middle of it. And what if you pull \nthat out and the Supreme Court says, ultimately, you can't require \nthat. Then you have done $2.5 trillion, $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare \ncuts, $\\1/2\\ trillion in tax increases, and your core piece is pulled \nout; it is unconstitutional. Then the whole house of cards falls apart.\n  Another popular argument for forcing citizens to purchase health \ninsurance under penalty of law is that States require people to buy car \ninsurance. This argument is not only constitutionally flawed but also \nan underwhelming argument that in many respects hardly deserves comment \nand adds little to the debate. It is recognized that States maintain \ninherent police powers to regulate behavior and enforce order within \ntheir borders to promote public welfare, security, health, and safety. \nThis is a fundamental difference between the power of States and the \nenumerated powers of the national government, such as commerce between \nStates and Indian tribes. This is a much broader granting of \njurisdiction to the States.\n  State vehicle insurance laws are exactly that, laws implemented by \nStates, and are generally derived from State constitutions and not the \nFederal Constitution under which this body operates. Furthermore, these \nlaws require an individual who voluntarily participates in the use of \nan automobile to insure that vehicle. It is not a right of citizenship \nas a Kansan that you have to buy auto insurance. But if you want to \noperate a car on our roads, you have to have auto insurance. It isn't a \nrequirement of citizenship.\n  We are requiring this as an article of citizenship. You have to have \nhealth insurance, a novel and enormously expansive role of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The Federal mandate for the purchase of health insurance forces \nindividuals to purchase a commodity not because they choose to \nparticipate in an economic or commercial activity such as what one \nwould think would be covered under the commerce clause but forces an \nindividual to purchase a product simply because that person exists. \nThis mandate is an abuse of the power granted to this Congress by the \nConstitution.\n  Last night I spent some time developing another thought that I think \nis an important one for us to consider. It is one this body has spent \nsome time over the last decade dealing with; that is, the removal of \nthe marriage penalty from our Tax Code, which we haven't gotten very \nfar in doing, but getting the marriage penalty out, the thought being \nthat marriage is a good institution. It is a fabulous institution for \nthe formation of family. It is something that has an enormous role in \nour culture and society and should be rewarded and should not be taxed.\n  The fundamental principle exists, if you want less of something, tax \nit; if you want more of something, subsidize it. In the Democratic \nhealth care bill there are marriage penalties on both low-income and \nupper income individuals that will reduce the incidence of marriage in \nthis society, under the principle that if you are going to tax \nsomething, you will get less of it.\n  This bill has marriage penalty taxes in it. I want to go through a \nseries of these, starting with the high cost plan tax, the Cadillac \ninsurance plan. Married couples under this bill are hit hardest by the \nhigh cost plans tax. The number of single and married tax filers is \nequal, but married taxpayers pay more than twice as much as singles as \na percent of new tax revenue in this bill.\n  So if you are married filing jointly, you will pay 62 percent--single \nfilers, 25 percent--in this bill. Is that something we want to do? Do \nwe want to say, if you are married, you will pay more of the tax? Most \npeople would say: We want to encourage marriage and the formation of \nfamily around marriage. We should have these at least equal or maybe do \na higher tax on the other end. But most would say let's have these be \nequal.\n  Instead, in this we have a huge increase in the amount of money \nmarried filers will have to pay as compared to taxes paid by single \nfilers. Consequently, you encourage people to say: Let's not get \nmarried because we don't want to pay the increase in taxes.\n  The high cost plans tax, the Cadillac plans tax, will hit married \ncouples' households far more severely than single filers. Even though \nthe number of married filers and single filers is roughly equal, the \nhigh cost plans tax will impact the total tax bill of married couples \nmuch more severely: 25 percent of the revenue will be from single \nfilers, 62 percent of the bill will go to married filers. One thing is \ncertain, 62 percent of married couples' households don't make more than \n$250,000. So not only is this unfair to married households, it is a \ndirect contradiction of the President's promise that you wouldn't pay \nmore taxes if you were making below $250,000. In this case you do under \nthe Cadillac insurance plan proposal or piece in this proposal.\n\n  I want to look at another chart on this subject. If we wanted to talk \nabout factors that impact an individual's decision to enter the \nworkforce or to invest in a business, an important factor is the \nmarginal tax rate they will face on the next dollar they earn. \nBasically, it is a question of whether it is worth the effort and risk \nto work. What is my marginal tax? If I work longer and make another \n$100, how much do I get to keep? The marginal tax rate.\n  This is an especially important factor for low-income households, \npeople who don't have much marginal income to work off of. They need \nevery dollar they can get. So if you are going to tax their marginal \nrate, they are looking at this saying: I don't want to get in that \ncategory. I need to hold back from getting in that category.\n  We have tried to help the less economically fortunate with various \ntypes of support programs: TANF, food stamps, the earned-income tax \ncredit, the additional child tax credit, to name a few. Low-income \nfamilies already face high marginal tax rates as a result of the \nphaseout of their benefits and tax rates that mean the loss of benefits \nthey get under TANF, food stamps, the earned-income tax credit, housing \nassistance, the welfare package we put together for low-income \nindividuals. Low-income families already face high marginal tax rates \nas a result of the phaseout of their benefits. These phaseouts already \nimpose significant barriers to marriage.\n  In other words, whenever you get a combined income of a low-income \ncouple, you lose more benefits. Consequently, people don't get married \nbecause they look and say: I will lose my health benefits if I get \nmarried. I will lose my medical benefits, my housing benefits. I may \nlose food stamps. I will not get married.\n  Yet you look at the chances for children in that situation to get out \nof poverty, their best chance is to have a stable mom and dad and a \nstable marriage environment, providing for the comfort and support of \nthose children. Our incentives are disincentives toward marriage in \nthis way, and they are built even more significantly into this health \ncare bill.\n  As an example, let's take two individuals at 150 percent of the \npoverty level. After the new subsidies proposed\n\n[[Page S13096]]\n\nin this legislation are taken into account, these two individuals would \npay $1,478 for their health insurance. But if they get married, their \nbill will increase to $2,308, a marriage penalty of $830, if you are at \nthe 150 percent of poverty level or below. If you are at 150 percent of \npoverty or below, you don't have marginal income to mess around with. \nYou need everything you have just to provide the basics. So if you are \nlooking at this increase in the marriage penalty of $830, you are \nsaying: We can't afford to get married.\n  Is that the signal we want to send from the Federal Government? No. \nEverybody in this body would say that.\n  Let's take a pair of individuals earning 250 percent of the poverty \nlevel. One has no children; the other has two children. Unmarried they \nwill, after subsidies, pay $5,865 for their health coverage. If they \ndecide to marry, they will face a penalty of $2,050.\n  Let's turn to the new Medicare tax that will go into effect in 2013. \nThe tax will apply to wage and salary income as well as certain \nbusiness income for individuals. The tax will apply to income of that \ntype for above $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for joint filers.\n  The penalty is obvious on its face. Let's take an example. Two \nunmarried individuals earn $200,000 each, and their total Medicare \ntaxes would be $11,600. But if they get married, the penalty is $750. \nOr take two individuals, one making $150,000 and the other $200,000. \nSingle, their Medicare taxes total $10,150; if they get married, they \nwill pay an additional $500. This is on top of the marriage penalties \nthat two earners face under current law. The marriage penalty is there. \nI don't think it is as significant as for the low-income individuals, \nbut it is here as well.\n  My point is, why on Earth would that even be built into the base of \nthe bill, particularly on the low-income couples? Why on Earth would \nyou build in a marriage penalty on people who can't afford it? If \ncombined income is over $250,000, you can afford another $500. I am \nwilling to agree with that. But not this couple that is making at 150 \npercent of poverty or 250 percent of poverty, one with two kids. They \ncan't afford that. Why on Earth would you build it into this? This is \nridiculous that it be placed in the proposal. It makes no sense.\n  Creating and expanding on the penalties for marriage makes zero \nsense. Families are a critical determinant of the well-being of our \nsociety. Family structure also has a significant impact on economic \nwell-being, on education, and the effect on the social fabric of this \nNation is positive.\n  It is a fundamental law of economics that when you tax something, you \nget less of it. Why would we tax marriage, particularly for low-income \nindividuals, when it is the best chance for those children involved \nwith this couple to have a stable environment, if they will form a \nsolid marriage unit? And we are going to tax it and discourage it. That \nis wrong. That is wrong as a policy matter.\n  There is a number of other problems I have had with this overall \nbill. This piece of it absolutely makes no sense to me, why we would do \nsomething like this. I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill, to \ntake these sorts of things out, to take them out of the base law. \nUnfortunately, in the United States today, this is kind of repeating \nwhat already takes place in food stamps, what takes place in health \nbenefits for low-income individuals right now. They cannot afford to \nget married or they lose their benefits. It is ridiculous. We ought to \ngive people bonuses for getting married, not penalties for getting \nmarried. Now we are going to add to it by putting it in this health \ninsurance bill. It is wrong and it is bad policy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SOLOMONT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on September 21, 2009, I announced my \nintention to object to proceeding to the nomination of Alan D. Solomont \nto be the Ambassador to Spain because of the incomplete responses that \nthe Corporation for National and Community Service, CNCS, had provided \nto my document requests regarding the removal of its Inspector General, \nGerald Walpin. Mr. Solomont was the chairman of the board of CNCS at \nthe time that my requests went unanswered, and he began the process \nthat led to Mr. Walpin's removal by contacting the White House \nCounsel's Office on May 20, 2009.\n  Since September 21, the White House produced approximately 1,900 \nadditional pages of previously withheld documents. During that time, my \nstaff conducted a series of negotiations with CNCS and the White House \nCounsel's Office over the hundreds of pages of remaining documents that \nwere being withheld or had been redacted. As a result of these \nnegotiations, this week the White House authorized and CNCS provided: \n1. descriptions of the information redacted from several CNCS \ndocuments, 2. 37-previously produced documents with substantive \nredactions removed, and 3. 370 pages of previously withheld documents. \nIn addition, the White House made Mr. Solomont available for a follow-\nup interview on December 8, 2009, so that he could be questioned about \nnew information that had been learned from these documents and other \nsources since his initial interview on July 15, 2009.\n  In order to obtain this additional information, I agreed to no longer \nobject to proceeding to Mr. Solomont's nomination if the White House \ntook these steps. I have kept my word and informed leadership that I no \nlonger intend to object. However, I remain concerned about the accuracy \nand completeness of Mr. Solomont's answers to questions during both his \nJuly 15 and December 8, 2009 interviews. I understand Congressman Issa \nof the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform shares those \nconcerns and has sent a letter to Mr. Solomont to that effect.\n  Although CNCS has produced a total of approximately 3,000 pages of \nmaterial responsive to my request, the record should also be clear that \nthe White House continues to withhold 46 documents, on grounds of \ndeliberative process and attorney work product privileges. The White \nHouse did not provide a detailed log of the documents being withheld \ndespite my requests. I will continue to seek answers to the remaining \nquestions in this matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/12/senate-section/article/S13096-3", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3199.

The provisions \n     governing health care lawsuits set forth in this paragraph \n     supersede chapter 171 of title 28, United States Code, to the \n     extent that such chapter--\n\n       (I) provides for a greater amount of damages or contingent \n     fees, a longer period in which a health care lawsuit may be \n     commenced, or a reduced applicability or scope of periodic \n     payment of future damages, than provided in this paragraph; \n     or\n       (II) prohibits the introduction of evidence regarding \n     collateral source benefits.\n\n       (ii) Preemption of certain state laws.--No provision of \n     this paragraph shall be construed to preempt any State law \n     (whether effective before, on, or after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act) that specifies a particular monetary \n     amount of compensatory or punitive damages (or the total \n     amount of damages) that may be awarded in a health care \n     lawsuit, regardless of whether such monetary amount is \n     greater or lesser than is provided for under this paragraph, \n     notwithstanding subparagraph (F)(i).\n       (iii) Protection of state's rights and other laws.--\n\n       (I) In general.--Any issue that is not governed by a \n     provision of law established by or under this paragraph \n     (including the State standards of negligence) shall be \n     governed by otherwise applicable Federal or State law.\n       (II) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this paragraph shall \n     be construed to--\n\n       (aa) preempt or supersede any Federal or State law that \n     imposes greater procedural or substantive protections (such \n     as a shorter statute of limitations) for a health care \n     provider or health care institution from liability, loss, or \n     damages than those provided by this paragraph;\n       (bb) preempt or supercede any State law that permits and \n     provides for the enforcement of any arbitration agreement \n     related to a health care liability claim whether enacted \n     prior to or after the date of enactment of this Act;\n       (cc) create a cause of action that is not otherwise \n     available under Federal or State law; or\n       (dd) affect the scope of preemption of any other Federal \n     law.\n       (M) Applicability; effective date.--This paragraph shall \n     apply to any health care lawsuit brought in a Federal or \n     State court, or subject to an alternative dispute resolution \n     system, that is initiated on or after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, except that any health care lawsuit \n     arising from an injury occurring prior to the date of \n     enactment of this Act shall be governed by the applicable \n     statute of limitations provisions in effect at the time the \n     injury occurred.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3200. Mr. McCAIN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed to \namendment SA 2786 proposed by Mr. Reid (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr.\n\n[[Page S13100]]\n\nDodd, and Mr. Harkin) to the bill H.R. 3590, to amend the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986 to modify the first-time homebuyers credit in the \ncase of members of the Armed Forces and certain other Federal \nemployees, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on the \ntable; as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n               TITLE X--IMPORTATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n     SEC. 10001. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Pharmaceutical Market \n     Access and Drug Safety Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 10002. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) Americans unjustly pay up to 5 times more to fill their \n     prescriptions than consumers in other countries;\n       (2) the United States is the largest market for \n     pharmaceuticals in the world, yet American consumers pay the \n     highest prices for brand pharmaceuticals in the world;\n       (3) a prescription drug is neither safe nor effective to an \n     individual who cannot afford it;\n       (4) allowing and structuring the importation of \n     prescription drugs to ensure access to safe and affordable \n     drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration will \n     provide a level of safety to American consumers that they do \n     not currently enjoy;\n       (5) American spend more than $200,000,000,000 on \n     prescription drugs every year;\n       (6) the Congressional Budget Office has found that the cost \n     of prescription drugs are between 35 to 55 percent less in \n     other highly-developed countries than in the United States; \n     and\n       (7) promoting competitive market pricing would both \n     contribute to health care savings and allow greater access to \n     therapy, improving health and saving lives.\n\n     SEC. 10003. REPEAL OF CERTAIN SECTION REGARDING IMPORTATION \n                   OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.\n\n       Chapter VIII of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \n     (21 U.S.C. 381 et seq.) is amended by striking section 804.\n\n     SEC. 10004.

Mr. President, I want to address the issue of health care \nreform, of course, which is the main reason Congress is here this \nweekend and was here last weekend, and in all likelihood will be here \nnext weekend. But I also think it is important we put these things into \nan overall context and take a look at the bill we are voting on right \nnow.\n  We are going to have a vote on final passage tomorrow. We had a \ncloture vote this morning on a spending bill, and the spending bill--\nwhich represents six, I think, appropriations bills that did not get \ndone earlier this year--represents a package of spending that overall \nincreases by 12 percent over last year.\n  That is an interesting number, given the fact that the Consumer Price \nIndex--which is the sort of, if you will, conduit to which a lot of \nthese decisions that are made around here is tied; in other words, the \nCPI is what we view to be inflation; and sometimes we say we mark up \nbills at inflation or inflation plus this or inflation plus that--where \nthe CPI was, ending on October 1 of this year, about two-tenths of 1 \npercent but in the negative column.\n  So you have a CPI that is actually negative, an inflation index that \nis actually negative for most Americans. This, again, is representative \nof the totality of our economy and what things cost, and that is a lot \nof times how appropriations bills are measured.\n  So you have a CPI, Consumer Price Index, that is running in the \nnegative, and yet you have appropriations bills--this one representing, \nagain, as I said earlier, six appropriations bills, individual \nappropriations bills that did not get done earlier--packaged into one \nbig spending bill that is a 12-percent increase over the previous year.\n  How can we go to the American people and justify year-over-year \nspending increases that are 12 percent, when they are having to balance \ntheir budgets and tighten their belts and live in an economy where some \npeople are losing their jobs? But certainly everybody is trying, \nstruggling to survive out there. That is true for small businesses. \nThat is true for families. That is true for pretty much everybody, it \nseems, except the Congress.\n  Here in Washington, DC, we seem not to be listening to what is \nhappening in America. We are marking up spending bills at 12 percent \nover last year's level, at a time when the CPI is actually running in \nthe negative--when you have negative cost-of-living increase. Yet we \nare marking up appropriations bills that represent a 12-percent \nincrease over last year's spending level?\n  Put that on top of a stimulus bill that passed earlier this year \nthat, with interest, is a $1 trillion spending bill. So you have a $1 \ntrillion spending bill with interest passed earlier this year, much of \nwhich went to the very same\n\n[[Page S13114]]\n\nFederal agencies that are going to benefit from this 12-percent \nincrease over last year in annual appropriations. So you have a $1 \ntrillion stimulus bill, you look at appropriations bills--again, this \nbeing representative of most of the bills this year--that year-over-\nyear increase at 12 percent, at a time when most Americans are having \nto tighten their belts.\n  We hear that. We also hear that TARP is now going to be used as a \nslush fund, so to speak, to pay for all kinds of other government \nspending. In other words, they have decided--at least, I think the \nadministration has--to use the TARP fund as sort of a ``pay for'' for \nlots of things they want to do.\n  Most of us know that the TARP fund was created specifically to \nstabilize our financial markets, to prevent what we thought at the time \nwas going to be an imminent financial collapse. That purpose has been \nserved. I have a bill that would end TARP at the end of this year on \nDecember 31. If it is not allowed to expire at the end of this year, \nwhen it is set to expire--if it is not allowed to expire, if it is \nextended and it goes well into next year--it can be used, as I said, \nfor all these other things that politicians have designs on doing.\n  So my legislation would end it at December 31 of this year, as was \nintended, and make sure any funds that are paid back in from loans that \nhave been made or assets that have been acquired actually go back to \nthe Treasury to pay down the Federal debt. Because that is what, in \nfact, TARP was intended to do. Once the job was accomplished, it was \nnot to become a ``grab bag'' and ``found money'' for Congress to use \nfor all these other things.\n  You have the TARP fund now morphing and evolving into this sort of \npolitical slush fund to be used for all these other spending \npriorities. You have the stimulus, this $1 trillion stimulus bill, out \nthere. You have this appropriations bill with a 12-percent year-over-\nyear increase over last year's level. On top of all that, we pile on a \n$2.5 trillion expansion of the Federal Government in Washington to pay \nfor a new entitlement program with the health care reform bill that has \nbeen, is being debated in the Senate in the last week and in the week \nto come.\n  So at some point you have to say--and I think the American people \nlook at us and say--enough already. I think that is what they are \nsaying. I think the reason we are seeing these public opinion polls \nthat are turning a thumbs-down on this massive expansion of the Federal \nGovernment here in Washington to fund health care is because the \nAmerican public is becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the idea \nthat the Federal Government continues to run the credit card up.\n  The stimulus money was all borrowed money. The TARP money is borrowed \nmoney. The appropriations bills, for the most part, this year are--or \nfor a large part, at least--borrowed money. Mr. President, 43 cents out \nof every dollar the Congress spent in the last year--the fiscal year \nending September 30--was borrowed money.\n  We continue to borrow and borrow and pass on the debt to future \ngenerations. We cannot continue to do that and expect to have a future \nthat enjoys the same level of prosperity and the same level of economic \ngrowth and vitality we have experienced in the past. You cannot \ncontinue to pile up these massive amounts of debt. The Federal debt is \ngoing to double in 5 years, it is going to triple in 10, if we continue \non the current path. Right now, I do not see anything that is going to \nput any brakes on this.\n  The capacity and the appetite and the willingness and the inclination \nof Washington, DC, and politicians here to continue to spend and spend \nseems to be unlimited. At some point, we have to put the brakes on. We \nhave people who have a foot on the pedal. The Democratic majority in \nthe House of Representatives, the Democratic majority here in the \nSenate, the White House, all have their feet on the accelerator. \nSomebody has to put on the brake. That is what we are trying to do.\n  That is why I think it is important we end TARP before it gets \nmisused and spent for all these other things and why it is important we \nrein in these appropriations bills. We are doing everything we can to \nstop this appropriations bill from being passed at a 12-percent \nincrease over last year's level. And we are doing everything we can, I \nwould say, to stop this massive expansion--$2.5 trillion expansion--of \nthe Federal Government to fund the new health care entitlement, at a \ntime when we have all these other debt problems and deficits, as far as \nthe eye can see.\n  So I wanted to, in shifting gears, paint that as sort of the context \nagainst which this whole health care debate is occurring. But I want to \nshift, if I could, to some of the more recent developments with regard \nto the debate over health care.\n  I think there are a couple things that, to me, are game changers in \nterms of the debate. One of those, of course, is the study that came \nout yesterday from the CMS, or the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \nServices, the Actuary who points out the health care reform bill that \nis currently before the Senate will not drive health care costs down \nbut will, in fact, increase health care costs by $234 billion, and that \ntoday, about one-sixth of every dollar we spend is on health care; that \n10 years from now, in 2019, that will be almost 21 percent--that is \nwhat the CMS Actuary said--that the total amount we spend on health \ncare in this country--which today is about 17 percent--10 years from \nnow will be almost 21 percent. So the amount spent on health care as a \npercentage of our gross domestic product goes dramatically up, not \ndown. And $234 billion is what the CMS Actuary said health care costs \nwould go up by in the next 10 years.\n  Of course, we had previously the CBO essentially saying the same \nthing. The Congressional Budget Office--for those who live outside of \nWashington, DC--is sort of the nonpartisan estimator, if you will, of \nwhat a lot of these Federal programs are going to cost.\n  The Congressional Budget Office said that under the bill put forward \nby the Senate majority here, the Democratic leadership in the Senate, \nyou would actually increase health care spending by $160 billion over \nthe next 10 years, again bending the health care cost curve up, not \ndown. So now you have the experts--the Congressional Budget Office, the \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services Actuary--all saying health \ncare costs are going to go up, not down, and significantly up.\n  You have the small business organizations out there saying--the \nNational Federation of Independent Business, the Chamber of Commerce, \nthe National Association of Wholesalers and Distributors, and I might \nadd there is another group that has been formed called the Small \nBusiness Coalition for Affordable Healthcare, which represents 50 \ndifferent business organizations--this health care reform bill will \nincrease the cost of doing business in this country and will drive up \nhealth care costs. So they have come out in opposition to it, as have \nall the other business organizations I mentioned, for the same reason. \nThey realize health care reform ought to be about getting their costs \ndown and improving their ability to create jobs. By the way, three-\nquarters of the jobs created in our economy are created by small \nbusiness.\n  So what are we going to do to small businesses? Pile on a bunch of \nnew taxes to pay for this expansion, this $2.5 trillion expansion of \nthe Federal Government in the form of this new health care entitlement. \nAll for what? So they can see their health care costs continue to go \nup. You pile on the new taxes, you cut Medicare to all the providers \nout there. And I want to draw them into this too because not only have \nthe small businesses said this is going to drive health care costs up--\nand they have come out opposed to it--not only has the Congressional \nBudget Office said that, not only the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \nServices Actuary said that, you have academics saying that, but now you \nalso have the providers saying that.\n  Hospitals and physicians groups are coming out and saying this latest \nproposal by the Democratic majority to expand Medicare will put \nhospitals out of business. Because hospitals get underreimbursed by \nMedicare, and so do physicians. So what do they do? They shift costs \nover to the private payers, which is everybody else in this country, \nand everybody else sees their premiums go up. It shrinks the number of \nprivate payers, expands the number of government payers, and for these\n\n[[Page S13115]]\n\nhospitals in places such as South Dakota--I see my colleague from \nWyoming on the floor--that are very dependent on Medicare, they are \ngoing to see less and less reimbursement coming into their facilities, \nwhich does not cover their costs, and very soon you will have a lot of \nhospitals, particularly in rural areas, going out of business. That has \nbeen stated. The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Senator \nConrad from North Dakota, came out and said that basically this latest \nproposal would bankrupt a lot of hospitals in his State. I think that \nis true for a lot of States and particularly in rural States such as \nmine and the Senator from Wyoming.\n\n  We have small businesses saying: We can't sustain these increases. We \nthink this is a really bad deal. We have the experts, the analysts, the \nCongressional Budget Office, and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices saying this increases costs for health care in this country. \nAnd now we have the American people weighing in and saying: We think \nthis is a bad deal. We think it is going to increase our health care \ncosts. The CNN poll that came out 2 days ago said 61 percent of \nAmericans oppose the health care reform bill that is pending right now \nin the Senate. Other polls show similar results. So we have a very \nsizable majority of the American people who have now weighed in saying \nthis is a bad deal because it cuts Medicare, it raises taxes, and at \nthe end of the day, it raises premiums.\n  So who is for this? Who thinks this is a good thing? Well, apparently \na number of Democrats here in the Senate, but that is an increasingly \nshrinking universe of people.\n  The American people have said it is a bad deal. The experts say it is \na bad deal. Small businesses say it is a bad deal. Providers say it is \na bad deal. What is left?\n  Well, I am hoping there are a couple of courageous Democrats who are \ngoing to step forward, agree with the American people, and say: We are \nlistening to the American people. We are listening to the experts. We \nare listening to small businesses that create two-thirds or three-\nquarters of the jobs in our economy. And we agree we are going to stop \nthis train wreck from happening, sit down, start over, do this right, \nwork with Republicans, and write a bill that actually does constrain \ncosts, that drives the cost curve down and provides access for more \nAmericans. I hope there are a few Democrats out there who will do that \nbecause I think on our side we have all concluded, based on what we \nhear from the American people, what we hear from the experts, what we \nhear from the business community, what we hear from the provider \ncommunity, the hospitals and the physicians, that this is a really bad \ndeal. At the end of the day, after all of this new spending, after all \nthe new taxes, after all the Medicare cuts, what are we left with?\n  What everybody says they want out of health care reform is lower \ncosts. Our colleagues on the other side come down here repeatedly and \nsay we have to do something about the cost of health care. People in \nthis country are struggling with health care costs, absolutely. We \ncould not agree more. What they will do with this bill if it passes is \nmake matters worse, not better, by increasing costs for most Americans.\n  I wish to show my colleagues exactly what I mean. If you are a family \nof four--and this is, again, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, which looked at this and analyzed these bills and said: If you \nare in the small group market or large group market, you are going to \nsee year-over-year increases in health care costs, which is somewhere \nbetween 5 and 6 percent, which is what we are seeing today--and by the \nway, that is twice the rate of inflation historically--but a 5- to 6-\npercent increase in health care premiums. If you are in the individual \nmarketplace, you are going to see your premiums go up anywhere from 10 \nto 13 percent beyond that. So if you are in the individual market, it \ngets much worse. But if you are in the small group or large group \nmarket, here is what it says: If you are in a family of four today and \nyou are receiving your insurance through your employer and they are \ngetting their insurance through a large group market, you are paying \nabout $13,000 a year. In 2016, 7 years from now, you are going to be \npaying over $20,000 a year for health insurance coverage.\n  So your health insurance coverage is going to go up under this bill, \nnot down, according to the Congressional Budget Office. It is going to \ngo up at a rate that is double the rate of inflation. Again, this is \nfor people who get their insurance in the large and small group \nmarkets. The yellow line represents the large group market, the red \nline represents the small group markets, but the result is the same. It \nis an upward trajectory. It is a spike up in the cost of health \ninsurance for people who get their coverage for health insurance in one \nof those two markets. Again, as I said before, if you are in the \nindividual marketplace, you could spike this thing like this because \ntheir costs are going to be 10 to 13 percent above and beyond what you \nare seeing here in the large group market. That is according to the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  So 90 percent of Americans, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, are going to see their health insurance premiums stay the same, \nand by ``stay the same,'' I mean go up by twice the rate of inflation--\nin other words, locking in the status quo--or worse yet, if you are in \nthe individual marketplace, it will be going up 10 to 13 percent.\n  So all of this talk about lowering the cost of health care and not \nsettling for the status quo may sound good, it is great rhetoric, but \nit is absolutely factually inaccurate.\n  So our colleagues who come down here day after day talking about how \nthis health care reform bill is going to drive down the cost of health \ncare are not listening. They are not listening to the American people. \nThey are not listening to the experts. They are not listening to the \nsmall business community. They are not listening to the provider \ncommunity.\n  I have to say that even the academic community has weighed in on this \nparticular issue as well.\n  I wish to read for my colleagues something that was said recently by \nthe dean of the Harvard Medical School:\n\n       Speeches and news reports could lead you to believe the \n     proposed congressional legislation would tackle the problems \n     of cost, access, and quality, but that's not true. The \n     overall effort will fail to qualify as reform. I find near \n     unanimity of opinion that whatever its shape, the final \n     legislation that will emerge from Congress will markedly \n     accelerate national health care spending rather than restrain \n     it. This will make an eventual solution even more difficult.\n\n  That from the dean of the Harvard Medical School.\n  So I hope that before this debate concludes--the push is to get it \ndone by the end of the year. I am not sure why. It seems to me, at \nleast, that this is not something we want to hurry. We are talking \nabout reordering or restructuring one-sixth of the American economy. As \nI said, today it represents 17 percent of our GDP. We spend about $2.5 \ntrillion a year on health care. We ought to get this right. There is an \nintent on the other side to jam this through sometime next week. Well, \nI hope we can put the brakes on this. I hope there are a couple of \ncourageous Democrats--at least one but two would be better, maybe even \nmore--who will step forward and say: We are going to listen to the \nAmerican people. We are going to listen to the providers out there, the \nhospitals and physicians. We are going to listen to the experts. We are \ngoing to listen to the small business community that creates the jobs. \nAnd we are not going to blindly follow the leader and take this country \nover the cliff when it comes to health care delivery and when it comes \nto our economy.\n  There is one final point I will make about that because I thought \nthis was a remarkable finding by the CMS in their study. They \nessentially said that the savings that are proposed in Medicare--the \nnew Federal spending that relies on Medicare cuts which are unlikely to \nbe sustainable on a permanent basis--we all, over here, agree with \nthat. The appetite for the Congress, the willingness for the Congress \nto cut reimbursements to hospitals and to nursing homes and to home \nhealth agencies and to hospices, I find very suspect.\n  So at the end of the day, if you cannot sustain those--and let's say, \nfor example, for a minute that you can. Let's say these Medicare cuts \ntake effect. If they take effect, and if the Democrats have their way \nand they expand Medicare, we are going to put more and\n\n[[Page S13116]]\n\nmore people onto a sinking ship because we have a program that is going \nto be bankrupt in 2017, we are told by the actuaries. We are going to \ncut $1 trillion out of it over the next 10 years when it is fully \nimplemented, and we are going to put more people onto it. So if those \ncuts occur, we are going to have more and more hospitals going out of \nbusiness because they flat aren't going to be able to make ends meet. \nThat is the other thing, by the way, the CMS Actuary found in their \nstudy.\n\n  But they said they don't believe we can sustain these Medicare cuts \non a permanent basis. Meaning what? Meaning that the cost of this \nprogram, $2.5 trillion over 10 years, is going to fall on the backs of \nfuture generations because it will be borrowed. It will be added to the \ndebt, which is growing at $1 trillion a year, as I said earlier.\n  We are going to have a vote, if you can believe that, here in the \nvery near future to actually raise the debt ceiling by $2 trillion over \nand above what it is today, which is $12 trillion. This debt situation \nis probably the most serious crisis and challenge facing this country \ngoing forward. It just seems as though there is an endless, limitless \nappetite for spending and borrowing around here, and at some point the \nchicken is going to come home to roost and the bills will have to be \npaid. You can't continue to sustain this level of borrowing.\n  These Medicare cuts are unsus-tainable, which is what the CMS Actuary \nsays. That means a lot of the cost of this new program is going to be \nfinanced partly by tax increases, which, as I said, are harmful to \nsmall businesses, but secondly by more and more borrowing and more and \nmore debt. More and more future generations, younger Americans, will be \nfaced with a massive inheritance of Federal debt because we weren't \nwilling to make the hard choices to be able to live within our means.\n  So I hope when it is all said and done, there will be some people who \nwill step forward, have the courage not to blindly follow the leader \nbut to say with the American people, with the experts, with the small \nbusiness community, with the provider community, with even some of the \nacademic community, that this does nothing to constrain or lower health \ncare costs. The emperor has no clothes. If they do that, we can sit \ndown together.\n  We are not here for a minute to suggest we shouldn't have health care \nreform. All we are here to suggest is that it ought to be done the \nright way, it ought to be done on a bipartisan basis, and it ought to \nbe done in a way that actually bends the cost curve down rather than \nraises it and that does not cost us $2.5 trillion of cuts to Medicare, \nwhich is going to impact a lot of seniors, increase taxes, which is \ngoing to crush small businesses, or debt, which is going to punish \nfuture generations.\n  That is what this debate is about. It is a consequential debate for \nAmerica's future. The stakes are very high. I hope the American people \nwill be engaged in it, and I hope we will be able to find some \nbipartisan support for defeating this really bad idea and moving to \nsomething that actually will make a difference, that will restrain \ncosts, and that will provide health insurance reform that is meaningful \nreform and that doesn't bankrupt us, doesn't bankrupt hospitals, \ndoesn't bankrupt future generations, doesn't cost us jobs by putting \nnew taxes on small businesses, and actually bends the cost curve down.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota for \nhis enthusiasm and passion and ability to explain things. The passion \nwe have seen throughout the day from the Republicans who have spoken is \na reflection of the passion we are hearing in our telephone calls and \nin our e-mails and in our letters. Our volume is much higher than the \n61 percent the CNN poll says. Of course, we wouldn't expect the CNN \npoll to necessarily reflect our constituents. That enthusiasm across \nAmerica, that passion, that concern should be reflected in this \nChamber.\n  I get a lot of mail and even phone calls from other States, and they \nsay: How come my Senator isn't listening to me? How come he is not \nlistening to all of my friends? Thank you for what you are doing on \nhealth care.\n  What we are doing on health care, of course, is asking that it be \ndone step by step so that we can get the confidence of the American \npeople, not do something grandiose that can't be well thought out \nbecause it is so big.\n  I spent time as the ranking member of the Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee in an extensive markup on a bill that we had no \ninput in writing. The other side says we had input into the amendments, \nand we did do some amendments and some were accepted. There were even \nsome that were fairly significant that were accepted.\n  Of course, what was disappointing was that after the August recess--\nthey didn't print it before the August recess because they didn't want \npeople to know what was actually in it at that time. But following the \nAugust recess, when they finally printed it, we found out that \nprovisions we had put in by agreement had been ripped out. Never have I \nhad that happen in my 12 years in the U.S. Senate.\n  Then I was part of the Gang of 6--the Group of 6, my mother would \nprefer to call it because she told me never to join a gang. But over a \nperiod of at least 60 days, we spent a lot of time and effort from \nmorning until night trying to get a health care bill that would work \nfor America.\n  One of the things we discovered is that it is very extensive. Nobody \ncan comprehend how big health care is in America. We talked about it \nbeing 16 percent of the whole economy. Well, does that register with \nyou? We talk about the trillions that are involved. I don't understand \ntrillions. We spend billions around here, but trillions is a whole \nother level. I don't even think the kids who work on billions \nunderstand trillions. When we say 1 trillion, a lot of people say: \nWell, that is just 1. Well, it is a thousand billion, and a billion is \na thousand million. So it is a lot of money.\n  But when we were doing this in this Gang of 6, what we did was kind \nof divide the issues up into 13 different parts--you might call them \nsteps.\n  We started working through those. Sometimes we would have to leave \none because we had basic questions we needed to ask about those \nsections so we would have a big enough understanding to be able to \ndraft legislation for it. Basic questions. Basic questions. We only \nmade it through slightly more than half the 13 areas before we were \nfaced with a phony deadline. They said September 15 is the drop-dead \ndate for this group to finish work. If you don't have it done by then, \nwe will put something together anyway.\n  If you are still getting basic questions answered, don't you think \nyou ought to work on it a little longer and have a few more people in? \nOne of the groups we had in were the Governors. We were going to have a \nvast expansion of Medicaid--not quite as vast as is in here, and what \nis in this new bill that we have not yet seen, even though we are quite \na ways into this, but a vast expansion of Medicaid. Medicaid works \nthrough the States and the States have to pick up part of the costs--\nactually, they pick up a lot of the costs. As we have expanded Medicaid \nand expanded the rolls on Medicaid, we have put a greater burden not \nonly on the Federal Government, though it is on the Federal Government, \ntoo, but also on the State governments. The State governments don't get \nto vote on it at all.\n  The Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, who used to be a college \npresident and was also a Secretary of Education, pointed out a number \nof times that when Governors are faced with this budget crunch on \nMedicaid, what do they do? Virtually the only place they can cut is \nuniversities and colleges. That is why there has been this dramatic \nincrease in college tuition--because of what Medicaid has done to the \nStates.\n  Now we are talking about another drastic increase in the number of \npeople in Medicaid. We thought it would be a good idea if we got the \nGovernors on the phone--we hoped the Governors task force on Medicaid \nwould meet with us, and I think they might have, but we were trying to \nrush it into a short period of time, so we did conference calls. They \nwanted to know how it was going to affect their States. We knew how \nmany billions it was going to cost as a whole for those States, but we \ndidn't have a breakdown individually. CBO and the Joint Tax\n\n[[Page S13117]]\n\nCommission don't do breakdowns by States. But we had some people on \nstaff--Democratic staff--who thought they could break that down, and \nthey did. They presented us with these numbers, and I called my \nGovernor and said: I know this is going to be a problem, and I will see \nwhat I can do about it, but it is a lot of money. Of course, if I am \ntalking about how much it was for Wyoming, it would not sound nearly as \nmuch as for New York, but it is the same kind of percentages, we just \nhave less population.\n  Another surprising thing that happened to us was it looked like \nNevada and New York would be hit real hard. The next day we got numbers \nand--we had the same CBO and Joint Tax score. That didn't change a bit. \nThere was one set of numbers. But the evaluation, the next day, looked \na lot better for Nevada and New York. It didn't bring it down enough, \nso there was a special provision that has been put in the bill--it was \nnot done in the Gang of 6--that made it much nicer for Nevada and New \nYork. We said: Wait a minute, why are you doing that for Nevada and New \nYork? Some of the influential people around here from Nevada and New \nYork said this economy is in a real downturn, and we are being hit \nharder than anybody else. I said: Well, that is a nice gesture, but \nthis part of the bill isn't going into effect for 4 years. How do we \nknow that in 4 years Nevada and New York are the ones that are going to \nbe hard hit? We ought to have provisions for whoever is hard hit.\n  Those are the kinds of things we were trying to take care of in \ncommittee with inadequate numbers. As we worked through--well, the \nPresident wanted to do a speech to the Nation, a joint session speech. \nThey do those over on the House side, and the House and Senate show up \nfor it. It was on health care. Following that health care speech, the \nnext morning we went to the Gang of 6 meeting. I kept notes on what the \nPresident said. I had about 12 areas we had tried to draft legislation \non that he had pretty specific suggestions on. I had to say: This is \nsomething we didn't do. We didn't do this yet. We talked about that for \na whole day. Immigration was one of the big ones. Medical malpractice \nwas another. That has been a huge concern to the medical community.\n  I have several things I need to say on this health care bill. I know \nwe are talking in the 30 hours following the appropriations bill. I \nhave things to say about the appropriations bill too. I usually don't \ntalk for very long down here, but I have some of that pent-up passion \nfrom all the calls and things I have gotten. So I will talk about both \nspending and health care.\n  I will start with the spending because we just voted for a bill that \ncosts $446.8 billion, and Senators didn't have any opportunity to \ndebate the critical issues within that bill. Of the six bills, three--\nFinancial Services, Labor-HHS, and State and Foreign Ops--were \nairdropped into conference with no opportunity for debate on this \nfloor. So we had no opportunity for consideration. The Transportation \nbill, the HUD bill, received a 23-percent increase over last year. The \nState and Foreign Ops bill received a 33-percent increase over last \nyear. Collectively, the six appropriations bills account for a 12-\npercent increase in Federal spending over last year.\n  Our national deficit for the past fiscal year stands at $1.4 \ntrillion. I don't see that going down at all. Our current unemployment \nlevel is at 10 percent, despite the administration's insistence earlier \nin the year that Congress pass a $1 trillion-plus stimulus package. The \nSenate is currently in the middle of a debate on a health care reform \nbill that has a 10-year implementation cost of $2.5 trillion. Sometime \nin the next month, we will be forced to raise the Nation's debt ceiling \nfor the second time this year to a level that exceeds the current \nceiling of $12.1 trillion.\n  The bill makes a number of significant policy changes with respect to \nthe fairness doctrine. This omnibus does not include the fiscal year \n2008 ban on Federal funds being used to enforce or implement the so-\ncalled fairness doctrine. The bill makes changes to several \nlongstanding policy provisions contained in the Financial Services bill \nand specifically the District of Columbia section dealing with \nabortion, medical marijuana, needle exchanges, domestic partners, and \nthe DC Opportunity Scholarships.\n  The bill also contains 5,224 earmarks that total $3.8 billion.\n  Well, let me go into the definition of an earmark. According to the \nchampion of it for many years, Senator McCain, it is not an earmark if \nyou take a specific project to the committee of jurisdiction, where \nthey can debate it and decide whether it is a valid project and how it \nmight fit in with other formulas and things they are already working \non. If the committee that actually works that issue approves it, it is \nnot an earmark. But, of course, it has to be put in, in the \nauthorization process, not dropped in by airmail when the conference \ncommittee is meeting at the end of the bill. It is considered an \nearmark when it is just sent to conference, nobody got to debate it and \nvote on it, and it was shoved into the bill. There are ways special \nprojects can be done and approved by several votes. Normally, it would \nbe the committee of authorization and then the Appropriations Committee \nand then the floor of the Senate; and that same process would have \nalready been done on the House side because they start all funding \nbills. So that is probably six or seven votes on an item before it can \nactually get passed, if it goes through the regular procedure.\n  Of course, it is easier to have somebody to champion it and quietly \nslip it in without any votes, except a final vote. The final vote is \nwhat we are doing right now. It is on the whole package. You cannot \npick out a section or an earmark and have a vote on that. Besides that, \nwith 5,224 earmarks, that would take a long time. But it totals $3.8 \nbillion. That is still a lot of money. It has been denigrated since we \nwent into the trillion-dollar category, but $3.8 billion is still a lot \nof money.\n  How is this playing out around the country? I found a blog I hadn't \nseen before. It kind of speaks to what we are doing in appropriations \nright now. This is uglytruthstudios.com. It begins:\n\n       Don't tell me where your priorities are. Show me where you \n     spend your money and I will tell you what they are.\n\n  That is James W. Frick, who is not the author of this. The author \nthen goes on to say:\n\n       I was mad when I decided to start this blog and podcast. I \n     was mad about the current state of our congressional \n     spending. I know, I know, a lot of folks are upset about the \n     government and what they spend. My anger starts with the \n     simple fact that they cannot complete the spending process. \n     They haven't been able to complete the process, not even one \n     time, since 1999.\n\n  You can see that this is directed against both sides of the aisle.\n\n       Folks, you are right to be mad about the out of control \n     spending of the Federal Government, but we all must start \n     with a hard look at how the money is being spent before we \n     can take an honest look at what it's being spent on.\n       Take for instance the topic of Healthcare. You will be hard \n     pressed to find a single soul in this country that doesn't \n     think the system needs to be re-evaluated.\n       For the last eight plus months we have heard on the morning \n     news, the Sunday talk shows, from congressional leaders, the \n     President of the United States, and even concerned citizens \n     about the impending healthcare crisis.\n       Primetime television has been interrupted for Presidential \n     addresses. The President addressed a joint session of \n     Congress, he held town meetings, he held focus group \n     meetings, he met with members of industry.\n       Congress itself has begged and pleaded for people to not \n     get too excited about their plans, to work with them on \n     putting reform in place. This was a crisis. A crisis that \n     needed to be addressed immediately, the citizens of the \n     United States of America needed to get behind the effort they \n     were putting forth.\n       The media was dominated with the urgency to get something \n     done. Television showed outraged Americans at town hall \n     meetings. Congress exchanged ideas and both sides pointed the \n     finger at the other side trying to show that their side was \n     most in tune with what our country needed. They were on top \n     of this situation.\n       Well they have ``sort of'' been tending to the business of \n     our nation's healthcare. The ugly truth though is this: in \n     their rush to be in the media on the Healthcare crisis, \n     Congress has not yet completed the Labor, HHS and Education \n     Appropriation for the 2010 Federal Fiscal year. The House \n     completed their version of the bill on July 27. The Senate \n     has not yet passed a version of the bill.\n       The Senate in all their talk about getting Healthcare done \n     has yet to even take the bill up on the floor for a vote.\n\n  Well, that part isn't true anymore. It has been finally taken up. It \nwas supposed to be October 1, but we are tardy in that.\n\n\n[[Page S13118]]\n\n\n       Now, mind you, tomorrow night you will probably have your \n     football game, family dinner or general quiet evening \n     interrupted by the Senate working through the weekend.\n\n  That is where we are now.\n\n       A vote of monumental importance during prime time \n     television, but not on the job that they should have been \n     doing; no, no, this is a vote on what they want to do.\n       For simple reference sake this is the equivalent of taking \n     out a trillion plus dollar loan, making commitments \n     associated to the loan, and never spending a second asking \n     yourself the following questions: Is this in the budget? Can \n     we afford it? Hell have we even thought about what we are \n     willing to spend on it? Have we decided yet what we are \n     spending on healthcare this year?\n       Healthcare was not a big enough problem this year for the \n     United States Senate to complete the normal course of \n     business by appropriating the spending for Fiscal Year 2010. \n     However, it apparently is a big enough to deal to forward \n     spend a conservative average of over $85 billion a year. It \n     is not a big enough deal to spend the $160 Plus Billion this \n     year that includes Labor and Education as well.\n       The House of Representatives despite passing their \n     appropriation in July has not accounted for the spending in \n     their passage of a conservatively estimated $1.2 trillion \n     Healthcare Plan. I am sure they would argue that they have, \n     their actual spending doesn't start for a few years. I would \n     argue that you had better start thinking about doubling \n     spending in 5 years now.\n       That is a slap in the face to hard working Americans. In my \n     book we all have roles to play. If you got elected to \n     Congress or in this specific case, the Senate, you were \n     placed in a position of public trusteeship. You were elected \n     to spend the people's money and make sure we are a solvent \n     nation. I bet that they just got so caught up in solving the \n     problem that they forgot to handle the process of budgeting \n     and spending. But wait, they continue to spend, and they make \n     forward commitments with our money that never come in on \n     budget.\n       You will find that I am not a big call to action guy. I am \n     actually kicking myself for not stopping my normal job and \n     getting started railing on this problem before now. I have \n     watched in great horror over the last 10 years as both \n     parties have ignored the process of spending, and funded our \n     government with our tax dollars through one size fits all \n     process. A one size fits all process that generally is traded \n     on our hard earned tax dollars, votes exchanged for passage.\n       It is time for the nonsense to stop. Keep watching them. I \n     have heard and firmly believe that you can track someone's \n     intentions by how they plan and spend their money. No matter \n     what the claimed intentions may be, people normally put their \n     money where their mouth is. Congress is putting our money \n     where their mouth is. If Healthcare isn't important enough to \n     finish the appropriations process on, then don't take the \n     time to spend more money on it.\n       Remember--It's all about the money stupid.\n\n  Mr. President, we are finally getting to the spending. We have been \nspending all year, but we are finally getting to some of these pieces. \nIt still leaves the defense piece undone. We are continuing last year's \nappropriations up to the current time.\n  I have some things I have gleaned from different places. I \nparticularly thank the Wall Street Journal for their articles and \neditorials that inform America. I think if I were picking one source of \ninformation, that is the one I would pick. I read the Washington Post, \nthe Washington Times, the Wall Street Journal, and I get clips from \nevery newspaper in Wyoming. I get a couple of those newspapers \ncomplete. I read a lot of news, but from a national perspective and one \nthat is actually paying attention to what we are doing here, my \nfavorite is the Wall Street Journal.\n  Earlier in the week, I quoted from a cost article I had found in the \nWall Street Journal. I was chastised for using them as a source and \nthen was countered by a Senator using Wikipedia. You can go into \nWikipedia and do your own editing. I am not sure if that is a good \nsource. I would prefer to rely on the Wall Street Journal.\n  There is not any article or opinion that cannot be quibbled with, and \nthat is just like the amendments we have here. What I prefer to think \nis when an amendment or an article or a speech is given, we ought to be \nlooking for the idea, the grain of truth, the juice of it that should \nbe used, and we are not doing that right now. We are just doing \namendments there and amendments here. We are defeating the amendments \nhere. And it kind of bothers me that we have all these amendments from \nthis side because, first of all, our amendments were voted down, all \nexcept two, when we went through the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee process to get the bill out of committee and when we \nwent to the Finance Committee, the same thing happened. I think we had \ntwo amendments that were taken as well over a whole week of amendments. \nThe two bills were taken to a closed door back here and were massaged \ninto a new bill. Some pieces of those two bills can be found there, but \nnot all of it and not in the same form. We had no input to that at all. \nNo input at all. Now it is on the Senate floor, and we have the chance \nto do amendments.\n  I contend the Democrats are filibustering their own bill because \nevery time we put up an amendment, they put up an amendment. If you \nwrote the bill, that bill ought to be good enough that you do not have \nto keep countering your own bill. We did not get to write the bill so \nwe ought to be able to make at least some points about what ought to be \nchanged by using our amendments.\n  Last week--one of the most fascinating things around here that I have \nseen--there was a Democratic amendment and then a Democratic side-by-\nside to it. Normally we get to present the side-by-sides. They are \narguing within themselves. It is on a very important issue.\n  Getting back to the spending, I will mention that since taking \noffice, Mr. Obama pushed through a $787 billion stimulus bill. Hardly \nany of that money has actually gone out. I would guess about 25 percent \nof it is all because there is health IT in there. It is $47 billion, \nand that is not going to go out for 4 years. I don't know how you put \nsomething in a stimulus bill where you are trying to get something done \nimmediately and not release the money for 4 years. Granted, there is \nsome work that needs to be done in that 4 years in order to make that \nmoney worth anything at all. It just fascinates me.\n  We had a $787 billion stimulus bill that was not anticipated to go \ninto effect right away; $33 billion expansion of SCHIP; a $410 billion \nOmnibus appropriations spending bill; and an $80 billion car company \nbailout. The President also pushed an $821 billion cap-and-trade bill \nthrough the House and is now urging Congress to pass a nearly $1 \ntrillion health care bill.\n  The administration says it is now instructing agencies to either \nfreeze spending or propose 5-percent cuts in their budget for next \nyear. This will not add up to much unless agencies use the budget they \nhad before the stimulus inflated their spending on their baseline in \ncalculating their cuts. That is why we are talking about this bill \nright now, the minibus or omnibus that is pretty ominous, with all the \nspending in it, with every one of those bills having a huge increase \nover a year ago. That will get built into the baseline so next year \nthere can be another huge increase. They compound dramatically.\n  If the Education Department uses its current stimulus-inflated budget \nof $141 billion instead of the $60 billion budget it had before the \nPresident moved into the White House, freezing its budget will do \nnothing to fix the fiscal mess that has been created. As I mentioned, \nthere is this little thing of second-degreeing their own amendment.\n  The Democrats are having a little problem deciding on their message. \nOn the one hand, the President said just this week that we have to \n``spend our way out of this recession. On the other they keep telling \nus the deficit is too large and isn't 'sustainable.' In this tug of \npolitical spin, watch what they spend, not what they say. And that \nmeans watching this weekend's expected Senate vote,'' which we have \nhad, ``on the 1,088-page $445 billion''--ominous--`` `omnibus' package \nof spending bills to fund the government for fiscal 2010. The House \npassed a similar elephant earlier this week''--I don't know why they \nare referring to it that way; it is similar to a donkey--``allowing \nspending federal agency budgets to increase spending by some $48 \nbillion, or about 12 percent from 2009. That increase--when inflation \nis negligible--is in addition to the $311 billion in stimulus already \nauthorized or out the door for these programs. Adding this new stash \nmeans that federal agencies will have received nearly a 70 percent \nincrease in the last 2 years.''\n  Has anybody gotten that kind of increase? ``Oh, and that's not all. \nThe President and Congress also want to spend as much as $200 billion \nmore\n\n[[Page S13119]]\n\nfrom the Troubled Asset Relief Program''--which is another stimulus, \nbut it was done as a series of loans, so we are supposed to get the \nmoney back from that. What they are talking about doing is taking the \nmoney from that program and using it for some other programs. Anything \nthat comes back is supposed to go to reduce the deficit. Lord knows \nthat is big enough.\n  As I mentioned, there are 5,324 earmarks in this bill. That brings \nthe total for the year to about 10,000 or about 23 for every \ncongressional district. That is after a promise that the President \nwould not sign any bill that had earmarks, but he has already done that \nonce. Hopefully, he will not do it twice.\n  We have been talking about jobs this week. I even got invited to the \nWhite House to talk to the President about jobs. Of course, the message \nthe Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, and I delivered to the \nPresident is, we ought to get the Workforce Investment Act done. That \nis a job training program that would train 900,000 people a year to \nhigher skill levels to meet some of the skill levels we are missing in \nthis country that we are having to export.\n  What has been the status on this bill? We have been working on this \nfor 4 years--4 years. This country did not need jobs before. Now we \nneed jobs, so maybe we are going to get something done on that.\n  She, I, and Senator Kennedy passed this bill through the Senate twice \nunanimously, but the House has never taken it up. I don't know how we \nare going to get jobs done if something that is that bipartisan--it \npassed the Senate both times with everybody voting for it. We cannot \nget more bipartisan than everybody voting for it. We are talking about \nbipartisan bills. That is really important.\n  Talking about jobs, one of the things I mentioned at the White House \nwas that 2 days before this meeting, the EPA had put out the notice of \nthe new regulation where they are going to take care of greenhouse gas \nemissions, CO2 and seven other chemicals.\n  According to Kimberly A. Strassel:\n\n       In the high stakes game of chicken the Obama White House \n     has been playing with Congress over who will regulate the \n     Earth's climate.\n\n  Right now the Copenhagen meeting is going on--\n\n       The president's team just motored into a ditch. So much for \n     threats.\n       The threat the White House has been leveling at Congress is \n     the Environmental Protection Agency's ``endangerment \n     finding,'' which EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson finally \n     issued this week. The finding lays the groundwork for the \n     EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions across the entire \n     economy, on the grounds that global warming is hazardous \n     to human health.\n       From the start, the Obama team has wielded the EPA action \n     as a club, warning Congress that if it did not come up with \n     cap-and-trade legislation the EPA would act on its own--and \n     in a far more blunt fashion than Congress preferred. As one \n     anonymous administration official menaced again this week: \n     ``If [Congress doesn't] pass this legislation,'' the EPA is \n     going to have to ``regulate in a command-and-control way, \n     which will probably generate even more uncertainty.''\n       The thing about threats, though, is that at some point you \n     have to act on them. The EPA has been sitting on its finding \n     for months, much to the agitation of the environmental groups \n     that have been upping the pressure for action.\n       President Obama, having failed to get climate legislation, \n     didn't want to show up to the Copenhagen climate talks with \n     big, fat nothing. So the EPA pulled the pin. In doing so, it \n     exploded its own threat.\n       Far from alarm, the feeling sweeping through many quarters \n     of the Democratic Congress is relief. Voters know cap-and-\n     trade is Washington code for painful new energy taxes. With a \n     recession on, the subject has become poisonous in \n     congressional districts. Blue Dogs and swing-state senators \n     watched in alarm as local Democrats in the recent Virginia \n     and New Jersey elections were pounded on the issue, and lost \n     their seats.\n       But now? Hurrah! It's the administration's problem! No one \n     can say Washington isn't doing something; the EPA has it \n     under control. The agency's move gives Congress a further \n     excuse not to act.\n       ``The Obama administration now owns this political hot \n     potato,'' says one industry source. ``If I'm [Nebraska \n     Senator] Ben Nelson or [North Dakota Senator] Kent Conrad, \n     why would I ever want to take it back?''\n       All the more so, in Congress's view, because the EPA \n     ``command and control'' threat may yet prove hollow. Now that \n     the endangerment finding has become reality, the litigation \n     is also about to become real. Green groups pioneered the art \n     of environmental lawsuits. It turns out the business \n     community took careful notes.\n       Industry groups are gearing up for a legal onslaught; and \n     don't underestimate their prospects. The leaked emails from \n     the Climatic Research Unit in England alone are a gold mine \n     for those who want to challenge the science underlying the \n     theory of manmade global warming.\n       But the EPA's legal vulnerabilities go beyond that. The \n     agency derives its authority to regulate pollutants from the \n     Clean Air Act. To use that law to regulate greenhouse gases, \n     the EPA has to prove those gases are harmful to human health.\n\n  That is the endangerment finding. One is CO2, and I am \nbreathing that out right know.\n\n       Put another way, it must provide ``science'' showing that a \n     slightly warmer earth will cause Americans injury or death. \n     Given that most climate scientists admit that a warmer earth \n     could provide ``net benefits'' to the West, this is a tall \n     order.\n       Then there are the rules stemming from the finding. Not \n     wanting to take on the political nightmare of regulating \n     every American lawn mower, the EPA has produced a ``tailoring \n     rule'' that it says allows it to focus solely on large \n     greenhouse gas emitters. Yet the Clean Air Act--authored by \n     Congress--clearly directs EPA to also regulate small \n     emitters.\n       This is where the green groups come in. The Tailoring rule \n     ``invites suits,'' says Sen. John Barrasso--\n\n  Who is the other Senator from Wyoming--\n\n     who has merged as a top Senate watchdog of EPA actions. Talk \n     of business litigation aside, Mr. Barrasso sees ``most of the \n     lawsuits coming from the environmental groups'' who want to \n     force the EPA to regulate everything.\n       [The President] may emerge from Copenhagen with some sort \n     of ``deal.'' But his real problem is getting Congress to act, \n     and his EPA move may have just made that job harder.\n\n  I thank Kimberly Strassel for those words.\n  Staying on the topic of jobs:\n\n       House Democrats keep stepping on President Obama's applause \n     lines about innovation and job creation. On Tuesday, Mr. \n     Obama announced that ``we're proposing a complete \n     elimination of capital gains taxes on small business \n     investment'' for 1 year. Responding with rare dispatch, \n     the House voted yesterday--\n\n  Actually, that would be the day before yesterday now. Some of these \nthings I wrote and hoped I would give before now.\n\n     --the House voted yesterday to change the capital gains rate \n     for venture capitalists who invest in technology start-ups. \n     But rather than eliminating the tax, the House more than \n     doubled it, moving the tax rate to 35 percent from 15 percent \n     by reclassifying such gains as ordinary income.\n       Private equity fund managers and managers of real-estate \n     and oil-and-gas partnerships would also get socked with a 133 \n     percent tax-rate increase. Now, there's a way to encourage \n     economic growth and new jobs. Knowing how popular tax \n     increases are with unemployment at 10 percent, the House \n     majority rushed the bill to the floor without a hearing or \n     even a committee vote. Then they buried it in a package \n     advertised as an extension of tax cuts for research and \n     development.\n\n  And that is how it will come over here.\n  And, of course, there are some other problems in the United States \nwith jobs. There are projections that show unemployment in construction \nwill rise by about 1.3 million and that will be outweighed by the \ncontinued drop in manufacturing and mining jobs. Goods-producing \nemployment as a whole is expected to show virtually no growth in total \njobs, according to the report. By 2018, that sector will account for \n12.9 percent of the jobs, down from 14.2 percent of the jobs. You know, \nin order to grow the economy, you either have to produce something or \nyou have to sell something. So separately, the number of workers filing \nnew jobless claims rose 17,000 to 474,000 last week, the Labor \nDepartment said, which is an unwelcome change after 5 weeks of \ndeclines.\n  Of course, accounting is one of my favorite things. I am the \naccountant in the Senate, and we have been doing some accounting on \njobs that are saved. Clear back at the very beginning of the \nadministration, when Secretary Geithner was appearing before the \nFinance Committee and the President was saying he will create or save 3 \nmillion jobs, I asked what is the definition of saving a job? After he \nexplained a little bit on that, I said: Well, I think probably anybody \nwho is employed, still employed would meet that criteria, so why don't \nyou save or create 180 million jobs? But now we have had some \nmeasurements done on jobs that were saved, and this one particularly\n\n[[Page S13120]]\n\nstuck with me. There is a report on the stimulus for a shoe store in \nKentucky, and since I used to be in the shoe business as well, that \nkind of stuck out. This is from the Washington Examiner--a ticker on \nstimulus jobs created--and what they said is a shoe store owner claimed \nto create nine jobs on an $889 contract, when in fact he supplied nine \npairs of shoes to the Army Corps of Engineers. A lot of accounting \nproblems around here, and talking about saving jobs without a good \ndefinition is only one of them.\n  Let's see. The government has taken over the banking industry, the \ncar industry, trying to take over the health care industry, trying to \ntake over the energy industry, none of which Washington knows much \nabout, but one that hasn't had much said about it yet is student loans, \nand I am not sure exactly when that is coming to this body, but I did \nwant to mention that the Department of Education right now is \npressuring schools to move to a government-run student loan program in \nlieu of utilizing private lenders, who are more efficient and have \ntraditionally offered better customer service. That is why people stay \nwith them, is the better customer service, if the price is the same. \nHowever, it is also important to note that the proposed student loan \ntakeover, which is H.R. 3221, would cause private lenders to cut an \nestimated 35,000 jobs across the country. That is according to a survey \nby the Federal Family Education Loan Program Industry Groups. With the \nunemployment rate lingering around 10 percent, it is nothing short of \namazing that presumably vulnerable politicians continue to advocate big \ngovernment programs that will result in private-sector job loss.\n  We will be saying more about that as it comes up. I am not sure when \nit is going to come up, but I did hear the Secretary of Education--and \nagain, this is good government accounting--said it would provide \nanother $80 billion for them to work with. Under the best of government \naccounting, it would be $40 billion, I believe. And even that is only \nbecause of the way it is accounted for.\n  Another problem we have now is with taxes, with the estate tax, and \nthat is one that won't die because the Democrats are afraid to let the \ntax rate hit zero. For years, we have had people saying that the estate \ntax is not fair; that in this country you get taxed when you earn \nmoney, you get taxed when you buy something, you get taxed when you use \nsomething, you get taxed when you sell something, but the tax people \nare upset about is the tax you get after you are dead. We had a bill \nthat already passed. The hated death tax is scheduled to expire, with \nthe rate falling from 45 percent to zero for 2010. Then it will be \nrestructured in 2011 at a rate of 55 percent.\n  This bizarre policy goes back to 2001, when the Democrats wouldn't \nlet President Bush permanently kill the death tax. So the Republicans \nbet if the tax were eliminated for 1 year, it would never come back. \nWell, the moment of truth has arrived and the House Democrats recently \nvoted to cancel that repeal and hold the rate permanently at 45 percent \nwith a $3\\1/2\\ million exemption. So now the majority leader wants to \ndo the same, and would suspend the health care debate and turn to that \nestate tax, but he would need 60 votes to do that, and I think that is \nbecause all the Republicans and many of the Democrats are saying no to \nthat. Blanche Lincoln and Jon Kyl, Arkansas and Arizona, have placed \nsome proposals out there.\n  The correct way to tax a gain in the value of assets bequeathed to an \nheir with capital gains of 15 percent is when the assets are sold. \nThere ought to be some actual action that derives some revenue for it; \notherwise, people out our way are having to sell off ranches \nprematurely in order to have the money to pay off death taxes when the \nfounder of the family passes away. A recent problem we have had with \nthat is that the land values are going up. I suppose they have \nstagnated at the moment, but it is hard to tell. These ranchers were \nputting money in, trying to do estate planning so they could pay this \nwith not having to sell off part of the farm, and were doing a pretty \ngood job of that. Of course, they made some adjustments when we made \nadjustments and started giving them a decline. And there is going to be \na lot more said on that yet.\n  We have this massive spending bill, this huge increase in spending, \nand I want to share with you some of the words of Douglas Holtz-Eakin, \nthe former Director of the Congressional Budget Office, which we talk \nabout here regularly and point out as being a nonpartisan office. He \nspoke recently at the Senate Committee on the Budget, or relatively \nrecently--November 10. This is kind of what he said:\n\n       President Barack Obama took office promising to lead from \n     the center and solve big problems. He has exerted enormous \n     political energy attempting to reform the Nation's health-\n     care system. But the biggest economic problem facing the \n     Nation is not health care. It's the deficit. Recently, the \n     White House signaled that it will get serious about reducing \n     the deficit next year--after it locks into place the massive \n     new health-care entitlements. This is a recipe for disaster, \n     as it will create a new appetite for increased spending and \n     yet another powerful interest group to oppose deficit-\n     reduction measures.\n       Our fiscal situation has deteriorated rapidly in just the \n     past few years. The Federal Government ran a 2009 deficit of \n     $1.4 trillion--the highest since World War II--as spending \n     reached nearly 25 percent of GDP and total revenues fell \n     below 15 percent of GDP. Shortfalls like these have not been \n     seen in more than 50 years.\n       Going forward, there is no relief in sight, as spending far \n     outpaces revenues and the Federal budget is projected to be \n     in enormous deficit every year. Our national debt is \n     projected to stand at $17.1 trillion 10 years from now, or \n     over $50,000 per American. And per American means every \n     man, woman and child.\n\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       By 2019, according to the Congressional Budget Office's \n     analysis of the President's budget, the budget deficit will \n     still be roughly $1 trillion, even though the economic \n     situation will have improved and revenues will be above \n     historical norms.\n       The planned deficits will have destructive consequences for \n     both fairness and economic growth. They will force upon our \n     children and grandchildren the bill for our overconsumption. \n     Federal deficits will crowd out domestic investment and \n     physical capital, human capital, and technologies that \n     increase potential GDP and the standard of living. Financing \n     deficits could crowd out exports and harm our international \n     competitiveness, as we can already see happening with the \n     large borrowing we are doing from competitors like China.\n\n  Yes, the President went to China recently; Secretary Geithner has \nbeen to China. They weren't over there trying to visit the Great Wall. \nThey were over there trying to explain to China how we would be able to \npay off our bonds. And last week, it was said that Standard & Poor's \nand Moody's were taking a look at the United Kingdom and the United \nStates to see if there shouldn't be a downgrade in their rating. And so \nMr. Holtz-Eakin says:\n\n       At what point, financial analysts ask, do rating agencies \n     downgrade the United States? When do lenders price additional \n     risk to Federal borrowing, leading to a damaging spike in \n     interest rates? How quickly will international investors flee \n     the dollar for a new reserve currency? And how will the \n     resulting higher interest rates, diminished dollar, higher \n     inflation, and economic distress manifest itself? Given the \n     President's recent reception in China--friendly but \n     fruitless--these answers may come sooner than any of us would \n     like.\n       Mr. Obama and his advisers say they understand these \n     concerns, but the administration's policy changes are the \n     equivalent of steering the economy toward an iceberg. Perhaps \n     the most vivid example of sending the wrong message to \n     international capital markets are the health-care reform \n     bills--one that passed the House earlier this month and \n     another under consideration in the Senate. Whatever their \n     good intentions, they have too many flaws to be defensible.\n       First and foremost, neither bends the health-cost curve \n     downward. The CBO found the House bill fails to reduce the \n     pace of health-care spending growth. An audit of the bill by \n     Richard Foster, the chief actuary for the Centers for \n     Medicare and Medicaid Services--\n\n  And that is the CMS, which is a division of Health and Human \nServices. So this is the chief actuary issuing this report.\n\n     --found that the pace of national health-care spending will \n     increase by 2.1 percent over 10 years, or by about $750 \n     billion. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's bill grows just \n     as fast as the House version.\n\n  Yesterday, or the day before yesterday, we got a new actuarial report \nthat addressed the Reid bill as opposed to the House bill, and we \ntalked about that fairly extensively. I haven't seen any articles about \nit yet. But one summary comment on it is that, according to this \nActuary of CMS--which is a part of the administration--the cost of \nhealth care under the Reid bill will increase by seven-tenths of 1 \npercent.\n\n[[Page S13121]]\n\nThat doesn't sound like much, but it is seven-tenths of 1 percent \nmore--more--than if we did nothing. That is not bending the cost curve \ndown.\n  Mr. Holtz-Eakin goes on to say:\n\n       Second, each bill sets up a new entitlement program that \n     grows at 8 percent annually as far the eye can see--faster \n     than the economy will grow, faster than tax revenues will \n     grow, and just as fast as the already-broken Medicare and \n     Medicaid programs. They also create a second new entitlement \n     program, a federally run, long-term-care insurance plan.\n       Finally, the bills are fiscally dishonest, using every \n     budget gimmick and trick in the book: Leave out inconvenient \n     spending, back-load spending to disguise the true scale, \n     front-load tax revenues, let inflation push up tax revenues, \n     promise spending cuts to doctors and hospitals that have no \n     record of materializing, and so on.\n       If there really are savings to be found in Medicare, those \n     savings should be directed toward deficit reduction and \n     preserving Medicare, not to financing huge new entitlement \n     programs. Getting long-term budgets under control is hard \n     enough today. The job will be nearly impossible with a slew \n     of new entitlements in place.\n       In short, any combination of what is moving through \n     Congress is economically dangerous and invites the rapid \n     acceleration of a debt crisis.\n       It is a dramatic statement to finance markets that the \n     federal government does not understand that it must get its \n     fiscal house in order. . . .\n       The time to worry about the deficit is not next year, but \n     now. There is no time to waste.\n\n  Again, Mr. Holtz-Eakin is the former Director of the Congressional \nBudget Office and a fellow at the Manhattan Institute. This is adapted \nfrom testimony he gave to the Senate Committee on the Budget on \nNovember 10.\n  Since that time I have been talking about how we have maxed out our \ncredit cards, but this is something known across the Nation.\n  I have to share something. I mentioned I get things from all the \npapers in Wyoming. This comes from the Lovell Chronicle. That is a \nplace that is probably about 120 miles from Yellowstone Park. That is \nalways how I describe our State, in terms of Yellowstone Park, because \na lot of people know where that is.\n  Her name is Diane Badget and she writes a column regularly.\n\n       My dad used to play this silly game with us. We'd hear \n     ``THUMP, THUMP'' coming from the kitchen. One of us would \n     ask, ``Dad, what are you doing?'' He'd reply, ``Beating my \n     head against the wall.'' At that point another of us would \n     dutifully respond, ``Why?'' Then we'd wait a second for the \n     expected reply: ``Cause it feels so good when I quit!''\n       Has the bickering in Washington sickened you to the point \n     where you almost don't care what they do as long as they shut \n     up? Be careful! That's what some are hoping for. They are \n     disdainful of our feeble attempts to get them to listen to \n     us. They hope that if we beat our heads against the wall long \n     enough we'll realize how much better we'd feel if we'd just \n     quit.\n\n  She goes on to talk a little about Copenhagen.\n\n       The plans for building safe, clean nuclear power plants to \n     provide electricity evaporated when the promise of a secure \n     place to store spent nuclear fuel suddenly ended. Yet this \n     same administration has decried coal fired plants as \n     ``ecological disasters'' and large-scale wind and solar \n     energy as too expensive to build yet. Nothing has been done \n     to utilize the vast reserves of resources in Alaska.\n       Okay, if we can't use coal plants, can't afford wind or \n     sun, Alaska doesn't exist, and nuclear options just got \n     flushed, what should we do? Oh, I know! Let's gather up half \n     of the over-zealous geniuses who supported Obama's decision \n     and put them on giant hamster wheels hooked to generators! \n     Then we'll take the other half and utilize their hot air to \n     turn turbines! It makes as much sense as anything in the Cap \n     and Trade bill.\n       My grandkids can't pray in school, but other kids are \n     provided with prayer mats. No wonder so many terrorists are \n     found right here in the very country they have sworn to \n     destroy. How many more radicals are walking among us, \n     undetected?\n\n  She talks about:\n\n       The decision to try the 9/11 conspirators in our court \n     system is a travesty. These murderers have already pleaded \n     guilty in a military tribunal. They are not entitled by our \n     Constitution to a trial. U.S. citizens are entitled to a \n     trial before a jury of their peers.\n\n  But she does move on to healthcare as well.\n\n       Are you confused yet? Apparently Congress is. The health \n     care plan that the Senate voted to send to the floor for \n     debate is a perfect example. One side says that it will be \n     deficit neutral, will ensure competition, will not affect \n     Medicare and won't result in more taxes. The other side says \n     it will cost too much, eliminate competition, slash Medicare \n     and tax us out of our underwear.\n       Barbara Boxer (D. Ca) touted Medicare as a great example of \n     how seniors are able to chose a ``public option''. Excuse me? \n     When we turn 65 we are required to sign up for Medicare. How \n     is that optional? I think at this point both sides of the \n     aisle are trying to sell us snake oil, and somewhere in the \n     middle is the truth.\n       Are you worried yet? Are your children and grandchildren \n     going to enjoy the same freedoms and opportunities that we \n     enjoyed? The future of my grandchildren should have been \n     better than the life I had, and my life has been pretty \n     doggone good. Instead, future generations are going to be \n     paying, financially and personally, for the mistakes made \n     right now by a president who presumes too much power and a \n     system of checks and balances that no longer works.\n\n  We have been talking about having a bipartisan bill here. Maybe that \nwould end the contradiction and furor that we are talking about here. I \nthink a lot of people must have missed the speech Olympia Snowe made \nabout durable social reform always being bipartisan. I want to share \nsome comments on that. I know her speech wasn't noticed by the press \ncorps.\n\n       With Majority Leader Harry Reid's announcement this week of \n     a double-secret bargain that Democrats hope will squeeze \n     ObamaCare through the Senate after nine whole days of debate \n     so far in the world's greatest deliberative body--the Maine \n     Republican's words seem more pertinent than ever.\n       Mrs. Snowe began by noting that this year's health debate \n     is ``one of the most complex and intricate undertakings the \n     Congress has ever confronted,'' and that she, too, has \n     devoted much of her three-decade political career to \n     promoting cheaper, better quality insurance. ``But it must be \n     done in an effective, common-sense and bipartisan way,'' she \n     cautioned.\n       Far from ``systematically working through the concerns, the \n     issues and the alternatives,'' Mrs. Snowe added, Democrats \n     have instead favored ``artificially generated haste'' and \n     settled on a strategy ``to ram it, to jam it'' through \n     Congress. The Senator detailed her good-faith participation \n     in the ``group of six'' on the Senate Finance Committee, \n     which met some 31 times over the spring and summer and \n     reflected ``the kind of extensive, meticulous process that an \n     issue of this magnitude requires.''\n       The negotiators tried to build a consensus, blending the \n     best ideas from both parties. Or at least they did before the \n     group of six, and Mrs. Snowe in particular, became a liberal \n     political target for supposed obstructionism. Chairman Max \n     Baucus then pushed their unfinished work to the Senate floor, \n     where Mr. Reid is now rushing to pass a bill in a race \n     against its rising unpopularity and President Obama's falling \n     approval ratings.\n       Mr. Reid made his case with his usual intellectual nuance \n     this week: ``Instead of joining us on the right side of \n     history, all the Republicans can come up with is, `Slow down, \n     stop everything, let's start over.' If you think you've heard \n     these same excuses before, you're right. When this country \n     belatedly recognized the wrongs of slavery, there were those \n     who dug in their heels and said, 'Slow down, it's too early, \n     things aren't bad enough.' ''\n       Then, after equating opposition to Medicare cuts and tax \n     increases with support for human bondage that it took a \n     bloody civil war to end, Mr. Reid went on to draw analogies \n     to women's suffrage, Social Security, civil rights and \n     Medicare.\n       Mr. Reid would have done better listening to Mrs. Snowe \n     about the ``history'' of major social legislation, which she \n     also discussed in her November speech. Her main and telling \n     point was that durable social reform in America has always \n     been bipartisan, and not merely with one or two opposition \n     party votes.\n       While Social Security passed when Democrats controlled both \n     Congress and the White House, she said, 64 percent of Senate \n     Republicans and 79 percent of the House GOP supported it. \n     Civil rights passed with 82 percent of Republicans in the \n     Senate and 80 percent in the House, while 41 percent and 51 \n     percent, respectively, voted for Medicare. Mrs. Snowe could \n     have added the 1996 welfare reform that President Clinton \n     signed with the support of nearly all Republicans in \n     Congress, 98 Democratic Representatives and 25 Democratic \n     Senators.\n       ``Policies that will affect more than 300 million people \n     simply should not be decided by partisan, one-vote-margin \n     strategies,'' Senator Snowe explained, and Congress should \n     not be ``railroading solutions along partisan lines.''\n\n  On the debate that we have had, one of the points of contention, of \ncourse, has been Medicare. They talked on that side of the aisle about \nhow good Medicare is. We talked on this side of the aisle about how \nMedicare is being harmed. I think what we are really giving people the \nimpression of it is when we pass the bill, all of it will be free. That \nwill not happen. But there was some contention that private insurance \nwas less fair to people, Medicare was always fair. So I dug up some \ninformation on it. Investors Business Daily has done a little bit of \nresearch in that area. They found that:\n\n       Throughout the health care debate insurance companies have \n     been cast as greedy villains that gleefully deny medical \n     claims. But\n\n[[Page S13122]]\n\n     when it comes to rejecting claims, they can't hold a candle \n     to government.\n\n  They found the most claims are the ones denied by Medicare, not the \nprivate sector.\n  What has happened in the last couple of days, Medicare has been so \npopular that the leader has said he is going to include, now, a piece \nthat will bring the age group to 55. We have been talking about how, \nunder the present circumstances, with the money that is being stolen \nfrom Medicare, that it is going to go broke. The majority leader--and \nevidently it is just the majority leader because when we asked to see a \ncopy of it yesterday in a little colloquy we had with the Senator from \nIllinois, Senator Durbin, he said he had not seen it. So I think--I \nknow they had been briefed on it probably in a general way the night \nbefore. But it was explained to us that if anybody knew what was \nactually in that, that then the CBO score that comes out of that, how \nmuch it will cost, would have to be shared with everybody.\n  I thought we were in the new era of transparency. That doesn't sound \nvery transparent to me. Even Democrats didn't get to see it because, if \nthey did, then all of us could see how much it is going to cost as soon \nas the Congressional Budget Office has declared that.\n  That bothers me. I think it kind of bothers America. What we are \nworried about is it is going to come to the floor all of a sudden and \nwe are going to have to make decisions on it. Evidently it is being \ntalked about a little bit on the other end of the building, because I \nsaw that Speaker Pelosi stopped short of endorsing the full Senate \ncompromise, saying she needed to see ``something in writing.'' But she \nsaid, ``There is certainly a great deal of appeal'' in expanding \nMedicare. But the Washington Post did a little editorial. This would \nhave been on December 10. They called it ``Medicare Sausage? The \nemerging buy-in proposal could have costly unintended consequences.''\n  Incidentally our side has only seen this based on what the media has \nheard, and I don't know what kind of briefings the media has had on \nwhat this particular proposal has.\n  The Washington Post says: ``The emerging buy-in proposal could have \ncostly unintended consequences,'' and begins by saying:\n\n       The only thing more unsettling than watching legislative \n     sausage being made is watching it being made on the fly. The \n     11th-hour compromise on health care reform and the public \n     option supposedly includes an expansion of Medicare to let \n     people ages 55 to 64 buy into the program. This is an idea \n     dating to at least the Clinton administration, and Senate \n     Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus originally proposed \n     allowing the buy-in as a temporary measure before the new \n     insurance exchanges get underway. However, the last minute \n     introduction of this idea within the broader context of \n     health reform raises numerous questions--not the least of \n     which is whether this proposal is a far more dramatic step \n     toward a single-payer system than the lawmakers on either \n     side realize.\n       The details of how the buy-in would work are still sketchy \n     and still being fleshed out, but the basic notion is \n     uninsured individuals 55 to 64 who would be eligible to \n     participate in the newly created insurance exchanges could \n     choose instead the emergency coverage through Medicare. In \n     theory, this would not add to Medicare costs because the \n     coverage would have to be paid for--either out of pocket or \n     with the subsidies that would be provided to those at lower \n     income levels to purchase insurance on the exchanges. The \n     notion is that, because Medicare pays lower rates to health-\n     care providers than do private insurers, the coverage would \n     tend to cost less than a private plan. The complication is \n     understanding what effect the buy-in option would have on the \n     new insurance exchanges and, more important, on the larger \n     health-care system.\n       Currently, Medicare benefits are less generous in \n     significant ways than the plans to be offered on the \n     exchanges. For instance, there is no cap on out-of-pocket \n     expenses.\n\n  Wasn't one of the promises that we were going to be sure that \ncatastrophic was covered for everybody? One of the things I discovered \nearly on in this process is that catastrophic is not covered in \nMedicare, not in the regular plan. You have to get the Medicare \nAdvantage to get catastrophic or the more expensive Medigap policy. Of \ncourse, we are talking about taking a whole bunch of money out of the \nMedicare Advantage, which the companies say will either reduce benefits \nor eliminate it altogether.\n  I think this book was delivered to every office. I got one in my \noffice. It is called ``Voodoo Anyone?'' It is ``How to understand \neconomics without really trying.'' I do hope every Senator finds their \ncopy of this book and takes a look at it because it talks about prices, \nhow prices are set, what affects prices, what happens when you fix \nprices. Then it talks about health care and energy and education and \ncrime and social and agriculture and labor and monopolies, and \nfinancial markets and government action.\n  I have never found a book that put it quite as succinctly or quite as \nunderstandably as this book does. We need to be paying some attention \nto the fixing prices part of it, for sure. He gives a nice example on \nthis.\n\n       You're in a college town, and you realize that there is no \n     good place to buy a decent bicycle. So you get some money \n     together (loans, the parents, investors, whatever) and you \n     open up Deals on Wheels. But business at first is slow. So \n     you figure you'll bring in customers for a sale. You look \n     at your books and you make some tough decisions. You paid \n     $100 for a bike from the manufacturer, and you sell it for \n     $110. But without customers, you realize you need to do \n     something.\n       So you decide to sell the bicycles for $80 as a way to draw \n     customers to Deals on Wheels. You know that you can't \n     continue to sell your bikes at a loss, so you say it's a one-\n     day sale only. And sure enough, the word gets out, and you've \n     got more customers than you can handle. They can't fit in the \n     store and spill out on the street.\n       Little did you know that a lawmaker passed by, saw the \n     crowd and realized something good was going on. The \n     politician goes back to Washington, D.C., and convinces his \n     colleagues that an $80 bicycle is a great thing. ``Bicycles \n     have so many benefits,'' intones the lawmaker. ``They can \n     help you get healthy. And the more people who ride bikes, the \n     less pollution there is. And, of course, more people riding \n     bicycles will help the United States become less dependent on \n     foreign oil.\n       To thunderous applause, the politician sits down and \n     watches his bill that will cap the price of bicycles at $80 \n     pass in a near unanimous vote. (The politician and all his \n     colleagues have calculated a lot of votes will come their way \n     in the next election as a result of this bill).\n       But for you, the bicycle dealer, the one-day sale has \n     become a permanent condition. You can't find bicycles for \n     less than $90, so you're going to be selling all bicycles at \n     a loss.\n       Do you stay in business? You instead sell off the rest of \n     your inventory and explore other employment opportunities.\n\n  I read that to lead up to what he has on Medicare. He says:\n\n       Remember the bicycle example? A price control on bicycles \n     below the cost of production signaled to consumers to buy \n     cheap bikes. But it also told producers that they couldn't \n     make any money. When you have high demand and low supply, you \n     get a shortage. And that's where the Medicare program stands \n     today--waiting lists, fewer doctors who see Medicare patients \n     and shorter hospital stays are all evidence of a shortage in \n     the medical care for senior citizens.\n\n  There are several more pages on Medicare I won't cover. I encourage \nmy colleagues to read it. It is a very small book, a very short book, \nbut it makes a lot of excellent points.\n  Of course, the day before yesterday we got this report from the \nActuary of CMS, which is part of Health and Human Services, which is a \npart of the administration. He said that Medicare would not be \nsustainable under the Reid bill.\n  Is there a way to fix Medicare? I think so. We have promoted over \nhere several times that instead of taking these cuts to Medicare and \nexpanding them into brandnew entitlements--an entitlement is something \nthat goes on forever without congressional approval--we ought to lop \noff the Medicare piece and make sure we get it right.\n  Yes, there are things that have been noted that would save money. But \nthat money that is saved ought to go right back into Medicare so that \nthose seniors who are so nervous across the country would understand we \nweren't cutting their programs.\n  They say: No, we are not cutting the program. We haven't cut a single \nguaranteed benefit.\n  We also haven't fooled a single senior out there. The only ones we \nhave fooled have been the AARP. Of course, the AARP is going to make \nmore money off of Medigap than they ever made off Medicare Advantage. \nThey have to look at where the bread is buttered here.\n  Senator Dodd said that he would like to know exactly which pages had \ncuts to Medicare on it. I have a sheet here that shows the exact page \nnumbers in the bill and the CBO report.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following be printed in the Record \nin this regard.\n\n[[Page S13123]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Medicare Cuts in the Reid Bill\n\n\n                       hospitals serving seniors\n\n       $200 billion in cuts, page 663, through Medicare quality \n     reporting programs; $1.5 billion in cuts, p. 687, Medicare \n     payment adjustments for hospital-acquired conditions; $7.1 \n     billion in cuts, p. 775, hospital readmissions reduction \n     program; $20.6 billion, p. 842, Disproportionate Share \n     Hospital (DSH) payment cuts; $105.5 billion, p. 974, Medicare \n     market basket updates.\n\n\n                             nursing homes\n\n       $15 billion, p. 977, Medicare market basket updates.\n\n\n                                hospices\n\n       Nearly $8 billion, p. 987, Medicare market basket updates.\n\n\n                              home health\n\n       More than $40 billion, p. 983, Medicare market basket \n     updates.\n\n\n                           medicare advantage\n\n        $118 billion, p. 869, Medicare Advantage payment \n     adjustments; $1.9 billion, p. 908, application of coding \n     intensity adjustment.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Of course, the Democrats do recognize that there is a \nproblem with Medicare going broke; otherwise, they wouldn't have to put \na special commission in there. There is a special MedPAC commission. \nThere already is a MedPAC, so there is going to be a MedPAC on steroids \nin there. That means it will have to report to us and we will have to \ntake action on it or else they will be able to take action anyway. If \nwe are not breaking the system, what do we need that for?\n  Actually, if we use the money that comes from Medicare only for \nMedicare, the commission would have a much easier job.\n  For one thing, we would be able to do the doc fix. The other side \nkeeps referring to how the deficit will be reduced by this bill--$157 \nbillion in the first 10 years and another number for the second 10 \nyears. But that is only if you believe we will not fix any of these \nthings that are major problems, such as the doctors.\n  We are not paying the doctors enough. Right now, 25 percent of the \ndoctors won't take a new Medicare patient. The number varies between 45 \npercent and 50 percent who won't take a new Medicaid patient because we \npay too little. We did the price fixing such as I described in that \nbook. If you do price fixing, you can't afford to pay the doctors \nenough. The doctors know that. They are not going to work for nothing \nor less than nothing. Consequently, if you can't see a doctor, you \ndon't have any kind of insurance. That is a basic guarantee of \ninsurance, that you will get to see some medical person and they will \ndo some kind of treatment if you need it. We are also hoping the doctor \ngets to make the decision on the treatment you have.\n  There is also a little medical commission in the bill, preventative \ncommission, a task force that put out a report on mammograms and upset \nthe whole country, with some justification. As those things are adopted \nfor everybody, it takes away the right for the doctor to say: My \npatient is a little bit different. We are all a little bit different. \nSome of these commissions and task forces need to be looked at. Is \nAmerica listening?\n  Last week, there was a vote in Kentucky. There were two people \nrunning for the legislature there. It was a highly Democratic district. \nThe Republican talked about health care. That was his whole pitch. He \ndid a warning on health care. He won in a heavily Democratic district.\n  This is being reported repeatedly across the country. I have some \nthings where I could go into some of the poll numbers that are out \nthere now. I know individuals are looking at those poll numbers and \nrealizing the American people have figured it out. They really have. \nCongress hasn't figured it out, but the American people have figured it \nout.\n  I have to talk about one specific part of the bill. Senator Harkin \nand I worked together on this bipartisan amendment. It wasn't one we \ninvented; it is one we found from Safeway. Safeway has some programs \nthey put into effect for their employees on a voluntary basis that cut \nthe cost of health care for Safeways while increasing the benefits for \nthe employees. That is not happening anywhere in America. You have seen \nthe charts on how fast health care is expanding. Safeway was able to \nget about an 8-percent reduction the first year and has been able to \nhold it level since then.\n  Senator Harkin and I asked: How did you do that? One of the ways was \nto give people incentives to do the right thing. Again, it was on a \nvoluntary basis. We got the flexibility for these incentives put into \nthe HELP Committee markup. It was approved. It was put in. It was \nbipartisan. It should have been approved and put in. It was also a good \nidea. There was this clinic that we call Safeway that had been the lab \nfor it, that had tried it and it worked. It was to raise the limit \npeople could have for doing these incentives from 20 percent to 30 \npercent and even up to 50 percent, if it worked. Without my approval, \nthat was jerked out of the bill before it was actually printed.\n  I hope people take a look at the November 29 issue of Roll Call, \nwhere there is an editorial by Morton Kondracke, who explains how this \nall works and what a difference it could make and how terrible it is \nthat it got pulled out.\n  It is interesting that some of the groups that were against it were \nones such as the American Cancer Society, the American Heart \nAssociation, and the American Diabetes Association. They did it on the \nbasis that it discriminates against people who want to stay fat and \nwon't quit smoking. Incidentally, a smoker costs $1,200 a year to \nsomebody else because it isn't included in their insurance that way.\n  Ways of improving the system--I will talk about that at another time. \nI can see everybody is fascinated by all of this. We will talk about \nlawsuits and health savings accounts.\n  The other side would like to eliminate health savings accounts. \nActually, what they want to do is tell you what insurance you have to \nhave. They want the government to tell you what the minimum acceptable \ninsurance is. That is not bad enough. If you don't buy at least the \nminimum acceptable insurance, then you get fined. Under the House bill, \nyou can go to jail. That is only if you don't pay your taxes as a \nresult of the fine. That is done through the IRS. It is a huge \nexpansion of the IRS at the same time.\n  Health savings accounts have been working in this country. In fact, \nthey work for our employees in the Senate. The health savings account \nis where you buy a high-deductible policy and you have the right to put \nmoney tax free into a savings account that can only be used for health, \nwith the theory that if you do have something happen to you, you can \ndraw out of your health savings account to pay this deductible.\n  If you are young and healthy, it is a tremendous thing. One of the \nyoung ladies in my office said: Let's see, the amount I have to pay for \nregular insurance and the amount I have to pay for a health savings \naccount are considerably different. If I took that difference and put \nthat into a health savings account, it would still belong to me. It \nwould roll over from year to year, and I would have that available tax \nfree whenever I need it. She did that. Within 3 years, she had the \nentire deductible covered in there. She was smart enough to continue to \nput money in there, tax free money that will take care of her health \ncare expenditures. Do you think she will be upset if we eliminate \nhealth savings accounts? Yes, I think so.\n  There is another thing Senate employees use; that is, flexible \nspending accounts. Even if you pick the ones without the high \ndeductible, you have the right to figure out how much your medical \nexpenses are going to be the next year and put those into a special \naccount, a flexible savings account. Over the next year, you can use \nthat money from the flexible savings account, which comes out of your \npaycheck, tax free for the medical needs you have.\n  People who know they are going to have medical needs find this to be \nuseful. They find that they can tell--you have to do it by Monday--how \nmuch you think you are going to spend the next year. The downside of it \nis, if you don't spend it all, the extra goes back to the Federal \nGovernment. Even though it came out of your paycheck, it goes back to \nthe Federal Government.\n  A lot of people would say this would be a good deal if we could roll \nthat over. There are a lot of eyeglasses and dentists appointments that \nare done in December for people to be able to use\n\n[[Page S13124]]\n\nthat flexible spending account. If it rolled over, they could continue \nto use it for what was really necessary.\n  That is being limited in the bill. That will be a detriment to people \nwho have some catastrophic things happening to them. Cancer would be \none of those things. If they know how much they are going to have to \nspend on MRIs and CAT scans and other kinds of tests over the coming \nyear, in December they put that amount of money in there, and then they \ncan have this little bit of a tax advantage for taking care of their \nhealth care costs.\n  That is much like big business provides in the much better plans than \nwe have in the Senate.\n  To conclude, I would like to have a document printed in the Record by \nunanimous consent, which is titled: ``A Specific Plan of Action: \nLowering Health Care Costs.''\n  I am inserting this on behalf of Senator McCain because people keep \nclaiming that when he ran for President, he said things differently \nthan what is being said now, and with this as part of the Record, maybe \nwe can get them to quit saying that. Because he did talk about waste, \nfraud, and abuse in Medicare and the need to contain it and physician \npayments and coordinated care and preventable medical errors. So I ask \nunanimous consent that document be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         A Specific Plan of Action: Lowering Health Care Costs\n\n       John McCain Proposes a Number of Initiatives That Can Lower \n     Health Care Costs. If we act today, we can lower health care \n     costs for families through common-sense initiatives. Within a \n     decade, health spending will comprise twenty percent of our \n     economy. This is taking an increasing toll on America's \n     families and small businesses. Even Senators Clinton and \n     Obama recognize the pressure skyrocketing health costs place \n     on small business when they exempt small businesses from \n     their employer mandate plans.\n       Cheaper Drugs: Lowering Drug Prices. John McCain will look \n     to bring greater competition to our drug markets through safe \n     re-importation of drugs and faster introduction of generic \n     drugs.\n       Chronic Disease: Providing Quality, Cheaper Care for \n     Chronic Disease. Chronic conditions account for three-\n     quarters of the Nation's annual health care bill. By \n     emphasizing prevention, early intervention, healthy habits, \n     new treatment models, new public health infrastructure and \n     the use of information technology, we can reduce health care \n     costs. We should dedicate more federal research to caring and \n     curing chronic disease.\n       Coordinated Care: Promoting Coordinated Care. Coordinated \n     care--with providers collaborating to produce the best health \n     care--offers better outcomes at lower cost. We should pay a \n     single bill for high-quality disease care which will make \n     every single provider accountable and responsive to the \n     patients' needs.\n       Greater Access and Convenience: Expanding Access to Health \n     Care. Families place a high value on quickly getting simple \n     care. Government should promote greater access through walk-\n     in clinics in retail outlets.\n       Information Technology: Greater Use of Information \n     Technology To Reduce Costs. We should promote the rapid \n     deployment of 21st century information sytems and technology \n     that allows doctors to practice across state lines.\n       Medicaid and Medicare: Reforming the Payment System To Cut \n     Costs. We must reform the payment systems in Medicaid and \n     Medicare to compensate providers for diagnosis, prevention \n     and care coordination. Medicaid and Medicare should not pay \n     for preventable medical errors or mismanagement. Medicare \n     should lead the way in health care reforms that improve \n     quality and lower costs. We need to change the way providers \n     are paid to move away from fragmented care and focus their \n     attention on prevention and coordinated care, especially for \n     those with chronic conditions. This is the most important \n     step in effectively caring for an aging population. We must \n     work in a bipartisan manner to reform the physical payment \n     system, focus efforts on eliminating fraud and move Medicare \n     into a new generation of coordinated, quality care.\n       Smoking. Promoting the Availability of Smoking Cessation \n     Programs. Most smokers would love to quit but find it hard to \n     do so. Working with business and insurance companies to \n     promote availability, we can improve lives and reduce chronic \n     disease through smoking cessation programs.\n       State Flexibility: Encouraging States To Lower Costs. \n     States should have the flexibility to experiment with \n     alternative forms of access, coordinated payments per episode \n     covered under Medicaid, use of private insurance in Medicaid, \n     alternative insurance policies and different licensing \n     schemes for providers.\n       Tort Reform: Passing Medical Liability Reform. We must pass \n     medical liability reform that eliminates lawsuits directed at \n     doctors who follow clinical guidelines and adhere to safety \n     protocols. Every patient should have access to legal remedies \n     in cases of bad medical practice but that should not be an \n     invitation to endless, frivolous lawsuits.\n       Transparency: Bringing Transparency to Health Care Costs. \n     We must make public more information on treatment options and \n     doctor records, and require transparency regarding medical \n     outcomes, quality of care, costs and prices. We must also \n     facilitate the development of national standards for \n     measuring and recording treatments and outcomes.\n\n\n                Confronting the long-term care challenge\n\n       John McCain Will Develop a Strategy for Meeting the \n     Challenge of a Population Needing Greater Long-Term Care. \n     There have been a variety of state-based experiments such as \n     Cash and Counseling or the Program of All-Inclusive Care for \n     the Elderly (PACE) that are pioneering approaches for \n     delivering care to people in a home setting. Seniors are \n     given a monthly stipend which they can use to: hire workers \n     and purchase care-related services and goods. They can get \n     help managing their care by designating representatives, such \n     as relatives or friends, to help make decisions. It also \n     offers counseling and bookkeeping services to assist \n     consumers in handling their programmatic responsibilities.\n\n\n     setting the record straight: covering those with pre-existing \n                               conditions\n\n       Myth: Some claim that under John McCain's plan, those with \n     pre-existing conditions would be denied insurance.\n       Fact: John McCain supported the Health Insurance \n     Portability and Accountability Act in 1996 that took the \n     important step of providing some protection against exclusion \n     of pre-existing conditions.\n       Fact: Nothing in John McCain's plan changes the fact that \n     if you are employed and insured you will build protection \n     against the cost of any pre-existing condition.\n       Fact: As President, John McCain would work with governors \n     to find the solutions necessary to ensure those with pre-\n     existing conditions are able to easily access care.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I hope, on future appropriations--I hope when the President \ngets this bill, if it makes it through the process--and it appears as \nthough it should easily do that--he will veto the bill and send it back \nbecause the 5,224 earmarks, amounting to $3.8 billion--instead of \ntalking about 5 percent of what the Cabinet members expend, it might be \nmore valuable to talk about $3.8 billion.\n  There are other things that need to be done. We do need to start \nbeing fiscally responsible. Of course, one of the questions is: Why \nhaven't we been, in the past, fiscally responsible? That answer to that \nis, we did not have our credit cards maxed out before. We were able to \nprint the money and nobody noticed. But now when we print the money, \npeople do notice. So we have both the end of the year appropriations--\nthe end of the year, incidentally, was the last day of September, and \nwe are doing them now--and we have this health care crisis to solve. \nThere is not anybody who does not want to come up with a solution to \nit. But we want to do it step by step and get the confidence of the \nAmerican people.\n  The American people do not have confidence in what we are doing. I \nhave several documents that would show what percentage of the people do \nnot agree we are doing the right thing. That ought to get the attention \nin virtually every State because it is not just as a national whole, it \nis in every State. People have figured out what we are trying to do, \nand they do not think we are doing it right. We better get it right or \npeople will be even more upset.\n  I yield floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/12/senate-section/article/S13124-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 1:30 P.M.
