Madam President, I will vote to ratify the New START \ntreaty between the United States and Russia because it leaves our \ncountry with enough nuclear warheads to blow any attacker to kingdom \ncome and because the President has committed to an $85 billion 10-year \nplan to make sure those weapons work. I will vote for the treaty \nbecause it allows for inspection of Russian warheads and because our \nmilitary leaders say it does nothing to interfere with the development \nof a missile defense system.\n  I will vote for the treaty because the last six Republican \nSecretaries of State support its ratification. In short, I am convinced \nthat Americans are safer and more secure with the New START treaty than \nwithout it. Last week, I joined Senators Inouye, Cochran, and Feinstein \nin a letter to the President stating that we will vote to ratify the \ntreaty and to appropriate funds to modernize our outdated nuclear \nweapons facilities and that he, the President, requests those funds in \nhis budget.\n  Last night, I received a response to the President saying he would do \nso. I ask unanimous consent to have printed both letters in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 16, 2010.\n     The White House,\n     1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to express our support \n     for ratification of the New START Treaty and full funding for \n     the modernization of our nuclear weapons arsenal, as outlined \n     by your updated report that was mandated by Section 1251 of \n     the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010.\n       We also ask that, in your future budget requests to \n     Congress, you include the funding identified in that report \n     on nuclear weapons modernization. Should you choose to limit \n     non-defense discretionary spending in any future budget \n     requests to Congress, funding for nuclear modernization in \n     the National Nuclear Security Agency's proposed budgets \n     should be considered defense spending, as it is critical to \n     national security and, therefore, not subject to such \n     limitations. Further, we ask that an updated 1251 report be \n     submitted with your budget request to Congress each year.\n       We look forward to working with you on the ratification of \n     the New START Treaty and modernization of the National \n     Nuclear Security Agency's nuclear weapons facilities. This \n     represents a long-term commitment by each of us, as \n     modernization of our nuclear arsenal will require a sustained \n     effort.\n           Sincerely,\n     Daniel Inouye.\n     Dianne Feinstein.\n     Thad Cochran.\n     Lamar Alexander.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                 Washington DC, December 20, 2010.\n     Hon. Lamar Alexander,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Alexander: Thank you for your letter regarding \n     funding for the modernization of the nuclear weapons complex \n     and for your expression of support for ratification of the \n     New START Treaty.\n       As you know, in the Fiscal Year 2011 budget, I requested a \n     nearly 10 percent increase in the budget for weapons \n     activities at the National Nuclear Security Administration \n     (NNSA). In May, in the report required by Section 1251 of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, I \n     laid out a 10 year, $80 billion spending plan for NNSA. The \n     Administration submitted an update to that report last month, \n     and we now project over $85 billion in spending over the next \n     decade.\n       I recognize that nuclear modernization requires investment \n     for the long-term, in addition to this one-year budget \n     increase. That is my commitment to the Congress--that my \n     Administration will pursue these programs and capabilities \n     for as long as I am President.\n       In future years, we will provide annual updates to the 1251 \n     report. If a decision is made to limit non-defense \n     discretionary spending in any future budget requests, funding \n     for nuclear modernization in the NNSA weapons activities \n     account will be considered on the same basis as defense \n     spending.\n       In closing, I thought it important for you to know that \n     over the last two days, my Administration has worked closely \n     with officials from the Russian Federation to address our \n     concerns regarding North Korea. Because of important \n     cooperation like this, I continue to hope that the Senate \n     will approve the New START Treaty before the 111th Congress \n     ends.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Barack Obama.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, why are these two so necessarily \nlinked--the treaty and the plan for nuclear weapons modernization? The \nanswer is, if we are going to reduce our number of warheads, we want to \nmake sure we are not left with what amounts to a collection of wet \nmatches. Defense Secretary Gates said:\n\n       There is absolutely no way we can maintain a credible \n     deterrent and reduce the number of weapons in our stockpile \n     without either resorting to testing our stockpile or pursuing \n     a modernization program.\n\n  In a November 24 statement, Senators Kyl and Corker said they ``could \nnot support reductions in U.S. nuclear forces unless there is adequate \nattention to modernizing those forces and the infrastructure that \nsupports them.''\n  Senators Kyl and Corker deserve credit for untiring efforts to fund \nproperly nuclear modernization. President Obama deserves credit for \nupdating the nuclear modernization plan in such a significant way.\n  I have reviewed that so-called ``1251 plan'' completed November 17 of \nthis year, which calls for spending $85 billion over the next 10 years. \nI have visited our outdated nuclear weapons facilities. I am convinced \nthe plan's implementation will make giant steps toward modernization of \nthose facilities so that we--and our allies and adversaries--can be \nassured that the weapons will work if needed.\n  The President's statement that he will ask for these funds and the \nsupport of senior members of the Appropriations Committee means that \nthe plan is more likely to become a reality. The President agrees that \nin tight budgets these funds should be considered as defense spending.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a summary of \nthe appropriations recommended by\n\n[[Page S10851]]\n\nthe plan mandated by section 1251 of the 2010 Defense authorization \nbill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n     3.

Madam President, I will offer an amendment at the \nappropriate time to the resolution of ratification to require an annual \nupdate of the 1251 report, which the President's letter says he will \ndo.\n  Under the terms of the treaty, the United States may have 1,550 \ndeployed strategic nuclear weapons, each one up to 30 times more \npowerful than the one used at Hiroshima to end World War II.\n  The United States will also gain valuable data, including through \ninspection operations that should provide a treasure trove of \nintelligence about Russian activities that we would not have without \nthe treaty, and that we have not had since the START treaty expired on \nDecember 9, 2009.\n  Over the weekend, the President sent a letter to the Senate \nreaffirming ``the continued development and deployment of U.S. missile \ndefense systems.'' There is nothing within the treaty itself--I \nemphasize ``nothing in the treaty''--that would hamper the development \nof missile defense or its deployment. Our military and intelligence \nleaders all have said that.\n  Obviously, something could happen down the road involving differences \nover missile defense systems that could require either country--Russia \nor the United States--to withdraw from the treaty. That is any \nsovereign country's right with any treaty. In 2002, President Bush \nwithdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty because of our desire \nto pursue missile defenses to protect us from an attack by a rogue \nstate.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the President's letter on missile defense.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 18, 2010.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: As the Senate considers the New \n     START Treaty, I want to share with you my views on the issue \n     of missile defense, which has been the subject of much debate \n     in the Senate's review of the Treaty.\n       Pursuant to the National Missile Defense Act of 1999 \n     (Public Law 106-38), it has long been the policy of the \n     United States to deploy as soon as is technologically \n     possible an effective National Missile Defense system capable \n     of defending the territory of the United States against \n     limited ballistic missile attack, whether accidental, \n     unauthorized, or deliberate. Thirty ground-based interceptors \n     based at Fort Greely, Alaska, and Vandenberg Air Force Base, \n     California, are now defending the Nation. All United States \n     missile defense programs--including all phases of the \n     European Phased Adaptive Approach to missile defense (EPAA) \n     and programs to defend United States deployed forces, allies, \n     and partners against regional threats--are consistent with \n     this policy.\n       The New START Treaty places no limitations on the \n     development or deployment of our missile defense programs. As \n     the NATO Summit meeting in Lisbon last month underscored, we \n     are proceeding apace with a missile defense system in Europe \n     designed to provide full coverage for NATO members on the \n     continent, as well as deployed U.S. forces, against the \n     growing threat posed by the proliferation of ballistic \n     missiles. The final phase of the system will also augment our \n     current defenses against intercontinental ballistic missiles \n     from Iran targeted against the United States.\n       All NATO allies agreed in Lisbon that the growing threat of \n     missile proliferation, and our Article 5 commitment of \n     collective defense, requires that the Alliance develop a \n     territorial missile defense capability. The Alliance further \n     agreed that the EPAA, which I announced in September 2009, \n     will be a crucial contribution to this capability. Starting \n     in 2011, we will begin deploying the first phase of the EPAA, \n     to protect large parts of southern Europe from short- and \n     medium-range ballistic missile threats. In subsequent phases, \n     we will deploy longer-range and more effective land-based \n     Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) interceptors in Romania and Poland \n     to protect Europe against medium- and intermediate-range \n     ballistic missiles. In the final phase, planned for the end \n     of the decade, further upgrades of the SM-3 interceptor will \n     provide an ascent-phase intercept capability to augment our \n     defense of NATO European territory, as well as that of the \n     United States, against future threats of ICBMs launched from \n     Iran.\n       The Lisbon decisions represent an historic achievement, \n     making clear that all NATO allies believe we need an \n     effective territorial missile defense to defend against the \n     threats we face now and in the future. The EPAA represents \n     the right response. At Lisbon, the Alliance also invited the \n     Russian Federation to cooperate on missile defense, which \n     could lead to adding Russian capabilities to those deployed \n     by NATO to enhance our common security against common \n     threats. The Lisbon Summit thus demonstrated that the \n     Alliance's missile defenses can be strengthened by improving \n     NATO-Russian relations.\n       This comes even as we have made clear that the system we \n     intend to pursue with Russia will not be a joint system, and \n     it will not in any way limit United States' or NATO's missile \n     defense capabilities. Effective cooperation with Russia could \n     enhance the overall effectiveness and efficiency of our \n     combined territorial missile defenses, and at the same time \n     provide Russia with greater security. Irrespective of how \n     cooperation with Russia develops, the Alliance alone bears \n     responsibility for defending NATO's members, consistent with \n     our Treaty obligations for collective defense. The EPAA and \n     NATO's territorial missile defense capability will allow us \n     to do that.\n       In signing the New START Treaty, the Russian Federation \n     issued a statement that expressed its view that the \n     extraordinary events referred to in Article XIV of the Treaty \n     include a ``build-up in the missile defense capabilities of \n     the United States of America such that it would give rise to \n     a threat to the strategic nuclear potential of the Russian \n     Federation.'' Article XIV(3), as you know, gives each Party \n     the right to withdraw from the Treaty if it believes its \n     supreme interests are jeopardized.\n       The United States did not and does not agree with the \n     Russian statement. We believe that the continued development \n     and deployment of U.S. missile defense systems, including \n     qualitative and quantitative improvements to such systems, do \n     not and will not threaten the strategic balance with the \n     Russian Federation, and have provided policy and technical \n     explanations to Russia on why we believe that to be the case. \n     Although the United States cannot circumscribe Russia's \n     sovereign rights under Article XIV(3), we believe that the \n     continued improvement and deployment of U.S. missile defense \n     systems do not constitute a basis for questioning the \n     effectiveness and viability of the New START Treaty, and \n     therefore would not give rise to circumstances justifying \n     Russia's withdrawal from the Treaty.\n       Regardless of Russia's actions in this regard, as long as I \n     am President, and as long\n\n[[Page S10852]]\n\n     as the Congress provides the necessary funding, the United \n     States will continue to develop and deploy effective missile \n     defenses to protect the United States, our deployed forces, \n     and our allies and partners. My Administration plans to \n     deploy all four phases of the EPAA. While advances of \n     technology or future changes in the threat could modify the \n     details or timing of the later phases of the EPAA--one reason \n     this approach is called ``adaptive''--I will take every \n     action available to me to support the deployment of all four \n     phases.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Barack Obama.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, ratifying this treaty would extend \nthe policies of President Nixon, President Reagan, President George \nH.W. Bush, President George W. Bush, as well as Democratic Presidents.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the statements \nof the last six Republican Secretaries of State, all of whom support \nratification of the treaty.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Dec. 2, 2010]\n\n              The Republican Case for Ratifying New START\n\n(By Henry A. Kissinger, George P. Shultz, James A. Baker III, Lawrence \n                  S. Eagleburger, and Colin L. Powell)\n\n       Republican presidents have long led the crucial fight to \n     protect the United States against nuclear dangers. That is \n     why Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. \n     Bush negotiated the SALT I, START I and START II agreements. \n     It is why President George W. Bush negotiated the Moscow \n     Treaty. All four recognized that reducing the number of \n     nuclear arms in an open, verifiable manner would reduce the \n     risk of nuclear catastrophe and increase the stability of \n     America's relationship with the Soviet Union and, later, the \n     Russian Federation. The world is safer today because of the \n     decades-long effort to reduce its supply of nuclear weapons.\n       As a result, we urge the Senate to ratify the New START \n     treaty signed by President Obama and Russian President Dmitry \n     Medvedev. It is a modest and appropriate continuation of the \n     START I treaty that expired almost a year ago. It reduces the \n     number of nuclear weapons that each side deploys while \n     enabling the United States to maintain a strong nuclear \n     deterrent and preserving the flexibility to deploy those \n     forces as we see fit. Along with our obligation to protect \n     the homeland, the United States has responsibilities to \n     allies around the world.\n       The commander of our nuclear forces has testified that the \n     1,550 warheads allowed under this treaty are sufficient for \n     all our missions--and seven former nuclear commanders agree. \n     The defense secretary, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff and the head of the Missile Defense Agency--all \n     originally appointed by a Republican president--argue that \n     New START is essential for our national defense.\n       We do not make a recommendation about the exact timing of a \n     Senate ratification vote. That is a matter for the \n     administration and Senate leaders. The most important thing \n     is to have bipartisan support for the treaty, as previous \n     nuclear arms treaties did.\n       Although each of us had initial questions about New START, \n     administration officials have provided reasonable answers. We \n     believe there are compelling reasons Republicans should \n     support ratification.\n       First, the agreement emphasizes verification, providing a \n     valuable window into Russia's nuclear arsenal. Since the \n     original START expired last December, Russia has not been \n     required to provide notifications about changes in its \n     strategic nuclear arsenal, and the United States has been \n     unable to conduct on-site inspections. Each day, America's \n     understanding of Russia's arsenal has been degraded, and \n     resources have been diverted from national security tasks to \n     try to fill the gaps. Our military planners increasingly lack \n     the best possible insight into Russia's activity with its \n     strategic nuclear arsenal, making it more difficult to carry \n     out their nuclear deterrent mission.\n       Second, New START preserves our ability to deploy effective \n     missile defenses. The testimonies of our military commanders \n     and civilian leaders make clear that the treaty does not \n     limit U.S. missile defense plans. Although the treaty \n     prohibits the conversion of existing launchers for \n     intercontinental and submarine-based ballistic missiles, our \n     military leaders say they do not want to do that because it \n     is more expensive and less effective than building new ones \n     for defense purposes.\n       Finally, the Obama administration has agreed to provide for \n     modernization of the infrastructure essential to maintaining \n     our nuclear arsenal. Funding these efforts has become part of \n     the negotiations in the ratification process. The \n     administration has put forth a 10-year plan to spend $84 \n     billion on the Energy Department's nuclear weapons complex. \n     Much of the credit for getting the administration to add $14 \n     billion to the originally proposed $70 billion for \n     modernization goes to Sen. Jon Kyl, the Arizona Republican \n     who has been vigilant in this effort. Implementing this \n     modernization program in a timely fashion would be important \n     in ensuring that our nuclear arsenal is maintained \n     appropriately over the next decade and beyond.\n       Although the United States needs a strong and reliable \n     nuclear force, the chief nuclear danger today comes not from \n     Russia but from rogue states such as Iran and North Korea and \n     the potential for nuclear material to fall into the hands of \n     terrorists. Given those pressing dangers, some question why \n     an arms control treaty with Russia matters. It matters \n     because it is in both parties' interest that there be \n     transparency and stability in their strategic nuclear \n     relationship. It also matters because Russia's cooperation \n     will be needed if we are to make progress in rolling back the \n     Iranian and North Korean programs. Russian help will be \n     needed to continue our work to secure ``loose nukes'' in \n     Russia and elsewhere. And Russian assistance is needed to \n     improve the situation in Afghanistan, a breeding ground for \n     international terrorism.\n       Obviously, the United States does not sign arms control \n     agreements just to make friends. Any treaty must be \n     considered on its merits. But we have here an agreement that \n     is clearly in our national interest, and we should consider \n     the ramifications of not ratifying it.\n       Whenever New START is brought up for debate, we encourage \n     all senators to focus on national security. There are plenty \n     of opportunities to battle on domestic political issues \n     linked to the future of the American economy. With our \n     country facing the dual threats of unemployment and a growing \n     federal debt bomb, we anticipate significant conflict between \n     Democrats and Republicans. It is, however, in the national \n     interest to ratify New START.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I will vote to ratify this treaty. \nThe vote we are about to have today is about whether to end debate. The \nmajority's decision to jam through other matters during this lameduck \nsession has poisoned the well, driven away Republican votes, and \njeopardized ratification of this important treaty.\n  Nevertheless, this treaty was presented in the Senate on May 13, \nafter 12 hearings in two committees and many briefings. The Foreign \nRelations Committee reported the treaty to the Senate on September 16 \nin a bipartisan vote of 14 to 4. For several months, there have been \nintense negotiations to develop a realistic plan and the funding for \nnuclear modernization. That updated plan was reported on November 17. \nThe Senate voted to proceed to the treaty last Wednesday. I voted no \nbecause I thought there should still be more time allowed for amendment \nand debate.\n  Despite the flawed process, I believe the treaty and the nuclear \nmodernization plan make our country safer and more secure. It will \nallow us to resume inspection and verification of disarmament of \nnuclear weapons in Russia. The head of our missile defense system says \nthe treaty will not hamper our missile development program--and if it \ndoes, we can withdraw from the treaty.\n  All six former Republican Secretaries of State support ratification \nof this treaty. Therefore, I will vote to ratify the New START treaty \nand during the next several years vote to fund the nuclear \nmodernization plan.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "21", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/21/senate-section/article/S10852-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The minority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                          Net Neutrality Rules\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, later today the Federal \nCommunications Commission is expected to approve new rules on how \nAmericans access information on the Internet. There are a lot of people \nrightly concerned. The Internet has transformed our society, our \neconomy, and the very way we communicate with others. It has served as \na remarkable platform for innovation at the end of the 20th century and \nnow at the beginning of the 21st century. All of this has been made \npossible because people have been free to create and to innovate, to \npush the limits of invention free from government involvement.\n  Now that could soon change. Today, the Obama administration, which \nhas already nationalized health care, the auto industry, insurance \ncompanies, banks, and student loans, will move forward with what could \nbe a first step in controlling how Americans use the Internet by \nestablishing Federal regulations on its use. This would harm \ninvestment, stifle innovation, and lead to job losses. That is why I, \nalong with several of my colleagues, have urged the FCC Chairman to \nabandon this flawed approach. The Internet is an invaluable resource. \nIt should be left alone.\n  As Americans become more aware of what is happening here, I suspect \nmany will be as alarmed as I am at the government's intrusion. They \nwill wonder, as many already do, if this is a Trojan horse for further \nmeddling by the government. Fortunately, we will have an opportunity in \nthe new Congress to push back against new rules and regulations.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, today the Senate will consider a 73-day \ncontinuing resolution, which will fund the government through March 4 \nof next year. This is a clean CR that is $1 billion above the spending \nlevel for fiscal year 2010. It meets the most basic needs of the \nFederal Government, and will allow Congress the time necessary to \nreconsider a funding bill next year. Most importantly, this temporary \nfunding measure will avoid a government shutdown, which would be a \nterrible thing for the American people. That is the last thing any \nresponsible Member of this body should wish for.\n  As I have previously stated, it is deeply unfortunate that we were \nunable to take up and pass the omnibus bill. An omnibus, as opposed to \na CR, assumed responsibility for the spending decisions that are the \nmost basic responsibility of Congress. I regret that our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle, many of whom helped to craft the omnibus, \nfailed to support it in the end. It was a far superior alternative to \nthis short-term CR. The omnibus better protected our national security \nand would have brought a responsible conclusion to the fiscal year 2011 \nappropriations process.\n  The CR we have before us allows for a limited number of adjustments \nfor programs that would lose either their funding or their \nauthorization between now and March 4. The CR will also prevent the \nlayoff of thousands of Federal workers and contractors during the \nholiday season.\n  When the 112th Congress convenes in January, I hope the Senate and \nthe House will find a way to move forward in a responsible manner to \nconclude work on the fiscal year 2011 appropriations process. To do so, \nwe will require a good-faith effort from Members of both parties to \nreach reasonable compromises on a range of issues. I hope that despite \nthe current political environment, we can find a way to work together \nto fund critical priorities that will strengthen our economy and \nprotect our Nation's security. That is what the American people expect \nof us, and they deserve no less. But for now, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this 10-week continuing resolution.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

We hope to have agreement that at around 2 \no'clock today, we will vote on a couple of judges. We will vote on the \nmotion to concur on the continuing resolution and vote on cloture on \nthe treaty. We don't have that down in writing yet, but that is the \ngoal, so everyone understands. We will have four to five votes this \nafternoon around 2 o'clock. That would point us toward the final surge \non this most important treaty. I had conversations with Senator Kerry \nand Senator Kyl this morning. I think there is a way clear to complete \nthis sometime tomorrow.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                         Farewell to the Senate\n\n                            Closing Argument\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, this is not a farewell address but, \nrather, a closing argument to a jury of my colleagues and the American \npeople outlining my views on how the Senate and, with it, the Federal \nGovernment arrived at its current condition of partisan gridlock, and \nmy suggestions on where we go from here on that pressing problem and \nthe key issues of national and international importance.\n  To make a final floor statement is a challenge. The Washington Post \nnoted the poor attendance at my colleagues' farewell speeches earlier \nthis month. That is really not surprising since there is hardly anyone \never on the Senate floor. The days of lively debate with many Members \non the floor are long gone. Abuse of the Senate rules has pretty much \nstripped Senators of the right to offer amendments. The modern \nfilibuster requires only a threat and no talking. So the Senate's \nactivity for more than a decade has been the virtual continuous drone \nof a quorum call. But that is not the way it was when Senator Chris \nDodd and I were privileged to enter the world's greatest deliberative \nbody 30 years ago. Senators on both sides of the aisle engaged in \ncollegial debate and found ways to find common ground on the Nation's \npressing problems.\n  When I attended my first Republican moderates luncheon, I met Mark \nHatfield, John Chafee, Ted Stevens, Mac Mathias, Bob Stafford, Bob \nPackwood, Chuck Percy, Bill Cohen, Warren Rudman, Alan Simpson, Jack \nDanforth, John Warner, Nancy Kassebaum, Slade Gorton, and I found my \ncolleague John Heinz there. That is a far cry from later years when the \nmoderates could fit into a telephone booth.\n  On the other side of the aisle, I found many Democratic Senators \nwilling to move to the center to craft legislation--Scoop Jackson, Joe \nBiden, Dan Inouye, Lloyd Bentsen, Fritz Hollings, Pat Leahy, Dale \nBumpers, David Boren, Russell Long, Pat Moynihan, George Mitchell, Sam \nNunn, Gary Hart, Bill Bradley, and others. They were carrying on the \nSenate's glorious tradition.\n  The Senate's deliberate cerebral procedures have served our country \nwell. The Senate stood tall in 1805 in acquitting Supreme Court Justice \nSamuel Chase in impeachment proceedings and thus preserved the \nindependence of the Federal judiciary. The Senate stood tall in 1868 to \nacquit President Andrew Johnson in impeachment proceedings, and that \npreserved the power of the Presidency. Repeatedly in our 223-year \nhistory, the Senate has cooled the passions of the moment to preserve \nthe institutions embodied in our Constitution which have made the \nUnited States the envy of the world.\n  It has been a great privilege to have had a voice for the last 30 \nyears in the great decisions of our day: how we allocate our resources \namong economic development, national defense, education, environmental \nprotection, and NIH funding; the Senate's role in foreign policy as we \nexercise it now on the START treaty; the protection of civil rights, as \nwe demonstrated last Saturday, eliminating don't ask, don't tell; \nbalancing crime control and defendants' rights; and how we have \nmaintained the quality of the Federal judiciary, not only the high-\nprofile 14 Supreme Court nominations I have participated in but the 112 \nPennsylvanians who have been confirmed during my tenure on the Federal \ndistrict courts or the Third Circuit.\n  On the national scene, top issues are the deficit and the national \ndebt. The deficit commission has made a start. When raising the debt \nlimit comes up next year, that will present an occasion to pressure all \nparties to come to terms on future taxes and expenditures, to \nrealistically deal with these issues.\n  The Next Congress should try to stop the Supreme Court from further \neroding the constitutional mandate of separation of powers. The Supreme \nCourt has been eating Congress's lunch by invalidating legislation with \njudicial activism after nominees commit under oath in confirmation \nproceedings to respect congressional factfinding and precedents. That \nis stare decisis. The recent decision in Citizens United is \nillustrative. Ignoring a massive congressional record and reversing \nrecent decisions, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito repudiated \ntheir confirmation testimony given under oath and provided the key \nvotes to permit corporations and unions to secretly pay for political \nadvertising, thus effectively undermining the basic democratic \nprinciple of the power of one person, one vote. Chief Justice Roberts \npromised to just call balls and strikes. Then he moved the bases.\n  Congress's response is necessarily limited in recognition of the \nimportance of judicial independence as the foundation of the rule of \nlaw, but Congress could at least require televising the Court \nproceedings to provide some transparency to inform the public about \nwhat the Court is doing since it has the final word on the cutting \nissues of the day. Brandeis was right when he said that sunlight is the \nbest disinfectant.\n  The Court does follow the election returns, and the Court does \njudicially notice societal values as expressed by public opinion. Polls \nshow that 85 percent of the American people favor televising the Court \nwhen told that a citizen can only attend an oral argument for 3 minutes \nin a chamber holding only 300 people. Great Britain, Canada, and State \nsupreme courts permit television.\n  Congress has the authority to legislate on this subject, just as \nCongress decides other administrative matters such as what cases the \nCourt must hear, time limits for decisions, number of Justices, the day \nthe Court convenes, and the number required for a quorum. While \ntelevision cannot provide a definitive answer, it could be significant \nand may be the most that can be done consistent with life tenure and \njudicial independence.\n  Additionally, I urge Congress to substantially increase funding for \nthe National Institutes of Health. When NIH funding was increased from \n$12 to $30 billion annually and $10 billion added to the stimulus \npackage, significant advances were made on medical research. It is \nscandalous--absolutely scandalous--that a nation with our wealth and \nresearch capabilities has not done more. Forty years ago, the President \nof the United States declared war on cancer. Had that war been pursued \nwith the diligence of other wars, most forms of cancer might have been \nconquered.\n  I also urge colleagues to increase their activity on foreign travel. \nRegrettably, we have earned the title of ugly Americans by not treating \nother nations with proper respect and dignity.\n  My experience on congressional delegations to China, Russia, India, \nNATO, Jerusalem, Damascus, Bagdad, Kabul, and elsewhere provided an \nopportunity for eyeball-to-eyeball discussions with world leaders about \nour values, our expectations, and our willingness to engage in \nconstructive dialog. Since 1984, I have visited Syria almost every \nyear, and my extensive conversations with Hafiz al-Assad and Bashar al-\nAssad have convinced me there is a realistic opportunity for a peace \ntreaty between Israel and Syria, if encouraged by vigorous U.S. \ndiplomacy. Similar meetings I have been privileged to have with Muammar \nQadhafi, Yasser Arafat, Fidel Castro, Saddam Hussein, and Hugo Chavez \nhave persuaded me that candid, respectful dialog with our toughest \nadversaries can do much to improve relations among nations.\n\n[[Page S10855]]\n\n  Now I will shift gears. In my view, a principal reason for the \nhistoric stature of the U.S. Senate has been the ability of any Senator \nto offer virtually any amendment at any time. This Senate Chamber \nprovides the forum for unlimited debate with a potential to acquaint \nthe people of America and the world with innovative proposals on public \npolicy and then have a vote on the issue. Regrettably, that has changed \nin recent years because of abuse of the Senate rules by both parties.\n  The Senate rules allow the majority leader, through the right of his \nfirst recognition, to offer a series of amendments to prevent any other \nSenator from offering an amendment. That had been done infrequently up \nuntil about a decade ago and lately has become a common practice, and, \nagain, by both parties.\n\n  By precluding other Senators from offering amendments, the majority \nleader protects his party colleagues from taking tough votes. Never \nmind that we were sent here and are paid to make tough votes. The \ninevitable and understandable consequence of that practice has been the \nfilibuster. If a Senator cannot offer an amendment, why vote to cut off \ndebate and go to final passage? Senators were willing--and are \nwilling--to accept the will of the majority in rejecting their \namendments but unwilling to accept being railroaded to concluding a \nbill without being provided an opportunity to modify it. That practice \nhas led to an indignant, determined minority to filibuster and to deny \n60 votes necessary to cut off debate. Two years ago on this Senate \nfloor, I called the practice tyrannical.\n  The decade from 1995 to 2005 saw the nominees of President Clinton \nand President Bush stymied by the refusal of the other party to have a \nhearing or floor vote on many judicial and executive nominees. Then, in \n2005, serious consideration was given by the Republican caucus to \nchanging the longstanding Senate rule by invoking the so-called nuclear \nor constitutional option. The plan called for Vice President Cheney to \nrule that 51 votes were sufficient to impose cloture for confirmation \nof a judge or executive nominee. His ruling, then to be challenged by \nDemocrats, would be upheld by the traditional 51 votes to uphold the \nChair's ruling.\n  As I argued on the Senate floor at that time, if Democratic Senators \nhad voted their consciences without regard to party loyalty, most \nfilibusters would have failed. Similarly, I argued that had Republican \nSenators voted their consciences without regard to party loyalty, there \nwould not have been 51 of the 55 Republican Senators to support the \nnuclear option.\n  The majority leader then scheduled the critical vote on May 25, 2005. \nThe outcome of that vote was uncertain, with key Republicans \nundeclared. The showdown was averted the night before by a compromise \nby the so-called Gang of 14. Some nominees were approved, some \nrejected, and a new standard was established to eliminate filibusters \nunless there were extraordinary circumstances, with each Senator to \ndecide if that standard had been met. Regrettably, again, that standard \nhas not been followed as those filibusters have continued up to today. \nAgain, the fault rests with both parties.\n  There is a way out of this procedural gridlock by changing the rule \non the power of the majority leader to exclude other Senators' \namendments. I proposed such a rule change in the 110th and 111th \nCongresses. I would retain the 60-vote requirement for cloture on \nlegislation, with a condition that Senators would have to have a \ntalking filibuster, not merely presenting a notice of intent to \nfilibuster. By allowing Senators to offer amendments and a requirement \nfor debate, not just notice, I think filibusters could be effectively \nmanaged, as they had been in the past, and still retain, where \nnecessary, the opportunity to have adequate debate on controversial \nissues.\n  I would change the rule to cut off debate on judicial and executive \nbranch nominees to 51 votes, as I formally proposed in the 109th \nCongress. Important positions are left open for months, and the Senate \nagenda today is filled with unacted-upon judicial and executive \nnominees, and many of those judicial nominees are in areas where there \nis an emergency backlog. Since Judge Bork and Justice Thomas did not \nprovoke filibusters, I think the Senate can do without them on judges \nand executive officeholders. There is a sufficient safeguard of the \npublic interest by requiring a simple majority on an up-down vote. I \nwould also change the rule requiring 30 hours of postcloture debate and \nthe rule allowing the secret hold, which requires cloture to bring the \nmatter to the floor. Requiring a Senator to disclose his or her hold to \nthe light of day would greatly curtail this abuse.\n  While political gridlock has been facilitated by the Senate rules, I \nam sorry to say partisanship has been increased greatly by other \nfactors. Senators have gone into other States to campaign against \nincumbents of the other party. Senators have even opposed their own \nparty colleagues in primary challenges. That conduct was beyond \ncontemplation in the Senate I joined 30 years ago. Collegiality can \nobviously not be maintained when negotiating with someone \nsimultaneously out to defeat you, especially within your own party.\n  In some quarters, ``compromise'' has become a dirty word. Senators \ninsist on ideological purity as a precondition. Senator Margaret Chase \nSmith of Maine had it right when she said we need to distinguish \nbetween the compromise of principle and the principle of compromise. \nThis great body itself was created by the so-called Great Compromise, \nin which the Framers decreed that States would be represented equally \nin the Senate and proportionate to their populations in the House. As \nSenate Historian Richard Baker noted: ``Without that compromise, there \nwould likely have been no Constitution, no Senate, and no United States \nas we know it today.''\n  Politics is no longer the art of the possible when Senators are \nintransigent in their positions. Polarization of the political parties \nhas followed. President Reagan's ``big tent'' has frequently been \nabandoned by the Republican Party. A single vote out of thousands cast \ncan cost an incumbent his seat. Senator Bob Bennett was rejected by the \nfar right in his Utah primary because of his vote for TARP. It did not \nmatter that Vice President Cheney had pleaded with the Republican \ncaucus to support TARP or President Bush would become a modern Herbert \nHoover. It did not matter that 24 other Republican Senators, besides \nBob Bennett, out of the 49 Republican Senators voted for TARP. Senator \nBennett's 93 percent conservative rating was insufficient.\n  Senator Lisa Murkowski lost her primary in Alaska. Congressman Mike \nCastle was rejected in Delaware's Republican primary in favor of a \ncandidate who thought it necessary to defend herself as not being a \nwitch. Republican Senators contributed to the primary defeats of \nBennett, Murkowski, and Castle. Eating or defeating your own is a form \nof sophisticated cannibalism. Similarly, on the other side of the \naisle, Senator Joe Lieberman, a great Senator, could not win his \nDemocratic primary.\n  The spectacular reelection of Senator Lisa Murkowski on a write-in \nvote in the Alaska general election and the defeat of other Tea Party \ncandidates in the 2010 general elections may show the way to counter \nright-wing extremists. Arguably, Republicans left three seats on the \ntable in 2010--beyond Delaware, Nevada, and perhaps Colorado--because \nof unacceptable general election candidates. By bouncing back and \nwinning, Senator Murkowski demonstrated that a moderate centrist can \nwin by informing and arousing the general electorate. Her victory \nproves that America still wants to be and can be governed by the \ncenter.\n  Repeatedly, senior Republican Senators have recently abandoned long-\nheld positions out of fear of losing their seats over a single vote or \nbecause of party discipline. With 59 votes for cloture on this side of \nthe aisle, not a single Republican would provide the 60th vote for many \nimportant legislative initiatives, such as identifying campaign \ncontributors to stop secret contributions.\n  Notwithstanding the perils, it is my hope more Senators will return \nto independence in voting and crossing party lines evident 30 years \nago. President Kennedy's ``Profiles in Courage'' shows the way. \nSometimes a party does ask\n\n[[Page S10856]]\n\ntoo much. The model for an elected official's independence in a \nrepresentative democracy has never been stated more accurately, in my \nopinion, than it was in 1774 by Edmund Burke, in the British House of \nCommons, when he said: `` . . . his [the elected representative's] \nunbiased opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience . . . \n[including his vote] ought not to be sacrificed to you, to any man or \nany set of men living.''\n  But, above all, we need civility. Steve and Cokie Roberts, \ndistinguished journalists, put it well in a recent column, saying:\n\n       Civility is more than good manners. . . . Civility is a \n     state of mind. It reflects respect for your opponents and for \n     the institutions you serve together. . . . This polarization \n     will make civility in the next Congress more difficult--and \n     more necessary--than ever.\n\n  A closing speech has an inevitable aspect of nostalgia. An \nextraordinary experience for me is coming to an end. But my dominant \nfeeling is pride in the great privilege to be a part of this very \nunique body with colleagues who are such outstanding public servants. I \nhave written and will write elsewhere about my tenure here, so I do not \nsay farewell to my continuing involvement in public policy, which I \nwill pursue in a different venue. Because of the great traditions of \nthis body and because of its historic resilience, I leave with great \noptimism for the future of our country, a great optimism for the \ncontinuing vital role of the Senate in the governance of our democracy.\n  I thank my colleagues for listening.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). Cloture having been \ninvoked, the motion to refer falls.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Retiring Senators\n\n                             Arlen Specter\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I wish to offer some remarks in furtherance \nof what Senator Specter told us about this great institution. I wanted \nto spend a moment talking about his service to the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania.\n  When I came to the Senate in 2007 as a Senator-elect, one of the \nfirst things I did was go to see Senator Specter. He asked me at that \ntime to go to lunch. From the moment I arrived in the Senate, he made \nit very clear to me that not only did the people of Pennsylvania \nexpect, but he expected as well, that we work together.\n  From the beginning of his service in the Senate, way back when he was \nelected in 1980 all the way up to the present moment, he has been a \nSenator who was focused on building bipartisan relationships and, of \ncourse, focusing on Pennsylvania priorities. I am honored to have \nworked with him on so many priorities, whether it was veterans or \nworkers, whether it was dairy farmers or the economy of Pennsylvania or \nwhether it was our soldiers or our children or our families. We have \nworked on so many priorities. He has been a champion for our State and \nhe has shown younger Senators the way to work together in the interests \nof our State and our country.\n  That bipartisanship wasn't just a sentiment; it was bipartisanship \nthat led to results. I wish to point to one example of many I could \nlist: the funding for the National Institutes of Health, that great \nbulwark and generator of discoveries that cures diseases and creates \njobs and hope for people often without hope because of a disease or a \nmalady of one kind or another. That bipartisanship Senator Specter \ndemonstrated every day in the Senate has achieved results for \nPennsylvania, for sure, in terms of jobs and opportunity and hope but \nalso results for the Nation as well.\n  I know we are short on time, but I wanted to make one note about the \nhistory of his service. No Senator in the history of the Commonwealth--\nand we have had 55 or so Senators, depending on how you count those who \nhave been elected and served, but of those 55, no Senator has served \nlonger than Senator Specter. I recall the line--I think it is \nattributed to Abraham Lincoln, but it is a great line about what years \nmean and what service means, and I will apply the analogy to Senate \nservice. The line goes something like this: It is not the years in a \nlife, it is the life in those years. I am paraphrasing that. The same \ncould be said of the life of a Senator. It is not just that he served \n30 years. That alone is a singular, unprecedented achievement. In fact, \nthe Senator he outdistanced in a sense in terms of years of service was \nonly elected by the people twice. Senator Specter was elected by the \npeople of Pennsylvania five times. But it is the life in those Senate \nyears, the work in those Senate years, the contribution to our \nCommonwealth and our country in those Senate years that matters and has \nmeaning. His impact will be felt for generations--not just decades but \nfor generations.\n  Let me close with this. There is a history book of our State that \ncame out in the year 2002, and it has a series of stories and essays \nand chapters on the history of Pennsylvania. It is a fascinating review \nof the State's history. The foreword to that publication was written by \nBrent E. Glass, at the time the executive director of the Pennsylvania \nHistorical and Museum Commission. He wrote this in March of 2002. It is \na long foreword which I won't read, but he said in the early part of \nthis foreword the following:\n\n       One way to understand the meaning of Pennsylvania's past is \n     to examine certain places around the State that are \n     recognized for their significance to the entire Nation.\n\n  Then he lists and describes in detail significant places in \nPennsylvania that have a connection to our history, whether it is the \nLiberty Bell or the battlefield of Gettysburg; whether it is the farms \nin our Amish communities or whether it is some other place of historic \nsignificance. I have no doubt whatsoever that if the same history were \nrecounted about the people who had an impact on our Commonwealth--the \npeople who moved Pennsylvania forward; the people who in addition to \nmoving our State forward had an impact on the Nation--if we make a list \nof Pennsylvanians who made such contributions, whether it would be \nWilliam Penn or Benjamin Franklin--and you can fill in the blanks from \nthere--I have no doubt that list would include Senator Arlen Specter. \nHe is a son of Kansas who made Pennsylvania his home. He is a son of \nKansas who fought every day for the people of Pennsylvania.\n  So it is the work and the achievements and the passion and the \nresults in those years in the Senate that will put him on the very \nshort list of those who contributed so much to our Commonwealth that we \nlove and to our country that we cherish.\n  For all of that and for so many other reasons, as a citizen of \nPennsylvania, a resident of Pennsylvania, a citizen of the United \nStates but as a Senator--I want to express my gratitude to Senator \nArlen Specter for his 30 years of service, but especially for what \nthose 30 years meant to the people, sometimes people without a voice, \nsometimes people without power.\n  Thank you, Senator Specter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleagues in noting the \nfarewell address of Senator Arlen Specter is an inspiring moment in the \nSenate.\n  It has been my great honor to serve with Senator Specter and to be a \nmember of the Senate Judiciary Committee with him as well. I think of \nhis contribution to the Senate at many levels. I certainly appreciate \nwhat he did for the Senate and for the Nation when he chaired the \nJudiciary Committee and served on that committee, particularly when it \ncame to the hearings involving the appointment of new Supreme Court \nJustices. Without fail, Senator Specter at those hearings would always \nhave dazzling insight into the current state of the law and the record \nof the nominee. I couldn't wait for him each time there was a hearing \nto see what his tack would be. It always reflected a thoughtful \nreflection on the historic moment we faced with each nominee. The \nquestions he asked, the positions he took, the statements he made, all \nmade for a better record for the United States as the\n\n[[Page S10857]]\n\nSenate proceeded to vote on those historic nominations.\n  But there is one area he touched on ever so slightly that I believe \nis equal to his mark on the Senate Judiciary Committee. This man, \nSenator Arlen Specter, with the help in some respects and in some \nefforts by Senator Tom Harkin, has done more to advance the cause of \nmedical research in his time than virtually any other Member of the \nCongress. He had a single-minded determination to advance medical \nresearch and to put the investment in the National Institutes of \nHealth. On the House side, Congressman John Porter joined him in that \nearly effort--John Porter of Illinois--but time and again Arlen Specter \nwould have as his last bargaining chip on the table, whenever there was \na negotiation, that we needed to put more money in the National \nInstitutes of Health. I know he was probably inspired to that cause by \nmany things, but certainly by his own life experience where he has \nsuccessfully battled so many medical demons and is here standing before \nus as living proof that with his self-determination and the advancement \nof science, we can overcome even some of the greatest diseases and \nmaladies that come our way.\n  He was, to me, a role model many times as he struggled through cancer \ntherapy and never missed a bell when it came to presiding over a \ncommittee hearing or coming to the floor to vote. There were times when \nall of us knew he was in pain. Yet he never let on. He did his job and \ndid it with a gritty determination, and I respect him so much for it. \nThat personal life experience, I am sure, played some role in his \ndetermination to advance medical research.\n  So as he brings an end to his Senate career, there are countless \nthousands who wouldn't know the name Arlen Specter who have been \nbenefited by this man's public service and commitment to medical \nresearch. I thank him for that as a person, as does everyone in this \nChamber who has benefited from that cause in his life.\n  I also think, as I look back on his work on the stimulus bill when he \nwas on the other side of the aisle, that it took extraordinary courage \nand may have cost him a Senate seat to step forward and say, I will \njoin with two other Republicans to pass a bill for this new President \nObama to try to stop a recession and to give some new life to this \neconomy. There were very few with the courage to do it. He was one of \nthem. Sitting with him in the meetings where the negotiations were \nunderway, then-Republican Senator Arlen Specter drove hard bargains in \nterms of bringing down the overall cost of the project and dedicating a \nsubstantial portion--$10 billion, if I am not mistaken--to the National \nInstitutes of Health. Again, the final negotiation on the stimulus bill \nfor America included Arlen Specter's demand that the National \nInstitutes of Health have additional research dollars. His commitment \nto make that happen did make it happen. Those three votes from the \nRepublican side of the aisle made it happen: a stimulus which averted, \nin my mind, a terrible, much worse recession, maybe even a depression \nin America. It was the best of the Senate, when a Senator had the \ncourage to stand up, take a position, risk his Senate seat because he \nbelieved in it, and do some good for America which would benefit \nmillions, as his vote and his effort did.\n  When I look at those whom I have served with in the Senate, there are \nprecious few who meet the standards for Arlen Specter. I am going to \nmiss him for so many reasons, but I know his involvement in public life \nwill not quit. That is often a cliche we hear on the floor after a \nfarewell address. But I know it because he has been hammering away at \nme every single day about bringing those cameras over to the Supreme \nCourt. So even when he leaves this body, if it is not done then, I am \nsure I am going to hear from him again on televising the Supreme Court \nproceedings. I give my word that as long as I am around here, Senator, \nI will carry that banner for you, and if I have a chance to help you \npass that measure at some point in the future I am going to do it \nbecause I think it is the right thing to do and I know it has meant so \nmuch to you.\n  The Senate's loss is America's gain as he becomes a public figure in \na different life. But during his tenure in the Senate he has graced \nthis institution with an extraordinary intelligence, a determination, \nand a belief that the national good should rise above any party cause. \nI am going to miss Arlen Specter and I thank him for being my friend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I was pleased to have an opportunity to \nhear most of the remarks made this morning by my friend and colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania and others who have spoken on the occasion of his \nretirement from the Senate.\n  I couldn't help but remember when he was campaigning in his first \nrace for the Senate and I had been asked to be available to help out in \nsome campaigns that year. I was a brandnew Senator and didn't know a \nlot of the protocols, but when I heard Arlen Specter wanted me to come \nup and speak in Pennsylvania somewhere during his campaign, I decided I \nwould accept the invitation, although I was a little apprehensive about \nit, about how I would be received as a Republican from Mississippi \ngoing up and helping this new candidate who was running on the \nRepublican ticket too. His wife Joan was a member of the city council \nin Philadelphia, as I recall--very well respected. Anyway, I enjoyed \ngetting to know the Senator and his wife better during those early \ncampaign events. Then, after he was elected, he asked me to make one \nmore trip up.\n  He could not go to Erie, PA, and keep an invitation that he wanted to \naccept and speak to a retired group of businessmen. These were older \ngentlemen who had been prominent in Pennsylvania business and political \nlife. I worried about it--that they would not think much about me. But \nI went up there and nearly froze to death. I thought this is just a \npayback for the Civil War, I guess, that Arlen never got to express. He \nwas going to do his part to help educate me and refine me in the ways \nof modern America. But that led to an entire career here working \nalongside him on both sides of the aisle, which I have enjoyed very \nmuch.\n  We have all learned from him the commitment that he makes to the job, \nthe seriousness of purpose that he brings to committee work, and he has \ntruly been an outstanding leader in the Senate, through personal \nperformance and his serious and impressive record of leadership.\n  I am glad to express those thoughts today and wish Arlen well in the \nyears ahead. We will still have a friendship that will be appreciated. \nI look forward to continuing that relationship.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                            New START Treaty\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nbriefly about the START Treaty, the consideration of which is now \npending before the Senate, and to urge my colleagues to move forward to \nratify this important treaty.\n  I have long been interested in the relationship between the United \nStates and, at that time, the Soviet Union, following the end of World \nWar II, with the emergence of our Nation and the Soviets emerging as \nthe two great world powers.\n  In college, after the war, I devoted a good bit of study to U.S.-\nU.S.S.R. relations. I wrote a senior thesis on it as a major in \npolitical science and international relations, and I have continued \nthat interest throughout my tenure in the Senate. One of my first \ninitiatives, in 1982, after being elected in 1980, was to propose a \nresolution calling for a summit meeting between the President of the \nUnited States and the head of the Soviet Union.\n  President Reagan had a practice of making Saturday afternoon \nspeeches--or Saturday morning speeches--on the radio. One day I \nlistened in and heard him talk about the tremendous destructive power \nwhich both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. had, and how they had the capacity to \ndestroy each other. Of course, that capacity became the basis of the \nmutual assured destruction period. But it seemed to me that what ought \nto be done was there ought to be a dialog and an effort to come to \nterms with the Soviet Union to reduce the tension and reduce the threat \nof nuclear war. I, therefore, offered a resolution to propose that.\n\n[[Page S10858]]\n\n  My resolution was resisted by one of the senior Senators, Senator \nJohn Tower of Texas, who was chairman of the Armed Services Committee. \nWhen I proposed the resolution, it brought Senator Tower to the floor \nwith a very really heated debate, with Senator Tower challenging my \nresolution and challenging my knowledge on the subject.\n  Early on, after being elected and starting to serve in 1981, I had \ntraveled to Grand Forks, ND, to see the Missileman II. I went to \nCharleston, SC, to see our nuclear submarine fleet, and I went to \nEdwards Air Force Base in California to look at the B1-B, the B-1 \nbomber, at that time. I was prepared to take on these issues.\n  Senator Tower opposed it, offered a tabling motion, and standing in \nthe well of the Senate, as if it was yesterday, I can remember that \nSenator Laxalt walked down the aisle from the door entering this \nChamber and voted no. He started to walk up the aisle to the Republican \ncloakroom.\n  Senator Tower chased him and said: Paul, you don't understand. This \nis a tabling motion. I am looking for an ``aye.''\n  Laxalt turned and said: I understand it is a tabling motion, and I \nvoted the way I wanted to, no. I want the resolution to go forward.\n  Senator Tower said: Well, Arlen Specter is trying to tell the \nPresident what to do.\n  Senator Laxalt replied: Well, why shouldn't he? Everybody else does, \nhe said jokingly.\n  That tabling motion was defeated 60 to 38. When a vote came up on the \nfinal resolution, it passed with 90 in favor and 8 in opposition. We \nknow what happened. There were negotiations and President Reagan came \nup with the famous dictum, ``trust, but verify.''\n  I was then active in the negotiations, the discussions on the Senate \nobserver group in Geneva around 1987. Then our record is plain that we \nhave approved by decisive numbers three very important treaties. START \nI was approved by the Senate in 1992, with a vote of 93 to 6. The START \nII treaty was approved in 1996 by a vote of 87 to 4. The Moscow Treaty \nof 2003 was approved by a vote of 95 to 0.\n  We have heard extensive debate on the floor of the Senate. People \nhave questioned the adequacy of the verification. I think those \narguments have been answered by Senator John Kerry, chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, who has done such an excellent job in \nmanaging the treaty. Questions have been raised about the missile \ndefense, and I think that, too, has been adequately responded to. This \nhas nothing to do with the issue of missile defense.\n  For me, a very key voice in this entire issue has been the voice of \nSenator Richard Lugar, who has pointed out that this treaty does not \ndeal with these collateral issues. This treaty is, directly stated, an \nextension of the treaty which has been in effect up until the present \ntime and has worked so very well.\n  Strenuous arguments have been made about modernizing our nuclear \nforces. Well, that is a subject for another day and another time. But \nthose who have offered that advocacy have found a response from the \nadministration with millions of dollars, from $85 million. That, as I \nsay, belongs to another day and another analysis. But those who have \nadvocated for modernization have gained very substantial responses from \nthe administration on that subject. Curious, in that context, that \nnotwithstanding that very substantial funding, it hasn't won them over, \nhasn't diminished their resistance to the treaty. Also, curious in the \ncontext of those expenditures on an issue, which didn't directly \ninvolve the necessity for modernization, there is a real question as to \nwhether there has been adequate debate and study on that subject, on \nthe hearings. It isn't part of the START treaty debate and discussion \nabout the expenditure of that kind of money, considering the kind of a \ndeficit we have, and also considering the advocates of those \nmodernization additions with the great expense have been some of the \nloudest voices objecting to governmental expenditures.\n  Well, we ought to spend what it takes for defense. That is the \nfundamental purpose of the Federal Government, to protect its citizens. \nBut real questions arise in my mind as to whether this was the proper \nplace to have that argument, but that has gone by the boards.\n  I think the letter which Admiral Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff, has issued about the conclusion of the military, that this is \na good treaty; about Admiral Mullen's statement that he personally was \ninvolved in the negotiations; that if the START treaty was not to be \nratified there would be U.S. military resources that would have to be \ndevoted to certain other issues which were taken by START so that it \nleads to an unequivocal recommendation by our No. 1 military expert, \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  One other very important element that has been discussed, but cannot \nbe over emphasized, is the destructive consequence of having this \ntreaty rejected in terms of our relations with Russia.\n  Russia is vitally important to us as we deal with Iran, vitally \nimportant to us as we deal with North Korea, vitally important to us as \nwe deal with a whole range of international problems. For us to come \nright to the brink and then to say no and reject it and seek to reopen \nit would have a very serious effect on our relations with Russia, which \nare so important to our national security. The other nations of the \nworld are watching in the wings what we do here. It would have a domino \neffect on our relationship with other nations.\n  It comes in a context where it is subject to being misunderstood as a \npolitical matter in the United States. I do not question for a moment \nthe motivation of those who oppose START. Those who have spoken against \nit have been some of our body's most knowledgeable Members on this \nimportant subject. But there is so much publicity about some \nquestioning whether President Obama can have both the START treaty and \nrepeal of don't ask, don't tell at the same time, there has been so \nmuch public comment about not wanting to see President Obama have \nanother victory before the end of the year, so much comment which \nraises a question as to whether opposition is politically motivated.\n  If the Russians and the other nations of the world cannot rely upon \nthe Senate to make a judgment on the merits without regard to the \npolitics or the appearance of politics, it has very serious \nconsequences for our standing in the international community of \nnations.\n  For those reasons, I do believe we ought to move ahead promptly. We \nought to ratify this treaty. We ought to continue our strenuous efforts \nto rid the world of the threat of nuclear war. This is part of that \nongoing process.\n  I urge my colleagues to ratify this important treaty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nAlabama is recognized.\n\n\n                             arlen specter\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I see my other colleagues. I do wish to \ntalk about one or two judicial nominees, but I want to say first how \nmuch I appreciate Senator Specter.\n  I have had the honor to serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee with \nSenator Specter the entire time I have been in the Senate--going on 14 \nyears, I guess. No one has a clearer legal mind. The clarity of his \nthought and expression is always impressive to me. And as someone who \npracticed law, I see the great lawyer skills he possesses.\n  Also, I note that he has not just today but throughout his career \ndefended the legitimacy of the powers of the Senate. He was very \narticulate over the past number of years in criticizing the abuse of \nfilling the tree, where bills can be brought up and amendments are not \nallowed. He has believed that is an unhealthy trend in the Senate, and \nhe has been one of the most effective advocates in opposition to it.\n  He sponsored and helped pass the Armed Career Criminal Act. He was \none of the leaders in that. Having been a longtime prosecutor in \nPhiladelphia, I like to tease our good friend Senator Leahy that he was \na prosecutor, but it was in Vermont. Senator Specter had to deal with a \nlot of crime in Philadelphia and was consistently reelected there for \nhis effectiveness and is a true source of insight into crime in America \nand has been an effective advocate for fighting crime.\n\n[[Page S10859]]\n\n  I note also that he has a good view about a Senator. He respects \nother Senators. He was talking with me one time or I was sharing with \nhim my concern about a matter, and he used a phrase I heard him use \nmore than once: Well, you are a U.S. Senator. In other words, if you do \nnot like it, stand up and defend yourself. He respected that, even if \nhe would disagree.\n  I remember another time Senator Specter was on the floor. I had just \narrived in the Senate. I wanted him to do something--I have long since \nforgotten what.\n  I said: Senator Specter, you could vote for this, and back home, you \ncould say thus and so.\n  He looked right at me, and he said: Senator, I don't need your advice \non how to conduct myself back home politically.\n  I learned a lesson from that. I never told another Senator that, I \nsay to Senator Specter. Who am I to tell you how to conduct yourself \npolitically back home in the State of Pennsylvania?\n  Senator Specter chaired the Judiciary Committee during the \nconfirmations of Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito. He was the \nleading Republican chair at that time. He raised questions about the \nnominees. But as chairman of the committee, with the votes and support \nof his Republican colleagues, he protected our rights, he protected our \ninterests. He did not back down one time on any action by the other \nparty that would have denied the ability to move that nomination \nforward to a vote and protect the rights of the parties on our side.\n  Those are a few things that come to mind when I think about the \nfantastic service he has given to the Senate. He is one of our most \nable Members, one of our most effective defenders of senatorial \nprerogative and independence, one of our crime fighters without par, \nand one of the best lawyers in the Senate, a person who is courageous \nand strong. Even when he was conducting those very intense Alito and \nRoberts hearings--it was just after he had serious cancer treatment, \nthe chemotherapy. I know he didn't feel well, but he was fabulous in \nconducting himself at that time. Throughout all of that treatment, his \nwork ethic surpassed by far that of most Senators in this body. It has \nbeen an honor to serve with him.\n  I see my other colleagues. I know Senator Coburn wanted to come down. \nHe was told he might be able to speak around noon.\n\n\n                            Senator Specter\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, first, before I get into my remarks, I \nwish to say how much I appreciated the remarks of Senator Specter \ntoday. I, for one, hope Senators on both sides of the aisle, Democrats \nand Republicans, heed his closing remarks as he described them and also \nthe farewell remarks of so many Senators over the last 2 or 3 weeks. I \nthink there is a lot of wisdom we can apply to our work going forward.\n  I thank Senator Specter very much for his service.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n\n\n                            New START Treaty\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the New START treaty. \nI do so for several reasons.\n  First, of course, the treaty is essential for national security. It \npromotes transparency and stability between the two countries that \npossess the majority of the world's nuclear weapons. It will decrease \nthe likelihood of a nuclear weapon falling into the hands of a rogue \nnation.\n  For the residents of my State, the treaty is close to home, \nliterally. Alaska and Russia are less than 3 miles apart at the closest \npoint in the Bering Sea. Commerce, scientific, educational, and \ncultural exchanges are commonplace between Alaska and our Russian \nneighbors. So peaceful coexistence with Russia is more than an abstract \nconcept to my constituents; it is a way of life.\n  The second reason this treaty is personal for Alaskans is because of \nour close proximity to North Korea. When North Korea's leader exercises \nhis political muscle by firing test missiles or threatening to attack \nthe United States, Alaskans get nervous because we are most directly in \nthe line of fire.\n  Thankfully, my home State is home to the ground-based missile defense \nsystem. Based at Fort Greely, this sophisticated system of more than \ntwo dozen ground-based interceptors is maintained and operated by \nhighly trained members of the Alaska National Guard. I was pleased to \nshow Defense Secretary Robert Gates this state-of-the-art system last \nyear. I worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make \nsure this system gets the resources and funding it warrants to protect \nus. I will continue to do that.\n  I would be troubled if the New START treaty impacted our Nation's \nmissile defense system. I know some of my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle would be equally concerned. Fortunately, such concerns are \nunfounded. I am confident nothing in this treaty will limit our ability \nto defend ourselves and our allies against a ballistic missile attack \nfrom a rogue nation.\n  The preamble of this treaty simply acknowledges the relationship \nbetween offensive and defensive strategic arms and verifies that \ncurrent defensive strategic arms do not undermine the offensive forces. \nThe preamble is nonbinding. There is no action or inaction arising from \nthis statement.\n  The section of the treaty prohibiting conversion of missile silos or \nlaunchers for ballistic missile defense purposes does not impact us. It \nis not something we are planning to do. In fact, we are in the process \nof completing a missile field in Alaska to field interceptors. The \nfield will have seven spare silos to deploy more interceptors if we \nneed them. We are moving forward with the phased adaptive approach to \nprotect our allies, with the two-stage interceptor as a hedge.\n  The unilateral statement by Russia also is nonbinding and is not even \npart of the treaty. Our own unilateral statements make it clear that \nthis treaty will not constrain missile defense in any way and that we \nwill continue improving and deploying missile defense systems to \nprotect us and our allies. These types of statements in a treaty are \nnot unprecedented. The right to withdraw has been stated in many \nprevious treaties--the nonproliferation treaty and the START treaty. \nThose statements did not stop the Senate from ratifying those treaties. \nThe language in the New START treaty should not either. In fact, this \ntreaty actually helps missile defense because it lessens restrictions \non test targets that were in the previous treaty. We will have more \nflexibility in testing.\n  We have heard from our national security leaders that this treaty \ndoes not constrain ballistic missile defense in any way. Secretary of \nState Hillary Clinton, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, Missile Defense Agency Director \nLTG Patrick O'Reilly, former Strategic Commander GEN Kevin Chilton, and \ncountless others confirm that this treaty in no way limits our \nballistic missile defense plans. We cannot disregard the views of our \nNation's most senior military and civilian leaders on this critical \nissue because of politics.\n  We have had almost 7 months to consider this treaty. We have had \nnumerous hearings and briefings--more on this treaty than any other \nsingle item I have been involved in since I have been here. In that \ntime, I heard no current or former national security leader say this \ntreaty is a detriment to ballistic missile defense. What they say and \nwhat we know is that the New START treaty will strengthen national \nsecurity and will not constrain ballistic missile defense.\n  For all of these reasons, I urge a prompt approval of this vital \ntreaty for our Nation and our world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my statement \nand that of Senator Udall appear as in executive session and that the \ntime be charged postcloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Nomination of Bill Martinez\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise today to state my strong support \nfor the nomination of Bill Martinez to serve on the U.S. District Court \nfor the District of Colorado. Having recommended his candidacy to the \nPresident, along with my colleague Senator Udall, I believe he is \neminently qualified for the Federal bench.\n  Bill was nominated to serve on the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of\n\n[[Page S10860]]\n\nColorado in February of this year. His nomination cleared the Senate \nJudiciary Committee in April. Since then, he has been in a state of \nlimbo awaiting a final vote allowing him to serve. That is why I am \nvery grateful for the hard work of the Judiciary Committee, both \nDemocrats and Republicans, who have moved this nomination forward and \nare trying to finish it before the end of the 111th Congress.\n  Our State has two vacancies on the district court. Both vacancies are \nover 2 years old, with one close to 3 years old. Because there are only \nseven Federal judgeships in our State, the other judges are facing \never-growing caseloads, resulting in significant backlogs for those \nseeking justice.\n  In fact, the administrative office of the courts has declared the \nvacancy situation in Colorado a judicial emergency. It is important \nthat we move these nominations forward to prevent further backlogs and \njudicial emergencies, and I pledge to work with my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to make sure we can work together to confirm \njudicial nominees such as Bill Martinez in a timely manner.\n  I believe, after careful review of Bill Martinez's experience, my \ncolleagues will see this is someone well worth confirming. Bill is \ncurrently at a law firm in Denver, where he primarily represents \nplaintiffs in Federal and State courts and before arbitrators and \nadministrative agencies. He is certified as AAA arbitrator in \nemployment disputes.\n  Prior to starting his own firm, he was a regional attorney of the \nU.S. EEOC in its Denver district office. Senator Udall will be going \ninto more detail regarding this nominee.\n  There, Bill had responsibility for the Commission's legal operations \nand Federal court enforcement litigation in the office's six-State \njurisdiction.\n  Before joining the EEOC, Bill worked in private practice on \nemployment, securities and commercial litigation.\n  I know some want to focus on his pro bono work and try to make \npolitical assumptions about him from a small portion of his career. But \nI know Bill, and he is the sum of a lot of great work in the public and \nprivate sectors.\n  For example, while at the EEOC Bill was in charge of an age \ndiscrimination class action suit that resulted in a settlement of \nnearly $200 million for 3,200 laid off engineers. This is one of the \nlargest ever age discrimination class actions.\n  Bill began his career at the Legal Assistance Foundation of Chicago, \nrepresenting indigent clients and other individuals seeking low- or no-\ncost counsel. This is a nominee whose breadth of legal experience has \nspanned the profession, and I think for that reason alone he should be \nconfirmed.\n  Over the course of his legal career, Bill has been lead or colead \ncounsel in complex litigation, resulting in 18 published opinions from \nFederal and State courts in Colorado and Illinois. Bill's time as a \nlitigator and advocate has provided him with the necessary skills and \nperspective to deal with the diverse docket that comes before U.S. \ndistrict court judges.\n  Beyond his distinguished legal skills, Bill's personal story is a \ntribute to this country and embodies the American dream. He is an \nimmigrant success story. Bill was born in Mexico and immigrated with \nhis family to the United States at a young age. He was the first in his \nfamily to attend college and law school. His rise through the legal \nprofession is a great example for bright, young law students, and, \nindeed, for us all.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for Bill's nomination. He is a model \nnominee for the Federal district court, an expert in labor and \nemployment law who will serve Coloradans well. Bill Martinez has the \nexperience and strong sense of civic responsibility we need on the \nFederal bench.\n  I thank the chairman for his guidance of this nomination, and I urge \nmy colleagues to vote to confirm Bill to Colorado 's Federal bench.\n  I also would be remiss, if I didn't thank my senior Senator, Mark \nUdall, for his extraordinary efforts to make sure we had a fair, \nbalanced, and thoughtful search process. I think that process for this \nappointment and for the others whom we have done already are a model \nfor the country, and it is a real testament to Senator Udall's \nleadership.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                            New START Treaty\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I know today is a pretty monumental day as \nit relates to the START treaty we have been discussing for some time, \nand tomorrow will be a big day in that regard too. I think there is \nnothing more we care about than our country being secure. I have two \ndaughters who are 21 and 23, a wonderful wife, and extended family, as \ndoes every Member in this room, and there is nothing I take more \nseriously than making sure our country is secure.\n  So as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, when we entered \ninto discussions relating to the START treaty, I attended 11 of the 12 \nhearings. I have been in multiple classified meetings, I have spoken to \nmilitary leaders across our country, and I have been in so many \nintelligence briefings that I have begun to speak like an intelligence \nofficer. So I have taken this responsibility very seriously.\n  I wish to say there are numbers of people who obviously are still \nmaking up their mind regarding this treaty, and that is why I came to \nthe floor. One of the things we do when we end up ratifying a treaty is \nwe have something called a resolution of ratification. No doubt this \ntreaty was negotiated by the President and his team--the Secretary of \nState and others who work with Secretary Clinton--and no doubt that is \ndone by people on the other side of the aisle. But what I would like to \nbring to the attention of my colleagues is that whenever we ratify a \ntreaty, we do so through something called a resolution of ratification. \nFor those who might not have been involved in the markup, I would like \nfor everyone in this body to know this resolution of ratification, \nthanks to the good will of the chairman of our committee, was mostly \ndrafted by Republicans. It was drafted, with the approval, certainly, \nof the chairman, but this was drafted by Senator Lugar, by myself, \nSenator Kyl had tremendous input into this, and Senator Isakson.\n  So the resolution of ratification we are amending today had \ntremendous Republican input. As a matter of fact, it was done mostly by \nRepublicans. As a matter of fact, this resolution of ratification is \ncalled the Lugar-Corker resolution. This is what came out of committee.\n  One of the things that has concerned people on both sides of the \naisle has been this whole issue of modernization. I have seen something \nof beauty over the last year. About 1 year ago, I met with Senator Kyl \nin the Senate Dining Room, and we began looking at the modernization of \nour nuclear arsenal. Many people have focused during this debate on the \nfact that we have 1,550 warheads as a limitation, if you will, in this \ntreaty. But they fail to realize we have over 5,000 warheads in our \nnuclear arsenal, all of which need to be modernized, and all of which \nare getting ready to be obsolete if we don't make the investment.\n  As a matter of fact, the Presiding Officer and I have visited some of \nthe labs throughout our country. There are seven facilities we have in \nthis country that deal with our nuclear arsenal. Many of those are \nbecoming obsolete and must have needed investment.\n  I have watched Senator Kyl over the last year, in a very methodical \nway--under his leadership, with me as his wing man, and others--working \nto make sure the proper modernization of our nuclear arsenal takes \nplace. There is no question in my mind--there is no question in my \nmind--if it were not for the discussion of this treaty, we would not \nhave the commitments we have today on modernization.\n  This is the 1251 report that is required by Defense authorization. \nThis has been updated twice due to the efforts of Republicans, led by \nSenator Kyl, who has done an outstanding job. This has been updated \ntwice. First, we had a 5-year update about 60 days ago, and we had a \n10-year update that came thereafter. This is our nuclear modernization \nplan.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe nuclear modernization plan as part of this debate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S10861]]\n\n   November 2010 Update to the National Defense Authorization Act of \n                       FY2010 Section 1251 Report\n\n\n      New START Treaty Framework and Nuclear Force Structure Plans\n\n     Introduction\n       This paper updates elements of the report that was \n     submitted to Congress on May 13, 2010, pursuant to section \n     1251 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2010 (Public Law 111-84) (``1251 Report'').\n     2. National Nuclear Security Administration and modernization \n         of the complex--an overview\n       From FY 2005 to FY 2010, a downward trend in the budget for \n     Weapons Activities at the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration (NNSA) resulted in a loss of purchasing power \n     of approximately 20 percent. As part of the 2010 Nuclear \n     Posture Review, the Administration made a commitment to \n     modernize America's nuclear arsenal and the complex that \n     sustains it, and to continue to recruit and retain the best \n     men and women to maintain our deterrent for as long as \n     nuclear weapons exist. To begin this effort, the President \n     requested a nearly 10 percent increase for Weapons Activities \n     in the FY 2011 budget, and $4.4 billion in additional funds \n     for these activities for the FY 2011 Future Years Nuclear \n     Security Plan (FYNSP). These increases were reflected in the \n     1251 report provided to Congress in May 2010.\n       The Administration spelled out its vision of modernization \n     through the course of 2010. In February, soon after the \n     release of the President's budget, the Vice President gave a \n     major address at the National Defense University in which he \n     highlighted the need to invest in our nuclear work force and \n     facilities. Several reports to Congress provided the details \n     of this plan, including: NNSA's detailed FY 2011 budget \n     request, submitted in February; the strategy details in the \n     Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) (April); the 1251 report (May); \n     and the multi-volume Stockpile Stewardship and Management \n     Plan (SSMP) (June). Over the last several months, senior \n     Administration officials have testified before multiple \n     congressional committees on the modernization effort.\n       The projections in the Future Years Nuclear Security Plan \n     (FYNSP) that accompanied the FY 2011 budget submission and \n     the 1251 report by the President are, appropriately called, \n     `projections.' They are not a `fixed in stone' judgment of \n     how much a given project or program may cost. They are a \n     snapshot in time of what we expect inflation and other \n     factors to add up to, given a specific set of requirements \n     (that are themselves not fixed) over a period of several \n     years. Budget projections, whether in the FYNSP and other \n     reports, are evaluated each year and adjusted as necessary.\n       Indeed, planning and design, as well as budget estimates, \n     have evolved since the budget for FY 2011 was developed. \n     Notably, stockpile requirements to fully implement the NPR \n     and the New START Treaty have been refined, and the NNSA has \n     begun executing its Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan \n     (SSMP). This update will discuss, in particular, evolving \n     life extension programs (LEP) and progress on the designs of \n     key facilities such as the Uranium Processing Facility (UPF) \n     and the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement (CMRR).\n       Based on this additional work, and the development of new \n     information and insights, the President is prepared to seek \n     additional resources for the Weapons Activities account, over \n     and above the FY 2011 FYNSP, for the FY 2012 budget and for \n     the remainder of the FYNSP period (FY 2013 through FY 2016).\n       Specifically, the President plans to request $7.6 billion \n     for FY 2012 (an increase of $0.6 billion over the planned FY \n     2012 funding level included in the FY 2011 FYNSP). Thus, in \n     two years, the level of funding for this program requested \n     will have increased by $1.2 billion, in nominal terms, over \n     the $6.4 billion level appropriated in FY 2010. Altogether, \n     the President plans to request $41.6 billion for FY 2012-2016 \n     (an increase of $4.1 billion over the same period from the FY \n     2011 FYNSPT--).\n       Given the extremely tight budget environment facing the \n     federal government, these requests to the Congress \n     demonstrate the priority the Administration's places on \n     maintaining the safety, security and effectiveness of the \n     deterrent.\n     3. NNSA--Program Changes and New Requirements since \n         submission of the 1251 Report\n       A. Update to Stockpile Stewardship and Sustainment\n       Surveillance--Surveillance activities are essential to \n     enabling continued certification of the reliability of the \n     stockpile without nuclear testing. Surveillance involves \n     withdrawing weapons from deployment and subjecting them to \n     laboratory tests, as well as joint flight tests with the DoD \n     to assess their reliability. These activities allow detection \n     of possible manufacturing and design defects as well as \n     material degradation over time. NNSA has also received \n     recommendations from the National Laboratory directors, the \n     DoD, the STRATCOM Strategic Advisory Group, and the JASON \n     Defense Advisory Panel that the nuclear warhead/bomb \n     surveillance program should be expanded.\n       In response to this broad-based advice, NNSA has reviewed \n     the stockpile surveillance program and its funding profile. \n     From FY 2005 through FY 2009, funding for surveillance \n     activities, when adjusted for inflation, fell by 27 percent. \n     In recognition of the serious concerns raised by chronic \n     underfunding of these activities, beginning in FY 2010, the \n     surveillance budget has been increased by 50 percent, from \n     $158 million to $239 million. In the FY 2012 budget, the \n     President will seek to sustain this increase throughout the \n     FYNSP. This level of funding will assure that the required \n     surveillance activities can be fully sustained over time.\n       Weapon System Life Extension--The Administration is \n     committed to pursuing a fully funded Life Extension Program \n     for the nuclear weapons stockpile. The FY 2011 budget \n     submission and the NPR outlined initial plans. Since May \n     2010, additional work has further defined the requirements to \n     extend the life of the following weapon systems:\n       W76--The Department of Defense has finalized its assessment \n     of the number of W76 warheads recommended to remain in the \n     stockpile to carry out current guidance. The number of W76-1 \n     life-extended warheads needing completion is larger than NNSA \n     built into its FY 2011 budget plans. NNSA, with the support \n     of the DoD, has adjusted its plan accordingly to ensure the \n     W76-1 build is completed in FY 2018, an adjustment of one \n     year that is endorsed by the Nuclear Weapons Council. This \n     adjustment will not affect the timelines for B61 or W78 life \n     extensions. The LEP will be fully funded for the life of the \n     program at $255 million annually.\n       B61--NNSA began the study on the nuclear portion of the B61 \n     life extension in August 2010, six months later than the \n     original planning basis. To overcome this delay, NNSA will \n     accelerate the technology maturation, warhead development, \n     and production engineering that is necessary to retain the \n     schedule for the completion of the first production unit in \n     FY 2017. An additional $10 million per year has been added to \n     the FY 2012 FYNSP for this purpose.\n       W88 AF 1251 Report addressed the intent to study, \n     among other things, a common warhead for the W78 and the W88 \n     as an option for W78 life extension. Early development of a \n     W88 Arming, Fuzing, and Firing system (AF) would enhance \n     the evaluation of commonality options and enable more \n     efficient long-term sustainment of the W88. Approximately \n     $400 million has been added to the FY 2012-16 FYNSP for this \n     purpose.\n       Stockpile Systems and Services--NNSA is now seeking to \n     execute a larger program of stockpile maintenance than \n     assumed in planning the FY 2011 budget and than projected in \n     the 1251 Report. The additional work includes an increase in \n     the development/production of the limited life components to \n     support the weapons systems. Consequently, the Administration \n     plans to request increased funding of $40 million in FY 2012 \n     for the production of neutron generators and gas transfer \n     systems. NNSA and DoD are aligned for the delivery of \n     essential hardware to ensure no weapon fails to meet \n     requirements.\n       New Experiments--NNSA's current science and surveillance \n     activities have been more successful than originally \n     anticipated in ensuring the reliability of our existing \n     stockpile without nuclear testing. As we continue to develop \n     modern life extension programs, however, NNSA and the \n     laboratories are considering even more advanced methods for \n     evaluating the best technical options for life extension \n     programs, including refurbishment, reuse and replacement of \n     nuclear components. One such effort of interest that could \n     aid in our efforts includes expanded subcritical experiments \n     designed to modernize warhead safety and security features \n     without adding new military capabilities or pursuing \n     explosive nuclear weapons testing. This program might include \n     so-called ``scaled experiments'' that could improve the \n     performance of predictive capability calculations by \n     providing data on plutonium behavior under compression by \n     insensitive high explosives. In order to thoroughly \n     understand this issue, to assess its cost-effectiveness and \n     to ensure that there is a sound technical basis for any such \n     effort, the Administration will conduct a review of these \n     proposed activities and potential alternatives.\n       B. Updates to Modernization of the Nuclear Weapons Complex\n       Modernization of the complex includes reducing deferred \n     maintenance, constructing replacement facilities, and \n     disposing of surplus facilities. The Administration is \n     committed to fully fund the construction of the Uranium \n     Processing Facility (UPF) and the Chemistry and Metallurgy \n     Research Replacement (CMRR), and to doing so in a manner that \n     does not redirect funding from the core mission of managing \n     the stockpile and sustaining the science, technology and \n     engineering foundation. To this end, in addition to increased \n     funding for CMRR and UPF, the FY 2012 budget will increase \n     funding over the FY 2012 number in the 2011 FYNSP for \n     facilities operations and maintenance by approximately $176 \n     million.\n       Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities (RTBF): CMRR and \n     UPF Construction--These two nuclear facilities are required \n     to ensure the United States can maintain a safe, secure and \n     effective arsenal over the long-term. The NPR concluded that \n     the United States needed to build these facilities; the \n     Administration remains committed to their construction.\n       Construction of large, one-of-a-kind facilities such as \n     these presents significant challenges. Several reviews by the \n     Government\n\n[[Page S10862]]\n\n     Accountability Office, as well as a ``root-cause'' analysis \n     conducted by the Department of Energy in 2008, have found \n     that initiating construction before designs are largely \n     complete contributes to increased costs and schedule delays. \n     In response to these reviews, and in order to assure the best \n     value for the taxpayers, NNSA has concluded that reaching the \n     90% engineering design stage before establishing a project \n     baseline for these facilities is critical to the successful \n     pursuit of these capabilities.\n       The ten-year funding plan reported in the 1251 Report \n     reflected cost estimates for these two facilities that were \n     undertaken at a very early stage of design (about 10% \n     complete), were preliminary, and could not therefore provide \n     the basis for valid, longer-range cost estimates. The designs \n     of these two facilities are now about 45% completed; the \n     estimated costs of the facilities have escalated. Responsible \n     stewardship of the taxpayer dollars required to fund these \n     facilities requires close examination of requirements of all \n     types and to understand their associated costs, so that NNSA \n     and DoD can make informed decisions about these facilities. \n     To this end, NNSA, in cooperation with the DoD, is carrying \n     out a comprehensive review of the safety, security, \n     environmental and programmatic requirements that drive the \n     costs of these facilities. In parallel with, and in support \n     of this effort, separate independent reviews are being \n     conducted by the Corps of Engineers and the DOE Chief \n     Financial Officer's Cost Analysis Office. In addition, the \n     Secretary of Energy is convening his own review, with support \n     from an independent group of senior experts, to evaluate \n     facility requirements.\n       The overriding focus of this work is to ensure that UPF and \n     CMRR are built to achieve needed capabilities without \n     incurring cost overruns or scheduling delays. We expect that \n     construction project cost baselines for each project will be \n     established in FY 2013 after 90% of the design work is \n     completed. At the present time, the range for the Total \n     Project Cost (TPC) for CMRR is $3.7 billion to $5.8 billion \n     and the TPC range for UPF is $4.2 billion to $6.5 billion. \n     TPC estimates include Project Engineering and Design, \n     Construction, and Other Project Costs from inception through \n     completion. Over the FYNSP period (FY 2012-2016) the \n     Administration will increase funding by $340 million compared \n     with the amount projected in the FY 2011 FYNSP for the two \n     facilities.\n       At this early stage in the process of estimating costs, it \n     would not be prudent to assume we know all of the annual \n     funding requirements over the lives of the projects. Funding \n     requirements will be reconsidered on an ongoing basis as the \n     designs mature and as more information is known about costs. \n     While innovative funding mechanisms, such as forward funding, \n     may be useful in the future for providing funding stability \n     to these projects, at this early design stage, well before we \n     have a more complete understanding of costs, NNSA has \n     determined that it would not yet be appropriate and possibly \n     counterproductive to pursue such mechanisms until we reach \n     the 90% design point. As planning for these projects \n     proceeds, NNSA and OMB will continue to review all \n     appropriate options to achieve savings and efficiencies in \n     the construction of these facilities.\n       The combined difference between the low and high estimates \n     for the UPF and CMRR facilities ($4.4 billion) results in a \n     range of costs beyond FY 2016 as shown in Figure 3. Note that \n     for the high estimate, the facilities would reach completion \n     in FY 2023 for CMRR and FY 2024 for UPF. For each facility, \n     functionality would be attainable by FY 2020 even though \n     completion of the total projects would take longer.\n       Readiness in the Technical Base of Facilities (RTBF)--\n     Operations and Maintenance\n       In order to implement an increased scope of work for \n     stockpile activities, especially surveillance and the ongoing \n     life extension programs (LEPs), the following will be \n     supported:\n       NNSS--Full experimental facility availability to support \n     ongoing subcritical and other experiments necessary for \n     certification of life extension technologies.\n       Pantex--Funds are included in the FY 2012 request to fully \n     cover anticipated needs for flood prevention.\n       SNL--Replacement of aging and failing equipment at the \n     Tonopah Test Range in Nevada to facilitate the increasing \n     pace of operations support for the B61; and Micro-\n     electronics, engineering test, and surveillance actions at \n     SNL to support the B61, W76 and W78 that require additional \n     equipment maintenance in facilities and the need to operate \n     engineering test facilities that currently operate in a \n     periodic campaign mode.\n       LLNL, LANL, and Y-12--Investments in infrastructure and \n     construction, including support for Site 300, PF-4, and \n     Nuclear Facilities Risk Reduction.\n       Kansas City--Investment sufficient to meet LEP needs for \n     the W76-1, B-6I, and W78/88 while preparing and completing \n     the move to the KCRIMS site at Botts Road.\n       Savannah River--Sufficient investment to ensure that \n     availability of tritium supplies adequate for stockpile needs \n     is assured.\n       RTBF: Other Construction--As the CMRR and UPF projects are \n     completed, NNSA will continue to modernize and refurbish the \n     balance of its physical infrastructure over the next ten \n     years. The FY 2012 budget request includes $67 million for \n     the High Explosive Pressing Facility project that is ongoing \n     at Pantex, $35 million for the Nuclear Facilities Risk \n     Reduction Project at Y-12, $25 million for the Test \n     Capabilities Revitalization Project at Sandia, as well as \n     $9.8 million for the Transuranic Waste Facility and $20 \n     million for the TA-55 Reinvestment Project at LANL.\n       RTBF: Construction Management--Because of the unprecedented \n     scale of construction that NNSA is initiating, both in the \n     nuclear weapons complex and in non- proliferation activities, \n     the Administration recognizes that stronger management \n     structures and oversight processes will be needed to prevent \n     cost growth and schedule slippage. NNSA will work with DoD, \n     OMB, and other affected parties to analyze current processes \n     and to consider options for enhancements.\n       C. Pension Cost Growth and Alternative Mitigation \n           Strategies\n       NNSA has a large contractor workforce that is covered by \n     defined-benefit pension plans for which the U.S. Government \n     assumes liability. Portfolio management decisions, market \n     downturns, interest rate decreases, and new statutory \n     requirements have caused large increases in pension costs. \n     The Administration is fully committed to keeping these \n     programs solvent without harming the base programs. The \n     Administration will therefore cover total pension \n     reimbursements of $875 million for all of NNSA for FY 2012, \n     adding $300 million more to the NNSA topline than the amount \n     provided in FY 2011. Over the five year period FY 2012 to FY \n     2016, the Administration will provide a total of $1.5 billion \n     above the FY 2011 level. About three-quarters of this funding \n     is associated with Weapons Activities and is included in the \n     funding totals for those programs noted above.\n       The Administration will conduct an independent study of \n     these issues using the appropriate statutory and regulatory \n     framework to inform longer-term decisions on pension \n     reimbursements. The Administration is evaluating multiple \n     approaches to determine the best path to cover pension plan \n     contributions, while minimizing the impact to mission. \n     Contractors are evaluating mitigation strategies, such as \n     analyzing plan changes, identifying alternative funding \n     strategies, and seeking increased participant contributions. \n     Also, contractors have been directed to look into other human \n     resource areas where savings can be achieved, in order to \n     help fund pension plan contributions.\n     3. Summary of NNSA Stockpile and Infrastructure Costs\n       A summary of estimated costs specifically related to the \n     Nuclear Weapons Stockpile, the supporting infrastructure, and \n     critical science, technology and engineering is provided in \n     Table 1.\n\n                                                          TABLE 1--TEN-YEAR PROJECTIONS FOR WEAPONS STOCKPILE AND INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                                    Fiscal year\n                    $ Billions                    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       2010         2011         2012         2013         2014         2015         2016         2017         2018         2019         2020\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDirected Stockpile...............................          1.5          1.9          2.0          2.1          2.3          2.5          2.6          2.6          2.6          2.6          2.6\nScience Technology & Engineering Campaigns.......          1.6          1.7          1.8          1.8          1.8          1.8          1.9          2.0          2.1          2.2          2.3\nReadiness in Technical Base and Facilities.......          1.8          1.8          2.1          2.3          2.5          2.5          2.5          2.7      2.8-2.9      2.9-3.1      2.9-3.3\n    UPF..........................................          0.1          0.1          0.2          0.2          0.4          0.4          0.4     0.48-0.5     0.48-0.5     0.48-0.5     0.38-0.5\n    CMRR.........................................          0.1          0.2          0.3          0.3          0.4          0.4          0.4     0.48-0.5      0.4-0.5      0.3-0.5      0.2-0.5\nSecure Transportation............................          0.2          0.2          0.3          0.2          0.3          0.3          0.3          0.3          0.3          0.3          0.3\n                                                  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        Defense Programs Subtotal................          5.2          5.7          6.1          6.5          6.9          7.1          7.3      7.5-7.6      7.7-7.9      7.9-8.2      8.0-8.4\nOther Weapons....................................          1.2          1.3          1.3          1.3          1.3          1.3          1.4          1.4          1.4          1.4          1.5\n                                                  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        Subtotal, Weapons........................          6.4          7.0          7.4          7.8          8.2          8.5          8.7      8.9-9.0      9.2.9.3      9.4-9.6      9.4-9.8\nContractor Pensions Cost Growth..................  ...........  ...........          0.2          0.2          0.2          0.2          0.2         *TBD         *TBD         *TBD         *TBD\n                                                  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        Total, Weapons...........................          6.4          7.0          7.6          7.9          8.4          8.7          8.9      8.9-9.0      9.2-9.3      9.4-9.6      9.4-9.8\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNumbers may not add due to rounding.\n* Anticipated costs for contractor pensions have been calculated only through FY 2016.

Plans for Sustaining and Modernizing U.S. Strategic \n         Delivery Systems\n       The Administration remains committed to the sustainment and \n     modernization of U.S. strategic delivery systems, to ensure \n     continuing deterrent capabilities in the face of evolving \n     challenges and technological developments. DoD's estimates of \n     costs to sustain and modernize strategic delivery systems \n     will be updated as part of the President's FY 2012 budget \n     request; until this budget request is finalized, figures \n     provided in the May 2010 1251 report remain the best \n     available cost estimates.\n       The following section of this report provides the latest \n     information on DoD's efforts to modernize the Triad, \n     including expected timelines for key decisions.\n     Strategic Submarines (SSBNs) and Submarine-Launched Ballistic \n         Missiles (SLBMs)\n       As the NPR and the 1251 Report note, the United States will \n     maintain continuous at-sea deployments of SSBNs in the \n     Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as well as the ability to surge \n     additional submarines in crisis. The current Ohio-class \n     SSBNs, have had their service life extended by a decade and \n     will commence retirement in FY 2027. DoD plans a transition \n     between the retiring Ohio-class SSBNs and the Ohio-class \n     replacement that creates no gap in the U.S. sea-based \n     strategic deterrent capability.\n       Current key milestones for the SSBN replacement program \n     include:\n       Research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT) began \n     in FY 2010 and continues with the goal of achieving 10 \n     percent greater design maturity prior to starting procurement \n     than the USS VIRGINIA class had before procurement started;\n       In FY 2015, the Navy will begin the detailed design and \n     advanced procurement of critical components;\n       In FY 2019, the Navy will begin the seven-year construction \n     period for the new SSBN lead ship;\n       In FY 2026, the Navy will begin the three-year strategic \n     certification period for the lead ship; and\n       In FY 2029, the lead ship will commence active strategic \n     at-sea service.\n       The Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) considered three \n     platforms concepts for the Ohio-class Replacement: VIRGINIA-\n     Insert, OHIO-Like, and a New Design. DoD is currently \n     evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of each concept, \n     including cost tradeoffs, with the goal of meeting military \n     requirements at an affordable cost. An initial milestone \n     decision is expected by the end of calendar year 2010 to \n     inform the program and budget moving forward.\n       After the initial milestone design decision is made, DoD \n     will be able to provide any adjustments to the estimated \n     total costs for the Ohio-class replacement program. Thus, \n     today's estimated total costs for FY 2011 through FY 2020 \n     remain the same as reported in the 1251 Report: a total of \n     approximately $29.4 billion with $11.6 billion for R and \n     $17.8 billion for design and procurement.\n       As noted in the 1251 Report, the Navy plans to sustain the \n     Trident II D5 missile, as carried on Ohio-class Fleet SSBNs \n     as well as the next generation SSBN, through a least 2042 \n     with a robust life-extension program.\n     Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs)\n       As stated in the Nuclear Posture Review, while a decision \n     on an ICBM follow-on is not needed for several years, \n     preparatory analysis is needed and is in fact now underway. \n     This work will consider a range of deployment options, with \n     the objective of defining a cost-effective approach for an \n     ICBM follow-on that supports continued reductions in U.S. \n     nuclear weapons while promoting stable deterrence. Key \n     milestones include:\n       The Capabilities-Based Assessment (CBA) for the ICBM \n     follow-on system is underway.\n       By late 2011, the study plan for the AoA, including the \n     scope of options to be considered, will be completed.\n       In 2012, the AoA will begin.\n       In FY 2014, the AoA will be completed, and DoD will \n     recommend a specific way-ahead for an ICBM follow-on to the \n     President.\n       The Air Force is funding the ongoing CBA effort at \n     approximately $26 million per year. Given the inherent \n     uncertainties about missile configuration and basing prior to \n     the completion of the AoA, DoD is unable to provide costs for \n     its potential development and procurement at this time. \n     However, DoD expects to be able to include funding for RDT \n     for an ICBM follow-on system in the FY 2013 budget request, \n     based on initial results from the AoA.\n       The Air Force plans to sustain the Minuteman III through \n     2030. That sustainment includes substantial ongoing life \n     extension programs, cost data for which was provided to \n     Congress in the May 2010 Section 1251 Report.\n     Heavy Bombers\n       DoD plans to sustain a heavy bomber leg of the strategic \n     Triad for the indefinite future, and is committed to the \n     modernization of the heavy bomber force. Thus, the question \n     being addressed in DoD's ongoing long-range strike study is \n     not whether to pursue a follow-on heavy bomber, but the \n     appropriate type of bomber and the timelines for development, \n     production, and deployment. The long-range strike study, \n     which is also considering related investments in electronic \n     attack, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, air- \n     and sea-delivered cruise missiles, and prompt global strike, \n     will be completed in time to inform the President's budget \n     submission for FY 2012.\n       As stated in the May 2010 1251 Report, pending the results \n     of the long-range strike study, estimated costs for a follow-\n     on bomber for FY 2011 through FY 2015 are $1.7 billion and \n     estimated costs beyond FY 2015 are to-be-determined. DoD \n     intends to provide any necessary updates to cost estimates \n     along with the President's budget submission for FY 2012.\n       The Air Force plans to retain the B-52 in the inventory \n     through at least 2035 to continue to meet both nuclear and \n     conventional mission requirements. The Air Force will make \n     planned upgrades and life extensions to the fleet. The B-2 \n     fleet is being upgraded through three top priority \n     acquisition programs: the Radar Modernization Program (RMP), \n     Extremely High Frequency (EHF) Satellite Communications and \n     Computers, and Defensive Management System (DMS), as well as \n     multiple smaller sustainment initiatives.\n     Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM)\n       DoD intends to replace the current ALCM with the advanced \n     long range standoff (LRSO) cruise missile. The CBA for the \n     LRSO is underway. An AoA will be conducted from approximately \n     spring 2011 through fall 2013. The AoA will define the \n     platform requirements, provide cost-sensitive comparisons, \n     validate threats, and establish measures of effectiveness, \n     and assess candidate systems for eventual procurement and \n     production.\n       The Air Force has programmed approximately $800 million for \n     RDT over the FYDP for the development of LRSO. Based on \n     current analysis of the program, the Air Force expects low \n     rate initial production of LRSO to being in approximately \n     2025, while the current ALCM will be sustained through 2030. \n     Until the planned AoA is completed, DoD will not have a basis \n     for accurately estimating subsequent costs.\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, the reason I want that entered into the \nRecord, over the next 10 years, what this calls for is $86 billion--$86 \nbillion--worth of investment throughout the seven facilities throughout \nour country on nuclear armaments and over $100 billion on the delivery \nmechanisms to ensure that these warheads are deliverable.\n  So one might say: Well, that is great, but how are we going to be \nsure? How are we going to be sure the appropriators actually ask for \nthe money?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter signed on December 16 by Chairman Inouye, Senators Dianne \nFeinstein, Thad Cochran, and Lamar Alexander.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 16, 2010.\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to express our support \n     for ratification of the New START Treaty and full funding for \n     the modernization of our nuclear weapons arsenal, as outlined \n     by your updated report that was mandated by Section 1251 of \n     the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010.\n       We also ask that, in your future budget requests to \n     Congress, you include the funding identified in that report \n     on nuclear weapons modernization. Should you choose to limit \n     non-defense discretionary spending in any future budget \n     requests to Congress, funding for nuclear modernization in \n     the National Nuclear Security Agency's proposed budgets \n     should be considered defense spending, as it is critical to \n     national security and, therefore, not subject to such \n     limitations. Further, we ask that an updated 1251 report be \n     submitted with your budget request to Congress each year.\n       We look forward to working with you on the ratification of \n     the New START Treaty and modernization of the National \n     Nuclear Security Agency's nuclear weapons facilities. This \n     represents a long-term commitment by each of us, as \n     modernization of our nuclear arsenal will require a sustained \n     effort.\n           Sincerely,\n     Daniel K. Inouye.\n     Dianne Feinstein.\n     Thad Cochran.\n     Lamar Alexander.\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, that letter says to the President that \nthey will ask for the moneys necessary to modernize our nuclear \narsenal; that they agree to ask for that money as part of their \nappropriations bill.\n  So, then, you might say: Well, what about the President? Will the \nPresident actually, in his budget, ask Congress to ask for that money?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from the President of the United States, dated December 20, \naddressed to the appropriators who just wrote the letter I mentioned, \nsaying that he, in fact, will ask for those funds in the budget he puts \nforth in the next few months.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S10864]]\n\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, December 20, 2010.\n     Hon. Lamar Alexander,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Alexander: Thank you for your letter regarding \n     funding for the modernization of the nuclear weapons complex \n     and for your expression of support for ratification of the \n     New START Treaty.\n       As you know, in the Fiscal Year 2011 budget, I requested a \n     nearly 10 percent increase in the budget for weapons \n     activities at the National Nuclear Security Administration \n     (NNSA). In May, in the report required by Section 1251 of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, I \n     laid out a 10 year, $80 billion spending plan for NNSA. The \n     Administration submitted an update to that report last month, \n     and we now project over $85 billion in spending over the next \n     decade.\n       I recognize that nuclear modernization requires investment \n     for the long-term, in addition to this one-year budget \n     increase. That is my commitment to the Congress--that my \n     Administration will pursue these programs and capabilities \n     for as long as I am President.\n       In future years, we will provide annual updates to the 1251 \n     report. If a decision is made to limit non-defense \n     discretionary spending in any future budget requests, funding \n     for nuclear modernization in the NNSA weapons activities \n     account will be considered on the same basis as defense \n     spending.\n       In closing, I thought it important for you to know that \n     over the last two days, my Administration has worked closely \n     with officials from the Russian Federation to address our \n     concerns regarding North Korea. Because of important \n     cooperation like this, I continue to hope that the Senate \n     will approve the New START Treaty before the 111th Congress \n     ends.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Barack Obama.\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, there has been a lot of discussion about \nmany things--and I will get to missile defense in just one moment--but \nI don't think there is anything, as it relates to nuclear issues, that \nthreatens our national security more than our not investing in the \narsenal we have. I think what we see is a commitment by appropriators \non the Senate side, the President of the United States, those within \nthe NNSA and our military complex who believe modernization has to \noccur.\n  Candidly, the only thing today that would keep us from actually doing \nmodernization the way it needs to be done would be Republican \nappropriators. So I just wish to say to my friends on this side of the \naisle, it seems to me, through Senator Kyl's efforts and the efforts of \npeople working in a cooperative way, we have been very successful in \ngetting the commitments we need on modernization.\n  By the way, I would add, I do not think we would be talking about the \nissue of modernization today--something that hasn't been done for many \nyears to this scale--if it were not for discussions of the START \ntreaty. So I say to the Chair, I think we have enhanced our country's \nnational security just by having this debate, and I would say we have \nsought and received commitments that otherwise we would not have \nreceived if it were not for the discussion of this treaty.\n  The two are very related. I have heard a lot of people say there is \nno real relationship between the two. There is a lot of relationship \nbetween the two, in that I think Americans want to know if we are going \nto limit ourselves to 1,550 warheads, that we know they operate, we \nknow they can be delivered, and we know the thousands of warheads we \nhave that are not deployed are warheads that will be kept up.\n  We have talked a lot about missile defense, and I just wish to say I \nhave been through every word of this treaty, I have been through every \nword of the annexes, I have been through every word of the protocols \nand I have been in countless briefings and there is nothing in this \ntreaty that limits our missile defense other than the fact that we \ncannot convert ICBM launchers that we use on the offense for missile \ndefense--something our military leaders do not want to do. That is the \nmost expensive way of creating a missile defense system. That is \nsomething they do not want to do.\n  So a lot of discussions have been brought up because in the preamble \nsomething was stated that was nonbinding. How do we clear that up? We \nclear that up by virtue of a letter the President has sent to us \nabsolutely committing to the missile defense system that is now being \ndeployed in Europe, absolutely committing to a national defense system. \nPeople might say: Well, but that is no commitment.\n  I have reasonable assurance that by the time this debate ends we will \ncodify, as part of the resolution of ratification, the operative words \nin the President's language committing to all four phases of our \nadaptive missile system in Europe, committing to those things we need \nto do as relates to our national defense system and making that a part \nof the resolution of ratification.\n  I would say to you that I doubt very seriously we would have received \nthe types of commitments, the strident commitments from the President \nas relates to missile defense today, if we were not debating this \ntreaty.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Lamar Alexander \nbe added as a cosponsor to my amendment, amendment No. 4904, dealing \nwith ensuring the President's language becomes a part of this \nresolution of ratification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, let me conclude by saying it is obviously \nup to us, as Senators. We are the ones who have the right and the \nresponsibility and the privilege to take up the types of matters we are \ntaking up today. It is up to us to do the due diligence, to have the \nintelligence briefings, to look at our nuclear posture reviews, to look \nat what this treaty itself says, and to look at what our force \nstructure is. That is our responsibility. It is up to each of us, the \n100 of us in this body, to decide whether we ratify this treaty. But I \nthink it is also at least interesting to get input from others.\n\n  One of the things our side of the aisle likes to do is we like to \nlisten to military leaders and what they have to say about issues \nrelating to the war--Afghanistan or Iraq--and certainly the issue of \nhow we enter into nuclear treaties with other countries.\n  I will ask to have printed in the Record a letter to Senator Kerry \nfrom the Joint Chiefs of Staff talking about their firm commitment for \nthe START treaty on the basis that it increases our national security.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this letter \ndated December 20 from ADM Mike Mullen, Chairman of our Joint Chiefs.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   Chairman of the\n\n\n                                        Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 20, 2010.\n     Hon. John F. Kerry,\n     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Mr. Chairman, Thank you for your letter of 20 December \n     asking me to reiterate the positions of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff on ratification of the New START Treaty and several \n     related questions.\n       This treaty has the full support of your uniformed \n     military, and we all support ratification. Throughout its \n     negotiation, Secretaries Clinton and Gates ensured that \n     professional military perspectives were thoroughly \n     considered. During the development of the treaty, I was \n     personally involved, to include two face-to-face negotiating \n     sessions and several conversations with my counterpart, the \n     Chief of the Russian General Staff, Gen Makarov, regarding \n     key aspects of the treaty.\n       The Joint Chiefs and I--as well as the Commander, U.S. \n     Strategic Command--believe the treaty achieves important and \n     necessary balance between four critical aims. It allows us to \n     retain a strong and flexible American nuclear deterrent that \n     will allow us to maintain stability at lower levels of \n     deployed nuclear forces. It helps strengthen openness and \n     transparency in our relationship with Russia. It will \n     strengthen the U.S. leadership role in reducing the \n     proliferation of nuclear weapons. And it demonstrates our \n     national commitment to reducing the worldwide risk of a \n     nuclear incident resulting from proliferation.\n       More than a year has passed since the last START inspector \n     left Russian soil, and even if the treaty were ratified by \n     the Senate in the next few days, months would pass before \n     inspectors could return. Without the inspections that would \n     resume 60 days after entry into force of the treaty, our \n     understanding of Russia's nuclear posture will continue to \n     erode. An extended delay in ratification may eventually force \n     an inordinate and unwise shift of scarce resources from other \n     high priority requirements to maintain adequate awareness of \n     Russian nuclear forces. Indeed, new features of the treaty's \n     inspection protocol will provide increased transparency for \n     both parties and therefore contribute to greater trust and \n     stability.\n       The Joint Chiefs and I are confident that the treaty does \n     not in any way constrain our ability to pursue robust missile \n     defenses. We are equally confident that the European Phased \n     Adaptive Approach to missile defense\n\n[[Page S10865]]\n\n     will adequately protect our European allies and deployed \n     forces, offering the best near- and long-term approaches to \n     ballistic missile defense in Europe. We support application \n     of appropriately modified Phased Adaptive Approaches in other \n     key regions, as outlined in the Ballistic Missile Defense \n     Review Report.\n       I can also assure you that U.S. senior military leaders \n     monitored very closely all provisions related to conventional \n     prompt global strike (CPGS) throughout the negotiation \n     process. During that process, the Russian Federation publicly \n     declared on several occasions that there should be a ban on \n     placement of conventional warheads on strategic delivery \n     systems. In the end, we agreed that any reentry vehicle \n     (nuclear or non-nuclear-armed) contained on an existing type \n     of ICBM or SLBM would be counted under the central limits of \n     the treaty. Importantly, the New START Treaty allows the \n     United States not only to deploy CPGS systems but also to \n     continue any and all research, development, testing, and \n     evaluation of such concepts and systems. It is true that \n     intercontinental ballistic missiles with a traditional \n     trajectory would be accountable under the treaty, but the \n     treaty's limits accommodate any plans the United States might \n     pursue during the life of the treaty to deploy conventional \n     warheads on ballistic missiles.\n       Further, the United States made clear during the New START \n     negotiations that we would not consider non-nuclear, long-\n     range systems, which do not otherwise meet the definitions of \n     the New START Treaty (such as boost-glide systems that do not \n     fly a ballistic trajectory), to be accountable under the \n     treaty.\n       Finally, I am comfortable that the Administration remains \n     committed to sustainment and modernization of the nuclear \n     triad and has outlined its plans to do so in the so-called \n     Section 1251 report to Congress, as well as a recent update \n     to that report and a letter from Secretary of Defense Gates \n     to Senator Lugar dated 10 December. Plans for sustainment and \n     replacement of current ICBMs, ballistic missile submarines, \n     heavy bombers, and air launched cruise missiles are in \n     various stages of development, in a process that will be \n     implemented over the next three decades and across multiple \n     administrations.\n       The Administration's proposed ten-year, $85B commitment to \n     the U.S. nuclear enterprise attests to the importance being \n     placed on nuclear deterrence and the investments required to \n     sustain it--especially given the country's present fiscal \n     challenges. The increased funding commitment, if authorized \n     and appropriated, allows the United States to improve the \n     safety, security, and effectiveness of our nuclear weapons \n     and develop the responsive nuclear weapons infrastructure \n     necessary to support our deterrent. I also fully support a \n     balanced Department of Energy program that sustains the \n     science, technology, and engineering base.\n       In summary, I continue to believe that ratification of the \n     New START Treaty is vital to U.S. national security. Through \n     the trust it engenders, the cuts it requires, and the \n     flexibility it preserves, this treaty enhances our ability to \n     do that which we in the military have been charged to do: \n     protect and defend the citizens of the United States. I am as \n     confident in its success as I am in its safeguards. The \n     sooner it is ratified, the better.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      M.G. Mullen,\n                                               Admiral, U.S. Navy.\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I would like to point out, too, just for \nclarification, if you look at the makeup of our Joint Chiefs--Admiral \nMullen, General Cartwright, General Schwartz, General Casey, Admiral \nRoughead--every single one of these gentlemen was appointed by a \nRepublican President. In addition to them, we have General Amos. My \nsense is, based on some of the comments he has made over the course of \ntime, he would have Republican leanings. But all of these people have \nfirmly stated their support for this treaty.\n  In closing, I will also ask unanimous consent that the statement of \nRobert Gates, again appointed by a Republican President, head of our \nDefense Department, where yesterday he said:\n\n       The treaty will enhance the strategic stability at lower \n     numbers of nuclear weapons, provide a rigorous inspection \n     regime including on-sight access to Russian missile silos, \n     strengthen our leadership role in stopping the proliferation \n     of nuclear weapons, and provide the necessary flexibility to \n     structure our strategic nuclear forces to best meet the \n     national security interests.\n       This treaty stands on its merits and its prompt \n     ratification will strengthen U.S. national security.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   [From the U.S. Department of Defense, News Release, Dec. 21, 2010]\n\n      Statement by Secretary Robert Gates on the New START Treaty\n\n       I strongly support the Senate voting to give its advice and \n     consent to ratification of the New START Treaty this week.\n       The treaty will enhance strategic stability at lower \n     numbers of nuclear weapons, provide a rigorous inspection \n     regime including on-site access to Russian missile silos, \n     strengthen our leadership role in stopping the proliferation \n     of nuclear weapons, and provide the necessary flexibility to \n     structure our strategic nuclear forces to best meet national \n     security interests.\n       This treaty stands on its merits, and its prompt \n     ratification will strengthen U.S. national security.\n\n  Mr. CORKER. There has been a lot of discussion about the role of the \nSenate in this ratification. There are a lot of things that go into the \nratification of a treaty. I have laid out a number of things we have \ndiscussed that are relevant to the ratification of this treaty.\n  As we move through a process such as this, I try to make sure all of \nthe t's are crossed and i's are dotted that can possibly be crossed and \ndotted to ensure that I, as a U.S. Senator, feel comfortable that the \ntype of agreement we are entering into is one that is in the best \ninterests of our country. I have done that over the last year working \non nuclear modernization. Again, my hat is off to Senator Kyl and his \ngreat leadership in that regard. I have done that over the course of \nthis last year as we have looked at missile defense. We spent \nincredible amounts of time in our committee making sure people on my \nside of the aisle had tremendous input into the resolution of \nratification. We have worked through to make sure that if we are going \nto have fewer warheads deployed--again, we have thousands more that are \nnot deployed--that we, in fact, can assure the American people that \nthey will operate, that they are actually there for our national \nsecurity.\n  The question for me and for all of us who care so deeply about our \ncountry's national security is, Will we say yes to yes? I firmly \nbelieve that signing this treaty, that ratifying this treaty, and that \nall the things we have done over the course of time as a result of this \ntreaty are in our country's national interest, and I am here today to \nstate my full support for this treaty. I look forward to its \nratification, and I hope many others will join me in that process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, before I begin the focus of my \nremarks and the reason I came to the floor, I wish to commend the \nSenator from Tennessee for his thoughtful remarks and what I think is a \nthoughtful and important position he is taking on the START treaty. I \nlistened with great interest, and I learned additional information \nabout the importance of putting this treaty in effect. I also \nacknowledge the Senator's concerns about missile defense, about \ntactical nuclear weapons, and the other concerns that have been raised \nin this very important and obviously historic debate on the floor of \nthe Senate. I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his leadership.\n\n\n                     Tributes to Retiring Senators\n\n                             Arlen Specter\n\n  I also wanted to associate myself with the remarks of Senator Bennet, \nthe Senator from Colorado, in regard to Senator Specter's farewell \naddress to the Senate. In particular, I think Senator Specter laid out \na thoughtful and comprehensive way we can change the Senate rules in \nthe upcoming 112th Congress in ways that respect the rights of the \nminority but also provide the Senate with some additional ways to do \nthe people's business.\n  I know the Presiding Officer spent significant time on finding a way \nforward for the Senate. I look forward to the debate that will begin \nwhen we convene in just a couple of weeks for the 112th Congress.\n\n\n                     Nomination of William Martinez\n\n  Let me turn to the reason I came to the floor initially, and that is \nto urge my colleagues to support an outstanding nominee to the Federal \nbench, Mr. William Martinez. Bill's story is an inspirational one, and \nI will share that with you in a moment, but I wanted to first talk \nabout why there is such an urgency to confirm this fine nominee.\n  The situation in our Colorado District Court is dire, and I don't use \nthat word lightly. There are currently five judges on the court and two \nvacancies, both of which are rated as judicial emergencies by the \nAdministrative Offices of the U.S. Courts. These five judges have been \nhandling the work of seven judges for nearly 2 years. It has\n\n[[Page S10866]]\n\nbeen over 3 years since our court had a full roster of judges.\n  I know the Presiding Officer is familiar with the need for a fully \nstocked Federal bench as a former attorney general.\n  There is even more to the story. In 2008, based on the significant \ncaseload in Colorado, the Judicial Conference of the United States \nrecommended the creation of an eighth judgeship on the Colorado \nDistrict Court.\n  This is a pressing situation, but I know it is not unique just to \nColorado. Of the 100 current judicial vacancies, 46 are considered \njudicial emergencies--almost half of those vacancies. I understand the \nSenate has confirmed just 53 Federal circuit and district court \nnominees since President Obama was elected, including the judges over \nthe last weekend. This is half as many as were confirmed in the first 2 \nyears of the Bush administration and represents a historic low, which, \nno matter who is to blame, is very detrimental to our system of \njustice.\n  Bill Martinez was nominated in February of this year, had a hearing \nin March, and was referred favorably by the Judiciary Committee to the \nfull Senate in April. So today his nomination has been sitting on the \nSenate's Executive Calendar for over 8 months.\n  I am not going to complain about partisan delays, although I know \nthis continues to plague the Senate. Instead, in hope that we might \nimprove the nomination process, I want my colleagues to hear the real \neffect of imposing these delays on nominees.\n  The people of Colorado deserve well-qualified justices, but what the \nSenate put Bill Martinez through should make each of us question where \nour priorities are--and I say that because, unlike other judicial \nnominees before the Senate, Bill Martinez' life has been turned upside \ndown because of this delay in his confirmation. While many other \nnominees--and I don't begrudge them this--continued their judicial \ncareers because they were sitting on the bench, he has essentially had \nto dismantle his law practice to avoid Federal conflicts and even limit \ntaking clients to ensure they continue to receive representation once \nhe is confirmed. Both his life and his livelihood have been put on hold \njust because he was willing to become a dedicated public servant. If we \ncontinue this record or this habit of needlessly delaying judicial \nnominations, we risk chasing off qualified nominees such as Bill \nMartinez.\n\n  His long and winding road began last year when Senator Bennet and I \nconvened a bipartisan advisory committee, chaired by prominent legal \nexperts in Colorado, to help us identify the most qualified candidates \nfor the Federal bench. The committee interviewed many impressive \nindividuals, and then, based on his life experience, his record of \nlegal service, and his impressive abilities, both Republicans and \nDemocrats on this panel together recommended Bill Martinez for a \nFederal judgeship. The President agreed and then subsequently nominated \nBill for the vacant judgeship I mentioned.\n  There is no doubt that being nominated for a Federal judgeship is a \nprestigious honor, but since being nominated, Senate delays have not \nonly affected Bill and his family, but those delays have sent a \ndiscouraging message to future nominees. Despite these disruptions the \nprocess has caused for Bill and the dangerous precedent his delay may \nhave set, I am relieved that the Senate is finally giving this \nqualified candidate the confirmation vote he deserves today.\n  I have spoken about his impressive intellect and experience on the \nfloor before, but in advance of my vote, I would like my colleagues to \nhear one more time why Bill Martinez was selected by the bipartisan \nadvisory committee for this judgeship.\n  In addition to being an accomplished attorney and a true role model \nin our community in Colorado, he has a personal story that captures \nwhat is great about America and highlights what can be accomplished \nwith focus, discipline, and extraordinary hard work.\n  Bill was born in Mexico City, and he immigrated lawfully to the \nUnited States as a child. He worked his way through school and college \nand toward a career in law, becoming the first member of his family to \nattend college. He received undergraduate degrees in environmental \nengineering and political science from the University of Illinois and \nearned his law degree from the University of Chicago.\n  As a lawyer, Bill has become an expert in employment and civil rights \nlaw. He first began his legal career in Illinois, where he practiced \nwith the Legal Assistance Foundation of Chicago, litigating several law \nreform and class action cases on behalf of indigent and working-class \nclients. For the last 14 years, he has been in private practice and \npreviously served as a regional attorney for the U.S. Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission in Denver.\n  As you can imagine, over the years Bill has been a very active member \nof the Denver legal community. During the 1990s, he was an adjunct \nprofessor of law at the University of Denver College of Law and has \nbeen a mentor to minority law students. He is currently vice chair of \nthe Committee on Conduct for the U.S. District Court for the District \nof Colorado, and he has been a board member and officer of the faculty \nof Federal Advocates.\n  Bill also sits on the board of directors of the Colorado Hispanic Bar \nAssociation, where he serves as the chair of the bar association's \nEthics Committee. More recently, he was appointed by the Colorado Bar \nAssociation to the board of directors of Colorado Legal Services and by \nthe chief justice of the Colorado Supreme Court to the Judicial Ethics \nAdvisory Board.\n  Like all of us, I believe in a strong, well-balanced court system \nthat serves the needs of our citizens. Bill Martinez will bring that \nsense of balance because of his broad legal background, \nprofessionalism, and his outstanding intellect. I am proud to have \nrecommended Bill, and I am certain that once confirmed he will make an \noutstanding judge.\n  Before I conclude, I did want to give special acknowledgment to my \ngeneral counsel, Alex Harman, who has worked night and day on this \nnomination. Alex has worked tirelessly to see that Bill Martinez \nreceives the vote he deserves, and I want to acknowledge him here on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  I ask my colleagues to give their full support to this extraordinary \ncandidate and vote to confirm his nomination to the Colorado District \nCourt as a new Federal judge.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I appreciate the words from the \nsenior Senator from Colorado. His comments about the delays in the \njudicial process here, the selection of Federal judges, the nomination \nand confirmation, are identical to the situation for so many of the \nrest of us. Very qualified people are put forward. At times, the White \nHouse, perhaps, didn't move as fast as we would like. But the delays on \nthese judges is pretty outrageous.\n\n\n                      Nomination of Benita Pearson\n\n  Judge Pearson, who sits as a U.S. magistrate in the Northern District \nCourt in Ohio, didn't have the same disruption in her life as soon-to-\nbe, I hope, Justice Martinez had, having a law practice to put aside \nand having to wrap it up and figure out all that, but she has waited \nsince February when Senator Leahy and his Judiciary Committee voted her \nout, had a wait of 9 months, almost 10 months, until we are about ready \nto confirm.\n  I speak perhaps in criticism of the other party but, more \nimportantly, how do we fix this so people are not dissuaded, \ndiscouraged from wanting to fill these very important jobs?\n  When I interview potential judicial candidates, I always ask them: \nAre you willing to put your life on hold for at least a year before you \ncan actually be confirmed and sworn in, if it gets to that?\n  All are surprised, some are shocked, and some walk away and say: Find \nsomebody else. That is going to start happening. So I thank the Senator \nfrom Colorado and his comments.\n  I rise in support of another very strong candidate for a Federal \njudgeship, the nomination of Magistrate Judge Benita Pearson to become \na judge in the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Ohio.\n  Magistrate Pearson will make an excellent addition to the bench. That \nis not just my opinion. She has tremendous support from the judges with \nwhom she serves today and whose ranks she will soon join. She knows \nthem from her work, obviously, as a\n\n[[Page S10867]]\n\nmagistrate. Judge James Carr, the chief U.S. district judge at the time \nof her nomination, lauded Judge Pearson as ``a splendid choice . . . \neminently well-qualified by intelligence, experience . . . and judicial \ntemperament.'' Judge Carr's successor, Solomon Oliver, who now is the \nchief U.S. district judge, is just as supportive of her nomination.\n  Support for that nomination extends throughout the State. The other \nday when I gave a few remarks in the wake of Senator Voinovich's \nfarewell address, I neglected to mention how much I appreciated Senator \nVoinovich's cooperation in the process of selecting candidates for \nnomination to the Federal bench.\n  Senator Voinovich and I did something, and I do not know if any other \nSenator in this body does this, any other pair of Senators--I do know \nnobody in Ohio has done this--I asked Senator Voinovich, as the Senator \nfrom the President's party--and, generally, by tradition, the Senator \nwho suggests nominees to the President--I asked Senator Voinovich to be \npart of the selection system with me. We chose 17 people. We chose 17 \npeople from northern Ohio to interview Southern District of Ohio \npotential judges, and 17 people in southern Ohio--central and southern \nOhio--to interview prospective judges for the Northern District.\n  These panels, one of them was a Republican majority, the other was a \ndemocratic majority, I believe, by one vote. These panels met, took \nthis job very seriously. Each of the 17 people was given the name of a \ncandidate, one of the people who was applying to interview, references \nand all that. Each candidate got an hour in front of the 17-member \ncommittee, this Commission we appointed, and were subjected, after \nfilling out a very lengthy questionnaire designed, again, bipartisanly \nby my predecessor, Republican Senator DeWine, in large part, to, after \nfilling out this questionnaire, testifying, spending an hour in front \nof this panel of 17 very distinguished judges, some who are lawyers, \nsome, I believe, former judges, all people who were very interested in \nthe Federal judiciary.\n  Anybody who came out of that had to have a strong supermajority \nrecommendation from the 17. I then interviewed the top three, made the \nselection, cleared it with Senator Voinovich, and brought the name \nforward.\n  That produced Judge Timothy Black, who has been confirmed, sits in \nthe Southern District. It also produced Judge Benita Pearson. A similar \nselection committee, not identical but a similar selection committee, \nenabled me, helped me come to the conclusion to reappoint a Bush \nappointee to the U.S. marshal's job in Cleveland, Pete Elliott, to \nappoint the first--to send to the President, nominate, and confirm the \nfirst female U.S. marshal in the Southern District of Ohio, Cathy \nJones, and then the first African-American U.S. attorney in Columbus, \nand a very qualified U.S. attorney in Cleveland.\n  So that is the process we have in Ohio to make sure we get the best \nqualified people. As I said, they put in a tremendous amount of time \nand energy, and I wish to thank those 17 members of each of those \nCommissions, the 34 people who served again from both parties, \nprominent jurists and lawyers and community activists, to come up with \nJudge Pearson and others.\n  Judge Pearson currently resides in Akron but was born in Cleveland. I \ngot a chance to meet her mother and many of her family and friends \nalmost 1 year ago when she testified before the Judiciary Committee. \nThey were understandably proud of her, her achievements, and the honor \nof her nomination, certainly, but I got the sense they were most proud \nof her as a daughter, as a sister, as a family member. Nobody knows us \nbetter than our family.\n  Judge Pearson earned her J.D. from Cleveland State University, her \nbachelor's degree from Georgetown. Before law school, she spent several \nyears as a certified public accountant. I asked her how being a CPA \nwould help her in the judiciary as a judge. She said you can tell \nstories with numbers. She smiled when she said it. She, clearly, had \nkind of thought through what this means to be a Federal judge and what \nqualifications she brings. Throughout her career, Judge Pearson has \nlitigated and presided over a range of criminal and civil matters, \nincluding housing, public corruption cases. In addition to her work as \na magistrate judge since 2008, her legal experience includes serving as \nan adjunct professor at Cleveland State's law school, 8 years as an \nassistant U.S. attorney in Cleveland, the Northern District, and \nseveral years in private practice.\n  If confirmed, Judge Pearson will become the first African-American \nwoman to serve as a Federal judge in Ohio. She will also be the only \nU.S. district judge in the Youngstown courthouse, which, because of \ndelays here, for no apparent reason, has lacked a judge since this past \nsummer.\n  Last year, at the Akron Bar Association's annual Bench-Bar luncheon, \nshe urged attorneys to improve in two ways: to be better prepared to \nlitigate their cases and to be more civil to one another. Good advice \nto this body and for all of us, I suppose, in our daily lives.\n  Judge Pearson's community service includes more than a decade of \nongoing work as a board member of Eliza Bryant Village. Eliza Bryant \nVillage is a multifacility campus, providing services for impoverished \nelderly citizens. It was founded and named after the daughter of a \nfreed slave.\n  The facility began simply as a nursing facility built to serve \nEliza's mother and other African Americans who had been turned away \nfrom nursing homes simply because of their race.\n  Judge Pearson's background as a prosecutor, as a private attorney, as \na CPA, and as a Federal magistrate make her uniquely qualified to serve \nas U.S. district judge. Members of the law enforcement and legal \ncommunity throughout northern Ohio have attested to Judge Pearson's \nability and impartiality. As a magistrate and prosecutor, she, of \ncourse, as I said, is supported by our State's senior Senator, \nRepublican George Voinovich. First assistant U.S. attorney, David \nSierlega, for example, called Judge Pearson ``an extremely hardworking \nbright lawyer'' with an exemplary track record in handling public \ncorruption cases.\n  When asked to describe the ``most significant legal activities'' she \nhas been engaged in, Judge Pearson replied: ``My most significant legal \nactivity has been my steadfast commitment to administering equal \njustice for all . . . the poor and the rich, the likable and unlikable \n. . . the first-time offender and the repeat offender.''\n  At the end of the day, it is this demonstrated commitment to equal \njustice, delivered after thorough consideration and fidelity to the \nlaw, that distinguishes Judge Pearson as an invaluable asset to Ohio's \njudicial system.\n  I urge my colleagues, this afternoon, to quickly confirm her in her \nnew position as U.S. district judge for the Northern District of Ohio.\n  I would close with thanking two people on my staff who have gone \nabove and beyond the call of duty: Mark Powden, my chief of staff, who \nhas, almost weekly, spoken with Judge Pearson, talking about the delays \nand what is going to get this back on track and how are we going to get \nher confirmed. I appreciate the work Mark Powden has done. And Patrick \nJackson in her office, who, while all this was going on, was getting \nmarried. He got married earlier this month, and he was doing that at \nthe same time as we were doing all this. I am grateful to both of them. \nI thank my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          littoral combat ship\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Navy's \nacquisition strategy to purchase 20 littoral combat ships, LCS.\n  The Navy's plan would allow 20 littoral combat ships to be awarded to \ntwo shipyards: Austal, which will build 10 ships in Mobile, AL, and \nLockheed Martin, which will build 10 ships in Wisconsin.\n  Under the new procurement strategy, our sailors will receive the \nships they need to operate in shallow waters and\n\n[[Page S10868]]\n\ncombat the threats of surface craft, submarines, and mines. These ships \nwill be used for a variety of security issues from sweeping for mines \nin coastal waters to fighting pirates and chasing drug smugglers. They \nare a needed asset for our Navy.\n  The Navy's dual acquisition plan, included in the continuing \nresolution, brings significant advantages to the LCS program.\n  Our Navy will receive this capability faster, bring assets into \noperational service earlier, and will assist the Navy in reaching a \n313-ship Navy sooner.\n  The LCS strategy will stabilize the program and the industrial base \nwith an initial award of 20 ships. This will sustain competition \nthroughout the life of the program.\n  It is critical to ensure that the capabilities of our naval fleet are \nthe very best and that our Armed Forces receive the equipment they need \nin executing future operations.\n  However, as the foundation of our ability to project force globally \nfor the next half century, we must obtain the best platform for the \ntaxpayer investment.\n  The LCS dual award does both.\n  The dual procurement of the LCS will bring tremendous cost savings to \nthe program that would not have been realized had the Navy moved \nforward with a down select of designs.\n  According to the Navy, the acquisition savings for a dual award is \nprojected to be $2.9 billion as measured against the President's fiscal \nyear 2011 request. Of these savings, approximately $1 billion is \ndirectly attributable to the dual award.\n  Acquisition decisions made in the near term will affect fleet \neffectiveness and operating costs for decades to come.\n  This is the best outcome for all involved. The Navy will be able to \nobtain the best solution for the taxpayer investment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the dual acquisition strategy \nincluded within the continuing resolution.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through the Chair to my friend from Alabama, \nwould it be agreeable to the Senator that I do a UC request so we can \nfind out what we are going to do?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would be pleased to yield to the \nmajority leader for that. And if I could ask consent to be recognized \nafterward. I would note I did have time set aside for these remarks.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I understand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Order Of Procedure\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2 p.m. \ntoday, all postcloture time be considered expired and that the second-\ndegree amendment be withdrawn; that no further amendments or motions be \nin order; that the Senate then proceed to vote on the Reid motion to \nconcur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 3082 with \namendment No. 4885; that upon disposition of the House message, the \nSenate proceed to executive session to consider Executive Calendar Nos. \n703 and 813; that all time under the order governing consideration of \nthe nominations be yielded back, except for 8 minutes to be divided 4 \nminutes on each nomination, equally divided and controlled between \nSenators Leahy and Sessions or their designees; that upon the use or \nyielding back of all time with respect to the two nominations, the \nSenate then proceed to vote on confirmation of the nominations in the \norder listed; that upon disposition of the nominations, the other \nprovisions of the order remain in effect, except that the Senate remain \nin executive session and there then be 4 minutes of debate, equally \ndivided and controlled between the leaders or their designees, prior to \nthe vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the New START treaty; that \nupon the use of the time, the Senate then proceed to vote on the motion \nto invoke cloture on the treaty; that after the first vote in this \nsequence, the second and third votes be limited to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Members have \nuntil 1:30 p.m. today to file any germane second-degree amendments to \nthe New START treaty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing Senator Sessions, Senator Harkin then be recognized, to be \nfollowed by Senator Voinovich for up to 20 minutes.\n  I say to my friend from Iowa, how much time--15 minutes.\n  Does that give us enough time to do all that? It appears it does. So \nSenator Harkin would be recognized for 15 minutes and then Senator \nVoinovich for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I was pleased to yield to the majority \nleader and just observe that although we do fuss a lot around here, \nmany things are done by agreement. Senator Reid has obviously talked \nwith the Republican leaders and reached this agreement on how we can \nproceed on some of these matters, and I was pleased to yield to him.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would say to my friend from Alabama, my \nfriend from Alabama and I do not always agree on the substantive \nissues, but there is no one more of a gentleman and easier to work with \nthan the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                     nomination of william martinez\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the President's \nnomination of Mr. William Martinez to the United States District Court \nfor Colorado. I will oppose the nomination, and I have several reasons \nfor doing so. He has a lot of good friends and people who respect him \nand like him, but we are trying to make a decision about a lifetime \nappointment to the federal district court. There are some concerns with \nthis nomination that are serious and, in particular, trends of the \nPresident to nominate individuals with judicial philosophies outside \nthe mainstream.\n  There is one reason in particular that concerns me about Mr. \nMartinez. It is his longtime affiliation with the American Civil \nLiberties Union and the questions we asked him about that were answered \ninsufficiently for me. We have had a number of ACLU nominations. I have \nsupported some and opposed others. The ACLU is a very leftwing \norganization. It seeks openly to defy the will of the American people \nin many lawsuits while at the same time they endeavor to undermine and \noppose traditions and institutions that make up the very fabric of our \nculture, our national identity, and who we are as a people, assuming \nthose things are insignificant and only pure philosophical approaches, \nas they have, of an extreme nature should guide our Nation.\n  Mr. Martinez has been a member of the ACLU in Colorado for nearly a \ndecade, and since 2006 served on its legal panel. In this role he \nreviews memorandum prepared by ACLU staff and attorneys and decides \nwhether to pursue litigation, a very significant post in that \norganization. Of course that is not disqualifying. One can be a member \nof an organization, even though some of us might not like it or agree \nwith the organization. But any nominee from a conservative organization \nwho takes extreme positions would certainly have to answer those \npositions and justify why they might take them. Likewise it is fair and \nappropriate to ask questions about this nominee and about this \norganization and whether the nominee agrees with them or why, if they \ndon't agree, they are a member.\n  A lot of people say they didn't agree with this position or that \nposition. I was left asking: Why are you a member? It is on their Web \nsite.\n  When asked about some of the positions on important issues, he failed \nto\n\n[[Page S10869]]\n\nclearly respond and repeatedly refused to answer questions in a direct \nand clear manner. For example, at his hearing I asked whether he agreed \nwith the ACLU's position that the death penalty was unconstitutional in \nall circumstances. He refused to answer. Instead he noted that the \nSupreme Court has held the death penalty constitutional, adding:\n\n       What my view would be as a sitting Federal district judge \n     is something that would be quite different from my views as a \n     personal citizen or an advocate or a litigant and member of \n     the ACLU.\n\n  I asked him whether he personally thinks the death penalty violates \nthe Constitution and whether he had ever expressed that view. He again \nfailed to answer, stating only that he had never expressed any view.\n  So I put the question to him again, and again he did not answer.\n  Let me stop and say why I think this is a very important issue. The \nConstitution was passed as a unified document with 10 amendments. The \nAmerican people ratified it. Some people, in recent years, have come up \nwith the ingenious idea that they could disqualify and eliminate the \ndeath penalty without a vote of the people, without the popular will to \nchange laws that exist all over the country. They decided they could \nchange it by finding something in the Constitution that would say the \ndeath penalty is wrong, and they reached out to the provision that says \nyou should not have cruel and unusual punishment. They said the death \npenalty is cruel and unusual and is unconstitutional, which is not \nsound. Let me be respectful.\n  Why is that not a sound policy? There are multiple references in the \nConstitution to a death penalty. It talks about capital crimes, taking \nlife without due process. it is in the Constitution. How could one say, \nwhen there are multiple provisions explicitly providing for the death \npenalty, how could we reach over here and take a position on cruel and \nunusual punishment which was designed to prevent people from being hung \non racks and tortured and that kind of thing? But that is the ACLU \nposition.\n\n  This nominee, who is going to be given a lifetime appointment, the \npower to interpret the Constitution on this very real issue of national \nimport that good lawyers know about, refused to state that the \nConstitution is clear, that the death penalty is legal.\n  In fact, I note parenthetically that every Colony, every State had a \ndeath penalty at the time, and so did the United States Government. \nSurely the people, when they ratified it, had no idea that somebody \ncoming along in 2000 would create the view that the Constitution \nprohibits the death penalty.\n  I also asked Mr. Martinez whether he agreed with the President's so-\ncalled empathy standard, but rather than state flatly that empathy \nshould play no role in decisionmaking, as did Justice Sotomayor when \nshe came up--she flatly said no, a judge has to be impartial; one \nshould decide it on the facts and the law, not on feelings--he said \nthat empathy ``can provide a judge with additional insight and \nperspective as to the intent and motivations of the parties appearing \nbefore the court.'' Empathy, to me, is far too much like politics, far \ntoo much like something other than law. It is certainly not law.\n  When a nominee such as Mr. Martinez, who has dedicated so much time \nand legal expertise to the ACLU, refuses to answer basic questions \nabout these issues, it is fair and appropriate to conclude that perhaps \nhe agrees with the other positions of the ACLU. I have done a little \nchecking on that.\n  What is this organization of which he is a member? Some people like \nthe position they take on this issue or that issue. But what overall \nare some of the policy and legal positions taken by the ACLU? Over the \nlast several decades it has taken positions far to the left of \nmainstream America and the ideals and values the majority of Americans \nhold dear. Roger Baldwin, the ACLU's founder, was openly vocal about \nhis support and belief in ``socialism, disarmament, and ultimately for \nabolishing the State itself as an instrument of violence and \ncompulsion.''\n  He was quoted as saying:\n\n       I seek social ownership of property, the abolition of the \n     profited class and sole control by those who produce wealth. \n     Communism is the goal.\n\n  Mr. Baldwin's influence and impact on the ACLU could not be \noverstated. As former ACLU counsel Arthur Hays says:\n\n       The American Civil Liberties Union is Roger Baldwin.\n\n  As I mentioned earlier, the ACLU opposes the death penalty under any \ncircumstances, even for child rapists. They filed a brief recently in \nKennedy v. Louisiana arguing that a State could not apply the death \npenalty to a child rapist regardless of the severity of the crime or \nthe criminal history unless the child died from his or her injuries. \nHere the defendant had raped his own 8-year-old stepdaughter and caused \nhorrific injuries that a medical expert said were the most severe he \nhad ever seen. The defendant had done the same thing to another young \ngirl within the family a few years earlier. Even President Obama, when \nthe case came before the Supreme Court, said he opposed that view. Yet \nPresident Obama continues to nominate a host of ACLU lawyers to the \nFederal bench and presumably has some sort of sympathy with the views \nthey have been taking.\n  In recent years, the ACLU has litigated on behalf of sex offenders, \nincluding suing an Indiana city on behalf of a repeat sex offender who \nwas barred from the city's park after he admitted stalking children who \nplayed there. Even though the convicted offender had admitted that he \nthought about sexually abusing the children in the park, the ACLU sued \nto give him full access to the park and the children. I agree with the \nmayor of the city who said:\n\n       Parents need to be able to send their children to a park \n     and know they are going to be safe, not being window shopped \n     by a predator.\n\n  I would hope all nominees would share this view rather than the \nACLU's position on the subject. Although many view the ACLU as a \nneutral defender of the Bill of Rights, the ACLU takes a very selective \nview of the rights it advocates.\n  That is just a fact. Otherwise, if they were defending the \nConstitution and what it says plainly, they would defend the \nconstitutionality of the death penalty. It should not take them 2 \nseconds to figure that out. They have an agenda.\n\n  As it explains on its Web site, the ACLU openly disagreed with the \nSupreme Court's landmark ruling in the Heller case--the right to keep \nand bear arms--in Washington because the ACLU does not believe the \nsecond amendment confers an individual right to keep and bear arms. \nWell, OK. So the lawyers might disagree on that. But if this \ninstitution, this ACLU, is so committed to constitutional rights and \nopposes the power of the State, why would they not read the plain words \nof the second amendment: The right to keep and bear arms shall not be \ninfringed. Why wouldn't they defend that individual right of free \nAmericans to be armed and oppose the power of the State to take away \nwhat has historically been an American right? I think it represents and \nreveals a political agenda as part of this organization.\n  It also has a selective view of what exactly is protected by the \nfirst amendment. It has done some good work on the first amendment, the \nACLU has, but it has gone to great lengths to limit freedom of \nreligion, as provided for in the first amendment, suing religious \norganizations and groups such as the Salvation Army and even \nindividuals and supported the removal of ``under God'' from the Pledge \nof Allegiance and ``in God we trust'' from our currency. It sued the \nVirginia Military Institute to stop the longstanding tradition of \nmealtime prayer for cadets. You do not have to bow your head if you go \nto lunch and somebody wants to have a prayer. Nobody makes you pray. \nBut if other people want to take a moment before they partake of their \nmeal and, say, acknowledge a bit of appreciation for the blessings they \nhave received, what is wrong with that? I do not believe it violates \nthe first amendment.\n  The Constitution says that you cannot establish a religion in \nAmerica, and we cannot prohibit the free exercise of religion either. \nThe establishment clause and the free exercise clause are both in that \namendment. But the ACLU only sees one. They see everything as an \nestablishment of religion.\n\n[[Page S10870]]\n\n  The ACLU has also argued for the removal of religious symbols and \nscriptures from national parks and monuments and cemeteries that have \nstood for years regardless of how innocuous they may be.\n  I am very surprised we do not have the ACLU filing a lawsuit to deal \nwith those words right over that door: ``In God We Trust.'' It won't be \nlong. They will want to send in gendarmes with chisels to chisel it off \nthe wall. It is an extreme view of the first amendment, and has never \nbeen part of what we understood the Constitution to be about. The \nreference in a public forum to a ``higher being'' is not prohibited by \nthe Constitution--except in the minds of some extremists.\n  So the ACLU has argued for the removal of all vestiges of Christmas, \ngoing so far as to sue school districts to bar them from having Santa \nClaus at school events and threatening to sue if Christmas carols are \nsung anywhere on school grounds. Give me a break.\n  In addition, the ACLU has sought to limit or remove the rights of \nchildren to salute the U.S. flag, recite the Pledge of Allegiance, and \nopenly pray.\n  It has sued the Boy Scouts--I am honored to have been an Eagle Scout \nat one time in my life--and government entities that have supported \nthis honorable institution. It has sued them.\n  It has fought for the rights of child pornographers and against \nstatutes seeking to stop its production and distribution or limit \nchildren's exposure to it. The ACLU absolutely not only opposes adult \npornography laws, they oppose laws that prohibit child pornography, \nwhich is where so much of the problem of pedophilia occurs.\n  The ACLU has sought to overturn the will of the people by challenging \nnumerous State laws that define marriage as between a man and a woman \nand has encouraged city mayors across the country to openly defy State \nlaw by granting same-sex marriage licenses, even in contradiction to \nlaw.\n  It has vehemently opposed the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, calling \nit ``a deplorable act of hostility unworthy of the United States \nCongress.'' That passed a year before I came here--not too long ago. It \njust said that if one State allows a marriage to be between members of \nthe same sex, another State would not be forced to acknowledge it and \nrecognize it. That is what the Defense of Marriage Act did, and it \npassed here not too many years ago.\n  The ACLU has consistently opposed all restrictions on abortion--all \nrestrictions--including partial-birth abortion, the Unborn Victims of \nViolence Act, and statutes requiring parental notification before a \nminor child can have an abortion. If they want to defend the innocent \nagainst wrongdoing, what about defending a child partially born whose \nlife is taken from them? The ACLU's extreme advocacy on abortion would \nforce even religious health care providers--doctors and nurses--to \nperform abortions as a condition of Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement \neligibility. A doctor could not say: I will treat you, but I don't do \nabortions. Oh, if you take Medicare or Medicaid money, then under the \nACLU's position, you would have to do so.\n  According to the ACLU:\n\n       There is no basis for a hospital to impose its own \n     religious criteria on a patient to deny [her] emergency care.\n\n  So this type of religious liberty is not, I think, what the Founders \nsaid. I do not think a hospital that is founded on personal values and \nhas certain moral values should be required to give them up as a \ncapitulation to State domination, which is what they were asking for \nactually, having the State be able to tell a hospital that did not \nbelieve in abortion.\n  What about other issues that may come up, such as end-of-life issues. \nHospitals ought to be able to have--and doctors and nurses should be \nable to have moral views about those matters and not do something they \nthink is wrong and not have to give up their practice or their hospital \nin order to comply with what this group thinks is the right way to do \nbusiness.\n  So those are some of the examples of the ACLU's out-of-the-mainstream \npoint of view. It is no secret that this administration shares this \nkind of legal reasoning. This is, of course, one of a long line of ACLU \nnominees whom we have seen, and this kind of reasoning and legal \nthought is well to the left of and out of touch with the American \npeople and, I think, for the most part, established law. It seeks to \nimpose its liberal progressive agenda any way it can, including by \nfiling lawsuits and having judges--unelected lifetime appointed judges \nwho have been popped through the Senate--ratify what the people who \nfiled the lawsuits want to achieve as a matter of policy, not being \nneutral umpires who adjudicate disputes and decide them narrowly but to \ntry to use the courts as a vehicle to advance an agenda. That is what \nhas really been at the core of the debate in recent years over judicial \nnominations.\n  So it is not surprising that many of the President's judicial and \nexecutive branch nominees have been deeply involved in the ACLU--many \nof them. For example, President Obama's first nominee, Judge David \nHamilton, who was confirmed to the Seventh Circuit last year, was a \nleading member of the Indiana Civil Liberties Union for 9 years, where \nhe served as a board member and its vice president for litigation. \nJudge Gerard Lynch, who now sits on the Second Circuit, was a \ncooperating attorney and member of the ACLU for 25 years. Judge \nRogeriee Thompson, who was confirmed to the First Circuit earlier this \nyear, had been a member of the ACLU for 10 years. Judge Dolly Gee, who \nnow sits on the District Court for the Central District of California, \nhad been a member of the ACLU for 9 years. Carlton Reeves, who was \nconfirmed two days ago to the Southern District of Mississippi, was a \nmember for 12 years and served as a board member.\n  Three of President Obama's most controversial judicial nominees have \nhad extensive involvement with the ACLU. Edward Chen, nominated to the \nNorthern District of California, was a staff attorney on staff and \nmember of the ACLU of Northern California for 16 years. Goodwin Liu, a \nprofessor, one of the most extreme nominees now pending, was nominated \nto the Ninth Circuit, already the most activist circuit in America. He \nwas a member of the board of directors of the ACLU of northern \nCalifornia for years. Jack McConnell, nominated to the district of \nRhode Island, was a volunteer lawyer for the ACLU as recently as last \nyear.\n\n  A number of nominees who were recently considered by the Judiciary \nCommittee also have significant ties to the ACLU. Amy Totenberg, \nnominated to the Northern District of Georgia, has been a member for 21 \nyears. Robert Wilkins, nominated to the District of DC, was also a \nmember. Michael Simon, nominated to the District of Oregon, has been a \nmember since 1986. He served on the lawyers committee and the board of \ndirectors and as its vice president for legislation and vice president \nfor litigation.\n  That is more than I thought when we started going back and looking at \nthis. I am sure less than 1 percent of the lawyers in America are \nmembers of the ACLU, but it seems if you have the ACLU DNA, you get a \npretty good leg up on being nominated by this President. It is clear \nthe President, our President, a community activist, a liberal \nprogressive, as his own friends have described him, and former law \nprofessor is attempting to pack the courts with people who share his \nviews and who will promote his vision of, as he has said about judges, \nwhat America ``should be.'' That was his phrase. He said, We want \njudges who help advance a vision of what America should be.\n  But that is not good. We all have visions of what America should be. \nI wish to see us be a more frugal nation, more local government, more \nindividual responsibility. I do not support cradle-to-grave government. \nHis vision is what? That we want judges on the bench promoting an \nagenda because they were picked by a President who shares that agenda? \nThat is not the classical American heritage of what judges should be \nabout. Judges should take the bench and they should attempt, as \nobjectively as they possibly can, having put on that robe and having \ntaken an oath to do equal justice to the poor and the rich, and to be \nnot a respecter of persons, but to analyze that case objectively and \ndecide it based on the law and the facts, not on their empathy and not \non what their vision of what America should be because it may not be \nwhat the people's vision is.\n  Democracy is undermined if a judge gets on the bench and feels that \nthey\n\n[[Page S10871]]\n\ncan promote visions. I have to tell my colleagues, they are not \nappointed to be vision promoters. They are appointed to decide the \nstrict matters of law and fact, to the best of the ability the Lord \ngives them.\n  We can't stand idly by and allow that heritage of law that benefits \nus so greatly, the American rule of law and the greatest strength this \nNation has, in my opinion, to be altered by promoting a Federal \njudiciary that is agenda oriented. Any individual--regardless of the \nposition to which they have been nominated, to what kind of court \nposition they are nominated to--who demonstrates unwillingness to \nsubordinate his or her personal views, religious, political, \nideological, social, liberal, or conservative. Conservatives can't \npromote their views, either--if they can't be faithful to the law and \nthe Constitution, they should not be on the bench.\n  I am not going to support such nominees and no Senator should support \nthem. I have given it a lot of thought. I know Mr. Martinez has had a \nlong affiliation with the ACLU. He refused to give clear answers to \nthese questions I posed to him. I am not convinced that those views, \nwhich I think are outside legitimate constitutional theory, have been \nobjected to and are not by Mr. Martinez--indeed, it appears he supports \nthem because he has not with clarity rejected a single one. He has not \nmade any defense to participating in an organization that openly \nadvocates these kinds of legal views.\n  We ask a lot of the nominees: Do you believe the Constitution \nprohibits the death penalty? They said, No. Even though they were part \nof an organization and some of them--a lot--have been confirmed and I \nhave voted for a number of them, but I am not able to vote for this \none.\n  I have to say this: We are paid to judge and to vote, and when it \ncomes down to some of the positions taken by the ACLU--let's take the \none that the Constitution prohibits the death penalty--are so extreme \nand are so nonlegal that if a person can't understand that, I have \nserious doubt that they can understand any other significant \nconstitutional principle.\n  Therefore, I have concluded I would not be able to support the \nnominee, although I respect my colleagues who think he will do well. I \ncertainly don't think he is a bad person. I think he is an able person \nwho has a wonderful background, but his legal history evidences an \napproach to law that I think is outside the mainstream and I will \noppose the nomination. We are not blocking a vote. We will allow him to \nhave his up-or-down vote and Senators will cast their vote based on how \nthey conclude it should be decided.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                            New START Treaty\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Senate's \ndeliberation of the New START treaty and the treaty's implications for \nour friends and allies in Eastern and Central Europe and, more \nimportantly, the national security of the United States.\n  On November 17, I came to the Senate floor to discuss my concerns \nabout the treaty and the President's reset policy. Following my \nremarks, I received a significant amount of feedback--some positive, \nsome critical--and throughout my deliberations on the treaty, my \nintention was to contribute to advancing this important debate in a \nmeaningful way.\n  First, I wish to make it clear I remain concerned about the direction \nof Russia in terms of its commitment to human rights and an effort to \nreassert its influence over what Russia considers Eastern and Central \nEurope, their sphere of influence--those countries I often describe as \nthe captive nations. One cannot ignore the statement of Vladimir Putin \nwhen he described the collapse of the Soviet Union as the greatest \ngeopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century.\n  Two years ago, after listening to Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey \nLavrov at the German Marshall Fund Forum in Brussels, I concluded that \nRussia's internal political dynamic suggested that its people were \ndeeply concerned by the growth in U.S. influence through NATO expansion \nand incursion into their part of the world. The Russian people, it \nseems, believed there was a post-Cold War promise, once the Iron \nCurtain came down, to not interfere in the region.\n  As one of the leaders in helping the captive nations movement and to \nthis day regretting the way our brothers and sisters in these countries \nwere treated during the postwar conferences at Yalta and Tehran--I must \nsay I never thought the wall would come down or their curtain torn, but \nonce it did, I did everything I could to ensure these newly \ndemocratized countries were invited to join NATO. In 1998, as chairman \nof the National Governors Association, I worked to get a resolution \npassed encouraging the United States to invite Poland, the Czech \nRepublic, and Hungary to join the alliance.\n  One of the proudest moments as a Senator was when I joined President \nBush, Secretary of State Powell, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, and \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Myers at the NATO summit \nin Prague on November 21, 2002. I was in the room when NATO Secretary \nGeneral Lord Robinson officially announced the decision to invite \nBulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia \ninto NATO. I mention all of this history for a simple reason. I don't \nthink there is a Member of the Senate more wary of the intentions of \nRussia toward the former captive nations than I.\n  So it brings me back to the subject of the treaty now pending before \nthe Senate. I take the Senate's constitutional advice and consent \nduties very seriously. Since the treaty was signed in April, I have \nattended numerous meetings and classified briefings on the treaty. I \nsuspect I have spent at least 10 to 12 hours on it. Since I last spoke \non this floor about the treaty in November, I have held additional \nconsultations with a number of former Cabinet Secretaries, ambassadors, \nand experts from the intelligence community, including former \nSecretaries of State Albright, Powell, and Rice, seeking their views \nabout the treaty's effect on our bilateral relationship with Russia, as \nwell as our relationship with our Eastern and Central European allies. \nWhile some of those I met with had concerns about specific technical \naspects of the treaty, I continually heard that we should ratify the \ntreaty.\n  I believe it is noteworthy that five former Republican Secretaries of \nState, including Kissinger, Shultz, Baker, Eagleburger, and Powell, in \na December 2, 2010 Washington Post opinion piece urged the Senate:\n\n       . . . to ratify the New START Treaty signed by President \n     Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. It is a modest \n     and appropriate continuation of the START I treaty that \n     expired almost a year ago.\n\n  These former Republican Secretaries of State described some of the \noutstanding issues with the treaty, but describe convincingly, in my \nopinion, why ultimately it is in our national interest to ratify the \ntreaty.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the op-ed piece from the \nWashington Post be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Dec. 2, 2010]\n\n              The Republican Case for Ratifying New START\n\n(By Henry A. Kissinger, George P. Shultz, James A. Baker III, Lawrence \n                  S. Eagleburger and Colin L. Powell)\n\n       Republican presidents have long led the crucial fight to \n     protect the United States against nuclear dangers. That is \n     why Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. \n     Bush negotiated the SALT I, START I and START II agreements. \n     It is why President George W. Bush negotiated the Moscow \n     Treaty. All four recognized that reducing the number of \n     nuclear arms in an open, verifiable manner would reduce the \n     risk of nuclear catastrophe and increase the stability of \n     America's relationship with the Soviet Union and, later, the \n     Russian Federation. The world is safer today because of the \n     decades-long effort to reduce its supply of nuclear weapons.\n       As a result, we urge the Senate to ratify the New START \n     treaty signed by President Obama and Russian President Dmitry \n     Medvedev. It is a modest and appropriate continuation of the \n     START I treaty that expired almost a year ago. It reduces the \n     number of nuclear weapons that each side deploys while \n     enabling the United States to maintain a strong nuclear \n     deterrent and preserving the flexibility to deploy those \n     forces as we see fit. Along with our obligation to protect \n     the homeland, the United States has responsibilities to \n     allies around the world. The commander of our nuclear forces \n     has\n\n[[Page S10872]]\n\n     testified that the 1,550 warheads allowed under this treaty \n     are sufficient for all our missions--and seven former nuclear \n     commanders agree. The defense secretary, the chairman of the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff and the head of the Missile Defense \n     Agency--all originally appointed by a Republican president--\n     argue that New START is essential for our national defense.\n       We do not make a recommendation about the exact timing of a \n     Senate ratification vote. That is a matter for the \n     administration and Senate leaders. The most important thing \n     is to have bipartisan support for the treaty, as previous \n     nuclear arms treaties did.\n       Although each of us had initial questions about New START, \n     administration officials have provided reasonable answers. We \n     believe there are compelling reasons Republicans should \n     support ratification.\n       First, the agreement emphasizes verification, providing a \n     valuable window into Russia's nuclear arsenal. Since the \n     original START expired last December, Russia has not been \n     required to provide notifications about changes in its \n     strategic nuclear arsenal, and the United States has been \n     unable to conduct on-site inspections. Each day, America's \n     understanding of Russia's arsenal has been degraded, and \n     resources have been diverted from national security tasks to \n     try to fill the gaps. Our military planners increasingly lack \n     the best possible insight into Russia's activity with its \n     strategic nuclear arsenal, making it more difficult to carry \n     out their nuclear deterrent mission.\n       Second, New START preserves our ability to deploy effective \n     missile defenses. The testimonies of our military commanders \n     and civilian leaders make clear that the treaty does not \n     limit U.S. missile defense plans. Although the treaty \n     prohibits the conversion of existing launchers for \n     intercontinental and submarine-based ballistic missiles, our \n     military leaders say they do not want to do that because it \n     is more expensive and less effective than building new ones \n     for defense purposes.\n       Finally, the Obama administration has agreed to provide for \n     modernization of the infrastructure essential to maintaining \n     our nuclear arsenal. Funding these efforts has become part of \n     the negotiations in the ratification process. The \n     administration has put forth a 10-year plan to spend $84 \n     billion on the Energy Department's nuclear weapons complex. \n     Much of the credit for getting the administration to add $14 \n     billion to the originally proposed $70 billion for \n     modernization goes to Sen. Jon Kyl, the Arizona Republican \n     who has been vigilant in this effort. Implementing this \n     modernization program in a timely fashion would be important \n     in ensuring that our nuclear arsenal is maintained \n     appropriately over the next decade and beyond.\n       Although the United States needs a strong and reliable \n     nuclear force, the chief nuclear danger today comes not from \n     Russia but from rogue states such as Iran and North Korea and \n     the potential for nuclear material to fall into the hands of \n     terrorists. Given those pressing dangers, some question why \n     an arms control treaty with Russia matters. It matters \n     because it is in both parties' interest that there be \n     transparency and stability in their strategic nuclear \n     relationship. It also matters because Russia's cooperation \n     will be needed if we are to make progress in rolling back the \n     Iranian and North Korean programs. Russian help will be \n     needed to continue our work to secure ``loose nukes'' in \n     Russia and elsewhere. And Russian assistance is needed to \n     improve the situation in Afghanistan, a breeding ground for \n     international terrorism.\n       Obviously, the United States does not sign arms control \n     agreements just to make friends. Any treaty must be \n     considered on its merits. But we have here an agreement that \n     is clearly in our national interest, and we should consider \n     the ramifications of not ratifying it.\n       Whenever New START is brought up for debate, we encourage \n     all senators to focus on national security. There are plenty \n     of opportunities to battle on domestic political issues \n     linked to the future of the American economy. With our \n     country facing the dual threats of unemployment and a growing \n     federal debt bomb, we anticipate significant conflict between \n     Democrats and Republicans. It is, however, in the national \n     interest to ratify New START.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I believe many of these experts remain \nconcerned, as do I, that a failure to ratify the treaty would be \nexploited by those factions in Russia who wish to revert back to our \nCold War posture. Such a failure could easily be used by those factions \nto play on Russian nationalism, which I fear, from what I have heard \nfrom some people, is bordering on paranoia. Since I last spoke about \nthe treaty, a number of our new NATO allies have come out and supported \nthe treaty because they believe the treaty's approval should help \nadvance other issues related to Russia, including the lack of \ncompliance with the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, tactical \nnuclear weapons, and cooperation on missile defense.\n  For example, during his recent visit to Washington, Polish President \nBronislaw Komorowski has stated he supports the treaty's ratification. \nAnd at a press conference at the conclusion of the NATO Lisbon Summit, \nHungarian Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi stated:\n\n       My country has a very special experience with Russia, and \n     also a special geographic location . . . We advocate \n     ratification of START. It is in the interest of my nation, of \n     Europe and most importantly for the transatlantic alliance.\n\n  During this press conference, Lithuania's Foreign Minister pointed \nout that he saw the treaty as a prologue to additional discussions with \nRussia about other forms of nuclear arms in the region such as tactical \nnuclear weapons. About three weeks ago, I received a call from \nPresident Zatlers, the President of Latvia, urging me: Mr. Senator, \nplease ratify the START treaty.\n  Still, as history has taught us, the United States must make clear in \nregard to our relationship with Russia that it will not be at the \nexpense of our NATO allies. Thus, I was pleased to see President Obama \nprovided the leaders of our Central and European allies public \nreassurance regarding the U.S. commitment to article V of the North \nAtlantic Treaty during the recent NATO summit in Lisbon which, by the \nway, was one of the best NATO summits I think that has been held in the \nlast dozen years. The President reaffirmed this commitment in his \nDecember 18, 2010 letter to the majority and minority leaders, and I \nhope that letter from the President has been circulated among my \ncolleagues. It is very clear on where the President stands.\n\n       This NATO Summit meeting in Lisbon last month underscore, \n     we are proceeding with a missile defense system in Europe \n     designed to provide full coverage for NATO members on the \n     continent, as well as deployed U.S. forces, against the \n     growing threat posed by the proliferation of ballistic \n     missiles.\n\n  I know that some of my colleagues are concerned with issues related \nto the treaty, including the modernization of our nuclear \ninfrastructure, missile defense, and verification, and I will discuss \neach of these issues to explain why I believe they have been adequately \naddressed.\n  First of all, as others have pointed out--and I reiterate--Senator \nKyl has made a valiant effort to ensure we modernize the U.S. nuclear \ninfrastructure. I have worked with Senator Kyl on reviewing the treaty. \nI believe his hard work has led to nuclear modernization receiving the \nattention it deserves. It is long overdue. I remember Pete Domenici \ntalking about the fact that we needed to do something about it and, \nfrankly, we ignored Senator Domenici.\n  In a December 1, 2010, letter to Senators Kerry and Lugar, the \nNational Lab Directors from Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, and Sandia \nstated:\n\n       We are very pleased by the update to the Section 1251 \n     report, as it would enable the laboratories to execute our \n     requirements for ensuring a safe, secure, reliable, and \n     effective stockpile under the Stockpile Stewardship and \n     Management Plan.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 December 1, 2010.\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     Hon. Richard Lugar,\n     Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Kerry and Ranking Member Lugar: This letter \n     is a joint response to the letters received November 30, \n     2010, by each of us in our current roles as directors of the \n     three Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security \n     Administration (NNSA) laboratories--Los Alamos National \n     Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and \n     Sandia National Laboratories.\n       We are very pleased by the update to the Section 1251 \n     Report, as it would enable the laboratories to execute our \n     requirements for ensuring a safe, secure, reliable and \n     effective stockpile under the Stockpile Stewardship and \n     Management Plan. In particular, we are pleased because it \n     clearly responds to many of the concerns that we and others \n     have voiced in the past about potential future-year funding \n     shortfalls, and it substantially reduces risks to the overall \n     program. We believe that, if enacted, the added funding \n     outlined in the Section 1251 Report update--for enhanced \n     surveillance, pensions, facility construction, and Readiness \n     in Technical Base and Facilities (RTBF) among other \n     programs--would establish a workable funding level for a \n     balanced program that sustains the science, technology and \n     engineering base. In summary, we believe that the proposed \n     budgets provide adequate support to sustain the safety, \n     security, reliability and effectiveness of America's nuclear \n     deterrent within the limit of 1550 deployed strategic \n     warheads established by the New START Treaty with adequate \n     confidence and acceptable risk.\n\n[[Page S10873]]\n\n       As we emphasized in our testimonies, implementation of the \n     future vision of the nuclear deterrent described by the \n     bipartisan Strategic Posture Commission and the Nuclear \n     Posture Review will require sustained attention and continued \n     refinement as requirements are defined and baselines for \n     these major projects are established. We appreciate the fact \n     that this 1251 update calls out the importance of being \n     flexible and the need to revisit these budgets every year as \n     additional detail becomes available.\n       We look forward to working with you and the Administration \n     to execute this program to ensure the viability of the U.S. \n     nuclear deterrent.\n           Sincerely,\n     Dr. George Miller,\n       Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,\n     Dr.Michael Anastasio,\n       Los Alamos National Laboratory,\n     Dr. Paul Hommert,\n       Sandia National Laboratories.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, a number of experts I have consulted \nwith have pointed out--and I have agreed with--the need for the \nPresident to provide public assurances regarding the U.S. commitment to \na robust missile defense system. So I was pleased with the President's \nletter to our leadership reiterating such support. Here I quote \ndirectly from the President's letter:\n\n       Pursuant to the National Missile Defense Act of 1999, it \n     has long been the policy of the United States to deploy as \n     soon as is technologically possible an effective National \n     Missile Defense system capable of defending the territory of \n     the United States against limited ballistic missile attack, \n     whether accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate.\n\n  With regard to the Russian assertion--and we have heard this--that \nthe treaty's preamble prohibits the buildup in missile defense \ncapabilities, the President has stated in very clear language that the \n``United States did not and does not agree with the Russian statement. \nWe believe the continued development and deployment of U.S. missile \ndefense systems, including qualitative and quantitative improvements to \nsuch systems, do not and will not threaten the strategic balance with \nthe Russian Federation. . . . we believe the continued improvement and \ndeployment of U.S. missile defense systems do not constitute a basis \nfor questioning the effectiveness and the viability of the New START \nTreaty, and therefore would not give rise to circumstances justifying \nRussia's withdrawal from the Treaty.''\n  Mr. President, as I have discussed, I know many of my colleagues have \nconcerns about the treaty. But after my own research and consultations \nwith current and former Secretaries of State and numerous foreign \npolicy experts, including many conservative experts, as well as \nyesterday's 3-hour closed session in the Old Senate Chamber, I support \nthis treaty and do not believe the concerns that we have heard from \nsome of our colleagues rise to the level at which the Senate should \nreject the treaty.\n  The President signed the treaty in April. It is now December, and we \nare coming up on 1 full year without any verification regime in place. \nI believe we should work to get this treaty done because these \nverification procedures are needed now. I am not the only one who \nbelieves this. I recently received a letter from Bulgaria's Ambassador \nto the United States, Elena Poptodorova. I have known her a long time \nand worked with her to get Bulgaria into NATO. She wrote:\n\n       A failure to swiftly ratify the treaty would mean \n     discontinuation of the verification regime that could result \n     in negative consequences in the nuclear disarmament, \n     especially taking into consideration the significant \n     strategic nuclear advantage of Russia.\n       In my view, it will also put at risk the future cooperation \n     with Russia and will impede the negotiations on priorities, \n     such as conventional forces and tactical nuclear weapons in \n     Europe. It is of utmost importance that Russia be kept at the \n     negotiating table beyond the scope of the New START Treaty, \n     in particular on issues like Iran, Afghanistan and other \n     global security challenges.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that her letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    Embassy of the\n\n\n                                         Republic of Bulgaria,\n\n                                  Washington DC, December 6, 2010.\n       Dear Senator Voinovich: I am writing to you on an urgent \n     note regarding the pending ratification of the New START.\n       Firstly, I would like to reiterate the strong support of \n     the Bulgarian government for the treaty. As you may know, \n     already on the margins of the NATO Summit, the Bulgarian \n     Foreign Minister Nickolay Mladenov, together with his \n     colleagues from Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary and \n     Norway, explicitly pointed out that the treaty is in the \n     interest of European and global security. I firmly believe \n     that it is indeed key to the national security interest of \n     each country as well as to the stability of the transatlantic \n     alliance.\n       Secondly, Bulgaria shares the assessment that the treaty \n     allows the United States to maintain an effective and robust \n     nuclear deterrent and to keep modernizing its nuclear weapons \n     complex. It is crucial that it does not put any constraints \n     on the US missile defense programs and allows for the \n     deployment of effective missile systems.\n       Furthermore, a failure to swiftly ratify the treaty would \n     mean discontinuation of the verification regime that could \n     result in negative consequences in the nuclear disarmament \n     especially taking into consideration the significant \n     strategic nuclear advantage of Russia. In my view, it will \n     also put at risk the future cooperation with Russia and will \n     impede the negotiations on priorities such as conventional \n     forces and tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. It is of \n     utmost importance that Russia be kept at the negotiating \n     table beyond the scope of the New START, in particular on \n     issues like Iran, Afghanistan and other global security \n     challenges.\n       I strongly urge you, dear Senator, to consider the \n     arguments above and act in favor of a swift ratification of \n     the New START. The new treaty is yet another step toward \n     guaranteeing our common security and the United States \n     leadership is absolutely essential in this respect.\n       I trust I will be taken in good faith.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Elena Poptodorova,\n                                                       Ambassador.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I also bring to my colleagues' \nattention a July 14, 2010, letter to Senators Levin, Kerry, McCain, and \nLugar, from former commanders of the Strategic Air Command and U.S. \nStrategic Command. Again, I hope my colleagues will read that letter. \nThey list three reasons for support of the treaty. I quote from their \nsecond and third reasons:\n\n       The New START Treaty contains verification and transparency \n     measures--such as data exchanges, periodic dated updates, \n     notification, unique identifiers on strategic systems, some \n     access to telemetry and onsite inspections--that will give us \n     important insights into Russian strategic nuclear forces and \n     how they operate those forces.\n       We will understand Russian strategic nuclear forces much \n     better with the treaty that would be the case without it.\n\n  These former military commanders go on to state that the U.S. nuclear \narmaments--again, I think this is for all of us as American people to \nrealize--``will continue to be a formidable force that will ensure \ndeterrence and give the President, should it be necessary, a broad \nrange of military options.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that letter sent to the Foreign Relations \nCommittee be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 14, 2010.\n     Senator Carl Levin,\n     Chairman,\n     Senate Armed Services Committee.\n     Senator John F. Kerry,\n     Chairman,\n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n     Senator John McCain,\n     Ranking Member,\n     Senate Armed Services Committee.\n     Senator Richard G. Lugar,\n     Ranking Member,\n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n       Gentlemen: As former commanders of Strategic Air Command \n     and U.S. Strategic Command, we collectively spent many years \n     providing oversight, direction and maintenance of U.S. \n     strategic nuclear forces and advising presidents from Ronald \n     Reagan to George W. Bush on strategic nuclear policy. We are \n     writing to express our support for ratification of the New \n     START Treaty. The treaty will enhance American national \n     security in several important ways.\n       First, while it was not possible at this time to address \n     the important issues of non-strategic weapons and total \n     strategic nuclear stockpiles, the New START Treaty sustains \n     limits on deployed Russian strategic nuclear weapons that \n     will allow the United States to continue to reduce its own \n     deployed strategic nuclear weapons. Given the end of the Cold \n     War, there is little concern today about the probability of a \n     Russian nuclear attack. But continuing the formal strategic \n     arms reduction process will contribute to a more productive \n     and safer relationship with Russia.\n       Second, the New START Treaty contains verification and \n     transparency measures--such as data exchanges, periodic data \n     updates, notifications, unique identifiers on strategic \n     systems, some access to telemetry and on-site inspections--\n     that will give us important insights into Russian strategic \n     nuclear forces and how they operate those forces. We will \n     understand Russian strategic forces much better with the \n     treaty than\n\n[[Page S10874]]\n\n     would be the case without it. For example, the treaty permits \n     on-site inspections that will allow us to observe and confirm \n     the number of warheads on individual Russian missiles; we \n     cannot do that with just national technical means of \n     verification. That kind of transparency will contribute to a \n     more stable relationship between our two countries. It will \n     also give us greater predictability about Russian strategic \n     forces, so that we can make better-informed decisions about \n     how we shape and operate our own forces.\n       Third, although the New START Treaty will require U.S. \n     reductions, we believe that the post-treaty force will \n     represent a survivable, robust and effective deterrent, one \n     fully capable of deterring attack on both the United States \n     and America's allies and partners. The Department of Defense \n     has said that it will, under the treaty, maintain 14 Trident \n     ballistic missile submarines, each equipped to carry 20 \n     Trident D-5 submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). As \n     two of the 14 submarines are normally in long-term \n     maintenance without missiles on board, the U.S. Navy will \n     deploy 240 Trident SLBMs. Under the treaty's terms, the \n     United States will also be able to deploy up to 420 Minuteman \n     III intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and up to 60 \n     heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments. That will \n     continue to be a formidable force that will ensure deterrence \n     and give the President, should it be necessary, a broad range \n     of military options.\n       We understand that one major concern about the treaty is \n     whether or not it will affect U.S. missile defense plans. The \n     treaty preamble notes the interrelationship between offense \n     and defense; this is a simple and long-accepted reality. The \n     size of one side's missile defenses can affect the strategic \n     offensive forces of the other. But the treaty provides no \n     meaningful constraint on U.S. missile defense plans. The \n     prohibition on placing missile defense interceptors in ICBM \n     or SLBM launchers does not constrain us from planned \n     deployments.\n       The New START Treaty will contribute to a more stable U.S.-\n     Russian relationship. We strongly endorse its early \n     ratification and entry into force.\n           Sincerely,\n     General Larry Welch,\n       USAF, Ret.\n     General John Chain,\n       USAF, Ret.\n     General Lee Butler,\n       USAF, Ret.\n     Admiral Henry Chiles,\n       USN, Ret.\n     General Eugene Habiger,\n       USAF, Ret.\n     Admiral James Ellis,\n       USN, Ret.\n     General Bennie Davis,\n       USAF, Ret.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a September 7, 2010, opinion piece from the Wall \nStreet Journal by former Secretary of State George Shultz, who served \nunder President Reagan. I think all of us who are familiar with George \nShultz's record have high respect and regard for him.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 7, 2010]\n\n                Learning From Experience on Arms Control\n\n                         (By George P. Shultz)\n\n       The New Start treaty provides an instructive example of \n     how, when everyone works at it, an important element of arms \n     control treaties can be improved by building on past treaties \n     and their execution.\n       I remember well the treaty on Intermediate-Range Nuclear \n     Forces (INF), as I had a hand in negotiating the treaty and \n     in getting implementation started. Our mantra was stated \n     almost endlessly by President Ronald Reagan, to the point \n     that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev would join in: ``Trust \n     but verify.''\n       Reagan insisted on, and we obtained, on-site inspection of \n     the critical elements in the treaty: the destruction of all \n     missiles and a method of ensuring that new ones were not \n     produced. This critical element in the treaty built on an \n     earlier one. The Stockholm Agreement of 1986 was the first \n     U.S.-Soviet agreement to call for on-site observation of \n     military maneuvers. Although not as intrusive as a close look \n     at nuclear facilities, it was, nevertheless an important \n     conceptual breakthrough. The idea of on-site inspection had \n     been accepted and put in practice.\n       When the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start) was \n     negotiated and finally signed in 1991, a different problem \n     presented itself. On-site inspection of missile destruction \n     is one thing; on-site inspection of an active inventory is \n     something else again. You are looking at an ongoing \n     operation. Nevertheless, the challenge was met in part by \n     counting delivery vehicles, clearly building on the \n     successful experience of both sides with the INF treaty.\n       However, the political relations between the United States \n     and the then Soviet Union had not yet reached the level of \n     cooperation required to count the number of actual warheads \n     directly without concern about compromising secret design \n     information. The result was a process of attribution derived \n     from access to telemetry--that is, the data transmitted from \n     flight tests of missiles. This allowed for a cap on the \n     maximum number of warheads that could be delivered, which was \n     the number attributed in Start.\n       Periodic on-site inspections of the missile sites were \n     provided for under Start, but the experience of both sides \n     was that this process, conducted in a fragmented way, \n     disrupted normal operations and so was unnecessarily \n     burdensome to both sides.\n       The Strategic Offensive Reduction Treaty (SORT), negotiated \n     in 2002 under the George W. Bush administration, simply \n     relied on the Start verification regime. In a joint \n     declaration, President Bush and President Vladimir Putin \n     agreed on the desirability of greater transparency, but they \n     left it at that.\n       Along came the New Start treaty, signed by President Barack \n     Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on April 8, 2010. \n     People responsible for monitoring the original Start treaty \n     were included in the negotiations, so operating experience \n     was present at the table. The result was a further advance, \n     building on the transparency measures already in place under \n     the Start treaty. On-site inspection now allows the total \n     number of warheads on deployed missiles literally to be \n     counted directly.\n       Thus, up-close observation is substituted for the telemetry \n     that was essential in the original Start treaty. But some \n     cooperation in sharing telemetry information was included in \n     the New Start treaty. This provides some additional \n     transparency and can serve, over time, as a confidence-\n     building measure. It is well that some telemetry cooperation \n     will occur so that the principle is retained.\n       The New Start treaty, like others before it, was built on \n     previous experience. And, like earlier treaties, it provides \n     a building block for the future. As lower levels of warheads \n     are negotiated, the importance of accurate verification \n     increases and the precedent and experience derived from New \n     Start will ensure that a literal counting process will be \n     available. The New Start treaty also sets a precedent for the \n     future in its provision for on-site observation of \n     nondeployed nuclear systems--important since limits on \n     nondeployed warheads will be a likely next step.\n       The problem of interruptions in operations posed by the \n     original Start treaty and identified by the executors of the \n     treaty on both sides is addressed in the New Start treaty in \n     a way that gives more information but is less disruptive. \n     First of all, a running account in the form of regular data \n     exchanges is provided every six months on a wide range of \n     information about their strategic forces, and numerous \n     inspection procedures have been consolidated.\n       The United States will have the right to select, for \n     purposes of inspection, from all of Russia's treaty-limited \n     deployed and nondeployed delivery vehicles and launchers at \n     the rate of 18 inspections per year over the life of New \n     Start. It is also important that each deployed and \n     nondeployed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) or \n     submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) or heavy bomber \n     will have assigned to it a unique code identifier that will \n     be included in notifications any time the ICBM or SLBM or \n     heavy bomber is moved or changes status. The treaty \n     establishes procedures to allow inspectors to confirm the \n     unique identifier during the inspection process.\n       The notification of changes in weapon systems--for example, \n     movement in and out of deployed status--will provide more \n     information on the status of Russian strategic forces under \n     this treaty than was available under Start. Information \n     provided in notifications will complement and be checked by \n     on-site inspection as well as by imagery from satellites and \n     other assets which collectively make up each side's national \n     technical means of verification.\n       Having been involved in the Stockholm Treaty when a \n     breakthrough in on-site inspection was made and when \n     intrusive on-site inspection of key events was a main element \n     of the INF Treaty, I am pleased to see that the building \n     process is continuing, especially since the New Start treaty \n     includes some improved formulations that bode well for the \n     future. Seeing is not quite believing, but it helps. Learning \n     is not limited to what you get from experience, but it helps.\n       The original Start treaty expired last December. The time \n     has come to start seeing again, with penetrating eyes, and to \n     start learning from the new experience.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. In his piece, the Secretary discusses the importance \nof verification and closes with this thought:\n\n       The original START Treaty expired last December. The time \n     has come to start seeing again, with penetrating eyes, and to \n     start learning from the new experience.\n\n  In other words, the provisions in terms of verification are new \ncompared to the old START treaty.\n  Finally, I ask my colleagues to take note of Secretary Rice's \nstatement that ``the treaty helpfully reinstates onsite verification of \nRussian nuclear forces, which lapsed with the expiration of the \noriginal START treaty last year. Meaningful verification was a \nsignificant achievement of Presidents\n\n[[Page S10875]]\n\nReagan and George H.W. Bush, and its reinstatement is crucial.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that her article in the Wall Street Journal \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 7, 2010]\n\n                    New Start: Ratify, With Caveats\n\n                         (By Condoleezza Rice)\n\n       When U.S. President Bush and Russian President Putin signed \n     the Moscow Treaty in 2002, they addressed the nuclear threat \n     by reducing offensive weapons, as their predecessors had. But \n     the Moscow Treaty was different. It came in the wake of \n     America's 2001 withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile \n     Treaty of 1972, and for the first time the United States and \n     Russia reduced their offensive nuclear weapons with no \n     agreement in place that constrained missile defenses.\n       Breaking the link between offensive force reductions and \n     limits on defense marked a key moment in the establishment of \n     a new nuclear agenda no longer focused on the Cold War face-\n     off between the Warsaw Pact and NATO. The real threat was \n     that the world's most dangerous weapons could end up in the \n     hands of the world's most dangerous regimes--or of terrorists \n     who would launch attacks more devastating than 9/11. And \n     since those very rogue states also pursued ballistic \n     missiles, defenses would (alongside offensive weapons) be \n     integral to the security of the United States and our allies.\n       It is in this context that we should consider the potential \n     contribution of the New Start treaty to U.S. national \n     security. The treaty is modest, reducing offensive nuclear \n     weapons to 1,550 on each side--more than enough for \n     deterrence. While the treaty puts limits on launchers, U.S. \n     military commanders have testified that we will be able to \n     maintain a triad of bombers, submarine-based delivery \n     vehicles and land-based delivery vehicles. Moreover, the \n     treaty helpfully reinstates on-site verification of Russian \n     nuclear forces, which lapsed with the expiration of the \n     original Start treaty last year. Meaningful verification was \n     a significant achievement of Presidents Reagan and George \n     H.W. Bush, and its reinstatement is crucial.\n       Still, there are legitimate concerns about New Start that \n     must and can be addressed in the ratification process and, if \n     the treaty is ratified, in future monitoring of the Obama \n     administration's commitments.\n       First, smaller forces make the modernization of our nuclear \n     infrastructure even more urgent. Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona has \n     led a valiant effort in this regard. Thanks to his efforts, \n     roughly $84 billion is being allocated to the Department of \n     Energy's nuclear weapons complex. Ratifying the treaty will \n     help cement these commitments, and Congress should fully fund \n     the president's program. Congress should also support the \n     Defense Department in modernizing our launchers as suggested \n     in the recent defense strategy study coauthored by former \n     Secretary of Defense Bill Perry and former National Security \n     Adviser Stephen Hadley.\n       Second, the Senate must make absolutely clear that in \n     ratifying this treaty, the U.S. is not re-establishing the \n     Cold War link between offensive forces and missile defenses. \n     New Start's preamble is worrying in this regard, as it \n     recognizes the ``interrelationship'' of the two. \n     Administration officials have testified that there is no \n     link, and that the treaty will not limit U.S. missile \n     defenses. But Congress should ensure that future Defense \n     Department budgets reflect this.\n       Moscow contends that only current U.S. missile-defense \n     plans are acceptable under the treaty. But the U.S. must \n     remain fully free to explore and then deploy the best \n     defenses--not just those imagined today. That includes \n     pursuing both potential qualitative breakthroughs and \n     quantitative increases.\n       I have personally witnessed Moscow's tendency to interpret \n     every utterance as a binding commitment. The Russians need to \n     understand that the U.S. will use the full-range of American \n     technology and talent to improve our ability to intercept and \n     destroy the ballistic missiles of hostile countries.\n       Russia should be reassured by the fact that its nuclear \n     arsenal is far too sophisticated and large to be degraded by \n     our missile defenses. In addition, the welcome agreements on \n     missile-defense cooperation reached in Lisbon recently \n     between NATO and Russia can improve transparency and allow \n     Moscow and Washington to work together in this field. After \n     all, a North Korean or Iranian missile is not a threat only \n     to the United States, but to international stability broadly.\n       Ratification of the treaty also should not be sold as a way \n     to buy Moscow's cooperation on other issues. The men in the \n     Kremlin know that loose nukes in the hands of terrorists--\n     some who operate in Russia's unstable south--are dangerous. \n     That alone should give our governments a reason to work \n     together beyond New Start and address the threat from \n     tactical nuclear weapons, which are smaller and more \n     dispersed, and therefore harder to monitor and control. \n     Russia knows too that a nuclear Iran in the volatile Middle \n     East or the further development of North Korea's arsenal is \n     not in its interest. Russia lives in those neighborhoods. \n     That helps explain Moscow's toughening stance toward Tehran \n     and its longstanding concern about Pyongyang.\n       The issue before the Senate is the place of New Start in \n     America's future security. Nuclear weapons will be with us \n     for a long time. After this treaty, our focus must be on \n     stopping dangerous proliferators--not on further reductions \n     in the U.S. and Russian strategic arsenals, which are really \n     no threat to each other or to international stability.\n       A modern but smaller nuclear arsenal and increasingly \n     sophisticated defenses are the right bases for U.S. nuclear \n     security (and that of our allies) going forward. With the \n     right commitments and understandings, ratification of the New \n     Start treaty can contribute to this goal. If the Senate \n     enters those commitments and understandings into the record \n     of ratification, New Start deserves bipartisan support, \n     whether in the lame-duck session or next year.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, in my opinion, the jury has returned \nits verdict, and the overwhelming evidence is that the Senate should \nratify the treaty. Support for the treaty should not be viewed through \nthe lens of being liberal or conservative, Republican or Democrat, but \nrather what is in the best interest of our national security, the best \ninterest of the United States of America, the best interest of our \nrelationships with those countries who share our values and understand \nthat nuclear proliferation is the greatest international threat to our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this treaty. I am \nprayerful that we have a good vote for it to demonstrate that we have \ncome together on a bipartisan basis to do something that needs to be \ndone, and something that liberals, conservatives, Republicans and \nDemocrats, can come together on to make a difference for the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, very shortly, the Senate will be voting on \nthe continuing resolution that will fund the operations of our Federal \nGovernment through March--I think, if I am not mistaken, through March \n4. I want to take this time to take a look at what happened recently \nwith our appropriations bill, the so-called omnibus bill, that was \ndefeated by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  Again, without getting into who caused what and did what to whom \nfirst, which is a game we play a lot around here, the fact remains that \nnone of our appropriations bills were passed this year, even though our \nsubcommittees on appropriations passed out all of our bills. We passed \nthem through the Appropriations Committee and brought them to the \nSenate for consideration, but they were not taken up on the floor. \nAgain, we can go into all the reasons why yes, why no. But that is \nwater over the dam. The fact is, they weren't; therefore, they weren't \npassed.\n  At the end of the year, a week ago, Leader Reid wanted to put \ntogether all the bills that had been passed out of committee with both \nRepublican and Democratic support. Of the 13 bills--and I could be a \nlittle mistaken--only 1 or 2 had any minor changes or votes against \nthem in committee. They were almost all unanimous by Republicans and \nDemocrats.\n  So to keep the government going, we had this omnibus--in other words, \nputting all the bills together in one package and passing that. My \nfriends objected to that. Because that was objected to, we now face \nhaving a continuing resolution to continue the funding from last year \non into fiscal year 2011 until March.\n  When the Republicans killed this Omnibus appropriations bill last \nweek, certain things happened. For example, they chose to close Head \nStart classrooms that serve 65,000 low-income children. By killing the \nomnibus, my friends on the other side of the aisle decided to cut \nchildcare subsidies for 100,000 low-income working families. They \nrejected the opportunity to provide lifesaving drugs to people living \nwith AIDS, who are on waiting lists for lifesaving medication. They \npassed on the chance to provide 4\\1/2\\ million more meals to seniors in \nneed.\n  All of these programs would have received badly needed increases in \nthe appropriations bill, but my friends on the other side of the aisle \nsaid no. They insisted on just keeping the present funding until March.\n  Here is another result of killing the omnibus: Millions of American \nstudents who receive Pell grants--low-income students--to go to college \nno\n\n[[Page S10876]]\n\nlonger know if they will be able to afford college next year.\n  We cannot let that happen. The continuing resolution we will vote for \nin a few minutes includes a provision that would close the so-called \nPell grant shortfall and ensure there is no cut to the Pell grants to \nour poor students.\n  The Pell Grant Program is the backbone of our Nation's financial aid \nsystem. More than 9 million low-income students and middle-income \nstudents use these grants toward a postsecondary education or \nvocational training.\n  People might say: Why has the Pell grant grown so much over the last \nfew months? When the economy is bad, more people tend to go to college \nand more people in lower income brackets tend to go to college and try \nto better themselves. That means the cost of providing Pell grants goes \nup, even when the maximum Pell grant award a person can receive stays \nthe same.\n  Right now, the maximum Pell grant award is $5,550 a year. Nearly 90 \npercent of the students who receive that level come from families whose \nannual income is less than $40,000 for a family of four. Without Pell, \nmost of them would have no chance of receiving a postsecondary \neducation. This is truly a program for low-income students and families \nseeking to better themselves.\n  The omnibus bill that was killed last week would have provided the \nadditional funding to close that shortfall, to keep the maximum grant \nat $5,550. That was $5.7 billion. Again, that money did not just fall \nfrom the sky. Other programs across the Federal Government were cut to \noffset that spending. We appropriators decided that maintaining Pell \nwas so important that it was worth reducing or eliminating other \nprograms, which we did.\n  When my friends on the other side killed the omnibus, they put the \nPell Grant Program in jeopardy and endangered the future of millions of \ndisadvantaged students. According to the recent estimates from OMB, if \nwe do not close the Pell shortfall before February, the maximum award \nwill drop by $1,840, and the Pell grants of all those students with a \nfamily income of less than $40,000 will fall by 33 percent--from $5,550 \nto $3,710 next school year. An estimated 435,000 students who currently \nreceive Pell grants would get nothing, zero. Their entire grant would \nbe cut off. Why do I say that? Because if the award drops by $1,840, if \nyour Pell grant was $1,800, you get nothing. So 435,000 students will \nget no Pell grants whatsoever. That is the situation facing students \nall over the country today.\n  We are 4 days away from Christmas. More than 9 million students who \ndepend on Pell grants do not know if their financial aid will be \ndrastically cut or if they will get any financial aid at all. \nHopefully, in about 10 minutes, we are going to change that because I \nam hopeful we will all join together today in supporting this \ncontinuing resolution because as a part of the continuing resolution, \nwe close that Pell grant shortfall so we can undo or redo what was \nundone by not taking up the omnibus bill.\n  We can keep the government running, but we can also make this fix. It \nis so important to do that now because of certain rules and regulations \nthat go into effect after the first of the year that will drastically \nimpinge on the Pell Grant Program unless we take this action today.\n  I hope all Republicans and Democrats will join in supporting the \ncontinuing resolution and so do more than 9 million American students \nwho depend on Pell grants for their college education.\n  Again, I point out that other appropriations will not be settled even \nif we pass the continuing resolution today. Those decisions are kicked \ndown the street until March 4 when the continuing resolution expires.\n  We are going to face a tough situation on March 4. My friends on the \nother side of the aisle have said that their plan is to cut \nnonsecurity-related appropriations, to cut everything except defense, \nhomeland security, military construction, and VA by $100 billion. When \nyou exclude all that and you want to cut $100 billion, that is a 21-\npercent cut from everything else.\n  Do Republicans really want to cut 21 percent from childcare subsidies \nfor working families in this economy--a 21-percent cut? Do you really \nwant to cut 21 percent from job training programs in this economy? Do \nyou really want to cut 21 percent from programs that educate \ndisadvantaged children, title I programs, in this economy? Do our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle want to cut 21 percent from the \nAIDS drug assistance program? Do you want to cut 21 percent from senior \nmeals programs? Do we want to cut 21 percent from the Social Security \nAdministration in this economy?\n  That is what is coming down the pike on March 4. We kick the ball \ndown the field a little bit, but on March 4, the battle will be joined \nagain.\n  If my friends on the other side of the aisle try to decimate these \nprograms that are so critical to the well-being of so many families in \nthis country--children, working parents who need childcare, the elderly \nwho rely on a lot of these meals--I had it happen in my own family. \nMeals on Wheels keeps people from going to the hospital, lets them stay \nat home and get a decent diet, senior meals programs; job training \nprograms so people can train for new jobs--all part of getting our \ncountry back up again. If they are going to cut 21 percent from all \nthis, I want to say there is going to be a battle. We are not going to \nsit back and let these programs be decimated, these programs that mean \nso much to so many families.\n  In the meantime, we have to keep the government running, and that is \nwhat the continuing resolution is all about. As I said, what is so \nimportant is to make sure the Pell grant shortfall is closed, which it \nis on this continuing resolution.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support the continuing resolution and \nhopefully when March 4 comes, again we can agree on a bipartisan basis \nnot to decimate so many programs that help so many people in our \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                    Nomination of Benita Y. Pearson\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record two letters that have been received by the Senate in regard \nto the nomination of Judge Benita Pearson--one from the National \nCattlemen's Beef Association; the other from the Farm Animal Welfare \nCoalition.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                              National Cattlemen's\n\n\n                                             Beef Association,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 21, 2010.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader, Capitol Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Republican Leader, Capitol Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: \n     The National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA) opposes the \n     nomination of Judge Benita Pearson to the United States \n     District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. After \n     reviewing answers she gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     earlier this year, we believe that Judge Pearson's \n     connections to the Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF) would \n     make it hard for her to be an impartial judge in cases \n     regarding actions by animal activists. ALDF is an activist \n     organization involved in numerous federal lawsuits and \n     advocates giving animals the same legal rights as humans.\n       NCBA expects the Senate to confirm judges who can hear \n     cases and make decisions based on facts and law, rather than \n     judges with strong biases that could lead to legislating from \n     the bench. While we continue to discover more about Judge \n     Pearson's animal activist work, we think her connection to \n     ALDF alone is enough to block her nomination in order for \n     Senators to do more research into her background and \n     character.\n       NCBA is the nation's oldest and largest national trade \n     association representing U.S. cattle producers with more than \n     140,000 direct and affiliated members. On behalf of our \n     producers, we urge you to oppose the nomination of Judge \n     Benita Y. Pearson to the United States District Court for the \n     Northern District of Ohio.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Steve Foglesong,\n                                                        President.\n\n[[Page S10877]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                                December 20, 2010.\n     Re Nomination of Benita Y. Pearson to the U.S. District Court \n         for the Northern District of Ohio.\n     To: The U.S. Senate.\n     From: The Farm Animal Welfare Coalition: American Farm Bureau \n         Federation, American Feed Industry Association, American \n         Sheep Industry Association, Biotechnology Industry \n         Organization, Farm Credit System, Livestock Marketing \n         Association, National Milk Producers Federation, National \n         Pork Producers Council, National Renderers Association, \n         United Egg Producers.\n       The Farm Animal Welfare Coalition (FAWC), an ad hoc \n     coalition of America's largest farm/ranch, input and related \n     organizations seeks to ensure all federal policy decisions \n     regarding the welfare of food animals are based upon sound \n     science, producer expertise and the rule of law. We write to \n     express our concerns related to the nomination of Benita Y. \n     Pearson to be a judge on the U.S. District Court for the \n     Northern District of Ohio.\n       Our concerns stem from Ms. Pearson's membership and \n     participation in the Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF), an \n     animal rights organization which uses the courts to impose \n     upon farmers, ranchers, biomedical researchers, animal \n     breeders and other legitimate users of animals its parochial \n     view of animal welfare. ALDF also provides legal support for \n     political organizations dedicated to furthering animal rights \n     in the U.S. ALDF's website is rife with references to \n     ``factory farming,'' and other pejorative descriptions of \n     U.S. farm animal husbandry, as well as touting its current \n     and past lawsuits brought against agriculture interests. Its \n     political positions affecting contemporary American \n     agriculture are well known to us.\n       ALDF works to secure ``standing'' for animals in the \n     courts, a legal evolution with multiple potential negative \n     consequences for food production and the survivability of \n     farmers and ranchers in the U.S. Consider the following from \n     ALDF's Executive Director Steven Wells:\n       ``One day, hopefully, animals will have more opportunities \n     to be represented in courts so that we can more effectively \n     fight the many injustices they face--perhaps as another kind \n     of recognized `legal person.' In the meantime we must be \n     resourceful and creative in bringing lawsuits to win justice \n     for animals.''\n       Ms. Pearson's membership in ALDF demonstrates the \n     willingness of a prospective jurist to go beyond the academic \n     or philosophical contemplation of the legal and political \n     issues of animal rights. Her membership in ALDF translates \n     her personal philosophy into implicit action in support of \n     the goals of the animal rights movement.\n       We are encouraged by Ms. Pearson's written statement it is \n     never appropriate for judges to ``indulge their own values in \n     determining the meaning of statutes and the U.S. \n     Constitution;'' however, her responses remain exceedingly \n     vague when it comes to animal rights issues.\n       Given one of the ALDF's long-standing priorities is the \n     legal adoption of its so-called ``animal bill of rights''--\n     which calls for the undefined ``right of farm animals to an \n     environment that satisfies their basic and psychological \n     needs''--it seems disingenuous of Ms. Pearson to say she is \n     unaware of this priority or even the existence of the ``bill \n     of rights'' given she is a self-described member of the ALDF. \n     She also teaches animal law courses at Ohio's Cleveland-\n     Marshall College of Law--including a section on \n     constitutional standing--which, we assume, must touch at some \n     point on the ALDF's 30-year-old political philosophy and \n     history of legal actions.\n       Ms. Pearson stated she does not use the term ``animal \n     rights'' and is ``not an advocate for animal rights'' but \n     ``an advocate for doing what is in the best interest of \n     animals.'' However, she does not explain on what sources of \n     information she relies when determining what is ``the best \n     interest of animals,'' but simply her belief the law ``is \n     intended to do what is in the best interest of animals and \n     humans.''\n       While it is not a judge's role to legislate from the \n     bench--and we are gratified Ms. Pearson appears to concur--\n     judicial decisions set precedent and can precipitate \n     legislation and regulations. It is unsettling that in Ms. \n     Pearson's written responses to direct questions posed by \n     Senate Judiciary Committee members Sens. Charles Grassley, \n     Jeff Sessions and Tom Coburn, she simply restates existing \n     law as relates to animal rights, animal standing, etc. Hence, \n     we do not get a clear picture of her views regarding animal \n     rights and legal standing.\n       We would welcome a meeting with Ms. Pearson to discuss \n     these concerns.\n       Thank you for consideration of our views. Please feel free \n     to contact any of the organizations listed on this letter or \n     FAWC's coordinator, Steve Kopperud, at 202-776-0071 or \n     skopperud@poldir.com.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to spend a short time addressing \nthe remarks of my friend from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the situation we find ourself in is that \nno appropriations bills came to the floor. We did not control that. If \nthat had been under our control, I assure you they would have come to \nthe floor--and they should. No matter who is in charge, they should \ncome. I think he agrees with that. But I will address the greater issue \nwe have in front of us.\n  Our Nation has a very short time with which to reassess and \nreprioritize what is important in our fiscal matters. That period of \ntime, I believe, is shorter than many of my colleagues believe. But I \nhave not been wrong in the past 6 years as to where we are coming. I \nhave been saying it for 6 years. We are now there.\n  The fact is everything is going to have to be looked at--everything--\nevery project, for every Senator, every position, every program--if we \nare to solve the major problems that are facing this country.\n  We all want to help everybody we can, but the one thing that has to \nbe borne in mind as we try to help within the framework of our supposed \nlimited powers is there has to be a future for the country. The things \nthat are coming upon us in the very near future will limit our ability \nto act if we do not act first.\n  I take to heart my colleague's very real concern for those who are \ndisadvantaged in our country. It is genuine. It is real. We are going \nto have a choice to help them or we are going to have a choice to make \na whole lot more people disadvantaged. What we have to do is try to \nfigure out how compassionately we can do the most we can do and still \nhave a country left. That is the question that is going to come before \nus.\n  I have no doubt we will have great discussions over the next few \nyears on what those priorities are. But we cannot wait to make those \npriorities. We are going to have to squeeze wasteful spending from the \nPentagon. We have no choice. We have no choice with which to make the \nhard choices in front of us. And it does not matter what happened in \nthe past. What is going to matter is what happens in the future and \nwhether we have the courage to meet the test that is getting ready to \nface this country.\n  There is a lot of bipartisan work going on right now behind the \nscenes in the Senate planning for next year to address those issues.\n  I say to my colleague from Iowa, the way to have the greatest impact \non that issue is to join with us to, No. 1, agree with the severity of \nthe problem and the urgency of the problem, and then let's build a \nframework on how we solve it, knowing nobody is going to get what they \nwant.\n\n\n                     Tributes to Retiring Senators\n\n                             Russ Feingold\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to take 2 more minutes to pay a compliment to \none of my colleagues.\n  When I came to the Senate, I visited almost every Member of the \nSenate on the other side of the aisle. I had a wonderful visit with the \nSenator from Wisconsin. We actually--although we are totally opposite \nin our philosophical leanings--had a wonderful time visiting together.\n  Senator Feingold is my idea of a great Senator. I want to tell you \nwhy.\n  I left that meeting, and about a week later, I got a note from him \nfirst of all thanking me for taking the initiative to come and meet \nwith him, but also a commitment that he would always be straight with \nme, that when he gave me his word and handshake, it would always be \nthat way, and that I could count on him standing for what he believed \nin but knowing he would do the things we needed to do to get things \ndone.\n  My observation in the last 6 years in this Chamber is I have watched \none man of great integrity keep his word and hold to his values through \nevery crisis and every vote. And every time it was taken where we had \nto come together to do something, this gentleman kept his character. He \nkept his word. He fulfilled the best aspects of the tradition of the \nSenate.\n  Although I often--most of the time--am on the opposite side of issues \nfrom Senator Russ Feingold, I want to tell you, he has my utmost \nadmiration and my hope that more would follow his principled stand and \nhis wonderful comity as he deals with those on the other side of the \naisle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I understand the UC has us voting at 2 \no'clock; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n[[Page S10878]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the continuing resolution. One of \nthe many reasons is that the Navy's urgent request for authority for \nthe littoral combat ship, (LCS),--program is included.\n  The original LCS acquisition plan in 2005 would have had the Navy \nbuying both types of LCS vessels for some time while the Navy evaluated \nthe capabilities of each vessel. At some time in the future, the Navy \nwould have had the option to down select to building one type of \nvessel. But in any case, the Navy would have been operating some number \nof each type of LCS vessel in the fleet, which means that the Navy \nwould have been dealing with two shipyards, two supply chains, two \ntraining pipelines, etc. Last year, after the bids came in too high, \nthe Navy decided upon a winner-take-all acquisition strategy to procure \nthe fiscal year 2010 vessels under a fixed-price contract, with fixed-\nprice options for two ships per year for the next 4 years. This revised \nstrategy included obtaining the data rights for the winning ship design \nand competing for a second source for the winning design starting in \nfiscal year 2012. Again, the Navy made this course correction because \nthe Navy leadership determined that the original acquisition strategy \nwas unaffordable.\n  Earlier this year, the Navy released the solicitation under that \nrevised strategy and has been in discussion with the two contractor \nteams and evaluating those proposals since that time. The bids came in, \nthe competition worked, and the prices were lower than the Navy had \nexpected. Both teams have made offers that are much more attractive \nthan had been expected, and both are priced well below the original, \nnoncompetitive offers.\n  The Navy has now requested that we approve a different LCS \nacquisition strategy, taking advantage of the low bids and keeping the \nindustrial base strong. The Armed Services Committee held a hearing on \nthe subject of the change in the Navy's acquisition strategy. We heard \ntestimony from the Navy that, after having reviewed the bids from the \ntwo contractor teams, they should change their LCS acquisition \nstrategy.\n  The Navy testified that continuing the winner-take-all down select \nwould save roughly $1.9 billion, compared with what had been budgeted \nfor the LCS program in the Future-Years Defense Program, or FYDP.\n  The Navy further testified that revising the acquisition strategy to \naccept the offers from both LCS contractor teams, rather than down \nselecting to one design and starting a second source building the \nwinning design, would save $2.9 billion, or $1 billion more than the \nprogram of record, and would allow the Navy to purchase an additional \nLCS vessel during the same period of the FYDP--20 ships rather than 19 \nships.\n  The Navy also testified that additional operation and support costs \nfor maintaining two separate designs in the fleet for their service \nlife over 40 to 50 years, using net present value calculations, would \nbe much less than the additional saving that could be achieved through \nbuying both the ships during the FYDP period--approximately $250 \nmillion of additional operating and support costs vs. approximately \n$900 million in savings.\n  Those are the facts of the case as we heard from the Navy. Let me \nrelay a few quotes from the Navy witnesses at the hearing to amplify on \nthese points.\n  Secretary of the Navy Raymond E. Mabus, Jr., referring the authority \nto revise the acquisition strategy, said the following:\n\n       This authority, which I emphasize, requires no additional \n     funding, will enable us to purchase more high-quality ships \n     for less money and get them into service in less time. It \n     will help preserve jobs in our industrial shipbuilding base \n     and will create new employment opportunities in an economic \n     sector that is critical to our Nation's military and economic \n     security.\n\n  ADM Gary Roughead, the Chief of Naval Operations, said:\n\n       The dual award also allows us to reduce costs by further \n     locking in a price for 20 ships, enabling us to acquire LCS \n     at a significant savings to American taxpayers and permitting \n     the use of shipbuilding funds for other shipbuilding \n     programs.\n\n  From a broad policy perspective, I believe that the Navy approach of \na competitive, dual source alternative could help ensure maximum \ncompetition throughout the lifecycle of the program, meeting the spirit \nand intent of the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009, MSARA. \nSpecifically, it calls for two shipbuilders in continuous competition \nto build the ships for the life of the program. The Navy plans to build \na total of 55 of these ships, so that could take a number of years.\n  Some have raised concerns because the Navy has been unable to reveal \nthe specific bid information from the two contractors. Unfortunately, \nthe Navy has been prevented from sharing specific bid information \nbecause that would violate the competitive source selection process by \nrevealing proprietary information about the two contactors' bids. \nBecause of these constraints, I do not know what is in the bids. But I \ntake comfort from knowing that these bids are for fixed- price \ncontracts and not for cost-type contracts where a contractor has little \nto lose from underbidding a contract.\n  As far as the capability of the two vessels, we heard from Admiral \nRoughead at the hearing that each of the two vessels would meet his \nrequirements for the LCS program. I asked Admiral Roughead: ``Do both \nof these vessels in their current configuration meet the Navy's \nrequirements?'' Admiral Roughead replied: ``Yes, Senator, they do. Both \nships do.''\n  Some have raised the possibility that development of the mission \npackages could cause problems in the shipbuilding program and lead to \nunexpected cost growth, and thereby fail to achieve the extra savings \nthe Navy is projecting. In some other shipbuilding programs that might \nbe a concern, but I believe that the Navy's fundamental architecture of \nthe LCS program divorces changes in the mission package from changes \nthat perturb the ship design and ship construction. In the past, when \nthere were problems with developing the right combat capability on a \nship, this almost inevitably caused problems in the construction \nprogram. In the case of the LCS, the combat capability largely resides \nin the mission packages that connect to either LCS vessel through \ndefined interfaces. What that means is that changes inside the mission \npackages should not translate into changes during the ship construction \nschedule--i.e., they are interchangeable. And whatever is happening in \nthe mission package development program would apply equally to either \nthe down select strategy or the dual source strategy.\n  In terms of the proposal's effects on the industrial base and on \ncompetition, I believe that there would be a net positive. The Navy \nwould have the opportunity to compete throughout the life of the \nprogram, and any erosion in contractor performance could be corrected \nby competitive pressures. For the industrial base, there would be more \nstability in the shipbuilding program. Countless Navy witnesses have \ntestified to the Armed Services Committee and the other defense \ncommittees that achieving stability in our shipbuilding programs is one \nof the best things we in the government can do to help the Navy support \nthe shipbuilding industry.\n  The Navy's proposal to change to a dual source selection strategy \nwould promote that goal of stability, while effectively continuing \ncompetition throughout the program, and at the same time reducing \nacquisition costs and buying an additional ship over the FYDP.\n  Why don't we just wait until sometime after the new Congress convenes \nto deliberate this changed acquisition strategy? Senator Jack Reed \nasked the Navy about this very issue at the hearing. He asked, ``What \nis lost or what do you gain or lose by waiting?'' Assistant Navy \nSecretary Sean Stackley answered that question as follows: ``Workforce \nis leaving, hiring freezes are in effect, vendors are stressed in terms \nof their ability to keep faith with the proposals, the fixed price \nproposals that they have put in place. They will need to have to then \ngo back with any further delay and reprice their proposals.''\n  What that means is, if we were to let the bids expire at the end of \nDecember, we would lose the full benefits of the competition and our \nsavings will likely be reduced.\n  Mr. President, I support including the authority for the Navy to make \nthis change in the continuing resolution before us.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the littoral combat \nships, LCS,\n\n[[Page S10879]]\n\nprovision in the continuing resolution, CR. That provision--which, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, and the \nCongressional Research Service, CRS, could cost taxpayers as much as \n$2.9 billion more than the current acquisition strategy--simply does \nnot belong in the CR. But once again we are looking at a cloture vote \non a piece of ``must-pass'' legislation where the majority leader has \nfilled the amendment tree and no amendments will be allowed.\n  The LCS program has a long, documented history of cost overruns and \nproduction slippages and yet we now find ourselves inserting an \nauthorization provision at the 11th hour to yet again change the \nacquisition strategy of a program that has been plagued by instability \nsince its inception.\n  Let's look at its track record over the past 5 years:\n\n       1st LCS funded in 2005--LCS 1 Commissioned in Nov 2008 at \n     cost of $637 million;\n       2nd LCS funded in 2006--LCS 2 Commissioned in Jan 2010 at \n     cost of $704 million;\n       3rd LCS funded in 2006--Canceled by Navy in April 2007, \n     because of cost, and schedule growth;\n       4th LCS funded in 2006--Canceled by Navy in Nov 2007, \n     because of cost and schedule growth;\n       5th LCS funded in 2007--Canceled by Navy in Mar 2007, \n     because of cost and schedule growth;\n       6th LCS funded in 2007--Canceled by Navy in Mar 2007, \n     because projected costs too high;\n       7th LCS funded in 2008--Canceled by Navy in Sep 2008, \n     because projected costs too high;\n       8th LCS funded in 2009--Christened in Dec 2010 is about 80 \n     percent complete; ``New LCS 3'';\n       9th LCS funded in 2009--Under construction is about 40 \n     percent complete; ``New LCS 4.''\n\n  When the Navy first made its proposal to Congress just over 6 weeks \nago, it failed to provide Congress with basic information we need to \ndecide whether it should approve the Navy's request--including the \nactual bid prices, which would tell us how realistic and sustainable \nthey are, and specific information about how capable each of the yards \nare of delivering the ships as needed, on time and on budget. Why don't \nwe have that information? Because it's sensitive to the on-going \ncompetition.\n  Last week, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nthe General Accountability Office, GAO, the Congressional Research \nService, CRS, and the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, raised \nimportant questions that Congress should have answers to before it \nconsiders approving the proposal.\n  Those questions included not only ``how much more (or less) would it \ncost for the Navy to buy LCS ships under its proposal'' but also ``how \nmuch would the cost be to operate and maintain two versions of LCS, \nunder the proposal''. They also asked ``how confident can we be that \nthe Navy will be able to stay within budgeted limits and deliver \npromised capability on schedule--given that all of the deficiencies \naffecting LCS' lead ships have not been identified and fully resolved'' \nand ``has the combined capability of the LCS seaframes with their \nmission modules been sufficiently demonstrated so that increasing the \nNavy's commitment to seaframes at this time would be appropriate?''\n  Those questions, and others, that GAO, CRS and CBO raised last week, \nare salient and should be answered definitively before we approve of \nthe Navy's proposal. Every one of those witnesses conceded that more \ntime would help Congress get those answers. And, considering this \nprovision in connection with a Continuing Resolution, brought up at the \n11th hour; during a lame-duck session; outside of the congressional \nbudget-review period; and without specific information or the \nopportunity for full and open debate by all interested Members, does \nnot give us that time. Buying into this process would be an abrogation \nof our constitutional oversight responsibility.\n  From 2005 to date, we have sunk $8 billion into the LCS program. And, \nwhat do we have to show for it? Only two boats commissioned and one \nboat christened--none of which have been shown to be operationally \neffective or reliable--and a trail of blown cost-caps and schedule \nslips. I suggest that, having made key decisions on the program hastily \nand ill-informed, we in Congress are partly to blame for that record. \nBut, with the cost of the program from 2010 to 2015 projected to be \nabout $11 billion, we can start to fix that--by not including this ill-\nadvised provision in the CR.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my December 10, 2010, letter to the \nchairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, asking \nthem not to include the LCS provision in any funding measure, a letter \nfrom the Project on Government Oversight to Senator Levin and me, and \nthe exchange of letters between me and the Chief of Naval Operations, \nCNO, be printed in today's Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Chief of Naval Operations,\n\n\n                                                Navy Pentagon,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 22, 2010.\n     Hon. John S. McCain,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Thank you for affording me the \n     opportunity to discuss the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) \n     program. This program is vital to the future force structure \n     of the United States Navy, and I am committed to its success. \n     The Navy tackled aggressively and overcame the program's past \n     cost and schedule challenges, ensuring affordability of this \n     new critical warfighting capability.\n       The Department has taken action on all four of the \n     recommendations of the August 2010 General Accountability \n     Office (GAO) LCS report.\n       The Navy has been operating both LCS designs and collecting \n     design performance data. There are mechanisms in place to \n     ensure design corrections identified in building and testing \n     the first four ships are incorporated in the operating ships, \n     ships under construction, and ships yet to be awarded.\n       The Navy will update the Test and Evaluation Master Plan \n     (TEMP) for the LCS, to reflect the Program of Record \n     following the Milestone B (MS B) decision.\n       The Navy will update test and evaluation and production of \n     LCS seaframes and mission modules following the MS B \n     decision.\n       The Navy has completed a robust independent cost analysis \n     of the LCS lifecycle using estimating best practices and \n     submitted this estimate to the Office of the Secretary of \n     Defense (OSD) for comparison with the Cost Assessment and \n     Program Evaluation (CAPE) group independent estimate.\n       These recommendations and the Department's responses apply \n     for either the down-select or the dual block-buy approach and \n     the Department's concurrence and related actions with the \n     recommendations (included in Appendix III of the August GAO \n     report) will not change in either case.\n       As you know, Navy has taken delivery of the first two ships \n     and the third and fourth ships are under construction. The \n     performance of the USS FREEDOM (LCS 1) and USS INDEPENDENCE \n     (LCS 2) and their crews are extraordinary and affirm the \n     value and urgent need for these ships. For the Fiscal Years \n     (FYs) 2010-2014 ships, Navy has been pursuing the \n     congressionally authorized down-select to a ten ship block-\n     buy. Competition for the down-select has succeeded in \n     achieving very affordable prices for each of the ten ship \n     bids which reflect mature designs, investments made to \n     improve performance, stable production, and continuous labor \n     learning at their respective shipyards.\n       The result of this competition affords the Navy an \n     opportunity to award a dual block-buy award (for up to 20 \n     ships between FYs 2010-2015) with fixed-price type contracts, \n     which achieves significant savings for the taxpayer, while \n     getting more ships to the Fleet sooner and providing greater \n     operational flexibility. The dual block-buy provides much \n     needed stability to the shipbuilding industrial base; from \n     vendors, to systems providers to the shipyards. This will pay \n     important dividends to the Department, and to potential \n     Foreign Military Sales customers, in way of current and \n     future program affordability. The fixed-price type contract \n     limits the government's liability and incentivizes both the \n     government and the shipbuilder to aggressively pursue further \n     efficiencies and tightly suppress any appetite for change. \n     Navy will routinely report on the program's progress and \n     Congress retains control over future ship awards through the \n     annual budget process.\n       The agility, innovation and willingness to seize \n     opportunities displayed in this LCS competition reflect \n     exactly the improvements to the way we do business that the \n     Department requires in order to deliver better value to the \n     taxpayer and greater capability to the warfighter.\n       I greatly appreciate your support for the LCS Program. As \n     always, if I can be of further assistance, please let me \n     know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      G. Roughead,\n     Admiral, U.S. Navy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              Project on Government Oversight,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 9, 2010.\n     Senate Armed Services Committee,\n     Senate Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain, The Project \n     On Government Oversight (POGO) is a nonpartisan independent \n     watchdog that champions good government reforms. POGO's \n     investigations into corruption, misconduct, and conflicts of \n     interest achieve a more effective, accountable,\n\n[[Page S10880]]\n\n     open, and ethical federal government. We are troubled by a \n     rushed proposal to change the Navy Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) \n     sea frame acquisition strategy.\n       The Navy notified Congress of its proposal to change its \n     acquisition strategy for LCS on November 3, 2010. The \n     proposed strategy, under which the Navy intends to buy up to \n     20 sea frames from two separate shipyards, is a substantial \n     change from the current strategy. Currently, the Navy's \n     strategy is to ``down select'' (i.e. choose a winner) to one \n     yard and (with the winning design in hand) hold another \n     competition later to build a total of 19 ships--only 10 of \n     which are now authorized under law. To implement the new \n     strategy, the Navy needs Congress to sign off on it and wants \n     Congress to do so by mid-December.\n       Congress should require that the Navy give it more time to \n     get answers to the serious questions raised by, among others, \n     the Congressional Research Service (CRS) in its November 29, \n     2010, report (attached) and the Government Accountability \n     Office (GAO) in reports issued in August and December 2010. \n     As CRS asked:\n       ``Does the timing of the Navy's proposal provide Congress \n     with enough time to adequately assess the relative merits of \n     the down select strategy and the dual-award strategy? . . . \n     Should the Navy ask the contractors to extend their bid \n     prices for another, say, 30 or 60 or 90 days beyond December \n     14, so as to provide more time for congressional review of \n     the Navy's proposal?''\n       Congress needs time to consider whether the Navy's new plan \n     is fiscally responsible or whether it increases risks that \n     already exist in the program. Congress should require that \n     the Navy to ask the two contractor teams to extend their bid \n     prices up to 90 days beyond December 14. The two contractor \n     teams are led by, respectively, Lockheed Martin and Austal \n     USA.\n       The Navy's justification for its new strategy is the \n     purportedly low prices that both bidders have submitted in \n     the current competition. But it is not clear if these low \n     bids are reasonable. The use of fixed-price contracts won't \n     necessarily prevent an underperforming shipyard from simply \n     rolling its losses into its prices for follow-on ships.\n       There can be no doubt that the LCS program has already had \n     significant problems. For example, the sea frames were \n     originally intended to cost about $220 million each. But the \n     ones built and under construction have ballooned up to over \n     $600 million each. Yet without any real data indicating that \n     the program is likely to perform adequately in the future \n     (the Navy has failed to meaningfully implement many of GAO's \n     recommendations in its August report), the Navy wants \n     Congress's help to lock the program into 20 ships over the \n     next five years.\n       The Navy has not demonstrated the combined capabilities of \n     the LCS sea frame(s) with its mission packages. It's \n     important to bear in mind that the LCS sea frame is \n     effectively a ``truck.'' The LCS's combat effectiveness \n     derives from its modular ``plug-and-play'' mission packages \n     (e.g., anti-submarine, mine-countermeasures, and surface \n     warfare). The LCS program has been struggling with \n     developmental challenges with these mission packages that \n     have led to postponed testing. As the GAO states, ``Until \n     mission packages are proven, the Navy risks investing in a \n     fleet of ships that does not deliver promised capability.'' \n     Without effective mission capabilities, the LCS will be \n     ``largely constrained to self-defense as opposed to mission-\n     related tasks.''\n       Furthermore, it is likely that other shipyards that may be \n     just as capable of building LCS sea frames as the two that \n     would be awarded contracts under the dual-award strategy. \n     Some, including CRS, have asked whether other shipyards will \n     be frozen out of the LCS program--even after the first 20 \n     ships have been built. For that reason, we believe that, \n     before approving the Navy's proposal, Congress should \n     carefully evaluate whether it may in fact stifle, rather than \n     encourage, competition throughout the program's lifecycle, as \n     is required under the recently enacted weapon systems \n     acquisition reform law.\n       This is not the first time the Navy has given Congress \n     insufficient time to evaluate its LCS acquisition strategy. \n     The last time the Navy asked Congress to approve its LCS \n     acquisition strategy--just last year--there was short notice. \n     In 2002, the Navy gave ``little or no opportunity for formal \n     congressional review and consideration'' of the Navy's \n     proposed LCS acquisition strategy, according to CRS. This is \n     deja vu all over again. The taxpayers deserve the careful \n     consideration of Congress.\n       In sum, Congress should not approve the Navy's acquisition \n     strategy without a clear picture of the likely costs and \n     risks. Furthermore, Congress should not allow the Navy to \n     continue to skirt oversight. We appreciate your review of \n     this letter and your time, and look forward to working with \n     you on the Littoral Combat Ship Program. If you have any \n     questions, please do not hesitate to contact Nick \n     Schwellenbach.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Danielle Brian,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 10, 2010.\n     Hon. Daniel Inouye,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriations, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Vice Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriations, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Inouye and Vice Chairman Cochran: The House-\n     passed Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (H.R. \n     3082) contains a provision that would authorize the \n     Department of the Navy to acquire 20 Littoral Combat Ships \n     (LCS) in lieu of the 10 that were authorized under the \n     National Defense Authorization Act, 2010. As you finalize \n     your Omnibus Appropriations Bill, I wanted to express my \n     opposition to including this provision in the Omnibus \n     Appropriations Bill or any other stop-gap funding measure \n     that you may be considering.\n       As you know, the Navy first conveyed to the Senate its \n     proposal that gave rise to this provision just a few weeks \n     ago, and the competition for the LCS ship construction \n     contract is still open. As such, not only has the Senate been \n     given an unusually short time to review such an important \n     proposal but it also has been unable to obtain basic \n     information (on cost and capability, for example) it needs to \n     consider the proposal carefully because they remain source-\n     selection sensitive.\n       Moreover, recent reviews of the proposal released by the \n     General Accountability Office (GAO) and the Congressional \n     Research Service (CRS) just yesterday raise a number of \n     salient concerns about it. In the aggregate, those concerns \n     indicate the proposal needs more careful and open \n     deliberation than would be afforded by including it in a late \n     cycle Omnibus or continuing resolution.\n       In particular, the GAO identified a full range of \n     uncertainties (relating to, for example, design changes, \n     operations and support costs, mission-package development) \n     that would determine whether the proposal will realize \n     estimated savings--savings that, in its own report release \n     just today, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) suggests \n     that the Navy may have overstated. GAO also negatively \n     assessed the Navy's implementation of some of the \n     recommendations it made in its August 2010 report--\n     recommendations with which the Department of Defense \n     concurred. Against that backdrop, GAO observed that \n     ``decisionmakers do not have a clear picture of the various \n     options available to them related to choosing between the \n     down-select and dual award strategies''.\n       Similarly posing a number of important questions (on, for \n     example, the potential relative costs and risks of the two \n     strategies, the proposal's impact on the industrial base, and \n     its effect on competition) in its recent review of the \n     proposal, CRS too noted that this is the third time that the \n     Navy has presented Congress with a difficult choice about how \n     to buy LCS ships late in Congress' budget-review cycle--after \n     budget hearings and often after defense bills have been \n     written.\n       Given the foregoing, without the basic information and the \n     time necessary for the Senate to discharge its oversight \n     responsibilities with respect to the Navy's proposal \n     responsibly and transparently, I oppose including this \n     provision in the any funding measure now under consideration. \n     With the LCS' program's troubled history, I suggest that such \n     measures would serve as inappropriate vehicles to make \n     dramatic changes to the program.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John McCain,\n     Ranking Member.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 8, 2010.\n     Admiral Gary Roughead, USN,\n     Chief of Naval Operations,\n     Navy Pentagon, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Admiral Roughead: About a month ago, the Navy first \n     proposed that Congress let it fundamentally change how it \n     buys seaframes under the Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) \n     program--a program that has had serious difficulty on cost, \n     schedule and performance.\n       However, in August 2010 and again just today, the General \n     Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report raising serious \n     concerns about the program. In today's report, it also \n     conveyed criticism about the Navy's implementation of its \n     recommendations.\n       When you and I met, on November 18, 2010. I asked that you \n     describe how the Navy has implemented GAO's recommendations. \n     In that regard, your letter of November 22, 2010, was \n     unhelpful. Not only did it cite what the Navy will do to \n     implement GAO's recommendations as examples of action it had \n     already taken, most of the action items it described didn't \n     even correspond to GAO's actual recommendations. Indeed, the \n     whole thrust of the Navy's proposal appears basically \n     inconsistent with the recommendation that the Navy not buy \n     excess quantities of ships and mission packages before their \n     combined capabilities have been sufficiently demonstrated.\n       Until deficiencies affecting the lead ships have been fully \n     identified and resolved, I simply cannot share your optimism \n     that the LCS program will stay within budgeted limits and \n     deliver required capability on time--an assumption that \n     underpins the Navy's proposal. And, without basic information \n     needed to consider the proposal responsibly (because, with \n     the competition still open, they remain sensitive), I cannot \n     support it at this time.\n       Finally, I would like to comment on how undesirable the \n     process by which the Navy has made this proposal has been--\n     outside of ``regular order''; during an open competition; in \n     a way that precludes full and open debate\n\n[[Page S10881]]\n\n     by all interested Members; and without full information. I \n     respectfully suggest that neither this program nor the Navy's \n     shipbuilding enterprise have been served well by Congress' \n     making decisions in this way in the past. I, therefore, \n     respectfully ask that this process not be repeated.\n       Thank you for your visit. I look forward to continuing to \n     work with you in support of our sailors.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John McCain,\n     Ranking Member.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 10, 2010.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: As you know, the Navy is planning to acquire \n     a fleet of 55 littoral combat ships (LCSs), which are \n     designed to counter submarines, mines, and small surface \n     craft in the world's coastal regions. Two of those ships have \n     already been built, one each of two types: a semiplaning \n     steel monohull built jointly by Lockheed Martin and Marinette \n     Marine in Wisconsin and an all-aluminum trimaran built by \n     Austal in Alabama. The Navy also has two more ships (one of \n     each type) under construction. The remaining 51 ships would \n     be purchased from 2010 through 2031. In response to your \n     request, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analyzed the \n     cost implications of the Navy's existing plan for acquiring \n     new LCSs and a new plan that it is currently proposing:\n       Existing ``Down-Select'' Plan: In September 2009, the Navy \n     asked the two builders to submit fixed-price-plus-incentive \n     bids to build 10 ships, 2 per year from 2010 to 2014, \n     beginning with funds appropriated for 2010. The Navy planned \n     to select one of the two versions of the LCS, awarding a \n     contract for those 10 ships to the winning bidder, and then, \n     through another competition, to introduce a second yard to \n     build 5 more ships of that same design from 2012 to 2014. In \n     2015, the Navy would purchase 4 more ships; the acquisition \n     strategy for those vessels has not been specified. A total of \n     19 ships of one design would be purchased by 2015 (see Table \n     1). Any shipyard could bid in that second competition except \n     the winner of the contract for the first 10 ships.\n\n                    TABLE 1--LCS PROCUREMENT UNDER DIFFERENT ACQUISITION PLANS, 2010 TO 2015\n                                           [Number of ships procured]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                          2010    2011    2012    2013    2014    2015    Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                            Existing Down-Select Plan\n \nWinner.................................................       2       2       2       2       2       4       19\n \nSecond Builder.........................................  ......  ......       1       2       2  ......  .......\n                                            Proposed Dual-Award Plan\n \nLockheed Martin/Marinette Marine.......................       1       1       2       2       2       2       20\nAustal.................................................       1       1       2       2       2       2  .......\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Congressional Budget Office based on data from the Navy.\nNote: The Navy also purchased two ships from each builder between 2005 and 2009. Under the down-select plan, the\n  Navy proposes to procure four ships in 2015. How the Navy would purchase those ships has not been determined.\n\n       Proposed ``Dual-Award'' Plan: In November of this year, the \n     Navy proposed to accept the fixed-price-plus-incentive bids \n     from both teams, purchasing 10 of each type of LCS (a total \n     of 20 ships) by 2015, beginning with funds appropriated for \n     fiscal year 2010.\n       According to the Navy, the bid prices received under the \n     existing down-select plan were lower than expected, which \n     would allow the service, under the dual-award plan, to \n     purchase 20 ships from 2010 through 2015 for less than it had \n     expected to pay for 19. (The total number of LCSs ultimately \n     purchased would be the same under both plans.)\n       CBO has estimated the cost for the LCS program between 2010 \n     and 2015 under both plans, using its standard cost-estimating \n     model. By CBO's estimates, either plan would cost \n     substantially more than the Navy's current estimates--but CBO \n     did not have enough information to incorporate in its \n     estimates the bids from both contractors for the 10-ship \n     contract.\n       CBO's analysis suggests the following conclusions:\n       Whether one considers the Navy's estimates or CBO's, under \n     either plan, costs for the first 19 ships are likely to be \n     less than the amounts included in the Navy's 2011 budget \n     proposal and the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).\n       CBO's estimates show per-ship construction costs that are \n     about the same for the two plans, but those estimates do not \n     take into account the actual bids that have been received.\n       Adopting the dual-award plan might yield savings in \n     construction costs, both from avoiding the need for a new \n     contractor to develop the infrastructure and expertise to \n     build a new kind of ship and from the possibility that bids \n     now are lower than they would be in a subsequent competition, \n     when the economic environment would probably be different.\n       Operating and maintaining two types of ships would probably \n     be more expensive, however. The Navy has stated that the \n     differences in costs are small (and more than offset by \n     procurement savings), but there is considerable uncertainty \n     about how to estimate those differences because the Navy does \n     not yet have much experience in operating such ships. In \n     addition, if the Navy later decided to use a common combat \n     system for all LCSs (rather than the different ones that \n     would initially be installed on the two different types of \n     vessels), the costs for developing, procuring, and installing \n     that system could be significant.\n\n\n          The Navy's Estimates of Costs Between 2010 and 2015\n\n       In the fiscal year 2011 FYDP, the Navy proposed spending \n     almost $12 billion in current dollars to procure 19 littoral \n     combat ships between 2010 and 2015 under the down-select \n     plan. (The Navy's budget estimate was submitted in February \n     2010, well before it received the two contractors' bids in \n     the summer of 2010.) The Navy now estimates the cost under \n     that plan to be $10.4 billion, about $1.5 billion (or 13 \n     percent) less than its previous estimate.\n       Now that the Navy has the two bids in hand, it has \n     formulated a new plan for purchasing LCSs. It estimates that \n     it could purchase 20 ships--10 from each contractor--for \n     about $9.8 billion through 2015, or $0.6 billion less than it \n     currently estimates for the down-select plan and $2.1 billion \n     less than the cost it had estimated for 19 ships in its 2011 \n     FYDP. The Navy's projected cost per ship under this plan is \n     21 percent less than its estimate in the 2011 FYDP.\n       The Navy's block-buy contracts under either plan would be \n     structured as fixed price plus incentive. Under the terms of \n     the two contractors' bids, the ceiling price is 125 percent \n     of the target cost, and that price represents the maximum \n     liability to the government. The Navy and the contractor \n     would share costs equally over the target price up to the \n     ceiling price. If costs rose to the ceiling price, the result \n     would be a 12.5 percent increase in price to the government \n     compared with the target price at the time the contract was \n     awarded. The Navy has stated that its budget estimates \n     include additional funding above the target price to address \n     some, but not all, of the potential cost increases during \n     contract execution. There is also the potential for cost \n     growth in other parts of the program, such as in the \n     government's purchasing of equipment that it provides to the \n     shipyard, that are not part of the shipyard contract. But the \n     cost of government-furnished equipment is small; it is less \n     than 5 percent of the total cost in the case of the third and \n     fourth ships currently under construction.\n       The Navy indicates that its estimates reflect the \n     experience the shipyards gained from building two previous \n     ships and the benefits of competition. Under the down-select \n     plan, the second shipyard that would begin building LCSs in \n     2012 would be inexperienced with whichever ship design was \n     awarded, and the investments required in infrastructure and \n     expertise would make the first ships it produced more \n     expensive than those from a shipyard with an existing \n     contract for LCS construction. Conversely, under the dual-\n     award plan, each shipyard would benefit from its experience \n     with building two of the first four LCSs. CBO cannot quantify \n     the benefits of competition, although they undoubtedly exist. \n     In light of the results of the competition for the 10-ship \n     block, it is possible that the competition the Navy would \n     hold in 2012 for the second source in the down-select plan \n     might also yield costs that are below those the Navy (or CBO) \n     estimates, in which case the current estimate of the costs \n     for that plan would be overstated.\n       The Navy briefed CBO on some aspects of those estimates but \n     did not provide CBO with the detailed contractor data or with \n     the Navy's detailed analysis of those data. If the \n     contractors' proposals for the 10-ship award are robust and \n     do not change, the Navy's estimates would be plausible \n     although not guaranteed. CBO has no independent data or means \n     to verify the Navy's savings estimate, and costs could grow \n     by several hundred million dollars if the shipbuilders or \n     developers of the combat systems carried by those ships \n     experience cost overruns.\n\n\n              Comparison of CBO's and the Navy's Estimates\n\n       CBO's estimates of costs are higher and indicate little \n     difference in the per-ship costs of the two plans. They \n     reflect information about the ships currently being built, \n     but they do not incorporate information about the \n     contractors' bids because CBO does not\n\n[[Page S10882]]\n\n     have access to that information. Thus, CBO's estimates do not \n     incorporate any benefits of competition that may have arisen \n     as a result of the Navy's existing down-select acquisition \n     strategy--benefits the Navy argues would be locked in by the \n     fixed-price-plus-incentive contracts.\n       CBO estimates that the down-select plan would cost the Navy \n     about $583 million per ship--compared with an estimated cost \n     of $591 million per ship under the dual-award plan (see table \n     2). Contributing to that difference is the loss of efficiency \n     that would result from having two yards produce one ship per \n     year in 2010 and 2011, rather than having one yard produce \n     two ships per year. Given the uncertainties that surround \n     such estimates, that difference, of less than 2 percent, is \n     not significant.\n       CBO's estimates of the cost for the down-select and dual-\n     award strategies are higher than the Navy's, by $680 million \n     and $2.0 billion, respectively, because the contractors' \n     prices are apparently much lower than the amounts CBO's cost-\n     estimating model would have predicted and even lower than the \n     Navy predicted in its 2011 budget. (CBO's model is based on \n     well-established cost-estimating relationships, and it \n     incorporates the Navy's experience with the first four LCSs.) \n     For example, the Navy's estimate of the average cost for one \n     ship in each of the two yards in 2010 and 2011 is lower than \n     CBO's estimate of what the average cost would be to build \n     (presumably, more efficiently) two ships in one yard. And \n     those lower costs carry through to the years when each yard \n     would be building two ships per year. In addition, again \n     according to the Navy, the contractors were willing to accept \n     a change in the number of ships purchased per year in 2010 \n     and 2011 without increasing the total cost of the ships. \n     The Navy stated that the contractors achieved a \n     substantial savings in the cost of materials because, \n     under the block buy, the Navy would be committing to \n     purchase 10 ships from one or both shipyards. With the \n     dual- award strategy, the Navy is attempting to capture \n     the lower prices offered by both builders for 20 ships, \n     rather than just for 10 ships under the down-select \n     strategy.\n\n TABLE 2--CBO'S AND THE NAVY'S ESTIMATES OF THE COSTS OF THE LCS PROGRAM UNDER DIFFERENT ACQUISITION PLANS, 2010\n                                                     TO 2015\n                                          [Millions of current dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                        Average\n                                           2010 a     2011     2012    2013    2014    2015    Total   ship cost\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                 CBO's Estimates\n \n19-Ship Down-Select Plan.................   1,080    1,150 b   1,790   2,330   2,350   2,380   11,080        583\n20-Ship Dual-Award Plan..................   1,080    1,450 b   2,290   2,300   2,330   2,370   11,820        591\n \n                                                Navy's Estimates\n \n19-Ship Down-Select Plan.................    n.a.       n.a.    n.a.    n.a.    n.a.    n.a.   10,400        547\n20-Ship Dual-Award Plan..................    n.a.       n.a.    n.a.    n.a.    n.a.    n.a.    9,800        490\nMemorandum:\n    2011 President's Budget and FYDP (19-   1,080      1,509   1,808   2,334   2,417   2,748   11,893       626\n     ship plan)..........................\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Congressional Budget Office.\nNote: n.a. = not available; FYDP = Future Years Defense Program.\na. The amount for 2010 is the funding level provided in the Defense Appropriations Act, 2010.\nb. The amounts for 2011 include additional funds CBO estimates would be needed to complete the 2010 ships.\n\n       With the Navy in possession of contract bids, it is not \n     clear that CBO's cost-estimating model is a better predictor \n     of LCS costs through 2015 than the Navy's estimates. Still, \n     the savings compared with the 2011 FYDP might not be realized \n     if the Navy changes the number of ships that are purchased \n     after the contract has been let or makes design changes to \n     address technical problems, regardless of which acquisition \n     strategy the Navy pursues. Inflation or other escalation \n     clauses in the contract also could add to costs.\n       Although CBO estimates that the dual-award plan would be \n     slightly more costly, that approach might also provide some \n     benefits. In materials delivered to the Congress about that \n     strategy, the Navy stated, ``There are numerous benefits to \n     this approach including stabilizing the LCS program and the \n     industrial base with award of 20 ships; increasing ship \n     procurement rate to support operational requirements; \n     sustaining competition through the program; and enhancing \n     Foreign Military Sales opportunities.'' CBO did not \n     evaluate those potential benefits.\n\n\n    Implications of the Two Acquisition Plans for Costs Beyond 2015\n\n       A Navy decision to buy both types of ships through 2015 \n     would have cost implications after 2015. But whether those \n     long-term costs will be higher or lower would depend on at \n     least three aspects of the Navy's decision:\n       Which of the two ship designs the Navy would have selected \n     if it had kept to its original down-select plan;\n       Whether the Navy will buy one or both types of ships after \n     2015; and\n       Whether the Navy decides eventually to develop a common \n     combat system for both types of ships or to keep the two \n     combat systems (one for each type of ship) that it would \n     purchase under the dual-award approach.\n       CBO cannot estimate those costs beyond 2015 because it does \n     not know what the Navy is likely to decide in any of those \n     areas. For example, if the Navy pursued its original down-\n     select strategy and chose the ship with lower total ownership \n     costs (the costs of purchasing and operating the ships), \n     switching to the dual-award strategy would increase the \n     overall cost of the program because the Navy would then be \n     buying at least 10 more ships that have higher total \n     ownership costs. Conversely, if the Navy were to choose the \n     ship with higher total ownership costs under the down-select \n     strategy, the dual-award strategy might produce an overall \n     savings. However, some of those savings would be offset by \n     the extra overhead costs of employing a second shipyard and \n     by other types of additional costs described below. Added \n     costs would also arise if the Navy selected the dual-award \n     strategy through 2015 and then decided to build both types of \n     ships after 2015 to complete the 55-ship fleet rather than \n     selecting only one type, in keeping with its current plans.\n       The dual-award strategy might entail higher costs to \n     support two full training and maintenance programs for the \n     two ship designs. Under the down-select strategy, the Navy \n     would need training, maintenance, and support facilities to \n     sustain a fleet of 53 LCSs of the winning design. Facilities \n     would be required for both the Pacific Fleet and the Atlantic \n     Fleet--essentially one on each coast of the continental \n     United States. A more modest set of facilities would be \n     required to support the two ships of the losing LCS design, \n     which the Navy could presumably concentrate at a single \n     location. Under a dual-award strategy, the Navy would buy at \n     least 12 ships of each type, with an additional 31 ships of \n     either or both designs purchased after 2015. Thus, a more \n     robust training, maintenance, and support program would be \n     required for the version of the LCS that would have lost \n     under the down-select strategy. The Navy has said that those \n     costs are relatively small and more than offset by the \n     savings generated by the shipyards' bids, but CBO did not \n     have the data to independently estimate those additional \n     costs.\n       Finally, another, potentially large, cost would hinge on \n     whether the Navy decides in 2016 or later to select a common \n     combat system for all LCSs. Currently, the two versions of \n     the ship use different combat systems. If the Navy decided to \n     have both versions of the LCS operate with the same combat \n     system, it would incur research, development, and procurement \n     costs, as well as costs to install the new system on 12 of \n     the LCSs already equipped with an incompatible system. Combat \n     systems for the LCS today cost about $70 million each, not \n     including the cost to remove the old system and install the \n     new one. At a minimum, the Navy would lose some efficiency in \n     the production of the combat system under the dual-award plan \n     because neither producer of the combat system would have \n     provided more than 12 systems for installation on LCSs by \n     2015; under the down-select strategy, by contrast, one \n     producer would have provided 19 systems by that year. Thus, \n     the production costs of the combat system are likely to be \n     higher for ships purchased after 2016 under the dual-award \n     strategy than under the existing down-select approach because \n     the manufacturers of those later ships would have had less \n     experience building ships of the same type and thus fewer \n     opportunities to identify cost-saving practices. Furthermore, \n     the costs to operate two combat systems (or to switch to a \n     single combat system later) would probably exceed the cost to \n     operate a single system from the outset.\n       I hope you find this information helpful. If you have any \n     more questions, please contact me or CBO staff. The CBO staff \n     contact is Eric Labs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Douglas W. Elmendorf,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I strongly support the alternate engine for \nthe F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The evidence and the logic for an \nalternate engine easily overwhelm the flawed arguments that have been \nused to attack it. Investments in fighter engine competition will \nreduce costs over the life of the F-35 program. Not only will \ncompetition cost less than a single engine monopoly; competition also \nforces contractors to be more responsive and reliable. And the F-35 \nwill comprise a vast percentage of the U.S. strike aircraft fleet. With \njust one engine, our national security would rest on a single point of \nfailure. Sole-sourcing the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter engine is simply\n\n[[Page S10883]]\n\nthe wrong decision for our country, and I am glad that the continuing \nresolution will preserve funding for this program through March.\n  Though misinformation has been spread about the costs of the \nalternate engine, multiple nonpartisan reports suggest that it is \nhighly likely to save taxpayer dollars. According to Government \nAccountability Office testimony, the Congress can reasonably expect to \nrecoup investment costs over the life of the program. If the so-called \n``Great Engine War'' of the F-16 program is any example, the F-35 \nalternate engine might even yield 30 percent cumulative savings for \nacquisition, 16 percent savings in operations and support, and 21 \npercent savings over the life cycle of the aircraft. Not only would we \nsacrifice these potential savings by killing the F-35 alternate engine \nprogram, but that decision would waste the investment we have already \nmade in a competitive second engine. Ending fighter engine competition \nfor the F-35 is pound foolish without even being penny wise.\n  GAO also points to several possible nonfinancial benefits of engine \ncompetition, including better system performance, increased reliability \nand improved contractor responsiveness. News reports about the broader \nF-35 program reveal what happens when we sole-source crucial large, \nmultiyear defense programs. The F-35 faces a range of unanticipated \nproblems, delays and cost overruns. Even the independent panel on the \n2010 Quadrennial Defense Review--led by President Clinton's Defense \nSecretary, William Perry, and President Bush's National Security \nAdviser, Stephen Hadley--strongly advocated dual-source competition in \nmajor defense programs. Without competition, the American people will \nkeep paying more and more to buy less and less.\n  Without competition, our country's strike aircraft would be one \nengine problem away from fleet-wide grounding. Putting all of our eggs \nin the single engine basket would elevate risks to our troops and their \nmissions. Imagine our soldiers in Afghanistan stranded without air \nsupport simply because we were not wise enough to diversify the program \nto avoid engine-based groundings. With their lives on the line, we \ncannot afford to be irresponsible with this program.\n  The continuing resolution appropriately maintains funding for the \nalternate engine program. It does not allow for so-called new starts, \nbut neither does it bring programs to a premature end without the \ndebate and full consideration here in the Congress that they deserve. \nThe alternate engine program will rightly continue, and I expect that \nwhen programs receive scrutiny during budget consideration next spring, \nthe same will also be the case.\n  Ensuring engine competition is the right thing to do because it is \nthe smart thing to do. Although some have stressed the up-front costs, \ntaxpayers stand to save more money over the life of the F-35 program by \nmaintaining competitive alternatives. Most importantly, we will \npurchase a better and more reliable product for the people who risk \ntheir lives to defend our country. I will continue to support engine \ncompetition that ensures the best product for the troops at the best \nprice for the taxpayer.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the appropriations \nprocess and the need to return it to regular order. I come to the floor \nvery bitter that we have to pass this continuing resolution, CR. The \npower of the purse is our constitutional prerogative. I am for regular \norder. Regular order is the most important reform to avoid continuing \nresolutions and omnibus bills.\n  Regular order starts with the Appropriations subcommittees and then \nfull committee marking up 12 individual bills. Chairman Inouye has led \nthese bills out of Committee for the last 2 years, as Chairman Byrd did \nbefore him. Then the full Senate considers 12 bills on the floor and \nall Senators have a chance to amend and vote on the bills. This, \nhowever, has not happened since the 2006 spending bills. Lack of \nregular order means trillion dollar omnibuses or continuing \nresolutions. If a bill costs a trillion dollars, then opponents ask why \ncan't we cut it by 20 percent--what will it matter? But we are dealing \nwith actual money; it is not authorizing, which is advisory. There are \nreal consequences. If we are really going to tackle the debt, the \nAppropriations Committee must be at the table. Tackling the debt can't \nbe done just through Budget and Finance Committees alone.\n  What are the real life consequences of this CR? Well, this CR means \nthat it will be harder to keep America safe. Under this CR the FBI \ncannot hire 126 new agents and 32 intelligence analysts it needs to \nstrengthen national security and counter terrorist threats. The FBI's \ncyber security efforts will also be stalled, even while our Nation \nfaces a growing and pervasive threat overseas from hackers, cyber spies \nand cyber terrorists. Cyber security is a critical component to our \nNation's infrastructure, but this CR doesn't allow the FBI to hire 63 \nnew agents, 46 new intelligence analysts and 54 new professional staff \nto fight cyber crime. The DEA, ATF and FBI cannot hire 57 new agents \nand 64 new prosecutors to reduce the flow of drugs and fight violence \nand strengthen immigration enforcement along the Southwest border. \nUnder this CR, we leave immigration courts struggling to keep pace with \nover 400,000 immigration court cases expected in 2011 because they \ncannot add Immigration Judge Teams who decide deportation and asylum \ncases. We cannot hire 143 new FBI agents and 157 new prosecutors for \nU.S. attorneys to target mortgage and financial fraud scammers and \nschemers who prey on America's hard working, middle class families and \ndestroy our communities and economy. We miss the chance to add at least \n75 new U.S. deputy marshals to track down and arrest the roughly \n135,000 fugitive, unregistered child sexual predators hiding from the \nlaw and targeting children.\n  This CR stifles innovation and workforce development. In September, \nNorm Augustine and the National Academy of Sciences updated the 2005 \n``Rising Above the Gathering Storm'' report, sounding the alarm that \nthe U.S. is still losing ground in science that fuels innovations, and \nbrings us new products and new companies. Everyone says they are for \nscience, but it appears that no one wants to pay for it. So, under this \nCR, our science agencies, like the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology, NIST, and the National Science Foundation, NSF, will be \nflat funded. For NSF, this would mean 800 fewer research grants, and \n7,000 fewer scientists and technicians working in labs across the \ncountry on promising research in emerging fields like cyber security \nand nanotechnology. Under a CR, we will let the world catch up by not \nmaking new investments in science education. We won't just lose the \nPh.D.s who open avenues of discovery and win the Nobel Prize. We will \nalso lose the technicians who are going from making steel and building \nships to the new, innovation-based manufacturing economy, creating the \nnext high tech product. We will also lose the chance to build up \ntechnical education in key fields like cyber security. Under this CR, \nwe cannot expand the supply of cyber security specialists who are \nresponsible for protecting U.S. Government computers and information. \nWe miss the opportunity to triple funding for the NSF program to train \ncyber professionals for Federal careers, which has brought us more than \n1,100 cyber warriors since 2002 and of whom more than 90 percent take \njobs with Federal agencies.\n  I am also disappointed we will be passing this CR because I believe \nin the separation of powers established by the Constitution. Congress \nshould not cede power to the Executive Branch, regardless of which \nparty is in the White House. The Constitution gives the power of the \npurse to Congress. I will not cede the power to meet compelling human \nor community needs or create jobs for America and for Maryland. I don't \nwant to leave all funding decisions to bureaucracy.\n  On the Appropriations Committee, we did our work by reporting 12 \nseparate bills to the full Senate, but none came to the Senate floor. \nMy Commerce, Justice, Science--or CJS--Subcommittee held 6 hearings \nwith 14 witnesses to examine agencies' budget requests and policies. We \nheard from 4 inspectors general, IGs, from our major departments and \nagencies: Todd Zinser at Commerce, Glenn Fine at Justice, Paul Martin \nat NASA and Allison Lerner at NSF. We listened to agencies' officials, \nrepresentatives of organizations from sheriffs to scientists\n\n[[Page S10884]]\n\nand interested Senators. My CJS Subcommittee worked in a bipartisan way \nto craft a bill that makes America safer, invests in the American \nworkforce of the future and is frugal and gets value for taxpayer \ndollars. Under this CR, all of that work is wasted. Instead of \nfulfilling our constitutional duty of the power of the purse, we are \nleaving it to the Executive Branch to make key funding decisions with \nminimal direction from Congress.\n  As I travel around Maryland, people tell me that they are mad at \nWashington. Families are stretched and stressed. They want a government \nthat's on their side, working for a strong economy and a safer country. \nThey want a government that is as frugal and thrifty as they are. They \nwant to return to a more constitutionally based government. This CR is \nnot the solution.\n  Some Members might say that a CR is OK, it will save money, it \ndoesn't matter. Well, even though the CR provides less funding for CJS, \nit doesn't do it smarter because the CR is essentially a blank check \nfor the executive branch. Regular order provides direction, telling the \ngovernment to be smarter and more frugal, making thoughtful and \ntargeted cuts and modest increases where justified--not government on \nautopilot.\n  For example, my CJS appropriations bill tells agencies to cut \nreception and representation funds by 25 percent; eliminate excessive \nbanquets and conferences; cut overhead by at least 10 percent--by \nreducing non-essential travel, supply, rent and utility costs; increase \nfunding to IGs, the taxpayers' watchdogs at the agencies, and have \nthose IGs do random audits of grant funding to find and stop waste and \nfraud; and notify the committee when project costs grow by more than 10 \npercent so that we have an early warning system on cost overruns. These \nreforms are lost in any CR.\n  We should refocus on the Appropriations Committee. Many Senators have \nonly been elected for the first time in the last 6 years, so most have \nnever seen regular order and don't know what Appropriations Committee \nis supposed to be. The Appropriations Committee is ``the guardian of \nthe purse,'' which puts real funds in the Federal checkbook for the \nday-to-day operations of Federal agencies in Washington, and around the \nNation and the world. It performs oversight of spending by Federal \nagencies. And it serves as Congress's main tool to influence how \nagencies spend money on a daily basis. Why does this matter? It matters \nbecause the Appropriations Committee is the tool for aggressive \noversight and meeting the needs of our constituents. Agencies must \nrespond to Appropriations--their budgets depend on it.\n  We must preserve the separation of powers, oversight of Federal \nagencies and advocacy for our States and our constituents. I urge my \ncolleagues to return to the regular order, and look forward to \nconsideration of all 12 appropriations bills on the floor next year.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, when our colleagues from across the \naisle blocked the Omnibus appropriations bill they decided to leave our \nNation less safe and less prepared to thwart the next terrorist attack. \nThey chose to put our homeland security on autopilot for the next few \nmonths--and that is just too risky.\n  We had before us an Omnibus bill that addressed the evolving threats \nto our homeland security. As chairman of the Homeland Security \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I can attest to the diligent, bipartisan \nwork that went into crafting this legislation, which met our security \nchallenges in a fiscally responsible manner. But our colleagues across \nthe aisle chose instead to fund our homeland security at the status quo \nlevels under a continuing resolution. The terrorists aren't operating \nunder the status quo and neither should we.\n  The terrorists are constantly searching for new ways to threaten our \nway of life. We are approaching the 1-year anniversary of the Christmas \nDay bombing attempt, when a terrorist boarded a flight to Detroit with \nexplosives sewn into his underwear. And just in October, printer \ncartridges being shipped from Yemen were found to contain explosives \nthat were meant to blow up on cargo planes flying over the east coast \nof the U.S.\n  Homegrown terrorism is also a growing threat, as evidenced by the \nFort Hood shooting, the Times Square bombing attempt and the New York \nCity subway plot. Earlier this month, the FBI arrested a suspect who \nwas planning to blow up a military recruitment center in Baltimore. And \nlast month, the FBI stopped a U.S. citizen who planned a terrorist \nbombing at a Christmas tree-lighting ceremony in Portland, OR.\n  Because of the opposition to the Omnibus, our Department of Homeland \nSecurity and first responders across the country will not have the \nresources they need to anticipate, thwart, and respond to these \nthreats: The Transportation Security Administration will not be able to \npurchase new explosive-tracing equipment or hire more intelligence \nofficers and canine teams. We won't be able to hire more Federal air \nmarshals, who have been stretched thin since the Christmas Day bomb \nplot was foiled. Our airports and seaports won't get new equipment to \ndetect radiation and nuclear material. We will have fewer resources to \nsecure air cargo and eliminate threats like the package bombs from \nYemen. We will have less funding to secure our rail and transit \nsystems, which are prime targets for terrorists--as we've seen \neverywhere from Madrid and Russia to DC and New York City. The Coast \nGuard won't be able to hire 100 new maritime inspectors or improve \ntheir capacity to respond to an oil spill. Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement may have to cut back investigations into human trafficking, \ndrug smuggling and identity theft. There will be fewer Customs officers \non duty to keep dangerous cargo and terrorists out of our country. Our \nability to prepare for natural disasters and other emergencies will \nsuffer. Fewer local fire departments will receive needed assistance to \npay for equipment and training.\n  In short, the Republicans' decision to kill the Omnibus will \nshortchange our safety and take chances with our security--and that is \nwrong for our country.\n  Beyond homeland security, the Republicans' actions will leave our \ntroops worse prepared and our children without the education they \ndeserve.\n  The Omnibus crafted by Senator Inouye, on the other hand, responsibly \nmet all of these needs. And it did so at the exact same funding level \nproposed by the Republican leader in the Appropriations Committee \nearlier this year. In June, 40 Republicans voted to support funding the \ngovernment at this level. Moreover, the Omnibus was crafted on a \nbipartisan basis--and included earmarks and other spending requested by \nRepublicans.\n  So it is the height of hypocrisy and cynicism for our Republican \ncolleagues to attack this bill as wasteful or bloated. Adding to the \nhypocrisy, just two days after killing the Omnibus, which included a \nquarter billion dollars more for border security than the CR, \nRepublicans killed the DREAM Act--on the alleged basis that we should \nsecure the border first. They are clearly more concerned with handing a \ndefeat to our President and to congressional Democrats than with \ngoverning in a responsible way. Republicans have put politics first and \nit is our troops, our security and our children that will pay the \nprice.\n  In the aftermath of the wreckage caused by the Republicans' \nopposition to the Omnibus, Senator Inouye was faced with the challenge \nof drafting a slimmed-down continuing resolution that would not leave \nthe country vulnerable. This was an extremely difficult task, but \nSenator Inouye was able to craft a bill that provides the most vital \nresources our government needs to function over the next few months. \nThis was no small feat and I commend the chairman for his tireless work \non this bill and throughout this year's appropriations process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                      Nomination of Bill Martinez\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise in response to Senator \nSessions' comments about a nominee we are going to consider shortly, \nBill Martinez.\n  Senator Sessions just spoke about the ACLU for 30 minutes, trying to \ndefine Bill Martinez--a district court nominee, not the appeals court \nas Sessions noted--as an ACLU-like nominee and then criticizing his \nhearing responses on the death penalty and the\n\n[[Page S10885]]\n\nempathy standard. I wanted to clarify for the record three points of \nmisinformation.\n  Bill Martinez did not work for the ACLU. He served on an advisory \nboard regarding cases in Denver. Several Bush nominees were members of \nthe Federalist Society and contributors to other conservative \nlitigation centers and were confirmed just a few years ago. Bill \nMartinez is not the ACLU, and we ought to be careful to avoid setting \nfalse standards.\n  From the Martinez Hearing:\n\n       Senator Sessions: Have you ever acted as counsel in a \n     matter on behalf of the ACLU? If so, please provide the \n     Committee with a citation for each case, a description of the \n     matter, and a description of your participation in that \n     matter.\n       Martinez Response: No.\n\n  Senator Sessions claimed he was dissatisfied with Bill Martinez's \nresponse regarding the death penalty, stating that he was not clear in \nhis beliefs. This is misleading and the record states otherwise.\n  From the Martinez Hearing:\n\n       Senator Sessions: Please answer whether you personally \n     believe that the death penalty violates the Constitution.\n       Martinez Response: It is clear under current Supreme Court \n     jurisprudence that, with very limited exceptions, the death \n     penalty does not violate the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. \n     Constitution. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153 (1976); Roper v. \n     Simmons, 543 U.S. 551 (2005); Kennedy v. Louisiana, 129 S.Ct. \n     1 (2008). Consistent with this precedent, I do not believe \n     the death penalty is unconstitutional.\n\n  Senator Sessions also claimed that Bill Martinez stated empathy can \nbe taken into consideration with legal decisions. This is misleading \nand the record states otherwise.\n  From the Martinez Hearing:\n\n       Senator Sessions: Do you think that it's ever proper for \n     judges to indulge their own subjective sense of empathy in \n     determining what the law means?\n       Martinez Response: No.\n\n  Let me end on this note. Bill Martinez is a man of high character, he \nis a good man, and he will make an excellent Federal judge. Let us vote \nto confirm Bill Martinez to the Colorado U.S. District Court.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Under the previous order, the \nsecond-degree amendment is withdrawn. The question is on agreeing to \nthe motion to concur.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado.

Under the previous order, the Senate will go \ninto executive session to consider the following two nominations, which \nthe clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Benita Y. Pearson, of \nOhio, to be United States District Judge for the Northern District of \nOhio.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of William Joseph Martinez, \nof Colorado, to be United States District Judge for the District of \nColorado.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, is there an agreement as to the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 8 minutes total, 4 minutes on each \nside on both nominations in combination.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would assume the chairman, who will be \nspeaking in favor, would want to go first, and I yield to Senator \nLeahy.\n  Mr. LEAHY. No, go ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the two nominees today are nominees who \ncame out of the Judiciary Committee with substantial negative votes. \nMr. Martinez is a long-time member of the American Civil Liberties \nUnion. He has refused, when asked at the hearing, by myself and in \nwritten questions, to state whether he believes the Constitution of the \nUnited States prohibits the death penalty--not whether he believed in \nit. That is his prerogative. He hid behind the answer that the Supreme \nCourt says it is. But the ACLU holds to the view that the cruel and \nunusual punishment provision of the Constitution prohibits the \nimposition of the death penalty and, therefore, it is unconstitutional.\n  He refused to answer that question, and I believe that is an \nuntenable view. There are four references, at least, in the \nConstitution to the death penalty, and I do not know how somebody could \ntake the cruel and unusual clause to override specific references to \nthe death penalty which was provided for in every Colony and the \nFederal Government when the Constitution passed.\n  With regard to the other nominee, Mrs. Benita Pearson, she has some \nvery extreme views on animal rights. When asked by Senator Coburn \nwhether it would be in the best interests of a steer to be \nslaughtered--she was asked that in the committee--she said probably not \nin the best interests of the steer, sir. But then you have to look \nbeyond that. I mean, the steer is going to lose its life. It is a \npainful situation. And steers, evidence has shown, may have some idea \nor apprehension about the slaughter that is impending. But the next \nstep is, is it necessary to slaughter the steer in order to provide \nfood for those who might otherwise go hungry or perhaps be malnourished \nwithout the sustenance that this steer's flesh and hide could provide \nin terms of clothing and matters necessary for the well-being of \nanimals.\n  Basically, what I understand this to be is that she is suggesting a \ncourt should enter into some sort of balancing test on whether it is \nlegitimate to slaughter a steer, and also she is a member of the ALDF, \nthe defense of animals group, that is very extreme in its views.\n  For that reason, the National Cattleman's Beef Association and the \nFarm Animal Welfare Coalition strongly oppose the nomination. I think \nher views on this issue are out of the mainstream.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, President Obama nominated William J. \nMartinez to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the District of \nColorado last February. Mr. Martinez is a well-respected legal \npractitioner in Denver who has the strong support of both of his home \nState Senators. The statements earlier today from Senator Udall and \nSenator\n\n[[Page S10886]]\n\nBennet were compelling. They have been steadfast, forthright and \nexceedingly patient. I wholeheartedly agree with them that Bill \nMartinez should now, at long last, be confirmed. When he is, he will \nbecome only the second Hispanic to serve Colorado as a district court \njudge.\n  The Judiciary Committee favorably reported his nomination over 8 \nmonths ago, on April 15. It has been delayed ever since. In May we \nreceived a letter from the chief judge of the District of Colorado, \nJudge Wiley Y. Daniel, urging us to confirm Mr. Martinez because \nwithout additional judges ``it is impossible for the court to possess \nthe judicial resources that are necessary to effectively discharge the \nbusiness of the court.'' Despite that plea from the chief judge of the \ndistrict, the Senate has not been allowed to consider this nomination \nuntil today.\n  This is another example of the unnecessary delays that have led to a \njudicial vacancies crisis throughout the country. Judicial vacancies \nhave skyrocketed to over 100 while nominations are forced to languish \nwithout final Senate action. In fact, President Obama's nominees have \nbeen forced to wait on average six times longer to be considered than \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees reported by the Judiciary Committee \nduring the first 2 years of his Presidency.\n  I still do not understand why this nomination was subjected to a \nparty-line vote before the Judiciary Committee. I recall all the Bush \nnominees who were members of the Federalist Society and other \nconservative litigation centers who were confirmed just a few years \nago. Can it be that some are seeking to apply a conservative activist \nideological litmus test and discount Mr. Martinez' qualifications and \nwork experience?\n  Our ranking Republican Senator, Senator Sessions, reflected on the \nconfirmation process last year, saying:\n\n       What I found was that charges come flying in from right and \n     left that are unsupported and false. It's very, very \n     difficult for a nominee to push back. So I think we have a \n     high responsibility to base any criticisms that we have on a \n     fair and honest statement of the facts and that nominees \n     should not be subjected to distortions of their record.\n\n  I listened closely to the Senator's statement against Mr. Martinez \nbut heard nothing about anything Mr. Martinez had done or even any \nposition taken by the Colorado ACLU in which Mr. Martinez was involved. \nThere was nothing on which to base opposition to this qualified \nnominee. Certainly not the ``gotcha'' questions he was asked months \nago.\n  More than two dozen Federal circuit and district court nominations \nfavorably reported by the Judiciary Committee still await a final \nSenate vote. These include 17 nominations reported unanimously and \nanother 2 reported with strong bipartisan support and only a small \nnumber of no votes. These nominations should have been confirmed within \ndays of being reported. In addition, 15 nominations ready for final \naction are to fill judicial emergency vacancies. With judicial \nvacancies at historic highs, we should act on these nominations. During \nPresident Bush's first 2 years in office, the Senate proceeded to votes \non all 100 judicial nominations favorably reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee. That included controversial circuit court nominations \nreported during the lameduck session after the election in 2002. In \ncontrast, during the first 2 years of President Obama's administration, \nthe Senate has considered just 55 of the 80 judicial nominations \nreported by the Judiciary Committee.\n  Adding to the letters we have received recently urging us to take \naction to fill vacancies is one sent this week to the Senate leaders by \nthe National Association of Assistant United States Attorneys, a group \nof career prosecutors. John E. Nordin, vice president for membership \nand operations, writes:\n\n       Judicial vacancies in our federal courts are reaching \n     historic highs. Our members--career federal prosecutors who \n     appear daily in federal courts across the nation--are \n     concerned by the increasing number of vacancies on the \n     federal bench. These vacancies increasingly are contributing \n     to greater caseloads and workload burdens upon the remaining \n     federal judges. Our federal courts cannot function \n     effectively when judicial vacancies restrain the ability to \n     render swift and sure justice.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record. It \nconcludes, ``[w]e believe that all judicial nominees approved by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee are deserving of a prompt up-or-down floor \nvote.'' I agree with these career Federal prosecutors who understand \nthe vital importance of functioning courts and rely on them every day. \nIt is time for the Senate to act on the dozens of judicial nominees \nthat have been stalled from final consideration before we adjourn.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                            Assistant United States Attorneys,\n\n                                Lake Ridge, VA, December 17, 2010.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: \n     Judicial vacancies in our federal courts are reaching \n     historic highs. Our members--career federal prosecutors who \n     daily appear in federal courts across the nation--are \n     concerned by the increasing numbers of vacancies on the \n     federal bench. These vacancies increasingly are contributing \n     to greater caseloads and workload burdens upon the remaining \n     federal judges. Our federal courts cannot function \n     effectively when judicial vacancies restrain the ability to \n     render swift and sure justice.\n       As you know, thirty-eight judicial candidates have been \n     approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee and await a Senate \n     floor vote. A large number of these candidates have been \n     approved without controversy by unanimous consent. Some \n     candidates have been named to judgeships whose vacancies have \n     been designated as ``judicial emergencies'' by the Judicial \n     Conference, because of their high caseloads and the \n     significant periods of time that these judgeships have \n     remained unfilled.\n       We believe that all judicial nominees approved by the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee are deserving of a prompt up-or-\n     down floor vote. Thank you for taking the time to consider \n     our views on this issue and for your leadership.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           John E. Nordin, II,\n\n                                    Vice President for Membership,\n                                                   and Operations.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate is finally considering a \njudicial nomination that has been stalled since February on the \nExecutive Calendar. The nomination of Benita Y. Pearson to serve on the \nNorthern District of Ohio was reported favorably by the Judiciary \nCommittee more than 10 months ago. Judge Pearson is currently a Federal \nmagistrate judge on the court to which she is nominated. When \nconfirmed, she will become the first African-American woman to serve as \na Federal judge in Ohio.\n  I have reviewed the record and considered the character, background \nand qualifications of the nominee and join with the Senators from Ohio, \none a Democrat and the other a Republican, in supporting this nominee. \nFrankly, the opposition is a dramatic departure from the traditional \npractice of considering district court nominations with deference to \nthe home State Senators that know the nominees and their districts \nbest. I commend Senator Brown on his statement in support of the \nnomination today. As he noted, he worked closely with Senator \nVoinovich, the Republican Senator from his State and a judicial \nscreening commission in making this recommendation to the President.\n  The obstruction of these district court nominations is unprecedented, \na sign that a different standard is being applied to President Obama's \nnominees that has never before been applied to the nominees of any \nPresident, Democratic or Republican. Out of the 2,100 district court \nnominees reported by the Judiciary Committee since 1945, only five have \nbeen reported by party-line votes. Four of these party-line votes have \nbeen in this Congress, including the two of the nominations we consider \ntoday. In fact only 19 of those 2,100 nominees were reported by any \ntype of split rollcall vote at all, but five of them--more than 25 \npercent of the total--have been this Congress.\n  The party-line vote against this nomination in the Judiciary \nCommittee was without explanation. Judge Pearson has been a Federal \njudge magistrate for 8 years and a prosecutor before that. Nothing in \nher professional background justifies the delay or opposition to this \nnomination.\n  At her hearing, there were some who tried to make a mountain out of a \nmole hill with respect to a statement she made about animals. I just \nworked\n\n[[Page S10887]]\n\nwith Senator Kyl and Senator Merkley on a constitutional, legal \nprohibition against vicious videos that show animals being crushed. \nThat bill passed unanimously. No Senators thought twice about approving \nthat important legislation. I remember a couple of years ago when a \nfamous professional football player went to prison for his \nparticipation in a dog fighting ring. Many Americans were outraged by \nthose activities and no Senator questioned the State and Federal laws \nagainst such activities. Are those who oppose this nomination also now \nopposed to the Humane Society of the United States and to the \nlegislative actions we took since they involved animals?\n  I join the Senators from Ohio in urging the Senate to confirm Judge \nPearson without further delay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, there has been concern, as the \nchairman pointed out and the ranking member pointed out, on Benita \nPearson's views on animal law. With all due respect to my colleague, \nyou know it is a red herring. If you look at the record of Ohio's \nNorthern District, which goes back to 1839, there has been exactly one \ncase on animal welfare. Some 20 years ago, the Cleveland Zoo was sued \nto stop the transfer of Timmy the gorilla to the Bronx Zoo--I am not \nmaking this up--from transferring Timmy the Gorilla to the Bronx Zoo \nfor mating purposes. The case was dismissed. One case in 170 years.\n  Judge Pearson is qualified, say the two former presiding judges, \nChief Judges Carr and White, and the sitting presiding judge, Judge \nOliver from the Northern District--a combined 50 years' experience on \nthe district court.\n  Judge James Carr, the Chief U.S. District Judge at the time of her \nnomination, lauded Judge Pearson as ``a splendid choice . . . eminently \nwell-qualified by intelligence, experience . . . and judicial \ntemperament.'' His successor, Chief Judge Solomon Oliver, is just as \nsupportive of her nomination.\n  So is former Chief Judge George White, who wrote that:\n\n       Magistrate Judge Pearson's record as a Judicial Officer and \n     her litigation and business experience do more than idly \n     suggest her readiness to assume the position of District \n     Court Judge. Taken all together, you will be hard-pressed to \n     find a more suitable candidate.\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. These judges have made glowing reports on Judge \nBenita Pearson, who has been a magistrate, a CPA, practiced privately, \nworked for the U.S. Attorney's Office. She will be the first African-\nAmerican woman to sit on the Federal bench in Ohio. She has been \nsupported by Senator Voinovich and a bipartisan commission of 17 \nlawyers who picked her. She is a great choice. I ask the concurrence of \nmy colleagues. I yield to Senator Udall.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I rise to support the nomination of Bill \nMartinez. Senator Leahy made the case for his nomination and for him to \nbe confirmed. I have great affection for my friend from Alabama, but I \nwant to set the record clear that Bill Martinez did not work for the \nACLU, he advised the ACLU. If we are going to raise that standard and \nchange the rules, then we ought to remember that the Bush nominations \noften included Federalist Society members and contributors.\n  We ought to be careful about setting false standards. Bill Martinez \nwas recommended by a bipartisan nominating commission that Senator \nBennet and I created. He is a good man. His story is a quintessential \nAmerican story. He will be an excellent judge. I urge us all to vote \nfor his confirmation today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. How much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 5 seconds.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, Mr. Martinez, I know, has a lot of good \nsupporters and friends, as I have noted. But he did refuse to answer a \nsimple question of whether the U.S. Constitution prohibits the death \npenalty, which I believe the ACLU, of which he was a member and a \nmember of the legal panel, definitely favored.\n  I do believe Judge Pearson's view that somehow there should be a \nbalancing test about whether we should actually slaughter a steer based \non the need for food or hide is an extreme view also.\n  We have had about 15 members of the ACLU confirmed by this \nadministration. But we expect this President to submit mainstream \njudges. The ACLU is not mainstream in its positions. I do believe the \nadministration needs to understand that this is going to be a more \ncontentious matter if we keep seeing the ACLU chromosome as part of \nthis process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like nothing better than to vote on \nthe judges. We have a number of them who came out unanimously from the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. My friends from the other side are not even \nallowing votes on them.\n  We did not do that to President Bush in his first 2 years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof William Joseph Martinez, of Colorado, to be United States District \nJudge for the District of Colorado?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 67, the nays are \n28. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                            Predator Wolves\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I wish to rise to speak about an issue \nthat has been at the center of debate in the northern Rockies for quite \nsome time; that is, the issue of the wolf. The wolf was introduced into \nthe northern Rockies in the 1990s and has flourished. Wolves are now \nabundant in the region, but, unfortunately, we have not been able to \nreturn the management of the wolves to the State, mostly due to \nlitigation and to the inflexibility of the Endangered Species Act. In \nthe meantime, wolf populations are growing at a rate of about 20 \npercent a year, resulting in substantial harm to our big game herds and \ndomestic livestock.\n  Whenever I am back in Idaho, I hear from hunters who are angry their \nfavorite hunting spots are no longer rich with elk and deer or from \nsheep and cattle ranchers who have lost many a head of cattle or sheep \ndue to the wolf predation.\n  The State of Idaho has done everything it has been asked to do in \norder to manage wolves, and we continue to be denied that much needed \nopportunity. As such, it is time for Congress to act.\n  I intend to make a unanimous consent request in a few moments. First, \nI yield a few moments to my colleague from Idaho, Senator Risch.\n  Mr. RISCH. Madam President, I join my colleague from Idaho in \nunderscoring the difficulty we have on this issue. Most people on this \nfloor don't have a full appreciation of what those of us in the West \nhave to deal with. Two out of every three acres in Idaho are owned by \nthe Federal Government. The Federal Government came in, in the mid-\n1990s, and forced the wolf upon the State. The Governor didn't want it, \nthe legislature didn't want it, and the congressional delegation didn't \nwant it. Nonetheless, the Federal Government brought us 34 wolves. Now \nthey have turned into well over 1,000, and nobody knows exactly how \nmany breeding pairs there are. The result is that there has been \ntremendous havoc wreaked on our preferred species in Idaho, the elk. We \nhave done an outstanding job of managing elk, the preferred species, \nbut they are also the preferred species for the wolf to eat. They are \nnot vegetarians.\n  As a result, we have had a tremendous problem with wolves in Idaho, \nand we have brought a bill to the Senate to turn the management of \nwolves over to the State. All the other animals are managed by the \nState. We have done a great job for well over 100 years of managing two \nother difficult predators, the bear and various cats. We have done it \nresponsibly, on a sustained basis, and we want to do the same thing \nwith wolves.\n  The Federal Government has to let go of this. We have tried. We have \nthe Federal courts that have stepped in. I don't quite understand how \nthe Federal\n\n[[Page S10889]]\n\ncourt can claim the wolf is still an endangered species, when they can \nturn 34 wolves into over 1,000 and the population has exploded. \nNonetheless, they have. It is time for Congress to act.\n  I yield back to Senator Crapo.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I will make this request on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Risch, and the Senators from Utah, Mr. Hatch and Mr. \nBennett, and the Senators from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi and Mr. Barrasso.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks be discharged from further consideration of S. 3919, and that the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration; that the bill be read \nthe third time and passed; that the motions to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to the measure be printed \nin the Record, as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I do \nintend to object, first, let me point out to Senator Crapo, he and I \nhave worked together on the Water and Wildlife Committee and the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. I think we have had a fine \nrelationship over the past couple years, and we have worked together on \na series of bills that I think will improve water and wildlife in this \nNation. This legislation has not had a hearing and has not been \napproved by the Environment and Public Works Committee. It deals with \nundermining one of the most important laws in our country, the \nEndangered Species Act. That is one of our most important environmental \nlaws and has protected iconic species such as the bald eagle. The act \nhas long enjoyed bipartisan support. President Nixon signed the ESA \ninto law on December 28, 1973.\n  This bill attempts to solve politically what should be done by good \nscience. Despite many disagreements in the more than three decades of \nthe ESA, there has never been a removal of a species by Congress. Also, \nthere have been efforts made to work out a reasonable compromise as it \nrelates to the wolf. It is my understanding that it has been blocked on \nthe Republican side in trying to get that compromise brought forward.\n  I will make one more suggestion to my friend, Senator Crapo. As you \nknow, the work product of our subcommittee, along with other bills in \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, and some lands bills have \nbeen combined into one bill, Calendar No. 30, S. 3003. I encourage the \nSenator to look at that package. If we can get consent to include a \ncompromise on the gray wolf, we would be willing to try to get it done \nin the remaining hours of this session. I offer that to my friend.\n  Madam President, in its current form, I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has the floor.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of my colleague \nfrom Maryland and I appreciate working with him on the committee and I \nintend to continue working with him. This is an issue of utmost \nimportance in those States in this region of the United States. The \nlonger we wait to resolve this issue, the more difficult it will be. \nCooperation is the key in order for us to get this resolution \naccomplished.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I say to all my friends, it is \nimperative we work together to find a compromise. As both Senators from \nIdaho know, you and other Senators have been working on a compromise. \nUnder that compromise, Idaho could have a wolf hunt, as they should. \nThe State of Montana could have a wolf hunt, as Montana should. \nNorthern Utah could. All wolves in Utah would be off the endangered \nspecies list. I and others have suggested that wolves in northern Utah \nbe totally off the endangered species list. This proposal we have been \nworking on--you, myself, and others, including Secretary Salazar and \nthe Assistant Secretary of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Services, a \nshort time ago, all agreed we should allow wolf hunts in all the States \nI mentioned. Yet I have to be honest, your side of the aisle has \nobjected to that. You are not coming up with a total abolition, taking \nthe wolf out of the Endangered Species Act. That is a solution that \nwill not pass. We need a compromise.\n  I end where I began. I strongly urge Senators, next year, to keep \nworking on a compromise. This is not going to work when the House \npasses a bill that totally takes the wolf off the Endangered Species \nlist, which I know is the game plan. If that happens, we are back into \nthe soup again. Let's find a solution and compromise that achieves the \nresults we all want. It is within our reach. It is right there. Because \nof this interchange, we will not get it done this year. Our States \ndesperately need a solution. That proposal was the solution. It was a \ncompromise that achieved the results intended. I very much hope we can \nfind a compromise to resolve this.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, the compromise the Senator from Montana \nrefers to--and he is correct, we have been intensely working on this \nissue to find a compromise with the administration and the affected \nStates. The compromise he refers to would have required a change in the \nmanagement of the wolf in Idaho that was unacceptable to the Governor \nin Idaho and others, including myself and Senator Risch. Although there \nwas a proposal made, it is not correct that it was approved by \neverybody. I believe, though, we are making progress.\n  I am willing to work with the Senator from Montana and the Senator \nfrom Maryland and others to try not only to find further progress at \nthis late date in this session or next year, if necessary, to try to \nfind our way to that solution. I appreciate the willingness of both \nSenators to work with us in trying to find that compromise that will \nwork.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                    FCC Vote on Internet Regulation\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I know the subject we are on now is \nthe New START Treaty. It is a very important subject. I appreciate so \nmuch all the debate we have had. I hope we will be able to go forward \nand allow people to have amendments within this time because it is a \nhuge issue for our country.\n  I wish to speak on a different subject right now because it is so \ntimely. Today, the Federal Communications Commission voted 3 to 2 to \nimpose new regulations on the Internet. This is an unprecedented power \ngrab by the unelected members of the Federal Communications Commission, \nspearheaded by its chairman.\n  The FCC is attempting to push excessive government regulation of the \nInternet through without congressional authority. These actions \nthreaten the very future of this incredible technology. The FCC pursuit \nof Net neutrality regulations involves claiming authority under the \nCommunications Act that they do not have. Congress did not provide the \nFCC authority to regulate how Internet service providers manage their \nnetwork, not anywhere in the Communications Act nor any other statute \nadministered by the Commission.\n  Adopting and imposing Net neutrality regulations is, in effect, \nlegislating. It takes away the appropriate role of Congress in \ndetermining the proper regulatory framework for the fastest growing \nsector of our economy. The real-world impact of the FCC's action today \nis that it will be litigated. It will take 18 months to 2 years to sort \nthrough the briefings and the court decisions, and it will probably go \nto the Supreme Court of the United States. In the meantime, capital \ninvestment will slow in core communications networks, and I cannot \nthink of a worse possible time for that, as we attempt to create jobs \nand fuel a recovery from the most significant recession in years.\n  Elected representatives should determine if regulation is necessary \nin this area. Hearings would bring opposing parties to the table, and \nthe process would be open. Instead, an unelected and unaccountable \ngroup of regulators are creating new authority to intervene in an area \nthat represents one-sixth of the Nation's economy.\n  I wish to go through a few of the specific provisions in this FCC \norder. The first one is an order to require broadband providers, such \nas Comcast and AT, to allow subscribers to send and receive any \nlawful Internet traffic, to go where they want, say what they want, to \nuse any nonharmful online devices or applications they want to use.\n  These principles are widely supported. I don't object and neither\n\n[[Page S10890]]\n\nwould probably anyone. However, these principles are already in use. We \ndon't need a big regulatory intervention to accomplish these \nprinciples. It is the rest of the order that is diametrically opposed \nto this statement of openness and freedom. It installs a government \narbiter to force their idea of freedom on the users of the Internet and \non the companies that are trying to make the Internet the economic \nengine of America.\n  The first provision that deals with this is that networks must be \ntransparent. It says networks must be transparent about how they manage \ntheir networks, i.e., decisions about engineering, traffic routing, and \nquality of service. Transparency requirements usually translate to \nreporting and consumer disclosure requirements that are heavily \nprescribed and expensive to comply with, and the possible disclosure of \nproprietary information could affect competition. The real-world impact \nof this is higher costs to consumers. The Commission will increase \nregulatory reporting and consumer disclosure requirements as a result \nof this provision, and the cost will be passed along to, of course, the \nconsumers in the form of more expensive services.\n  The second provision is that you may not unreasonably discriminate. \nThe FCC's order states that providers may not unreasonably discriminate \nagainst lawful Internet traffic. That sounds fine. But the devil is in \nthe details. The term is vaguely defined in the order, and how the FCC \ninterprets and enforces what is unreasonable will determine how \nlimiting this restriction is. For instance, if a provider notices that \na small number of users are sharing huge files that are leading to \ncongestion on the network and determines that slowing down those \nconnections would relieve the congestion for the majority of other \nusers, the FCC would have the right, under this order, to determine \nthat such an action is unreasonable.\n  The real-world impact is that this would diminish the company's \nflexibility in managing their own services. The unreasonable \ndiscrimination provision could undermine the providers' ability to \nmanage their network and guarantee all the users a high quality of \nservice. Companies that build and maintain the networks that make up \nthe Internet need the flexibility to manage the exploding demand for \nservices on their network.\n  Regrettably, the FCC's order curtails that by establishing that the \nFCC would be an approval portal that companies would have to pass \nthrough to manage their day-to-day operations. Surely, there is a \nbetter way.\n  The next provision requires that broadband providers must justify new \nspecialized services. Under the FCC orders, providers would now have to \ncome to the FCC in order to offer consumers a new service, something \nthat would be creative and innovative. Instead of offering it to the \nmarketplace and having the competitive advantage from something new, \nthey have to now expose it to all of their competitors by going through \na regulatory adjudication at the FCC.\n  Let me give an example of what could happen.\n  A hospital might want to work with a provider, such as Verizon, to \noffer a new telemedicine service for Verizon subscribers that allows \npatients at home to interact with their doctors via high-definition \nvideo and uninterruptible remote medical monitoring.\n  In order to do this, Verizon might have to prioritize that \ntelemedicine traffic ahead of regular Internet traffic to ensure the \nappropriate quality of service, particularly if there is a life-\nthreatening situation.\n  The FCC order allows the Commission to determine on a case-by-case \nbasis whether such prioritization is actually unreasonable \ndiscrimination because presumably the hospital that is offering the \nservice would be giving better treatment for that telemedicine traffic \nthan the user's regular traffic.\n  Going through a whole regulatory process in order to offer that \nservice is a burden we do not need and that will stifle the innovation \nthat has been a hallmark of the Internet, which led to the explosion of \nopportunities there.\n  The Commission says it wants innovation to occur, but the language of \nthe order clearly discourages innovation by forcing companies to pass \nthrough a government regulatory turnstile to determine whether a \nparticular service, an innovative service, something new that might be \na competitive advantage, something new for quality of life, should be \nallowed. This puts the FCC in the position of picking winners and \nlosers among the new innovative services, and it certainly slows down \nthe opportunity to have new things coming on the market in what is \nusually a fast-paced economic environment.\n  In some cases, this may be enough to discourage providers from even \nentering into the special arrangements necessary to offer such \nservices. It is a cumbersome process and, furthermore, it is \nunnecessary.\n  In another provision, the FCC order will treat wireless broadband \nservices more lightly than wireline broadband services, at least for \nnow. The FCC reserves rights in this order, which are taken without \ncongressional authority, in my opinion--and certainly the courts will \nlitigate that and make its decisions--the FCC reserves the right to \nregulate wireless just as harshly in the future as they are now \nattempting to regulate wireline. For now, wireless providers will have \nmore leeway to innovate and to manage their networks. But how much \ninvestment are they going to make for the long term if they do not know \nwhat the FCC might foresee in the future that needs fixing, even if it \nis not apparently broken.\n  The real world impact is that wireless is the fastest growing area of \ncommunications markets. The threat that the Commission might later \napply the wireline prohibitions it has ordered today to this wireless \nmarketplace is a major concern.\n  I commend the two members of the Commission who dissented in the vote \ntoday--Rob McDowell and Meredith Atwell Baker. They each did op-eds, \none in the Wall Street Journal and one in the Washington Post. I would \nsay the common theme is that this is a solution where there is no \nproblem. We have an open Internet. We have an Internet that is working. \nIt does not need the heavy hand of government. It does not need a \ngovernment prism through which to determine if the Internet providers \nare doing an allowable service. We have a marketplace, and the \nmarketplace is working.\n  This is a time for Congress to take a stand. These regulations will \nraise uncertainty about the methods and practices communications \ncompanies may use to manage their networks. Heavy-handed regulation \nthreatens investment and innovation in broadband services, placing \nvaluable American jobs at risk.\n  Why would this be happening in a recession where we are trying to \nincrease jobs, where we are trying to stop the trajectory of \nunemployment in our country?\n  We need to lay off, and it is time for Congress to take a stand. \nIndividuals and businesses alike are rightfully concerned about \ngovernment attempts to seize control of the Internet. Senator Ensign, \nwho is the ranking member of a Commerce subcommittee--I am the ranking \nmember on the full Commerce Committee--together we are going to submit \na resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act in an \neffort to overturn this troubling regulatory overreach by the FCC. It \nis time for Congress to say we have not delegated this authority to the \nFCC. The FCC tried to do this once before using another part of the \nCommunications Act. They were struck down by the courts. Now they have \ngone to a different interpretation in a different section of the act to \ntry to gain the capability to obstruct freedom on the Internet.\n  It is a huge and serious issue on which I hope Congress will take the \nreins and say to the FCC: If we need regulation in this area, Congress \nwill do it.\n  We are elected. We are accountable. People can vote what they believe \nis the right approach by what we do. The FCC is not accountable to the \npeople of our country. Yes, they are accountable to the President and \nthe votes for today's order were from Presidential appointees of this \nadministration. It is another big government intervention where we do \nnot need to suppress innovation.\n  What we need is to embrace innovation so we can create jobs in this \ncountry with the freedom that has marked the economic vitality of \nAmerica for over 200 years.\n\n[[Page S10891]]\n\n  We will have a resolution of disapproval at the appropriate time in \nthe next session of Congress. I look forward to working with other \nMembers of Congress to take the reins on this issue. It is a \ncongressional responsibility.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I understand Senator Sessions is on the \nfloor and wishes to speak. I ask unanimous consent that the Chair \nrecognize Senator Sessions, and after Senator Sessions, recognize \nmyself and then Senator Shaheen, so we stay in order, if that is \nagreeable.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It is agreeable to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I wish to take a brief moment to \nexpress my pleasure in the fact that the continuing resolution that \npassed and will now be going to the House had within it a provision to \nallow the Navy to award the littoral combat ship competition to two of \nthe bidders. It took a bit of a modification of the procedure to allow \nthem to do that. It is a product of good news.\n  At one point in the late nineties, I chaired the Seapower \nSubcommittee of the Armed Services Committee. I have been a member of \nit. I have seen the development of the littoral combat ship concept. \nADM Vern Clark determined it was the future of the Navy. We expect to \nhave 55 of them in the fleet. They would be manned by only 40 sailors. \nThey would be high speed, able to travel in shallow waters, and be \neffective for pirates or be effective for mine sweeping and other \nactivities of that nature.\n  The House put in this language. We had a hearing in the committee a \nfew days ago with Admiral Roughead and Navy officials, Secretary of the \nNavy Mabus, and representatives from the CRS, GAO and CBO--those ABC \nagencies that evaluate these kinds of proposals--and it has moved \nforward.\n  I thank Senator Levin for his leadership. I thank Senator Inouye and \nSenator Cochran on our side and the House leaders also who saw fit to \nsupport the Navy's idea. It is not a plan I suggested, but it is one I \nbelieve is good.\n  The good news is this was enabled by the fact that as a surprise, the \nbids on the ships were very much below what was anticipated. The \nlegislation required that the bids come in under $480 million per ship, \nand it looks as if these bids are going to be at $450 million. By \nhaving both shipyards go forward, the Navy gets a fixed price today. In \nother words, if aluminum goes up or electricity goes up, the shipyards \nare going to eat it. We will bring on both ships at the same time.\n  Not only that, but we would get 20 ships total in this first tranche \nof ships rather than 19. In addition to that, the Navy scores that it \nwill save $1 billion, and that $1 billion they hope to apply to other \nships the Navy needs in their 313-ship Navy of the future.\n  Ashton Carter, the DOD's acquisition executive, said:\n\n       The U.S. Navy's recent decision to buy both classes of \n     Littoral Combat Ship due to lower than expected bid prices is \n     an example of what good competition can do.\n\n  It was a competitive bid. I think the Navy may have made a mistake in \nnot allowing more benefit to the bidders based on how valuable the ship \nwas, the total value, but they made it a rigorous cost competition and \napparently got very good bids. The average bids were, as I said, $450 \nmillion.\n  The Chief of Naval Operations, ADM Gary Roughead, on December 14--a \nfew days ago--testified before the Armed Services Committee. He said:\n\n       I think the two different types [of ships] give us a \n     certain amount of flexibility, versatility that one would \n     not, and as I talked earlier about this ability to mix the \n     capabilities of a force that we put in there.\n\n  This may have been when I asked a question about it at that same \nhearing. He said:\n\n       I . . . believe that the designs of the ships and the \n     flexibility of the ships . . . and also the cost of these \n     ships open up potential of foreign military sales that would \n     otherwise not be there.\n\n  In other words, not only could we create jobs, perhaps 3,000 to 4,000 \njobs immediately, but many of our allies, with the approval of the \nDefense Department, might want to buy these ships for their fleets, and \nwe would have the ability to export these products abroad.\n  Having been involved in seeing the vision of the Navy over a decade \nplus and to see that finally come to fruition is good. One Navy \nofficial was quoted in one of the major publications as saying the \nnature of these competitions is such there be a 100-percent chance of a \nprotest, whichever one won the bid, and one reason is because the bid \nwas so close. We will avoid a protest and will be able to move forward, \nget the ships faster, lock in the lowest possible cost, clearly lower \nthan what would be otherwise, and maybe even be able to save enough \nmoney to build an even larger ship with it.\n  I thank my colleagues who worked on this issue. I believe it will be \na good thing. One of the ships will be built in my hometown of Mobile, \nAL. I know how excited the workers at the shipyards will be to hear \nthey will have jobs in the future producing one of the finest, most \nmodern warships in the history of the Navy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, we are now only hours away from when we \nwill have a chance to vote on the ratification of the New START treaty. \nThe Senate has invoked cloture, so we are in that 30-hour postcloture \nperiod. We are now in a period where we need to consider some \nadditional amendments, and then we will be able to vote on the \nratification. I think that is good news for the United States, for \nnational security.\n  I think each Member of the Senate wants to do what is right for our \nnational security. And I wish to emphasize the point that whenever I \nlook at a national security issue, I want to get the best advice I can \nfrom the experts--from our military experts, from our experts who are \ncharged with making sure we have the best intelligence to protect the \nsecurity of America, from our diplomatic experts, who understand the \nramifications of what we do here and around the world in other areas of \nconcern for national security. I would say it is unanimous that the \nexperts are telling us it is in the security interests of the United \nStates to ratify the New START treaty.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, would the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. CARDIN. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I want to make a 1-minute comment \nabout a Navy fellow who has been in my office. I am reluctant to \ninterrupt, but the Senator is so eloquent, I know he can handle the \ninterruption almost better than anybody else.\n  CDR Brent Breining has been assigned to my office for the year by the \nNavy. I hope it has been beneficial to him. I think it has been. It has \ncertainly been beneficial to us on a host of matters. He is a man of \nability, of integrity and hard work, and he symbolizes the kind of \nbright young men and women we have so many of in our military. I wanted \nto take this moment to express my appreciation for his fabulous \nservice.\n  I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I thank my colleague for \nletting me interrupt him.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I am glad I yielded to Senator Sessions for that point \nbecause I do believe the fellows from the military assigned to our \noffices are extremely valuable in our work. I was fortunate to have CDR \nAndre Coleman in my office from the Navy, and I can tell you that what \nI learned from his presence in my office was important to me, and I \nthink it really made me much more informed when it came to decisions I \nhave had to make in the Senate. So this program is a very valuable \nprogram.\n  I was pleased to yield to the Senator so he could recognize the \nperson in his office. He is from the Navy? He is a Navy officer?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. A Navy officer, yes.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Navy officers are always the best, and coming from \nMaryland, where we have the Naval Academy, we were pleased to provide \nsome help to the Senator from Alabama.\n  If I can continue on the New START treaty, the real test here is the \nnational security of our Nation. When you listen to the advice given to \nus by our military experts, they tell us the ratification of New START \nwill enhance our national security. When you\n\n[[Page S10892]]\n\ntalk to the people who are responsible for collecting intelligence \ninformation and analyzing that information, they tell us it is in our \nnational security interest to ratify the New START treaty. When you \ntalk to the political experts, those who are charged with managing our \nforeign policy considerations around the world, they tell us the \nratification of New START will help protect our national security \ninterest.\n  The reason is that when you look at this treaty and find out what is \nin this treaty that restricts what the United States can do and you \nlook at the number of deployed warheads and the number of delivery \nvehicles we are permitted to have, our experts say those numbers are \nclearly achievable for us without compromising whatsoever all of our \nnational security interests. That is what they tell us. And these \nnumbers were not developed by the political system; they were developed \nby the military experts as to what is reasonable as far as limitations \non deployed warheads.\n  When you look at the other restrictions--and we have heard a lot of \ndebate that we are restricted on other defense issues. There is nothing \nin this agreement that limits missile defense issues. That is going to \nbe a matter for our national debate. It will be a matter, in working \nwith our allies, of analyzing where our current risks come from. But we \ncan make independent judgments, and we are not restricted at all by the \nNew START treaty as to how we make those judgments.\n  What is in this treaty is our ability to verify what the Russians are \ndoing with their nuclear stockpile and what they are doing with their \nwarheads and with their delivery systems. It allows us to have \ninspectors on the ground. Since the end of last year, we have not had \ninspectors on the ground. That is intelligence information that is \nextremely valuable for us to have. You can't substitute for that. Yes, \nwe can get certain intelligence information from the assets we have, \nbut having boots on the ground is critically important to our national \nsecurity. So without the ratification of New START, we do not have the \ninspectors on the ground telling us, in fact, what Russia is doing, \ninspecting the warheads, and inspecting their delivery systems.\n  There is a third reason in addition to it being important from the \npoint of view of what our experts are saying and in addition to the \nfact that it gives us verification. It also is a very important part of \nour national security system in working with other countries. We want \nto make sure we know what Russia is doing, yes. We understand Russia is \na country of interest to the United States. But when you look at \ncountries that are developing nuclear weapons, we need Russia's help \nand the international community working with us to make sure we prevent \ncountries such as Iran from becoming nuclear weapon states. The \nratification of this treaty will help us in those political efforts.\n  When you put all this together, it gives us what we need for \nverification. The restrictions in this treaty were worked out by our \nmilitary as being what they believed was right, and it gives us the \nability to continue to lead internationally not just on strategic arms \nreduction but on nonproliferation issues. So for all those reasons, I \nwould urge my colleagues to vote for ratification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I wish to thank the Senator from Maryland for being a \nterrific member of the Foreign Relations Committee, and I thank both \nhim and the Senator from New Hampshire for their help here on the floor \nthis afternoon as we try to proceed on amendments as rapidly as \npossible for our colleagues and also try to negotiate a few of these \namendments at the same time as the Senator from Arizona.\n  Having discussed with the Senator from Arizona the path forward, I \nassure colleagues that both of us hear the pleas of our colleagues, and \nwe are anxious to try to move as rapidly as possible. But in fairness \nto my colleague from Arizona, I also want to make certain that he has \nan opportunity to have his amendments and that the other amendments are \nproperly heard.\n  To that end, I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be \ndeemed as pending from those amendments filed at the desk. These would \nbe the amendments eligible for consideration. I am not calling them up \nyet; I just want this to be a narrow list.\n  I apologize, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that these \namendments be in order: Kyl No. 4864; Kyl No. 4892, as modified; Risch \nNo. 4878; Risch No. 4879; Ensign re rail-mobile; Wicker No. 4895; Kyl \nNo. 4860, as modified; Kyl No. 4893; and McCain No. 4900.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to make a comment. For the benefit of \nMembers, what we are trying to do is to identify those matters we need \nto try to deal with in the 30 hours postcloture on the START treaty. If \nMembers have amendments they need to deal with, I would appreciate it \nif they would either communicate with me or with Senator Lugar's staff \nor Senator Kerry's staff so that we can determine whether to get them \non the list and where to plug them in. I would also suggest to Members \nthat there isn't a lot of time left, and if they have comments they \nwould like to make, now is the time to come to the Senate floor. There \nshouldn't be a minute of quorum call time here. There is a lot to do \nand not a lot of time to do it. So if Members have something, bring it \nto us. If they want to speak, they should come to the floor now or as \nsoon as they can get here.\n  My goal is to get as many of the amendments as possible dealt with, \nif not with a vote then worked out by unanimous consent. What I have \ntried to do is to take a universe of about 70 amendments and to \nconsolidate them into a much smaller group. So there are some specific \nsubject areas that are not specifically dealt with. In some cases, the \nconsolidations may not be technically related. For example, Senator \nLeMieux would like to add to one of the amendments his language dealing \nwith tactical weapons taken from his treaty amendment but to conform it \nto a resolution of ratification amendment. So we may be even combining \nsome subjects that don't necessarily relate.\n  The object here is to cover as much ground as possible within a \nlimited period of time, and in order to do that we will need \neverybody's cooperation. Senator Kerry and I will then--and Senator \nLugar, of course--primarily try to make sure everybody gets heard who \nwants to be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am very grateful to the Senator from \nArizona for his willingness to try to do exactly what we have just \ndone, and I pledge to him that I will work as hard as possible on our \nside to rapidly move on these amendments and to give them time.\n  I would ask for the cooperation of colleagues who want to speak on \nthe treaty as a whole, that they not do so at the expense of being able \nto move an amendment. So if colleagues would cooperate with us, we will \ncertainly, in between any activity on amendments, try to accommodate \nanyone who wants to talk on the treaty.\n  We are currently working staff to staff and negotiating out these \namendments, and on some it may be possible to accept them. We will \ncertainly try to avoid any rollcall votes, if possible. I know a number \nof colleagues have asked for some rollcalls on some amendments which \nmay not be acceptable. So with that understanding--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. If I can add, I understand Senator Shaheen is in order to \nspeak next, and then Senator Risch is available to begin; am I not \ncorrect?\n  Mr. KERRY. No, Senator Shaheen is here managing together with the \nSenator from Maryland while we are negotiating. So Senator Risch would \nbe in order to move on an amendment immediately.\n  Mr. KYL. OK. His numbers are 4878 and 4879, so we can begin with one \nof those, if it is agreeable.\n  Mr. KERRY. That is correct.\n  Mr. President, we would welcome that, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. So, Mr. President, it would be in order to call up for \nconsideration--I believe the first is amendment No. 4878, Risch \namendment No. 4878.\n  Well, Mr. President, I said there shouldn't be any quorum call, but \nwe are going to be a couple of minutes here. So I suggest the absence \nof a quorum until we are ready to go.\n\n[[Page S10893]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, about an hour or so ago, our colleagues \nvoted on whether we should proceed to final debate and eventually to an \nup-or-down vote on whether to ratify the New START treaty. I think it \nis safe to say most Democrats, most Republicans--even those two \nIndependents who hang out with us--have pretty much decided on what \nthey want to do on that final vote. I think there is a handful of \nSenators, maybe a half dozen or so, who are still undecided and trying \nto make up their minds. I just want to say I respect that. It is a \nserious matter, very serious matter, and there are strong arguments to \nbe made on either side of this issue.\n  For those who have already made up their minds, they are probably not \nall that interested in what I have to say. But for the handful of our \ncolleagues who have not decided how they believe we should proceed, how \nthey ultimately want to vote, I want to take a few minutes and talk to \nthem.\n  I want to boil this down into four questions that I have focused on \nas I have looked at this issue, looked at the treaty, looked at its \nramifications. I want to start out by mentioning what I think the four \nmaybe critical questions are that we should be asking ourselves.\n  The first question is, does this treaty make us safer? I believe it \ndoes. I think absolutely it makes us safer.\n  The second question is, can we afford not to ratify this treaty? I \nbelieve the answer is no; we cannot afford not to ratify this treaty. \nWe need to.\n  The third question is, Can we go on to build a robust missile defense \nsystem, should we need to, if we ratify this treaty? I believe the \nanswer is yes; we can do that if we need to.\n  The fourth and final question I want us to ponder is, Is ratification \nof the New START treaty the last word on this issue? Quite frankly, the \nanswer is no, not at all. In fact, ratification of this treaty would \njust be another step, an important step, in what has been a decades-\nlong journey. What I would like to do, if I could, is to take these \nquestions just one question at a time.\n  The first question is, Does this treaty make us safer?\n  One of the greatest threats, and some would say the greatest threat, \nto our country and to its people today is the chance that terrorists \nmight somehow acquire a nuclear weapon and detonate it inside this \ncountry. I ask my colleagues, are we doing all that we need to do to \nstop this from happening?\n  Sure, we can try to hunt down all the terrorists before they strike. \nIn fact, we are doing that now. But we will never know where every \nterrorist is hiding, and I doubt we will ever have the manpower \nnecessary to hunt them down if we did know where they were and try to \nstop them.\n  Here is what we do know, however. We know where most of the nuclear \nweapons on this planet are today. The majority of them are either in \nRussia or they are in the United States. I would like to think we do a \ngood job of securing our nuclear weapons facilities in the United \nStates. But Russia, as most of us know, is another story. There is a \nreason terrorists target Russian nuclear facilities.\n  While Russian security has improved recently, there are still holes, \nsome would say gaping holes, in the physical facilities of some Russian \nfacilities, holes that leave openings for terrorists to gain access to \nthese weapons. That is one of the reasons we need to ratify this \ntreaty. It limits the number of warheads that Russia can hold. Fewer \nRussian warheads translate into fewer chances that those weapons, those \nwarheads, will fall into the wrong hands.\n  Here is another reason to ratify this treaty: Since the original \nSTART treaty expired at the end of 2009, the United States has been \ndenied the ability to track and to verify the status of Russian nuclear \nweapons. The U.S. and Russian cooperation on verifying and monitoring \nwarheads under the original START treaty helped lay the groundwork \nunder the Nunn-Lugar cooperative threat reduction program in the 1990s. \nThis program worked and still works to secure and dismantle Russian \nnuclear weapons, to keep them from falling into the hands of terrorists \nor rogue regimes.\n  New START will restore our verification and tracking capabilities \nthat we lost last year with the expiration of the original START \ntreaty. This, in turn, will encourage Russia to continue and to \nparticipate in the Nunn-Lugar program. In short, Americans will be \nsafer if the treaty before us is ratified.\n  That leads me to the second question, Can we afford not to ratify \nthis treaty? I believe the answer is no; no, we cannot. Let me say why.\n  My colleagues opposing this treaty have pointed out what they believe \nto be flaws in it. Some of them say the United States should have held \nout for a better deal. Others say the United States should have \nincreased the number of allowed inspections or increased the number of \ndelivery systems allowed under the treaty. They say the job of the \nSenate is not to simply ratify treaties but to debate and to amend \nthem.\n  Let me just say, if this were a seriously flawed treaty, I would \nagree or if this were a flawed treaty I would agree. But it is not. The \nfact that so far all the amendments offered to this treaty have failed, \nmostly by large majorities, bears witness to that fact. Sure, we could \namend the treaty language to maximize the U.S. position. We could send \nour diplomats back to the negotiating table with the Russians with a \nwhole new set of terms the Russians will find unacceptable and \nultimately nonnegotiable. When the Russians then walk away from the \ntalks and the prospects of securing a new treaty die, we will ask \nourselves, was it worth it to oppose ratification? Was it worth it?\n  When a Russian nuclear weapon goes missing and we are left in the \ndark because U.S.-Russian cooperation on tracking and dismantling \nwarheads died with the treaty, we will ask ourselves, was it worth it \nto oppose ratification?\n  I believe the answer is no. Every living former Secretary of State \nfrom Kissinger to Baker to Rice shares that opinion.\n  Several former Secretaries of Defense, including Secretaries \nSchlesinger, Carlucci, Perry, and Cohen, all believe we ought to ratify \nthis treaty in order to make our country--our country--safer. I might \nadd, our top intelligence people agree with them.\n  This unlikely bipartisan coalition has come to this conclusion \nbecause they are certain that failure to ratify New START leaves our \ncountry less safe and more at risk to terror. We ignore the collective \nwisdom and advice of these leaders, past and present, at our peril. \nThey have no axe to grind. They are calling it like they see it. I hope \nwe will search our hearts--every one of us--and our minds this week and \ncome to the same conclusion they have.\n  Question No. 3 was: Can we build a robust missile defense system if \nwe ratify this treaty? That is an important question. The answer is \ntoo. And the answer is, yes, we absolutely can. There is simply nothing \nin this treaty that limits the United States from building the kind of \nmissile defense system we might want and that we might need.\n  You do not have to take my word for it. Last month the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, ADM Mike Mullen, bluntly stated, ``There is \nnothing in the treaty that prohibits us from developing any kind of \nmissile defense.''\n  Let me say his words again. ``There is nothing in the treaty that \nprohibits us from developing any kind of missile defense.'' Those are \nnot my words. Those are his words. Nothing, nothing in the treaty \nprohibits us from doing that.\n  Just last week Secretary Gates said that the treaty ``in no way \nlimits anything we want or have in mind on missile defense.'' Let me \nrepeat that as well. He said, ``The treaty in no way limits anything we \nwant or have in mind on missile defense.'' In no way.\n  Simply put, this treaty gives us both what we want and what we need. \nIt reduces the number of nuclear warheads Russia can possess, and it \ndoes so without constraining U.S. missile defense and deployment.\n  Some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, who have made \nup their minds that they will oppose ratification, dispute the \nstatements of\n\n[[Page S10894]]\n\nboth Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen. Clearly, that is their right \nto do so. These opponents to the treaty argue that this treaty would, \nin fact, create limitations on our ability to build and deploy a \nmissile defense system. With all due respect to them, I do not believe \nthat is true. And, more importantly, neither do our top military and \nintelligence leaders, upon whom our Nation depends. They do not believe \nit is true either. In supporting this argument, some of the treaty's \ncritics point to a provision which states we cannot convert nuclear \nmissile launchers into missile defense launchers. We have all heard \nSenators Kerry and Lugar respond to this assertion. We do not want to \nmake these conversions. We do not want to make these conversions. Why? \nBecause it is not cost effective. It is cheaper to build new silos \nrather than convert the old launchers. This is not a limitation on \nmissile defense. It is common sense. It is cost effective. And it is \ncertainly not a reason to vote against this important treaty.\n  Question No. 4 again. Question No. 4 was: Is ratification of New \nSTART the last word on this issue? And the answer is, not at all. This \nis not the last word. In fact, ratification is another step, albeit an \nimportant one, in a decades-long journey. Ratification reflects a \nvision shared by Presidents Nixon, Carter, Reagan, Clinton, George \nHerbert Walker Bush, and George W. Bush, as well as the people of our \ncountry, and the people of the Russian Federation.\n  Realizing that vision is vitally important both to Russians and to \nAmericans, our two nations must join to lead the global community on \nthe issue of nuclear disarmament. If we do not, no one else will.\n  The next step in realizing that vision requires us to ratify this New \nSTART treaty that is before us this week. Once we have done so, we \nshould turn to redoubling our efforts to work with Russia, with China, \nand our allies to pressure Iran and North Korea to give up not their \nnuclear energy programs but their nuclear weapons programs. And as we \ndo that, we should continue working toward future agreements with the \nRussian Federation on reducing tactical nuclear weapons.\n  Fortunately, in the resolution of ratification that contains the New \nSTART treaty language, there are instructions added by the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee that order--that order--the Obama \nadministration to pursue agreements on the limits of tactical nuclear \nweapons with Russia as well. Two weeks ago, Secretaries Clinton and \nGates said they would pursue such an agreement with the Russian \nFederation in the coming years. However, we cannot continue down that \npath without first ratifying New START. And we must.\n  Let me conclude today by asking my undecided colleagues, however many \nthere are out there, one final question. Here it is: How often do we \nsee in this body nearly every major national security official from \njust about every Presidential administration of the last four decades \ncome together to support one initiative like this? How often? The \nanswer is, not very often, at least not on my watch.\n  As a captain in the Navy, as my State's Congressman, and Senator, as \nGovernor of Delaware, and commander in chief for a while of our State's \nNational Guard, I learned a long time ago that the best way to make \ntough decisions, to make the right decision, is to gather together the \nbest and brightest minds that we can, people with different \nperspectives, urge them to try to find common ground, and then provide \ntheir recommendations to me.\n  In the case of this treaty, many of the best and brightest national \nsecurity minds our Nation has ever seen, names such as Kissinger, \nPowell, Schlesinger, Baker, Hadley, Scowcraft, Shultz, Rice, Nunn, \nWarner, Lugar, Kerry, Clinton, Bush, and Gates, agree that we should \nratify New START and ratify it now.\n  I urge my colleagues who are still undecided on this critical issue \nto join me, to join us, in moving our Nation forward by voting to \nratify this treaty.\n  Before I yield the floor, I want to take a moment to salute Senator \nLugar. I thank you and thank your staff for the terrific leadership you \nhave provided for years on these issues, along with Sam Nunn, all of \nthose years ago, and with John Kerry and others today.\n  I am going to thank Senator Kerry for the terrific leadership and the \ngreat support he has gotten from his committee, from the staff, to get \nus to this point today.\n  I am encouraged that we may have the votes to finish our business and \nto conclude by ratifying this treaty tomorrow. I hope that handful of \nour colleagues who are out there who are still trying to figure out \nwhat is the right thing to do will maybe find some words in the wisdom \nI share today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4855\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we set aside \nthe pending amendment and call up amendment No. 4855.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4855.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4855\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the Treaty to provide for a clear definition of \n                         rail-mobile missiles)\n\n       In Part One of the Protocol to the New START Treaty, in \n     paragraph 45. (35.), strike ``and the self-propelled device \n     on which it is mounted'' and insert ``and the self-propelled \n     device or railcar or flatcar on which it is mounted''.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of this \namendment, which would clear up any ambiguity by adding the rail mobile \ndefinition of START I to the New START treaty.\n  Specifically, my amendment would amend the protocol annex, part one, \nin terms and definitions protocol. Specifically under START I the \ndefinition of rail mobile launchers of ICBMs means an erector launching \nmechanism for launching ICBMs, and the rail car or flat car on which it \nis mounted.\n  Unfortunately, there is no such definition in New START. According to \nKonstantin Kosachev, the head of the Duma International Affairs \nCommittee, Senator Kerry's counterpart in the Duma, the understanding \non rail mobile ICBMs presumes that: ``The Americans are trying to apply \nthe New START treaty to rail mobile ICBMs in case they are built.''\n  So their definition, their understanding, the Russians' \nunderstanding, is that rail mobile is not included in this treaty. That \nis according to Mr. Kosachev's statement in the Duma. By making this \nstatement, we can infer that it is absolutely Russia's position that \nrail mobile ICBMs are not captured by this treaty or subject to the \ntreaty's limitations. So this is an issue we must address and we must \nclarify.\n  The administration, in a State Department fact sheet, asserts that \nrail mobiles are covered under the 700 ceiling of deployed delivery \nvehicles in article II. However, Mr. Kosachev's statements imply to the \ncontrary. Further, if rail mobiles were to fall under that cap, it \nwould be in the definitions. There is zero mention of rail mobiles in \nNew START.\n  My amendment simply clarifies this ambiguity. In the absence of New \nSTART limitations on rail mobile ICBMs and launchers, an unlimited \nnumber of these could be deployed. It may even be possible to take a \nroad mobile SS-27 ICBM, including multiple warhead versions, and put it \non a railcar. This would not in any way violate the conditions of the \nNew START limits, because the earlier START I limits on rail mobile \nlaunchers and nondeployed mobile ICBMs do not appear in this New START.\n  Another way to clarify that ambiguity would be if the administration \ngave us full access to the negotiating records. Since they have not, \nhowever, we must amend the treaty to amend the definition back to as it \nwas in START I.\n  What happens if the Russian Duma, in its ratification process, adds \nlanguage in its version of their ORR, that excludes rail mobile \nlaunchers? What do we do at that time? If they do this, I would think \nwe would have no choice but to simply take it.\n  Mitt Romney highlighted eloquently in an op-ed that:\n\n\n[[Page S10895]]\n\n\n       The absence of any mention of rail based launchers should \n     be remedied. U.S. advocates of the treaty say that if Russia \n     again inaugurates a rail program, as some articles in the \n     Russian press have suggested it might, rail mobile ICBMs \n     would count toward the treaty limits. Opponents say that no \n     treaty language supports such an interpretation. Russian \n     commentators have said that rail-based systems would be \n     discussed by the Bilateral Consultative Commission. Such \n     ambiguity should be resolved before the treaty is approved, \n     not after.\n\n  I will yield to the Senator from Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the amendment speaks to concerns about rail \nmobile missiles. First, I would emphasize it is important to note that \nneither side currently deploys rail mobile systems.\n  The Nunn-Lugar program destroyed the last SS-24 rail mobile system in \n2008. They are all gone. Destroyed. The New START treaty is \nspecifically drafted so that if Russia were to revive its rail mobile \nprogram, it would count under New START's central limits. This is \nunderscored in our resolution of ratification through an understanding \nthat if such systems are ever deployed by Russia, they will count as \ndeployed ICBMs under New START, and that such railcars on BMs.\n  I submit that the amendment is unneeded. But more seriously, if in \nfact it were to be adopted, it would require renegotiation of the \ntreaty. For that reason, as well as others I have stated as succinctly \nas possible, I oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Just to address the one point on the clarification in the \nresolution of ratification, it has been said that our resolution of \nratification clarifies and we should not need this language in the \ndefinition. Here is the problem I have.\n  Several years ago when we were debating the Chemical Weapons \nConvention and riot control agents, there it is right there in the \nresolution of ratification that these riot control agents can be used \nin operations to protect civilian life. Yet to this day, our State \nDepartment lawyers continue to argue they cannot, even though in the \nresolution of ratification we clearly stated that these riot control \nagents, tear gas basically, could be used to protect civilian life. Yet \nour State Department continues to argue against that. That is why \nputting it in the definitions within the treaty, we believe, is \nimportant to clarify the difference we seem to have with the Russians \nbased on statements they have made to the press.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this won't take too long. Let me say, first \nof all, I thank the Senator for bringing this up. Let me underscore: \nThis is one of the sort of let's see if we can find a problem, and if \nwe can find a problem, make it into a bigger problem, and then amend \nthe treaty because amending the treaty itself--this amendment seeks to \namend the treaty, so here we go right back down the road of the old \n``let's open up the negotiations again'' argument. We have been through \nit so many times here. It has appropriately been rejected by \ncolleagues.\n  I think the last vote was something like 66 to 30 on whether we will \namend the treaty. That doesn't mean he doesn't have a right to raise \nit, but let me speak to the substance.\n  Going back in history on the START treaty, which is why this is a \ncomplete red herring--if you go back in the history of the START \ntreaty, you will recall that the Soviet Union deployed 10 warheads, 10 \nMIRV warheads on an SS-24 intercontinental ballistic missile, and \nRussia deployed some 36 of those SS-24 rail-based launchers the Senator \nis referring to at the height of their deployment. But to comply with \nSTART I and with START II, which interestingly, we worked together on \nin terms of START II even though the Russians never ratified it--and \nthe reason they didn't ratify it is because we took unilateral action \nand withdrew from the ABM treaty, and they were mad about it. That is \nwhy what we do matters in this relationship. We ratified the START II \ntreaty; they didn't. So the things we choose to do have an effect.\n  The fact is, thanks to our colleague to my right, the distinguished \nSenator from Indiana, Mr. Lugar, and Senator Nunn, who had the vision \nto put together the threat reduction program, that program set out to \ndestroy Russia's SS-24 ICBMs and rail-based launchers.\n  This is important for all those people who have come to the floor and \nargued repeatedly that Russia has acted in bad faith in all of these \nefforts. Take note that Russia continued those cooperative efforts and \ncontinued to destroy those rail-based launchers even though they had \nnot signed on to START II. Guess what. The last Russian SS-24 launcher \nwas eliminated in 2007.\n  Now START I had a specific sublimit on mobile missiles and on rail \nmobile missiles. So the START treaty's definition, as a result of those \ntwo sublimits, the START treaty's definition needed to cover both the \nrail mobile and the road mobile launchers that were deployed at the \ntime of the treaty. They were both put under the same roof, and that \nroof was the START treaty's definition. Just like the Moscow Treaty, \nthe New START treaty contains just a plane limit, an overall limit on \nICBMs and ICBM launchers, SLBMs and SLBM launchers. We have the two \ncategories and heavy bombers with no sublimits.\n  That means the characteristics of strategic offensive arms limited by \nthe treaty, in particular the deployed and the nondeployed launchers of \nICBMs and the deployed ICBMs and their warheads, those characteristics \ndo not hinge on the treaty's definition of mobile launchers of ICBMs. \nWe don't want them to because we want this big umbrella that covers all \nof it, which we have the ability to verify.\n  If we look at exactly what the treaty says, it says the following--\nand I don't know which lawyers are arguing about this, but the lawyers \ninvolved between the Russians and the United States and the lawyers \ninvolved on the negotiating team and the lawyers at the State \nDepartment are not arguing about this. They understand exactly what the \ntreaty says.\n  Here is what it says. Article II, 1(a) of the treaty sets the limit \nof 700 deployed ICBMs, deployed submarine-launched ballistic missiles \nand deployed heavy bombers. That is really simple. It is very \nstraightforward--700 ICBMs, SLBMs, bombers. We have the flexibility to \ndecide how many of each of those we want to have. We had a debate \npreviously with our colleagues about how many we would have. But that \nis pretty straightforward. There is no ambiguity in that. Where is the \nambiguity--700, all three, and we believe we can count all three. \nParagraph 12 of part 1 of the protocol defines deployed ICBM as an ICBM \nthat is contained in or on a deployed launcher of ICBMs. That is pretty \nobvious. A launcher is a launcher is a launcher.\n  Paragraph 13 of part 1 of the protocol defines deployed launcher of \nICBMs as an ICBM launcher that contains an ICBM and is not an ICBM test \nlauncher, an ICBM training launcher or an ICBM launcher located at a \nspace launch facility. Those are the only three exceptions. That is it. \nThere is no ambiguity.\n  It seems to me pretty darn straightforward that a rail mobile ICBM, \nif either side decided to deploy it, obviously falls under the 700. It \nis so obvious that we should not have to risk renegotiating the entire \ntreaty over something as obvious as that.\n  I might add, a nondeployed launcher of a rail mobile would fall under \nthe 700 limit in terms of the launchers. I just ask my colleagues to \nlook carefully at this. It would be highly improbable.\n  The Senator from Tennessee earlier today gave a terrific speech, Mr. \nAlexander. He said: What is all this fuss about? In the end, we are \ngoing to have thousands of these things that can destroy the whole \nplanet anyway.\n  That came from a person who is pretty thoughtful on these issues, who \nunderstands that you have to put this in a context. We are not talking \nabout the Cold War right now. We are not talking about the Soviet Union \nright now. We are talking about a country with which we have a very \ndifferent relationship and where we have a whole set of combined \ninterests, and you have to put this treaty into that context. It is \nhighly unlikely that during the duration of this treaty with the \nRussian Federation, after years of working with the United States to \ndestroy the weapons and work cooperatively under Senator Lugar and \nSenator Nunn's program, it is unbelievably hard to believe\n\n[[Page S10896]]\n\nthey are going to divert what we know to be their very limited \nresources and infrastructure from their planned deployment in order to \ndo new mobile--we have a planned deployment of new mobile-based ICBM \nforces, and suddenly to have them go out and build and deploy rail \nmobile launchers, which we would observe unbelievably quickly under our \nnational technical means.\n  The simple answer is that we know what they are going to do. We have \na strong capacity to track what they are doing. We have every reason to \nbelieve the Russians agree with what I just said about the allocation \nof resources. The fact is, the resolution the Senate will vote on, in \norder to guarantee that we are certain about this, requires the \nPresident to communicate to the Russians in the formal instrument that \nratifies the agreement, when we ratify it, assuming we do it, will \nratify the understanding of the United States that the treaty would \ncover rail mobile launched ICBMs and their launchers, if Russia or the \nUnited States were crazy enough to try to build them. So for the life \nof me, I don't know what you can do more than that. But we certainly \nare not going to reopen the treaty for the basis of a nonambiguity like \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I wish to add parenthetically a footnote to \nthe chairman's presentation.\n  As has been mentioned frequently during this debate, for a variety of \nreasons, the Russians reduced the number of ICBMs below the totals that \nwere required by the former treaty. Some Senators, in fact, have said \nthe New START treaty, by imposing these limits of 1,550 warheads and \n700 launchers, inhibits only the United States because, according to \nthose who have argued this, Russia has already fallen below these \nlimits.\n  Let me add, as a point of personal recollection, one of the reasons \nthe Russians are below some of the standards that have been suggested \nis, as they thought more and more about the rail mobile situation, they \ndecided this was either useless, expensive, or so vulnerable to \npotential attack that it was not worth maintaining.\n  As a result, as has been suggested, as it turned out, using the \nCooperative Threat Reduction Program, the United States and Russia, \nquite outside of the last treaty, decided we would proceed under the \nCooperative Threat Reduction Program to simply destroy all the rest of \nthe rail, which we did.\n  Just for the sake of exhibit, I have a piece of one of the last rails \nto be destroyed. It was presented to us by the Russians with a proper \ninscription on the back of it, recognizing their appreciation to the \nUnited States for this destruction. Therefore, logically, to argue that \nwe are back into a predicament of the Russians wanting to build rails \nagain and launch missiles and what have you from them negates the \nhistory of cooperation, conversations that may have occurred well \nbeyond the treaty but that have come from the fact that there were \nAmericans working with Russians who were not involved necessarily in \nspecifics of the treaty but, in fact, were able to effect results that \nwere well beyond what the treaty mandated.\n  I mention this, again, to indicate that I believe the amendment is \nunnecessary. But worse still, adoption of it would, in fact, eliminate \nour consideration today. We would go home. It is finished.\n  I certainly encourage Senators, recognizing that the Russians don't \nwant the rails, have actually worked in the Cooperative Threat \nReduction Program with Americans to get rid of all of it, plus \neverything associated with them, that as a commonsense situation that \nseems to be fairly well under control. Even then, the statements we \nhave adopted as a part of the treaty take care at least of the counting \nsituation if, for any reason, such an emergence should occur again on \nthe rails.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in response to the last argument that the \nRussians don't have any incentive to and we don't believe they are \ngoing to build the rail mobile system again, I ask, then: What is the \nbig deal about ensuring in the treaty that if they do, they would be \ncounted under the 700? What is the problem? The problem appears to be \nthat the Russians don't have the same view of this as do my colleagues \nor the United States Government.\n  My colleague from Nevada quoted earlier from the Interfax report of \nOctober 29, 2010, where the chairman of the Russian Duma--parliament--\ncommittee responsible for treaties, Konstantin Kosachyov, stated--in \nresponse to the argument we have just made, that the Senator from \nNevada just made, that the treaty should include rail-mobile as part of \nthe 700 limit--he stated, in response to that claim, and in response to \nthe resolution of ratification of the Foreign Relations Committee, that \nU.S. claim compelled the Duma to stop action on the treaty. He said--\nand I am quoting:\n\n       The Americans are trying to apply the New START Treaty to \n     rail-mobile ICBMs in case they are built.\n\n  That, obviously, means if he is saying: We would have to stop the \nDuma action on this if that is what the U.S. Government is going to \nclaim, they are pushing back on this pretty hard. The question is, why? \nI do not know whether they intend to build the rail-mobile system. I do \nnot much care whether they build it. All we care about is, if they do, \nit has to be included within the 700 limit.\n  Now, the report language of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nconfirms the fact that they are not included. Here is what the report \nlanguage says--and this is in direct contradiction to what was said \njust a moment ago--this is from page 17 of the report--\n\n       Nevertheless, while a new rail-mobile system would clearly \n     be captured under the Article II limits despite the exclusion \n     of rail-mobile launchers from the definition of mobile \n     launchers of ICBMs, those provisions that actually use the \n     defined term ``mobile launcher of ICBMs'' would not cover \n     rail-mobile systems if Russia were to reintroduce them.\n\n  ``Would not cover.''\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       ``Appropriate detailed arrangements for incorporating rail-\n     mobile ICBM launchers and their ICBMs into the treaty's \n     verification and monitoring regime would be worked out in the \n     Bilateral Consultative Commission.'' Under Article XV . . . \n     the Parties may make changes to the Protocol or Annexes. . . \n     .\n\n  We have discussed this in the past. If there is a dispute about what \nthe treaty means, then you go to this dispute resolution group of \nRussians and Americans, and they try to talk it out and work it out. \nBut there is nothing to say they will, and if the Russian chairman of \nthe committee is already saying we are trying to insert something into \nthe agreement that isn't there, I wonder how successful we would be in \nworking it out.\n  The report concludes:\n\n       If Russia were again to produce rail-mobile ICBM launchers, \n     the Parties would work within the BCC to find a way to ensure \n     that the treaty's notification, inspection, and monitoring \n     regime would adequately cover them.\n\n  So it is clear that it does not. It is clear from the report that the \nlanguage would not cover rail-mobile systems if Russia were to \nreintroduce them. It is clear we would have to rely upon the Russians' \ngood offices, good intentions, to reach some kind of an agreement with \nus in the Bilateral Consultative Commission. There are no assurances \nthat will be done.\n  Why are we willing to proceed with an agreement that has such built \nin ambiguity? Why say: Well, we will let that be worked out by the BCC \nwhen we could work it out right now? It is the same answer we get with \nrespect to every one of these proposals: Well, the Russians would then \ndemand to renegotiate the treaty.\n  I ask again: Is the Senate just to be a rubber stamp? We cannot do \nanything to change the treaty or the protocol, or just the resolution \nof ratification, which is what we are trying to do because the Russians \nwould say no, and, therefore, we cannot do it?\n  I thought we were the Senate. We are one-half of the U.S. Government \nthat deals with it. The other is the Executive. The Executive \nnegotiated the treaty. Now, why didn't they include this language? We \ndo not know because we do not have the record of the negotiations. What \nI am told is that it is because the Russians said they would not \ninclude it because the rail-mobile system would be unique to Russia, \nand we do not have such a thing. Therefore, there would be a lack of \nparity. You could not have such a unilateral provision. So if that is \nthe case, either the\n\n[[Page S10897]]\n\nRussians do intend to develop these systems, and they do not want them \ncounted, or there should be no problem with the Ensign amendment, which \nwould ensure that they would be counted.\n  So you cannot read the report language and agree with what has been \nsaid--that the treaty covers these weapons--you cannot read it and \nbelieve they would clearly be covered by the inspection and \nnotification and monitoring regime. In fact, it clearly shows that is \nnot the case. What you have to believe is that this built-in dispute in \nthe treaty may well arise if the Russians decide to proceed to develop \nsuch a system, and we would then--or would arise if they decide to do \nthat, and we would be required to go to the BCC to try to work it out \nwith them. That, obviously, builds in a conflict that is not good.\n  As I said before, when you have a contract between two parties, the \nfirst thing the lawyers try to do is ensure there are no ambiguities \nthat could cause one side or the other to later come forward and say: I \ndid not mean that. Then you have a legal dispute. But it is one thing \nto have a legal dispute about buying a car or a house. It is quite \nanother to have a dispute like this between two sovereign nations.\n  I would note when the United States had a system we might develop, \nsuch as the rail-mobile--but we have not made a decision to do it; we \ncertainly do not have it--the Russians knew we wanted to at least study \nthe possibility of developing a conventional Prompt Global Strike \ncapability--that is to say, an ICBM that could carry a conventional \nwarhead rather than a nuclear warhead--and they specifically insisted \nthat we include that in the treaty.\n  Now, you might say: Well, wait a minute. The Russians apparently \nargued that they did not want to include anything on rail-mobile \nbecause the United States did not have anything on rail-mobile, and \nthat would be a lack of parity--it would be a unilateral restriction--\nbut the same thing is true with conventional Prompt Global Strike. The \nRussians have no intension of doing that, apparently. We might, just \nlike for the rail-mobile, the Russians might. Yet they insisted a \nlimitation be put on our conventional Prompt Global Strike--by what?--\nby counting them against the 700 launcher limit--exactly the same thing \nthat should be done with regard to rail-mobile.\n  So, apparently, if we might do something in the future the Russians \ndo not like, we have to count it. But if the Russians might do \nsomething in the future we do not like, we cannot count it. Our only \nrelief then is to go to this BCC and hope the Russians would agree to \nsomething in the future that they have not been willing to agree to \ntoday.\n  So all the Ensign amendment does is to clear up an ambiguity and \navoid a future dispute between the parties. It is clear from the report \nthat it is not covered now. Again, the language, ``those provisions \nthat actually use the defined term `mobile launchers of ICBMs' would \nnot cover rail-mobile systems if Russia were to re-introduce them.''\n  The report acknowledges that, therefore, in order to apply the \ninspection and notification and monitoring regimes, you would have to \nget the Russians to agree in the BCC. Why not solve that problem right \nnow?\n  Again, we meet with the same argument we are always met with: Well, \nwe do not dare change anything in here because the Russians would \ndisagree.\n  I just ask my colleagues, again, is there any purpose for us being \nhere? If every argument is, well, we do not dare change it because the \nRussians would disagree, so we would have to renegotiate it, maybe that \nsuggests that there was not such a hot job of negotiating this treaty \nin the first place. If the Senate cannot find errors or mistakes or \nshortcomings and try to correct them without violating some \nsuperprinciple that is above the U.S. Constitution, which says that the \nSenate has that right, then, again, I do not know what we are doing \nhere.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the Ensign amendment, as with some \nother things we have raised, to try to avoid a conflict. Resolve the \nsituation now while we still have time to do it rather than after the \ntreaty is ratified when it is too late.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I appreciate the concerns my colleague \nfrom Arizona is raising in regards to mobile launchers, particularly as \nit relates to rail-mobile launchers. But I am reading the same language \nthe Senator has put on the floor, and it says very clearly that it is \nsubject to the 700 limit. I think what my colleague is referring to is \nthe fact that Russia today does not have rail-mobile launchers. So, \ntherefore, there are other protocols in the treaty in regard to \ninspection, et cetera, that are not provided for in this treaty because \nit is not relevant since Russia today does not have rail-mobile \nlaunchers. But if they were to develop rail-mobile launchers, they \nwould be subject to the 700 limitation of launchers, if it was being \ndeployed. The consultation process will work out the procedures for \nadequate inspection.\n  So I think it is already covered under the treaty. In the language of \nthe treaty Senator Kerry mentioned it is clear to me it is covered. But \nin the report language I think it is stating the obvious.\n  One last point, and that is, again, you do not dispute the fact that \nif we were to adopt this amendment, it would be the effect of denying \nthe ratification of the treaty until it was modified in Russia, which \nis the same as saying we are not going to get a ratified treaty on this \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, might I pose a question to my colleague \nbecause I understand exactly the point he makes. He makes it \naccurately. I quoted the language that says that it would clearly be \ncaptured under article II limits. That is the committee's \nunderstanding, which is the point my colleague is making. But I go on \nto note that the exclusion of rail-mobile launchers from the definition \nmeans that it would not cover rail-mobile systems if Russia were to \nreintroduce them and, therefore, there would have to be work by the BCC \nto figure out how to deal with those under the inspection, monitoring, \nand notification regimes.\n  I understand that our committee says they believe they are captured. \nI see that in the report. What I am saying is, there is a dispute \nbecause the Russians do not appear to agree with that. I would just ask \nmy colleague, how do you square, then, the Russian response? The \nchairman of their committee--you have dueling committees--in the Duma \nsaid:\n\n       The Americans are trying to apply the New START Treaty to \n     rail-mobile ICBMs in case they are built.\n\n  It appears to me what he is saying is, but they should not be doing \nthat. In fact, his recommendation, I believe, was the Duma not take \naction on the treaty if that was our intent.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes, of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. To me, it is the language of the treaty itself. The \nlanguage of the treaty itself is pretty clear as to what the definition \nof a launcher is, with three exclusions. Just look at the language of \nthe treaty that any type of launcher would be covered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, if I could just close, and I actually had, \nI think, yielded the floor. So I appreciate the chance to make this \nfinal point.\n  All the Ensign amendment tries to do is clear up the ambiguity. My \ncolleague says it is absolutely clear to him that they are included. I \nknow the committee says they think it is clear. I do not think the \nRussians think it is clear, and I think there is a basis for an \nargument that it is not clear. Why not clear it up?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, the answer to the question--why not clear \nit up--is because if you clear it up the way the Senator is trying to, \nyou kill the treaty. Pretty simple.\n  The Senator keeps asking the question, Why can't we do this? We can't \ndo it because it kills the treaty. It is pretty simple. And the Senator \nknows it kills the treaty.\n  Now, going beyond that, come back again just for an instant to the \nsubstance. First of all, the Russian general\n\n[[Page S10898]]\n\nstaff--I have been known, as chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, to make some comments which occasionally the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff do not agree with. My comments are not going to drive them to do \nwhat they do not agree with. Likewise, the chairman of their foreign \nrelations committee whom he quotes was tweaking us in his comment. But \nthe fact is, the general staff of Russia has made it abundantly clear \nthey do not want to build these rail-based mobile. They have no \nintention of doing this. They have just been destroying them. They have \nbeen taking them down and destroying them in a completely verifiable \nmanner, and the Senator from Arizona cannot contest that. He knows that \nis absolutely true.\n  So this is a completely artificial moment designed, as others have \nbeen, to try to derail--no pun intended--the treaty.\n  That said, let me also point out that if you want to try to rein in \nthis issue of rail-based, this amendment is not the way to do it \nbecause there are a whole series of protocols set up in the treaty for \nhow you deal with road-based launchers, and you would need to begin to \nput in place a whole different set of protocols in order to deal with \nrail-based. So if, indeed, the Russians are, as I said, crazy enough, \nas they think it would be crazy--that is the way they define it now and \nwe do too--to go back to something we have spent the last 15 years \ndestroying, if that happens, we will know it. Moreover, if it happens, \nit is counted, as the Senator has agreed, under the article II limits \nfor launchers. So this is a nonissue, with all due respect.\n  I know the Senator from Nevada wants to take 2 minutes to make a \ncomment, and then I wish to make a unanimous consent request, if I \ncould, after that.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I think the Senator from Arizona wishes \nto make a statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Before my colleague from Nevada closes, I know this whole \nargument is based on the proposition that the Russians wouldn't be \ncrazy enough to think about doing a rail system again so we don't need \nto worry about it. What is all the fuss, is what my colleague said.\n  Well, here is a December 10--how many days ago is that now? I have \nforgotten. We are about to Christmas, but I have forgotten the date of \ntoday. It is from Moscow ITAR-TASS, English version. Headline: ``Russia \nCompletes Design Work For Use Of RS-24 Missiles On Rail-based \nSystems.''\n  I want my colleague from Massachusetts to hear this. The Russians \naren't crazy enough to think they could do a rail system. Here is the \nheadline, December 10: ``Russia Completes Design Work For Use of RS-24 \nMissiles On Rail-based Systems.''\n  Just to quote a couple lines from the story:\n\n       Russia has completed design work for the use of RS-24 \n     missiles railway-based combat systems, but implementation of \n     the project has been considered inexpedient, Moscow Heat \n     Engineering Institute Director Yuri Solomonov said. His \n     institute is the main designer of these missiles. Asked \n     whether the RS-24 missiles could be used in railway-based \n     systems, he said, ``This is possible. The relevant design \n     work was done . . . '' and so on.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Russia Completes Design Work for Use of RS-24 Missiles on Rail-Based \n                                Systems\n\n       Moscow, December 20 (Itar-Tass)--Russia has completed \n     design work for the use of RS-24 missiles railway-based \n     combat systems, but implementation of this project has been \n     considered inexpedient, Moscow Heat Engineering Institute \n     Director Yuri Solomonov said.\n       His institute is the main designer of these missiles.\n       Asked whether the RS-24 missiles could be used on railway-\n     based systems, Solomonov said, ``This is possible. The \n     relevant design work was done, but their development was \n     deemed inexpedient. I agree with this because the \n     survivability of this system is not better than that of the \n     ground-based one, but it costs more.''\n       The RS-24 Yars missile system was put on combat duty in \n     Russia this summer.\n       Earlier, the chief designer of the Moscow Heat Engineering \n     Institute, which created the system, said that one of the RS-\n     24 systems had already been delivered to the Strategic Rocket \n     Forces at the end of last year.\n       Solomonov said, ``All journalists are writing about Bulava, \n     but are saying little about the new mobile missile system RS-\n     24 Yars with multiple warheads that we created at the same \n     time.''\n       The Strategic Rocket Forces intended to deploy the missile \n     system RS-24 with multiple warheads in December 2009, \n     Commander of the Strategic Rocket Forces Lieutenant-General \n     Andrei Shvaichenko said in October 2009.\n       ``The intercontinental ballistic missile RS-24 put into \n     service will reinforce combat capabilities of the attack \n     group of the Strategic Rocket Forces. Along with the single-\n     warhead silo-based and mobile missile RS-12M2 Topol-M already \n     made operational the mobile missile system RS-24 will make up \n     the backbone of the attack group of the Strategic Rocket \n     Forces,'' the general said.\n       Silo-based and mobile missile systems Topol-M, as well as \n     RS-24 mobile missile systems were designed by the Moscow Heat \n     Engineering Institute.\n       The warheads of Russia's newest Topol-M and RS-24 \n     intercontinental ballistic missiles can pierce any of the \n     existing of future missile defences, Strategic Rocket Forces \n     Commander, Lieutenant-General Sergei Karakayev said earlier.\n       ``The combat capability of silo-based and mobile Topol-M \n     ICBMs is several times higher than that of Topol missiles. \n     They can pierce any of the existing and future missile \n     defence systems. RS-24 missiles have even better \n     performance,'' Karakayev said.\n       The Strategic Rocket Forces have six regiments armed with \n     silo-based Topol-M missiles and two regiments armed with \n     mobile Topol-M missiles. Each missile carries a single \n     warhead. This year, Russia began deploying RS-24 ICBMs with \n     MIRVs. There is currently one regiment armed with RS-24 \n     missiles.\n       Speaking of other ICBMs, Karakayev said that RS-20V \n     Voyevoda (Satan by Western classification) would remain in \n     service until 2026. ``Their service life has been extended to \n     33 years,'' he said.\n       On July 30, 1988, the first regiment armed with RS-20B \n     Voyevoda missiles was placed on combat duty in the Dombarovka \n     missile formation in the Orenburg region.\n       ``This is the most powerful intercontinental ballistic \n     missile in the world at the moment,'' the press service of \n     the Strategic Rocket Forces told Itar-Tass.\n       With a takeoff weight of over 210 tonnes, the missile's \n     maximum range is 11,000 kilometres and can carry a payload of \n     8,800 kilograms. The 8.8-tonne warhead includes ten \n     independently targetable re-entry vehicles whose total power \n     is equal to 1,200 Hiroshima nuclear bombs. A single missile \n     can totally eliminate 500 square kilometres of enemy \n     defences.\n       By 1990, Voyevoda missiles had been placed on combat duty \n     in divisions stationed outside of Uzhur, Krasnoyarsk \n     Territory, and Derzhavinsk, Kazakhstan. Eighty-eight Voyevoda \n     launch sites had been deployed by 1992.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I am not arguing that this issue has been \nresolved within Russia as to whether to go forward. I am not arguing \nwhether it is a good thing or a bad thing. I simply submit it in \nresponse to the argument that the Russians would be crazy to think \nabout doing this. Either they are crazy or--well, in any event, I would \nnever attribute that motivation to anybody, even somebody from another \ncountry. The fact is, they have begun design work on exactly such a \nproject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. It is my understanding that the Russian referred to in \nthat article is saying how difficult it is to do the rail-based. But \nhere is the simple reality. If they build it, it will count, end of \nissue. That is why this is unnecessary.\n  I yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, to wrap up this debate, let me address, \nfirst of all, the whole idea that changing this treaty in any way kills \nthe treaty. Under the Constitution, certainly it is the President's \nrole, the administration's role, to negotiate the treaties. We all \nrecognize that. But under the Constitution, the Senate is tasked with \nadvice and consent. That means we are to look at the treaties, and if \nwe think they should be changed--and we have changed treaties over the \nyears--then we are free to change the treaties. That is why there is a \nprocess set up, such as this amendment process, to change the treaties. \nSo if we have fundamental objections to the treaty, I think we can have \na debate on whether we should, on a particular amendment, change the \ntreaty on the merits of the amendment, but we shouldn't just say we \ncan't change any part of a treaty because it kills the treaty, because \nwe have a constitutional role in advice and consent on whether we \napprove treaties.\n\n[[Page S10899]]\n\n  Just a couple points to make.\n  First of all, this is from the State Department's Bureau of \nVerification, Compliance, and Implementation. I ask unanimous consent \nthat it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[From the Bureau of Verification, Compliance, and Implementation, Aug. \n                                2, 2010]\n\n           Rail-Mobile Launchers of ICBMs and their Missiles\n\n       Key Point: Neither the United States nor Russia currently \n     deploys rail-mobile ICBM launchers. If a Party develops and \n     deploys rail-mobile ICBMs, such missiles, their warheads, and \n     their launchers would be subject to the Treaty.\n       Definitions: The New START Treaty defines an ICBM launcher \n     as a ``device intended or used to contain, prepare for \n     launch, and launch an ICBM.'' This is a broad definition \n     intended to cover all ICBM launchers, including rail-mobile \n     launchers if they were to be deployed again in the future. \n     There is no specific mention of rail-mobile launchers of \n     ICBMs in the New START Treaty because neither Party currently \n     deploys ICBMs in that mode. Russia eliminated its rail-mobile \n     SS-24 ICBM system under the START Treaty. Nevertheless, the \n     New START Treaty's terms and definitions cover all ICBMs and \n     ICBM launchers, including a rail-mobile system should either \n     Party decide to develop and deploy such a system.\n       A rail-mobile launcher of ICBMs would meet the Treaty's \n     definition for an ICBM launcher. Such a rail-mobile launcher \n     would therefore be accountable under the Treaty's limits.\n       Because neither Party has rail-mobile ICBM launchers, the \n     previous definition of a rail-mobile launcher of ICBMs in the \n     START Treaty (``an erector-launcher mechanism for launching \n     ICBMs and the railcar or flatcar on which it is mounted'') \n     was not carried forward into the New START Treaty.\n       If Russia chose to develop and deploy rail-mobile ICBMs, \n     such missiles and their launchers would be subject to the \n     Treaty and its limitations. Specific details about the \n     application of verification provisions would be worked out in \n     the Bilateral Consultative Commission. Necessary adjustments \n     to the definition of ``mobile launchers of ICBMs''--to \n     address the use of the term ``self-propelled chassis on which \n     it is mounted'' in that definition--would also be worked out \n     in the BCC.\n       Accountability: A rail-mobile launcher containing an ICBM \n     would meet the definition of a ``deployed launcher of \n     ICBMs,'' which is ``an ICBM launcher that contains an ICBM.''\n       Deployed and non-deployed (i.e., both those containing and \n     not containing an ICBM) rail-mobile launchers of ICBMs would \n     fall within the limit of 800 for deployed and non-deployed \n     launchers of ICBMs and SLBMs and deployed and non-deployed \n     heavy bombers.\n       The ICBMs contained in rail-mobile launchers would count as \n     deployed and therefore would fall within the 700 ceiling for \n     deployed ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers.\n       Warheads on deployed ICBMs contained in rail-mobile \n     launchers therefore would fall within the limit of 1,550 \n     accountable deployed warheads.\n       Applicable Provisions: Separate from the status of the \n     rail-mobile ICBM launcher, all ICBMs associated with the \n     rail-mobile system would be Treaty-accountable, whether they \n     were existing or new types of ICBMs, and therefore would, as \n     appropriate, be subject to initial technical characteristics \n     exhibitions, data exchanges, notifications, Type One and Type \n     Two inspections, and the application of unique identifiers on \n     such ICBMs and, if applicable, on their launch canisters.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, let me just read one paragraph from \nthis:\n\n       If Russia chose to develop and deploy rail-mobile ICBMs, \n     such missiles and their launchers would be subject to the \n     Treaty and its limitations.\n\n  That is according to our State Department.\n\n       Specific details about the application of verification \n     provisions would be worked out in the Bilateral Consultative \n     Commission.\n\n  So, in other words, if Russia decides to build these things, then the \nverification has to be worked out by the Bilateral Consultative \nCommission. It isn't that it is set in there exactly what would happen, \nbut the verification certainly would have to be worked out.\n  The bottom line is, we believe there is ambiguity because of the \nstatements made by the Russians themselves. That is the problem. If the \nRussians, in their statements in the Duma, if they have been saying: \nYes, we agree with exactly the interpretation the Americans have been \nmaking, it would be a different story and we probably wouldn't need \nthis amendment. But because their statements--Senator Kerry's \ncounterpart in the Russian Duma has said the Americans are trying to \nbring into this New START treaty mobile launchers, and the Russians \ndon't think they should be in there. So we think we should clarify that \nlanguage in a very unambiguous way, based on my amendment, to make sure \nthere is no question on each side.\n  I appreciate what the Senator from Massachusetts is saying, that they \nhave destroyed their--it would be crazy for them to build them again. \nBut as the Senator from Arizona just talked about, they are at least \ndesigning. Maybe they have a better system to use for rail-mobile \nlaunchers. We don't know that. But what we do know is, they don't think \nthis language applies, the language in the treaty applies to the mobile \nlaunchers. So they could get around this treaty and the number of \nwarheads they could have, based on the language that is currently in \nthe treaty.\n  I just ask our colleagues to seriously consider removing the \nambiguity and voting for the Ensign amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I don't think we need to repeat. I \nappreciate the Senator from Nevada and I understand what he is saying. \nI completely agree with him about the advice and consent role of the \nSenate, but part of that role is to make a judgment about whether the \nconsequences of some particular concern merit taking down the whole \ntreaty and putting it back in the renegotiation process. It is not that \nwe can't or shouldn't under the right circumstances; it is a question \nof balancing what are the right circumstances. We are arguing, I think \nappropriately, because the report of our committee says clearly that \nrail-mobile will be covered under article II and this is unnecessary. \nSo weighing it that way, it doesn't make sense to do it.\n  Let me say to my colleagues that I think we want to move to the Risch \namendment, and I think it is the hope of the majority leader to try to \nhave two votes around the hour of 6 o'clock, if that is possible, and \nthen to proceed to the Wicker amendment.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4878\n\n  Mr. RISCH. Madam President, I wish to call up amendment No. 4878.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Risch] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4878.\n\n  Mr. RISCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide a condition regarding the return of stolen United \n                       States military equipment)\n\n       At the end of subsection (a) of the Resolution of \n     Ratification, add the following:\n       (11) Return of stolen united states military equipment.--\n     Prior to the entry into force of the New START Treaty, the \n     President shall certify to the Committees on Armed Services \n     and Foreign Relations of the Senate that the Russian \n     Federation has returned to the United States all military \n     equipment owned by the United States that was confiscated \n     during the Russian invasion of the Republic of Georgia in \n     August 2008.\n\n  Mr. RISCH. Madam President and fellow Senators, I bring you what I \nbelieve to be the first amendment to the resolution of ratification. We \nhave had a number of amendments that have been to the actual treaty \nitself. We have listened to objection after objection that: Oh, my \ngosh, we can't possibly amend the treaty because if we do, we are going \nto have to sit down and talk to the Russians again.\n  We don't have to worry about that with this amendment. This is an \namendment to the resolution of ratification. It will not require that \nwe sit down with the Russians and negotiate. Frankly, I don't know what \nis wrong with that. Frankly, I think it is a good idea after all the \nproblems that have been raised with the treaty. But, nonetheless, if \nthat is an overriding concern, you can set that aside and listen to the \nmerits of the amendment.\n  I have to tell my colleagues that part of this I bring as a matter of \nfrustration. I have been involved with this for months, and I am so \ntired of hearing about accommodation after accommodation after \naccommodation to the Russians. It appears, before we even\n\n[[Page S10900]]\n\nstarted with this, the Russians said: Well, we are going to have to \nhave in the preamble language that says missile defense is related to \nthis, and we said no. We have to have the ability to protect our \ncountry and build missile defense. The Russians said it has to be in \nthere. It is in there. The next thing we said: You know, for 40 years \nwe have been doing this, and you guys have a 10-to-1 advantage over us \non tactical weapons; that is, short-range weapons. We ought to talk \nabout that because you want to talk about parity on strategic weapons. \nNo, it can't be in there. We accommodated the Russians again. Every \ntime we turn around and put out a problem here--just as we heard on \nthis rail thing--every time we turn around and put out a problem that \nought to be addressed, the people who are promoting this stand and \napologize, they accommodate, they say it is OK, they overlook it, and \nwe go on and on and on.\n  I am sitting here listening to this on the rails, and the one side \nsays: Well, don't worry about it; they are never going to build this \nanyway. We pull up an article that says they are in the process of \ndoing this. Well, yes, but don't worry about it because it is going to \nbe counted anyway.\n  So I have something here that, hopefully, we are not going to \napologize to the Russians for. We are not going to accommodate them. We \nare going to tell them that if you want a relationship with us, you \nhave to be honest with us.\n  We all know, and it has been widely reported, that they cheat. They \nare serial cheaters. They cheated in virtually every agreement we have \nhad with them. If we are going to have a relationship with them and \npress the restart button--and I think we should. We should press the \nreset button. We should have a decent relationship with them. But let's \nwipe the slate clean and let's start with the military equipment they \nhave stolen from us. That is all this is about.\n  On August 8 of 2008, as we all know, the Russians invaded Georgia, \nand when they invaded Georgia, it was pretty much of a mismatch. They \nran over the top of them, did a lot of bad things, and eventually there \nwas a peace accord that was brokered by President Sarkozy, and the next \namendment I have deals more in-depth with that.\n  But when they ran over the Georgians, the American military had just \nbeen there doing exercises with the Georgians because the Georgians \nwere kind enough to engage with us and help us in Afghanistan. They \nwere preparing to send troops to Afghanistan to help us. So we \nAmericans went over there and we said: OK. We need to do some military \nexercises, engage in some joint training, so we can get you ready to go \ninto Afghanistan. We are now preparing to leave. We have completed the \nexercises. We are preparing to leave. We obviously took a lot of our \nequipment over there, not the least of which were four American \nhumvees. The four American humvees were shipped to a port in Georgia \nand were in the process of being shipped back to the United States. \nThere is no argument that the title to these four humvees is with the \npeople of the United States of America. They belong to me. They belong \nto you. They belong to the U.S. military. They belong to all of us.\n  The Russians, when they overran the Georgians and got to the seaport, \nfound our humvees, and what did they do? Did they say: Well, yes, they \nbelong to the Americans; we will put them on the boat that is supposed \nto go back to the United States? No. They said: We are going to take \nthem, and they stole them. Today, they still have them.\n  The United States has asked for the four humvees back. But let me \ntell my colleagues where the four humvees are. If you want to see a \npicture of them, you can go to msn.com and search Georgia and humvees \nand you can see a picture of our humvees. Where are they? They are in \nthe Russian Central Armed Forces Museum in Moscow, Russia. That is \nwhere our four humvees are. What are they doing there? They are on \ndisplay as a war trophy, taken by the Russians as a war trophy. Well, \nwe weren't engaged in that war.\n  So if we are going to have a good relationship with them, is it too \nmuch to ask to give us back the property they stole from us a little \nover 24 months ago?\n  So this is an easy one to vote for. I have had discussions with my \ngood friend from Massachusetts. He said this isn't related. This is \nabsolutely related. We are entering into a marriage on a very important \nissue.\n  Shouldn't we ask that they give us our stolen property back? And \nshouldn't they say: Yes, we want to set the reset button too. We want \nto hold hands and sing ``Kumbaya.'' We want to be friends.\n  Well, that is fine, but give us back our stolen military equipment.\n  That is all this asks for. It doesn't jeopardize the treaty; it just \nsays it goes into force as soon as they give us our four humvees back.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, let me first tell my colleague that I \nsupport the treaty because it is in the best interest of the United \nStates. It is in our national security interest. It is not an \naccommodation to Russia. This treaty helps us on national security. \nThat is what our military experts tell us. That is what our \nintelligence experts tell us. That is what our diplomats tell us. On \nall fronts, the ratification of this treaty makes us a safer nation. So \nit is not an accommodation to Russia.\n  On the issue the Senator is concerned about, both the Obama \nadministration and this body have repeatedly reaffirmed our commitment \nto Georgia's territorial sovereignty and integrity. We very much want \nRussia to withdraw. We are very sympathetic to the issue the Senator \nbrings to our attention. We have taken action in this body to support \nGeorgia's territorial integrity. The START treaty and its ratification \nis important in reestablishing confidence on verification as it relates \nto our relationship with Russia on strategic arms, but it is also \nimportant for the engagement of Russia on other issues. We can do more \nthan one thing at a time.\n  President Saakashvili of the Republic of Georgia said:\n\n       We all want--I personally want--Russia as a partner and not \n     as an enemy. Nobody has a greater stake than us in seeing \n     Russia turn into a country that truly operates within the \n     concert of nations, respects international law, and--this is \n     often connected--upholds basic human rights. This is why I \n     wholeheartedly support the efforts of European and American \n     leaders to strengthen their relationship with Russia.\n\n  The leader of Georgia understands that a better relationship between \nRussia and the United States will help Georgia and its territorial \nintegrity. This treaty and its ratification will help not only build \nconfidence between Russia and the United States but will help the other \ncountries of Europe, particularly a country such as Georgia.\n  So the chairman of the committee is absolutely correct--and I think \nwe can verify that with the Parliamentarian--that this is not relevant \non the issue we have before us. It is not part of the treaty we have \nnegotiated. It is not part of the ratification process. It is not the \nappropriate forum for this type of amendment to be considered. It \nshould be rejected on that basis.\n  The important thing in moving forward with U.S. influence on Russia \nas it relates to its neighbors, such as Georgia, is to move forward \nwith ratification of this treaty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I will be very quick. I don't think we \nneed to spend a lot of time on this. First of all, we agree with the \nSenator from Idaho that under normal circumstances the equipment they \nhave would be best returned to the United States, and there are many \ngood-faith ways in which they might do that. But the fact is that the \nway this is phrased, it has just two enormous problems. First, it says \nprior to the entry into force of the treaty. So we are linking this \nancillary issue to this entire treaty, which bears on a whole set of \nother national security considerations.\n  I want the four humvees back, and whatever the small arms are, which \nraises another issue, but I am not willing to see this entire treaty \nget caught up in that particular fracas. We have an unbelievable number \nof diplomatic channels and other ways of prosecuting that concept, and \nI pledge to the Senator that I am prepared, in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, to make certain we attempt to do that, as well as deal\n\n[[Page S10901]]\n\nwith the question of Russia's compliance with the peace agreement with \nrespect to the cease-fire in Georgia and so forth. These are essential \ningredients, and we will talk about that in a moment.\n  It also says they have to return all military equipment. It doesn't \nspecify. This could become one of those things where we are saying, you \nhave this, and they say, no, we don't. Are we talking about small arms? \nWhat about expended ammunition? Who knows what the circumstances are?\n  This is not the place or the time for us to get caught up in linking \nthis treaty to this particular outcome. I really think that stands on \nits own.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, obviously one of the purposes of these two \namendments is to respond to one of the arguments that has been raised \nin support of this treaty. We have this wonderful new reset \nrelationship with Russia, and were we to not ratify the treaty, that \nrelationship would be frayed, and who knows how much Russia might react \nto it? It would be harder to get their cooperation on things. Those are \nall arguments that have been made.\n  I think one of the points of these two amendments is to show that the \nreset relationship between Russia and the United States has not \nproduced all that much good behavior or cooperation on the part of the \nRussians. I earlier detailed all of the ways--at least a few--in which \nRussia had been very unhelpful to the United States with regard to \nIran. I noted I think 2 days ago or maybe yesterday that in the U.N., \nthey were trying to water down a resolution dealing with North Korea \nthat we are working hard to try to obtain. They have been very \ndifficult to deal with with regard to North Korea and Iran. At the end \nof the day, I think they only do what is in their best interest, in any \nevent--not basing their decisions of what is in their best interests on \nsome concept of a new friendliness with the United States.\n  I think part of the reason my colleague from Idaho offered these two \namendments is to simply demonstrate that this new relationship isn't \nall that its cracked up to be if they won't even give us some equipment \nthey confiscated when they invaded Georgia. That is not a major point \nin international diplomacy, and it certainly isn't a major point with \nrespect to U.S. military capability. It is illustrative of something.\n  The point of the amendment is to say that you have quite a bit of \ntime before this treaty enters into force. A lot has to happen. It is \nsent to Russia, the Duma has to deal with it, and so on.\n  Just return the stuff. Maybe that little gesture of good will would \nhelp to reestablish this so-called reset relationship in ways they have \nnot been able to accomplish by getting Russian support with the U.N. \nresolutions and other actions with regard to sanctions on Iran and \ndiplomacy with North Korea.\n  One can say it is not a big deal, this military equipment, but on the \nother hand, they say it will destroy the treaty if we have this \nparticular amendment. The reality is that we are simply trying to make \na point that the Russians have not acted well in a variety of \nsituations. I cannot think of a better example than the invasion of \nGeorgia, the continued violation of the cease-fire agreement they \nsigned there, and the violation of the U.N. resolution.\n  I would reiterate, at the summit declaration--this is where the NATO \nmembers, meeting in Lisbon last month, joined together to call for a \nresolution to the problem, saying, ``We reiterate our continued support \nfor the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Georgia within its \ninternationally recognized borders.'' And then they urge all to play a \nconstructive role and to work with the U.N. to pursue a peaceful \nresolution of the internationally recognized territory of Georgia. And \nthen the final sentence:\n\n       We continue to call on Russia to reverse its recognition of \n     the South Ossetia and Abkhazia regions of Georgia as \n     independent States.\n\n  That is the kind of cooperation we are getting from the Russian \nFederation these days. I appreciate the amendments brought forth by my \ncolleague to highlight that fact.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I agree with Senator Kyl and support the \nRisch amendment. I remember at a NATO conference not too many years ago \nPresident Bush was advocating for Georgia being a member of NATO, to \nshow you how serious these matters are. So had we voted to bring \nGeorgia into NATO--and they were on the short list--we would be in a \nsituation in which the Russians would be invading a NATO country. The \nact of Russia invading Georgia was a dramatic event.\n  The proponents of the treaty portrayed this matter as advancing our \nrelationship with Russia. I think Senator Kerry has been not so \naggressive--that hasn't been one of his themes. But a lot of people \nhave, and I think he was wise not to go down that road.\n  A lot of people have tried to say we are going to get along with \nRussia better by signing this treaty with them. That is not a sound \nbasis to sign a treaty. We all need a better relationship with Russia. \nThat I certainly acknowledge. Georgia would certainly benefit from it, \nand hopefully the world will have a better relationship with Russia.\n  But I am unable to fathom a lot of the Russian activities, frankly. \nIt is just difficult for me. Why have they negotiated so hardheadedly \non this treaty to actually reduce the number of inspections over what \nwe had in the previous treaty? Why? I thought Russia was about wanting \nto move forward into the world and be a good citizen in the world \ncommunity. I haven't seen it. I am worried about it.\n  So the question is, if we abandon or concede too much, are we helping \ndevelop a positive relationship? I think Senator Risch is saying: Look, \nwe have a serious problem. They are holding our military equipment. Are \nwe not even going to discuss that?\n  How do we get to a more positive relationship with our Russian \nfriends? I think the people of Russia are our friends. How do we get \nthere? Is it through strength, constancy, consistency, principle, and \nposition, or is it through weakness, placating, concession, and \nappeasing? Is that the way to gain respect and move us into a healthier \nrelationship? I don't think so.\n  I think we have only one charge, and that is to defend our legitimate \ninterests. I believe this administration has been too fixed on a \ntreaty, and, as one observer and former treaty negotiator has said: If \nyou want it bad, you will get it bad. In other words, if you want the \ntreaty too badly, you won't be an effective negotiator. I remember \nduring this process, on more than one occasion, warning and expressing \nconcern to our negotiators that we appeared to be too anxious to obtain \nthis treaty and, if so, the Russians would play us like a fiddle. I am \nafraid that is what has happened.\n  I think this Congress would do the President, the world, Russia, and \nour country a service if we said what Senator Risch says: OK, guys, how \nabout letting our equipment be sent back. If you are not willing to do \nthat, then we have a serious problem.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. RISCH. Madam President, first of all, to my good friend from \nMaryland, I agree with much of what he said about our relationship and \nthe relationship between Georgia and Russia. I will speak about that in \nthe next amendment I am going to offer, which is No. 4879, right after \nthis one. I know the Senator didn't talk about our stolen military \nequipment by the Russians.\n  To my friend from Massachusetts, who responded to what I said, I say: \nHere we go again. This is exactly why I brought this amendment. We are \nagain accommodating the Russians. Why can't we just once ask them to \nbehave themselves and say: Look, this is not a big matter, but you are \nacting like a thief.\n  Do you want to see what they did? I made reference for you to go on \nthe Internet to see the pictures, but here they are. If you are a good \nAmerican, you can go there and you can watch your property right here \nbeing towed away by the Russians, back to Moscow, to put on display as \na trophy. Here is another picture of it right here. This is even \nbetter. This is one of our humvees being towed by the Russians. This \nhumvee is headed back to Moscow, where it is now displayed as a trophy.\n\n[[Page S10902]]\n\n  Is it too much to ask, where we are going to enter into this \nagreement and supposedly befriend and supposedly reset the button on \nour relationship, is it too much to say: Look, you stole from us. You \nare acting like a thief. Give us back the property we own.\n  Is that asking too much of the Russians? Can we not just once, \ninstead of accommodating them, instead of apologizing for them, instead \nof saying we should not tie this to that or we will not get it, can we \nnot just once say: Give us our stolen property back.\n  That is all we are asking here. It is not a big thing, but it does \ngive us a clear indication of what they are thinking, of what their \nrelationship is with us, of what they want their relationship to be \nwith us.\n  This is not asking too much. This does not blow up the treaty. It \nsimply says they pack up the four humvees and, and as soon as they do, \nthe treaty goes into effect. That is not too much to ask.\n  I yield to my good friend from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, this has been cleared on both sides.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 6 p.m., the Senate proceed to votes \nin relation to the following amendments to the START treaty and the \nresolution of ratification: Ensign amendment No. 4855 and Risch \namendment No. 4878; further, that prior to the votes, there be no \nsecond-degree amendments in order to the amendment, and that the time \nbefore the votes be divided equally between the sponsors and myself or \ntheir designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I will share one thought I remember so \nvividly before Russia invaded Georgia. We were at a NATO conference. \nThere was a discussion outside the normal meeting. One weak-kneed, I \nsuppose, European explained to the Georgians why it was difficult for \nthe other nations to support Georgia in their idea to be in NATO and \nsuggested it was difficult because Russia was a big and powerful \ncountry.\n  The Georgian replied--and I have never forgotten it--saying: Well, \nsir, we think it is a question of values. Mr. Putin said last year the \ngreatest disaster of the 20th century was the collapse of the Soviet \nUnion. We in Georgia believe it was the best thing that happened in the \n20th century. It is a question of values. We share your values. We want \nto be with you.\n  I have to say it is deeply troubling to me that our Russian friends \nare being so recalcitrant and so aggressive and so hostile to sovereign \nstates such as Georgia, the Ukraine, the Baltics, and Poland. They used \nto be a part of the Soviet empire. They are now sovereign nations, \nindependent in every way.\n  Conceding, as part of these negotiations, the deployment of a ground-\nbased interceptor missile defense system in Poland to comply with \nRussian demands during this treaty process was a terrible thing, \nespecially when we did not even tell our friends in the sovereign \nnation of Poland we intended to do it before we announced it with the \nRussians.\n  The Senator is just raising a reality. I say to Senator Risch, we \nhave some problems here, and we might as well put it out on the table, \nbe realistic about it, and take off the rose-colored glasses. This \namendment is one way to say let's get serious and talk with our Russian \nfriends about some serious difficulties we have.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. RISCH. Madam President, I call up Risch amendment No. 4879.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, at this time there is, until we have an \nopportunity--we were going to work this out with Senator Kyl after the \nvote. So I object to it at this moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KERRY. I believe Senator Kyl had two amendments he wanted to get \nup at this point in time.\n  Mr. KYL. What was the unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. KERRY. The Senator from Idaho requested to go to his next \namendment, which is No. 4879. That was the one the Senator from Arizona \nand I were talking about with respect to an issue we wanted to work out \nwith the Parliamentarian before we go to it. I think the Senator and I \nhad agreed he would like to go to two other amendments next in line. We \nwill come back to this issue.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, that understanding is fine. There are two \nMembers who I think will be ready to go forward with their amendments \nimmediately following the two votes at 6 o'clock.\n  Again, for benefit of the Members, it is my hope that we can continue \nto work through as many amendments as possible this evening, maybe have \ndebate a couple at a time and vote, whatever the body desires. But \nperhaps we could continue at least to work through a few more \namendments yet this evening.\n  Mr. KERRY. I agree with that completely. We have a fairly limited \nlist, and I think it is possible to move through them rapidly. I \nappreciate the efforts of the Senator from Arizona to do so.\n  Madam President, how much time do we have on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kerry. I wish to respond to Senator Risch's \namendment because I am very sympathetic to the concerns he is raising.\n  All who watched Russia's invasion of Georgia had to be outraged about \nwhat happened. In fact, I have a resolution I have submitted with \nSenators Graham and Lieberman. I hope, perhaps, the Senator from Idaho \nmight be willing to take a look at this resolution and work with us on \nit next year because one of the things it does is it calls upon the \nGovernment of Russia to take steps to fulfill all the terms and \nconditions of the 2008 cease-fire agreement, including returning \nmilitary forces to prewar positions and ensuring access to \ninternational humanitarian aid to all those affected by the conflict.\n  It also deals with a number of other provisions in that resolution \nwith respect to Georgia.\n  I also point out, as I am sure my friend from Idaho knows, that \nGeorgia has recognized it is in their interest to have relations with \nRussia that can address their border concerns in a way that is \npositive, to have Russia working with the international community as \nopposed to working as a pariah. They may represent what we have heard \nfrom all our NATO allies with respect to the START treaty; that it is \nin the best interest of our NATO allies. We have heard from those \ncountries that border Russia--Latvia, Poland, and a number of other \ncountries--that they would like to see the United States ratify the New \nSTART treaty.\n  I am in agreement with the concerns Senator Risch raised. I have \nquestions about whether this is the best way to do it, given the \nconfines of the New START treaty and our efforts to get this into \neffect as soon as possible so we do not continue to have a situation \nwhere we do not have inspectors on the ground in Russia who can help \ngather intelligence, who can see what is going on with their nuclear \narms in a way that would also benefit Georgia.\n  I understand the concerns. I agree with those. But I cannot support \nthis amendment because of the negative impact it might have on \nratifying the treaty.\n  Mr. RISCH. Madam President, may I respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. RISCH. Madam President, somehow the debate about the relationship \nbetween Russia and Georgia and our relationship as far as Georgia is \nconcerned has crept into this debate. This amendment has nothing to do \nwith Georgia, other than the fact that is where the theft took place. \nThe international criminal offense of theft of our military property \ntook place in Georgia. That is the only thing Georgia has to do with \nthis. This has nothing to do with the relationship. Amendment No. 4879 \nhas a lot to do with it. When we get there, we will talk about that.\n  I regret my good friend from New Hampshire cannot support this \namendment, because although I suspect I will\n\n[[Page S10903]]\n\nsupport the resolution, we do a lot of these resolutions. We do the \nresolution and send it off to the Russians. They are going to be \nlaughing up their sleeve at us, whilst they are fondling our equipment \nthat they have possession of.\n  There are no teeth in these resolutions. We actually have the \nopportunity to do something to get our military equipment back. If they \nare acting in good faith, if they are people of good will, if they want \na relationship with us, then they are going to have to make a choice: \nDo we keep four humvees or do we give them back so this treaty can go \ninto effect? That is the choice they are going to have to make.\n  That is not too tough a choice to put on them. Do you want to \ncontinue to be thieves or do you want to be honest about this and \ndeliver the goods you have stolen? There is nothing wrong about that. \nThis gives us the opportunity, I say to the good Senator, to do what \nyou exactly do on the resolution, but it is going to give it some \nteeth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. On both sides? How much remains on the proponents' side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 19 seconds; the majority has \n3 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I suggest the absence of a quorum. I withhold that \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I, first, thank the Senator from Idaho \nfor bringing up this issue. I might tell him, I have a laundry list of \nissues with which I would like to deal with Russia.\n  I have the honor of chairing the Helsinki Commission. We have a lot \nof human rights issues with Russia, and we raise them all the time as \naggressively as we can. I am proud the Obama administration has raised \nthese issues at the highest level with the Russian Federation. We are \nvery sympathetic to the issue the Senator has brought up. It is the \nwrong vehicle to deal with this issue. It is the wrong vehicle. This \ntreaty is important for U.S. national security. That is why I support \nthe ratification. That is why I urge my colleagues to support the \nratification.\n  Yes, it is appropriate in our advise-and-consent role for us to take \nup issues that are relevant to the subject matter of the treaty. The \nproblem is, the issues the Senator from Idaho is bringing up are not \nrelevant to the subject matter of the treaty. Therefore, it is the \nwrong vehicle to take up this issue.\n  I do not want the Senator from Idaho to interpret my opposition to \nhis amendment as opposing what he is trying to do. I agree with what he \nis trying to do. It is the wrong vehicle on which to put it. I urge the \nSenator to work with Senator Shaheen, work with the Helsinki Commission \non other issues.\n  The issue the Senator is bringing up about the return of property is \nvery important to America. We believe in many cases the Russian \nFederation is not living up to their international commitments under \ninternational agreements. We will bring those up, and we will fight in \nthose forums. But this treaty is in our interest. This treaty and our \nactions should deal with the four corners of the agreement.\n  In that respect, I very much oppose the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. RISCH. Madam President, may I claim my 19 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. RISCH. Madam President, with all due respect to my good friend \nfrom Maryland, this is exactly the right vehicle to bring this up. This \nis a vehicle of trust, and it is a vehicle that puts some teeth in an \notherwise toothless thing.\n  As far as human rights versus this stolen property, this is very \nobjective, it is hard, you can see it. The human rights violations I \nthink are entirely different. They certainly are important. They \ncertainly rise to as high a level, but this is objective.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I believe all time has expired; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is yielded back. All time is expired.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 4855\n\n  The question is on agreeing to the Ensign amendment No. 4855.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Wicker], for himself and \n     Mr. Kyl, proposes an amendment numbered 4895.\n\n  Mr. WICKER. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide an understanding that provisions adopted in the \n  Bilateral Consultative Commission that affect substantive rights or \n   obligations under the Treaty are those that create new rights or \n obligations for the United States and must therefore be submitted to \n                 the Senate for its advice and consent)\n\n       At the end of subsection (b) of the Resolution of \n     Ratification, add the following:\n       (4) Bilateral consultative commission.--It is the \n     understanding of the United States that provisions adopted in \n     the Bilateral Consultative Commission that affect substantive \n     rights or obligations under the Treaty are those that create \n     new rights or obligations for the United States and must \n     therefore be submitted to the Senate for its advice and \n     consent.\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise this evening to offer another \namendment to the resolution of ratification. This amendment rises out \nof concerns over the Bilateral Consultative Commission known as the \nBCC. The BCC has been referred to numerous times in debate today. \nArticle XII of the treaty establishes the BCC as a forum for the \nparties to resolve issues concerning implementation of the treaty. Part \nsix of the protocol says the BCC has the authority to resolve questions \nrelating to compliance, agree to additional measures to improve the \nviability and effectiveness of the treaty, and discuss other issues \nraised by either party. This clearly is very broad authority given to \nthe BCC. In effect, the subject matter jurisdiction of the BCC seems \nlimitless, based on the clear language of article XII.\n  Former National Security Adviser under President George W. Bush, \nStephen Hadley, appeared before the Foreign Relations Committee and \nexpressed concerns over this treaty. He stated, with regard to the \nBilateral Consultative Commission:\n\n       The Bilateral Consultative Commission seems to have been \n     given authority to adopt, without Senate review, measures to \n     improve the viability and effectiveness of the treaty which \n     could include restrictions on missile defense.\n\n  It is that element of Senate review that this amendment would inject \nback into the process.\n  Others have voiced concern that the mandate of the BCC is overly \nbroad. This should trouble Senators. It is why I offer this amendment \nto place proper limits on the power of the BCC.\n  I hold in my hand a fax sheet written by the Department of State \nBureau of Verification, Compliance, and Implementation, dated August \n11, 2010. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[From the Bureau of Verification, Compliance, and Implementation, Aug. \n                               11, 2010]\n\n                Bilateral Consultative Commission (BCC)\n\n       Key Point: The New START Treaty establishes the BCC to work \n     questions related to Treaty implementation. The use of \n     treaty-based commissions to agree on limited technical \n     changes to improve or clarify implementation of treaty \n     provisions is a well-established practice in arms control \n     treaties.\n       Background: The New START Treaty authorizes the Parties to \n     use the Bilateral Consultative Commission (BCC) to reach \n     agreement on changes in the Protocol to the Treaty, including \n     its Annexes, that do not affect substantive rights or \n     obligations. The START Treaty's Joint Compliance and \n     Inspection Commission and the Intermediate and Shorter Range \n     Nuclear Forces Treaty's Special Verification Commission were \n     assigned similar responsibilities by those treaties.\n       The Chemical Weapons Convention, the Open Skies Treaty, and \n     the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty provide similar \n     authority to effect technical changes that are deemed \n     necessary by the Parties during the implementation of the \n     respective treaty.\n       Authority of the BCC: In addition to making technical \n     changes to the Protocol, including its Annexes, that do not \n     affect substantive rights or obligations, the BCC may: \n     resolve questions relating to compliance with the obligations \n     assumed by the Parties; agree upon such additional measures \n     as may be necessary to improve the viability and \n     effectiveness of the Treaty; discuss the unique features of \n     missiles and their launchers, other than ICBMs and ICBM \n     launchers, or SLBMs and SLBM launchers, referred to in \n     paragraph 3 of Article V of the Treaty, that distinguish such \n     missiles and their launchers from ICBMs and ICBM launchers, \n     or SLBMs and SLBM launchers; discuss on an annual basis the \n     exchange of telemetric information under the Treaty; resolve \n     questions related to the applicability of provisions of the \n     Treaty to a new kind of strategic offensive arm; and discuss \n     other issues raised by either Party.\n       If amendments to the Treaty are necessary, the Parties may \n     use the BCC as a framework within which to negotiate such \n     amendments. However, once negotiated, such amendments may \n     enter into force only in accordance with procedures governing \n     entry into force of the Treaty. This means that they would be \n     subject to the advice and consent of the United States \n     Senate.\n       This provision ensures that the Senate's Constitutional \n     role in providing advice and consent to the ratification of \n     treaties is not undermined.\n\n\n                  Rules Governing the Work of the BCC\n\n       The BCC is required to meet at least twice each year in \n     Geneva, Switzerland, unless the Parties agree otherwise.\n       The work of the BCC is confidential, except if the Parties \n     agree in the BCC to release the details of the work.\n       BCC agreements reached or results of its work recorded in \n     writing are not confidential, except as otherwise agreed by \n     the BCC.\n\n  Mr. WICKER. The fax sheet mentions on more than one occasion that \nchanges adopted by the BCC cannot affect substantive rights or \nobligations. It says under background: ``The New START treaty \nauthorizes the parties to use the Bilateral Consultative Commission, \nBCC, to reach agreement on changes in the protocol to the treaty, \nincluding its annexes, that do not affect substantive rights or \nobligations.''\n  Further down under authority of the BCC, the State Department fax \nsheet says: ``In addition to making technical changes to the protocol, \nincluding its annexes that do not affect substantive rights or \nobligations, the BCC may,'' and then it lists the six bullets. First, \nresolve questions relating to compliance with the obligations assumed \nby the parties. Secondly, agree upon such\n\n[[Page S10905]]\n\nadditional measures as may be necessary to improve the viability and \neffectiveness of the treaty. Next, discuss the unique features of \nmissiles and their launchers other than ICBM and ICBM launchers or SLBM \nand SLBM launchers referred to in paragraph 3 of article V of the \ntreaty that distinguish such missiles and their launchers from ICBM and \nICBM launchers and SLBM and SLBM launchers. Next, discuss on an annual \nbasis the exchange of telemetric information under the treaty. Fifth, \nresolve questions related to the applicability of provisions of the \ntreaty to a new kind of strategic offensive arm. And finally, discuss \nother issues raised by either party. But the changes may not affect \nsubstantive rights or obligations of the parties.\n  ``Rules governing the work of the BCC: The BCC is required to meet at \nleast twice a year in Geneva unless the parties agree otherwise. The \nwork of the BCC is confidential, except if the parties agree in the BCC \nto release details of the work,'' and ``BCC agreements reached or \nresult of its work recorded in writing are not confidential . . . '' \nThe BCC can agree to amendments in the treaty, but they must be \nsubmitted back to the Senate for advice and consent. It is a very \npowerful commission, no doubt. And it is reassuring to have this fax \nsheet saying that substantive changes cannot be made by the BCC.\n  It would be more reassuring if we put this in writing, and that is \nwhat the Wicker-Kyl amendment 4895 does. It is very simple and it uses \nthe State Department language, stating that provisions adopted by the \nBCC that affect substantive rights--and these are the words used by the \nState Department in the fax sheet--are those that create new rights or \nobligations for the United States and must therefore be submitted to \nthe Senate for its advice and consent.\n  The bottom line is this: If it is determined that a substantive \nchange has been made by a decision of the BCC, then that change should \nbe subject to the advice and consent of the Senate.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote to this very simple but straightforward \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the amendment offered by Senator Wicker is \nan amendment that is looking for an issue. There is no issue that is \njoined here with respect to the bilateral commission or what it might \ndo with respect to the creation of rights. But if this amendment were \nto pass, there would be an issue, not only an issue with respect to \nRussian participation but actually an issue that could be harmful to \nthe United States. This is a little bit technical and it is a tricky \nthing to follow in some ways, but let me lay this out.\n  Under the START treaty, the prior treaty under which we have lived \nsince 1992, and now under the proposed New START treaty, the \nconsultative commission that we create in the treaty will get together \nin order to work out the problems that may or may not arise and is \nallowed to agree upon ``such additional measures as may be necessary to \nimprove the viability and the effectiveness of the treaty.'' If those \nadditional measures they might approve at some point in time are \nchanges to the protocol or to its annexes and if the changes don't \naffect substantive rights or obligations under the treaty, then it is \nentirely allowable for those changes to be adopted without referring \nthem back to the Senate for any advice or ratification. The Senators' \nproposed amendment would make it U.S. policy all of a sudden that the \nphrase ``do not affect substantive rights or obligations'' means \n``doesn't create new rights or obligations.'' So there is a distinction \nbetween affecting substantive rights and then having the operative \nlanguage that kicks it into gear become the creation of rights or \nobligations. This proposal is unnecessary.\n  Why? We have operated without it for 15 years under the START treaty \nwithout a single problem. The New START treaty uses the exact same \napproach that has worked for 15 years. We have a lot of experience in \ndetermining what constitutes substantive rights or obligations.\n  More importantly, I mentioned a moment ago that this could be harmful \nto American interests. Here is how. It would actually require that \nagreements we want to move on and that act in our national security \ninterest would be delayed and referred to the Senate, and we all know \nhow long that could take, even if the new rights or obligations that \nthey created were absolutely technical in nature. No matter how \ntechnical or trivial, they have to come to the Senate to become hostage \nto one Senator or another Senator's other agenda in terms of our \nability to move, at least as structured here.\n  Under START, the compliance commission adopted provisions on how \ninspectors would use radiation detection equipment to determine that \nthe objects on a missile that Russia declared not to be warheads were, \nin fact, nonnuclear and, therefore, not warheads. There was absolutely \nno need for the Senate to hold hearings, write reports, or have a floor \ndebate on that provision, even though it created a new right for the \ninspecting side and a new obligation for the hosting side in an \ninspection. We don't want to take away our ability to be able to do \nthat. This amendment would do that.\n  Similarly, the commission under START reached agreement from time to \ntime on changes in the types of inspection and equipment that a country \ncould use. Equipment changes over time, as we know. Technology \nadvances, so the equipment changes. Giving U.S. inspectors the new \nright to use that equipment or the new obligation to let Russian \ninspectors use it hardly warrants referral to the Senate for its advice \nand consent.\n  In summary, this amendment is unneeded. We have done well without it. \nNot well--we have done spectacularly without it for 15 years. No \nproblems whatsoever. On the other side, it is a dangerous amendment \nbecause it forces us to delay for months the implementation of \ntechnical agreements that our inspectors ought to be allowed to \nimplement without delay.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and ask unanimous consent that \nupon the use or yielding back of time specified below, the Senate \nproceed to votes in relation to the following amendments to the \nresolution of ratification: Wicker 4895, Kyl 4860, and Kyl 4893; \nfurther, that prior to the votes there be no second-degree amendment in \norder to any of the amendments and that there be 30 minutes of debate \non each amendment equally divided between the sponsors of the amendment \nand myself and/or my designee or the designee of the sponsors; further, \nI ask unanimous consent that the time already consumed by Senator \nWicker and myself be counted toward this agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9 minutes remaining on the \nWicker amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Let me thank Senator Wicker for bringing forward this \namendment. I know it is an amendment he feels very strongly about. I \ncompliment him because I believe a good part of what he was concerned \nabout is already in the resolution of advice and consent on \nratification.\n  As the Senator pointed out, there is a consultation process before \nthe Bilateral Consultative Commission to meet on any changes that would \nmodify the treaty itself. There has to be consultation with Congress on \nthose issues, as the Senator pointed out in his comments. So I think we \nhave already taken care of the major concern the Senator has that it \nwould be a substantive decision made by the Bilateral Consultative \nCommission.\n  Secondly, let me point out that whatever the Bilateral Consultative \nCommission does, it is limited by the treaty itself, which, hopefully, \nwill have been ratified by both the United States and Russia. So there \nwill be a limit on the ratification already in the process.\n  As Senator Kerry pointed out, we certainly do not want to hold up \nSenate ratification for minor administrative issues, knowing how long \nSenate ratification of anything related to a treaty could take.\n  The last point I want to bring out is, the Senator mentioned missile \ndefense, and I know this has been brought up over and over and over. \nBut in our advice and consent to the ratification of the treaty, we \nhave already put in that:\n\n       . . . the New START Treaty does not impose any limitations \n     on the deployment of\n\n[[Page S10906]]\n\n     missile defenses other than the requirements of paragraph 3 \n     of Article V of the New START Treaty, which states, ``Each \n     Party shall not convert and shall not use ICBM launchers or \n     SLBM launchers for placement of missile defense interceptors \n     therein.''\n\n  So we already put in the resolution the concern that the Senator has \nvoiced as the major reason he wanted to expand the consultative \nprocess, which is also already included in the resolution.\n  I think the point Senator Kerry has raised is that this would make it \ntechnically unworkable for the Bilateral Consultative Commission to do \nits work if we required Senate consultation or ratification every time \nthe Commission wanted to meet.\n  For all those reasons, I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, if no one else seeks time on this \namendment, I would be prepared to close.\n  It may be that my friend from Maryland is satisfied that there are no \nrestrictions on missile defense in this aspect of the treaty. But it \ndid not satisfy Stephen Hadley, the National Security Adviser to former \nPresident George W. Bush, who came before our committee with concerns.\n  It seems to me we have a very simple way to address those concerns. \nLet me reiterate to my colleagues the quote of Mr. Hadley:\n\n       The Bilateral Consultative Commission seems to have been \n     given authority to adopt without Senate review measures to \n     improve the viability and effectiveness of the Treaty which \n     could include restrictions on missile defense.\n\n  I would also agree with my colleague from Maryland that, indeed, the \nBCC has the authority to negotiate amendments to the treaty. That is \nacknowledged in the factsheet by the State Department.\n  The simple step beyond that I am trying to do with my amendment is to \nmake it clear, using the terms supplied to us by the State Department \nthat say: The BCC cannot make changes that affect the substantive \nrights or obligations of the United States. I am trying to make that \npart of the resolution of ratification, and that is all it does. It \nsays if the BCC adopts provisions that affect substantive rights or \nobligations under the treaty that create new rights or obligations, \nthat those changes must come back to the Senate. It is in addition to \nthe requirement that amendments to the treaty come back to the Senate \nfor ratification, and it is a protection of the rights of this body to \ncontinue to have a role in substantive modifications that might come \nout of the BCC.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I will say, I think we just have a \ndisagreement. I think where Senate confirmation would be at issue is \nwhere there is an amendment to the treaty, and that is exactly what is \nincluded in our resolution.\n  I think it is unworkable to try to get the Senate involved in all the \nchanges in trying to say what is substantive and what is not. I think \nyou would be interfering with the administration of the verification \nsystems, et cetera. So I would just urge our colleagues to reject the \namendment.\n  I say to Senator Wicker, I think on our side we are prepared to yield \nback. So if the Senator would like to----\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I yield back.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, we yield back the time on this amendment.\n  As I understand the unanimous consent agreement, it is 30 minutes per \namendment. Then I think we are prepared to go to Senator Kyl for his \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, a point of inquiry before I begin. Is there a \nreason I should speak to either amendment No. 4860 or amendment No. \n4893 first?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can speak in whatever order he \nwishes, but neither amendment has been offered.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4860\n\n  Then, Mr. President, with that, I would like to offer amendment No. \n4860, SLCM side agreement, which I believe is pending at the desk. I \nwould ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4860.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require a certification that the President has negotiated \n a legally binding side agreement with the Russian Federation that the \n  Russian Federation will not deploy a significant number of nuclear-\narmed sea-launched cruise missiles during the duration of the New START \n                                Treaty)\n\n       At the end of subsection (a) of the Resolution of \n     Ratification, add the following:\n       (11) Limitation on nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise \n     missiles.--Prior to the entry into force of the New START \n     Treaty, the President shall certify to the Senate that the \n     President has negotiated a legally binding side agreement \n     with the Russian Federation that the Russian Federation will \n     not deploy a significant number of nuclear-armed sea-launched \n     cruise missiles during the duration of the New START Treaty.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this is actually a very straightforward \namendment. It simply seeks to repeat in this New START treaty the same \nthing the then-Soviet Union and United States did in the previous START \nI treaty with respect to a particular kind of weapon--a Russian weapon \ncalled the SLCM or sea-launched cruise missile.\n  As part of START I, we reached a binding side agreement--a side \nagreement--because the Senate had said we needed to include these \nweapons in the treaty. So a side agreement was reached that they would \nlimit a deployment of sea-launched cruise missiles or the SLCMs due to \ntheir impact on strategic stability, the point being that whether these \nsea-launched cruise missiles are deemed tactical or strategic, they \nactually have a strategic component, especially if they are sitting \nright off your coast and they are launched and they can hit your \ncountry. So that agreement was put into a side agreement between the \nthen-Soviet Union and the United States.\n  But when this New START treaty was negotiated, there was no similar \nside agreement. So there were no restrictions on SLCM deployments. The \nside agreement in the START treaty limited both nations to fewer than \n800 SLCMs with a range greater than 600 kilometers. In the 2010 Nuclear \nPosture Review, the administration committed to unilaterally \neliminating our SLCM capability.\n\n       The United States will retire the nuclear-equipped sea-\n     launched cruise missile (TLAM-N).\n\n  Under Secretary Miller said:\n\n       The timeline for its retirement will be over the next two \n     or three years.\n\n  Now Russia is developing a new version of its SLCM, with a range of \nup to, approximately, 5,000 kilometers, which is a longer range than \nsome of the ballistic missiles that are covered by the New START \ntreaty.\n  So that is why we believe there should be a side agreement, just like \nthere was in START I, that deals with these SLCMs. We are not going to \nhave them, Russia is. Yet there is nothing in the treaty that would \ncount their SLCMs against the total limit of warheads or delivery \nvehicles that are allowed under the treaty or in any other way deal \nwith them.\n  The administration assures us we should not be concerned about a lack \nof a formal agreement. Secretary Clinton noted that the START I treaty \ndid have a limitation on sea-launched cruise missiles and said that \nboth parties ``voluntarily agreed to cease deploying any nuclear SLCMs \non surface ships or multipurpose submarines.''\n  But today it is obvious, with the information about Russian plans, \nthat there is going to be a great disparity between the United States \nand Russia. As I said, it is not obvious that saying one is tactical, \nas opposed to the strategic weapons that are otherwise limited by this \ntreaty, is a very important distinction. I think it is really a \ndistinction without a difference.\n  Steve Hadley, the former head of the NSC, said:\n\n       And if you're living in eastern or central Europe, a so-\n     called tactical nuclear weapon,\n\n[[Page S10907]]\n\n     if you're within range, looks pretty strategic to you. So \n     what are we going to do about those?\n\n  As I said, he was the National Security Adviser.\n  Ambassador Bob Joseph, in testimony before the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, said:\n\n       Every time I hear the term ``nonstrategic nuclear \n     weapons,'' I recall that no nuclear weapon is nonstrategic.\n\n  If you stop and think about it, that is certainly true.\n  So these weapons, which are very powerful, and can have a range of up \nto 5,000 kilometers, clearly need to be dealt with.\n  Now, we did not want to insist that they go back and renegotiate the \ntreaty because we heard that argument before, so what we are suggesting \nby this amendment is simply to do the same thing we did in START I--\njust have it be a side agreement where the two parties would agree to \nlimit the number. Our administration would limit the Russians so they \nwould not have a significant number of these particular weapons.\n  Just a point, by the way: In the event there are folks who do not \nbelieve the Russians intend to rely on their weapons such as the SLCMs, \nUnder Secretary of Defense Flournoy said: The Russians are ``actually \nincreasing their reliance on nuclear weapons and the role of nuclear \nweapons in their strategy.''\n  Secretary Gates has made the same point. He said:\n\n       Ironically, that is the case with Russia today, which has \n     neither the money nor the population to sustain its Cold War \n     conventional force levels. Instead, we have seen an increased \n     reliance on its nuclear force with new ICBM and sea-based \n     missiles, as well as a fully functional infrastructure that \n     can manufacture a significant number of warheads each year.\n\n  And the Strategic Posture Commission noted:\n\n       This imbalance in non-strategic nuclear weapons, which \n     greatly favors Russia, is of rising concern and an \n     illustration of the new challenges of strategic stability as \n     reductions in strategic weapons proceed.\n\n  The point has been made by many others as well.\n  So I think this is fairly straightforward. It would require the \nUnited States to negotiate a side agreement with Russia, very similar \nto the side agreement we had under START I, to deal with a weapon that \nwe are no longer going to have, but the Russians are apparently \ndeveloping a new version of, that has a pretty substantial range--5,000 \nkilometers. Clearly, it is very difficult to distinguish the difference \nbetween a weapon like that and the strategic offensive weapons that are \notherwise dealt with in the treaty.\n  I hope my colleagues will recognize this is not a treaty killer, and \nit is something that needs t be addressed.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. First, let me thank Senator Kyl for bringing this issue \nto our attention. I think this is a very important issue. We have a lot \nof security issues as they relate to Russia, as they relate to Europe, \nand as they relate to the sea-launch cruise missiles. I couldn't agree \nwith the Senator more. But this falls under the same category of the \ndiscussion we had earlier about a side agreement on tactical weapons.\n  These are all beneficial issues, but it is not the key issue that is \nbefore us today. If we were to adopt this amendment, I think we all \nwould agree it would cause a considerable delay in the implementation \nof the START treaty.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that the START treaty, according to our \nmilitary experts, is needed now. We have been a year without having \ninspection regimes in Russia so we can get the intelligence information \nwe need by people on the ground. That expired in December of last year. \nSo we have already been delayed through this year, and the longer we \ndelay, the less reliable the information we have for our own national \nsecurity.\n  Although it would be nice to have all of these side agreements with \nRussia on a lot of other issues, every time we ask our negotiators to \ndo that, it takes time. It takes a lot of time to negotiate. It is not \nall one-sided when you negotiate. My colleagues know that. We know that \nhere as we negotiate issues.\n  This is an important issue, but it shouldn't delay the ratification \nand implementation of the New START treaty so that we can get our \ninspectors on the ground, giving us the information we need for our own \nnational security as it relates to the strategic capacity of Russia.\n  For all of those reasons, I urge my colleagues to reject the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Senator from Maryland is absolutely \ncorrect, and I appreciate him pointing that out. I think I have said \nmany times in the course of this debate that it is imperative for us to \ndeal with the issue of tactical nuclear weapons. In fact, the \nresolution of ratification has a section in it which specifically \naddresses this and urges the President to move to that.\n  I might add that the Senator from Florida, Mr. LeMieux--we are just \nfinishing up an agreement on an amendment which will, in fact, add an \nadditional component. It is an amendment we intend to accept, and it \nwill add an additional emphasis on this question of tactical weapons.\n  But not only is there no benefit to delaying this treaty from going \ninto effect--I mean, that is what the amendment of the Senator from \nArizona will do. Until this new verification and limitation mechanism \nis put into effect--the fact is that most of our experts, from \nSecretary Gates through Admiral Mullen and others, have all said to us: \nIf we don't get this treaty, we are not going to get to the tactical \nnuclear discussion with the Russians.\n  If we were the Russians and the U.S. Senate said: We are not going to \ndo this until this, we would be looking at a long road where we have \nreopened all of the different relationships and we have discarded this \none component of our nuclear deterrent that we find so critical, which \nis the submarine-launched missiles, the intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles, and the heavy bombers. That is the heart of our nuclear \ndeterrence. We want to know what they are doing and they want to know \nwhat we are doing, and that is how you provide the greatest stability.\n  In addition to that, Secretary Gates and Secretary Clinton have both \nreinforced that many times, but here is the important thing to think \nabout as we think about what the impact on this treaty would be. \nNuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles--or SLCMs, as we call them \nin the crazy vernacular of this place--these are tactical weapons, and \nalthough this amendment seems to suggest that Russian SLCMs could upset \nthe strategic balance between the United States and Russia, the truth \nis, they cannot. They don't do what this amendment seems to suggest.\n  For many years, going back at least to the Reagan administration, we \nhave considered these kinds of weapons to be nonstrategic weapons, \ntactical weapons. Even if they are long range, we consider them that. \nSecretary Gates and Admiral Mullen explained why in their answer to a \nspecific question from the Senate. They said:\n\n       Russian nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles . . . \n     could not threaten deployed submarine-launched ballistic \n     missiles (which will comprise a significant fraction of U.S. \n     strategic force under New START), and would pose a very \n     limited threat to the hundreds of silo-based ICBMs that the \n     United States will retain under New START.\n\n  In other words, Russian nuclear SLCMs can't take out our nuclear \ndeterrent in a first strike. That means if Russia were to use nuclear \nSLCMs against us, we could still use most of our strategic nuclear \nweapons and deliver an absolutely devastating blow in return. No logic \nin the sort of give-and-take of war planning, as horrible and as \nincomprehensible as it is to most people with respect to nuclear \nweapons, but it has all been done, appropriately, because they do \nexist, and it is important to our security. But no warfighting under \nthose situations is going to reduce our ability to not just defend \nourselves but to annihilate anyone who would propose or think about \ndoing that.\n  Ironically, it was the Soviets who once wanted to do what Senator Kyl \nis actually seeking to do. They wanted to categorize SLCMs as strategic \nweapons because we used to deploy a nuclear version of the Tomahawk on \nour attack submarines, and the Soviets\n\n[[Page S10908]]\n\nworked very hard to get the original START treaty to cover SLCMs. Guess \nwhat. We didn't bite. We didn't do that. The first Bush administration \nexplicitly rejected those Soviet efforts to add legally binding limits \non sea-launched cruise missiles. They considered SLCMs tactical \nweapons, and they also thought that limits on nuclear sea-launched \ncruise missiles are inherently unverifiable. That is, in part, because \nwe didn't want to give the Soviets that much access to our submarines \nin return for access to theirs, and we don't want to do it now with the \nRussians. Now, maybe people were wrong about that, but I just don't see \nthe wisdom in putting the treaty we have agreed on on the shelf while \nwe go out and try to experiment with a new approach that nobody has \nargued is imperative for the security of our country.\n  Back then, we did agree in politically binding declarations to a \nlimit of 880 deployed long-range nuclear SLCMs and to declare at the \nbeginning of the year how many SLCMs we intended to deploy for that \nyear. Those political declarations stayed operative for many years, \nand, in fact, Secretary Gates stated for the record that as recently as \nDecember of 2008, Russia has declared that it planned to deploy zero \nnuclear SLCMs.\n  Shortly after START was signed in 1991, the United States and Russia \neach pledged as part of the Presidential nuclear initiative to cease \ndeploying any nuclear SLCMs on surface ships or attack submarines. So \nwhile we have four former ballistic missile submarines converted to \ncruise missile submarines, we are no longer deploying our nuclear \nTomahawk missiles on any U.S. submarines. The Presidential nuclear \ninitiatives are still operative for us and for the Russians, and we \nthink we are more secure that way.\n  So I see nothing to be gained from negotiating a new binding \nagreement in the context of holding up this treaty, of putting it on \nthe shelf, and of going back in an effort to do that.\n  This amendment would delay the New START for months or years, throw \nan entire curveball back into what I talked about yesterday, which is \nthat theory of negotiation that nothing is agreed upon until everything \nis agreed upon. And in this case, if we say: Oh, no, ain't agreed upon, \nsorry, we are coming back to say you have to agree with us on tacticals \nbefore any of this becomes law, we have opened the entire negotiation \nagain. How reliable and what kind of partnership is that? I don't think \nthat makes sense. I fail to see any point in going down that road.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment, and I reserve the \nremainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has just under 8 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am a little bit flummoxed here because I \nthought in a conversation I had a couple of days ago with Senator Kerry \nthat side agreements might be all right; that we didn't want to amend \nthe preamble or didn't want to amend the treaty but that we could \nperhaps do some side agreements. So we structured this as a side \nagreement just exactly as was done in START I.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. On the Senator's time, I would be happy to.\n  Mr. KERRY. I would be happy to urge, if he wants to change the \namendment or if he wants to submit--it is too late now, but we could \nperhaps do a modification by unanimous consent to urge the President to \nenter into an agreement but not shelve the whole treaty until that \nhappens. That is the difference. So I am not going back on the notion. \nIt would be great to get a side agreement, but don't hold this \nagreement up in the effort to do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, there was no delay in the implementation of \nthe START I agreement because of a requirement that a side agreement be \nentered into between the then-Soviet Union and the United States on \nSLCMs. So I don't buy the notion that this necessarily would delay \nanything.\n  Secondly, we are not talking about tactical missile limitations \ngenerally. All we are doing is talking about the same kinds of missiles \nthat were the subject of the side agreement under START I. I suspect \nthat part of the reason was because it is pretty difficult to \ndistinguish as to whether these weapons are being used for a strategic \nor a tactical purpose. Senator Kerry has said they cannot upset the \nstrategic balance. I simply totally disagree with that proposition. \nThey absolutely can upset the strategic balance, depending upon where \nthey are located or how they intend to be used. That is one of the \nreasons I suspect they were limited under the START I treaty.\n  My colleague said they can't threaten our submarine fleet at sea and \nthey pose only a limited threat to ICBM sites. Well, that may be the \nopinion of our experts. They could sure threaten our submarine bases in \nWashington State at King's Bay. They could take out bases or other \nassets we have.\n  In fact, let me quote from a Russian article, the RIA Novosti Report \nof April 14, 2010, on the Graney class nuclear submarines:\n\n       Graney class nuclear submarines are designed to launch a \n     variety of long-range cruise missiles up to 3,100 miles or \n     500 kilometers with nuclear warheads and effectively engage \n     submarines, surface warships, and land-based targets.\n\n  Obviously, at 5,000 kilometers, as I said, that is a range longer \nthan some of the ballistic missiles that are covered by the New START \ntreaty. So these weapons--it is a little hard to characterize them as \neither tactical or strategic. I think it depends upon how they are \nused.\n  But the point is, if my colleague believes they can't threaten \nanything, then what is the problem with trying to set a limit on them? \nWell, obviously--or at least I assume obviously--the Russians don't \nwant to do that. I assume we raised this, though we don't have the \nnegotiation record, so I don't know whether it was raised. If it \nwasn't, why wasn't it? And if it was because we didn't think there was \nany threat to the United States, then I think it would be very \nimportant to ask some of our military folks why they think that is the \ncase given the kinds of targets that could be held at risk here and \ngiven the fact that we apparently reached a different conclusion during \nthe START I treaty implementation phase when the side agreement was \nnegotiated with the then-Soviet Union.\n  So I don't think it would delay anything. We do posit it as a side \nagreement rather than an amendment. We just say that the administration \nshould negotiate so that there wouldn't be a significant number of SLCM \ndeployments by the Russians given the fact that we are not doing any.\n  I do have to say that I fundamentally disagree with the assertion of \nmy colleague that this kind of weapon can't upset the strategic \nbalance. If you have a weapon that can fly over 3,000 miles with a \nnuclear warhead, which could be just as big of a nuclear warhead as on \na bomber or an intercontinental ballistic missile, with all of the \ntargets on our eastern seaboard or western seaboard that would be held \nat risk for such a weapon--in fact, 3,000 miles--you won't have to be \nfar off either of our two U.S. coasts to hit most targets within the \ncontinental United States.\n  This is a weapon that it seems to me we should be concerned about. \nTherefore, I urge my colleagues to support calling for a side agreement \nthat would deal with the SLCMs just as we did under the START I treaty.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I say to Senator Kyl, these missiles are \nnot strategic. Do they affect our strategic balance? I say that \neverything in our defense toolbox can affect our strategic balance. \nThat was taken into consideration in the negotiations. I thank him for \nbringing this issue to our attention, but for the reasons we have \nstated, we urge our colleagues to reject the amendment.\n  We are prepared to go to the Senator's next amendment if he is \nprepared to go forward.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will respond with about 30 seconds. Then I \nwill be prepared to go to my next amendment. Perhaps I can reserve \nwhatever time I have left on there to make a closing argument.\n  I really do sincerely appreciate the characterization of these issues \nwe have raised as serious and important. I do appreciate that. I do \nthink, though,\n\n[[Page S10909]]\n\nthat it would be appropriate to have a better response than just that \nthis will upset the Russians, they won't want to do it, so we will have \nto renegotiate the treaty, and that it will delay things and that will \ncreate problems.\n  The purpose is not to delay, as I said. I don't think the START I \ntreaty was delayed when we reached a side agreement.\n  I think, in any event, the question is this: Should the United States \ndelay, if that is what is called for, in order to improve the treaty in \nimportant respects? If it is conceded that this is an important aspect, \nthen it seems to me that it is worth taking time to do it right.\n  Most of the arguments that have been made in response to the \namendments we have raised boil down to: The Russians won't want to do \nwhat you say, and therefore we need to reject your amendment because it \nwould require some renegotiation. I get back to the point I have made \nover and over: Then what is the Senate doing here? Why would the \nFounders have suggested we should have a role in relation to treaties \nif every time we try to change something, the argument is that you \ncannot change a comma because the other side wouldn't like that and \nthat would require renegotiation?\n  There is nothing that serious about this treaty that it has to go \ninto effect tomorrow. The Washington Post had an editorial, and they \nsaid that no great calamity will befall the United States if this \ntreaty is not concluded before the end of the year. I think that is \nalmost a direct quotation. There is no immediate national security \nreason to do so. I know the administration would like to get on with \nit, but no great harm will befall us if we take time to do it right. If \nwe are not willing to do that, the Senate might as well rubberstamp \nwhat the President sends up because the argument will be that if we try \nto suggest changes, the other side will reject them and we could not \npossibly abide that.\n  I will reserve the remainder of time on this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4893\n\n  Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4893, which I believe is at \nthe desk, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4893.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide that the advice and consent of the Senate to \n  ratification of the New START Treaty is subject to an understanding \nregarding the non-use of covers by the Russian Federation that tend to \n interfere with Type One inspections and accurate warhead counting, is \n  subject to the United States and the Russian Federation reaching an \n    agreement regarding access and monitoring, and is subject to a \n certification that the Russian Federation has agreed that it will not \n deny telemetric exchanges on new ballistic missile systems it deploys \n                   during the duration of the Treaty)\n\n       At the end of subsection (a) of the Resolution of \n     Ratification, add the following:\n       (11) Covers.--Prior to entry into force of the New START \n     Treaty, the President shall certify to the Senate that the \n     President has reached an agreement with the Government of the \n     Russian Federation on the non-use of covers by the Russian \n     Federation that tend to interfere with Type One inspections \n     and accurate warhead counting.\n       (12) Telemetry.--Prior to entry into force of the New START \n     Treaty, the President shall certify to the Senate that the \n     United States has reached a legally-binding agreement with \n     the Russian Federation that each party to the Treaty is \n     obliged to provide the other full and unimpeded access to its \n     telemetry from all flight-test of strategic missiles limited \n     by the Treaty.\n       (13) Telemetric exchanges on ballistic missiles deployed by \n     the russian federation.--Prior to the entry into force of the \n     New START Treaty, the President shall certify to the Senate \n     that the Russian Federation has agreed that it will not deny \n     telemetric exchanges on new ballistic missile systems it \n     deploys during the duration of the Treaty.\n\n       At the end of subsection (b), add the following:\n       (4) Type one inspections.--The United States would consider \n     as a violation of the deployed warhead limit in section 1(b) \n     of Article II of the Treaty and as a material breach of the \n     Treaty either of the following actions:\n       (A) Any Type One inspection that revealed the Russian \n     Federation had deployed a number of warheads on any one \n     missile in excess of the number they declared for that \n     missile.\n       (B) Any action by the Russian Federation that impedes the \n     ability of the United States to determine the number of \n     warheads deployed on any one missile prior to or during a \n     Type One inspection.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would have preferred to deal with each of \nthe subjects in this amendment individually because each one is very \nimportant. To accommodate the other side's desire to try to get as much \ndone as quickly as possible, we consolidated some amendments, and there \nis a lot in this. I regret that we don't have time to get into detail \nabout each one of them.\n  This amendment amounts to an effort to try to improve the \nverification of the treaty to deal with a variety of issues which have \nbeen raised in the past and which we believe are inadequately dealt \nwith by the treaty. One of them involves covers, the kinds of things \nthe then-Soviet Union and now Russians consistently put over the \nwarheads so that it is impossible for our inspectors to see what is \nunder them, to see how many warheads are under them. That has been a \nproblem in the past.\n  On telemetry, we say the President should certify to the Senate that \nhe has reached a legally binding agreement with the Russian Federation \nso that each party is obliged to provide full and unimpeded access to \nits telemetry from all flight tests of strategic missiles limited by \nthe treaty. That is important because while we are not developing a new \ngeneration of missiles, the Russians are. We will be denied the \ntelemetry of those missile tests if the Russians decide to deny it. Our \nintelligence community has told us that this is of great value to us in \nassessing the capabilities of Russian missiles. Under the treaty, they \ndon't have to provide anything. They could provide telemetry on old \nmissiles they are testing, and they don't have to provide any on any of \nthe new missiles they are testing. We believe that should be done. The \nsame thing with respect to any ballistic missiles deployed during the \nduration of the treaty.\n  Then we turn to the subject of inspections. There are different kinds \nof inspections, but we are talking here about type one inspections in \nwhich we say that the United States would consider it a violation of \nthe deployed warhead limit and a material breach of the treaty if the \nRussians do one of two things: No. 1, any type one inspection that \nrevealed that the Russian Federation had deployed a number of warheads \non any one missile in excess of the number they declared for that \nmissile; No. 2, any action by the Russian Federation that impedes the \nability of the United States to determine the number of warheads \ndeployed on any one missile prior to or during a type one inspection.\n  That gets to the issue of covers again. Why is this important? \nBecause we are supposedly counting weapons in this treaty, warheads. \nThere is a limit of 1,550 warheads. How can we possibly verify \ncompliance if, when we seek to count the number of warheads on top of \nmissiles we have designated and have a right to inspect, we can't count \nthe warheads? You tell me how we are supposed to assume how many \nwarheads there are on the top of that particular missile or why we \nshould not deem it a material breach if they declared a certain number \nof warheads and it turns out there are more.\n  I think these are commonsense changes that would strengthen the \nverification provisions of the treaty.\n  It is too bad Senator Bond is not here tonight. He is the ranking \nRepublican member of the Intelligence Committee. In the classified \nsession we had yesterday, he talked about the deficiencies in \nverification under this treaty. This subject doesn't permit us to get \ninto a lot of detail in open session.\n  We have heard a lot about past cheating by the Russians and the kinds \nof things that were done. What we are trying to do with these basic \ncomponents is to make it less likely that the Russians would cheat, and \nif they do, it would less likely have an impact on the\n\n[[Page S10910]]\n\nkey element of the treaty, which is the limitation on warheads of \n1,550.\n  I will note a couple of things here that put this into context.\n  There have been allegations that there is better verification than \never before under this treaty. That is just not true. The verification \nprovisions of this treaty are not as strong as under the START I \ntreaty. There is an argument that they don't need to be for various \nreasons or the Russians weren't willing to allow them to be for various \nreasons. I don't think you can say the verification is better.\n  Former Secretary of State James Baker, who testified, said:\n\n       The verification mechanism in the New START Treaty does not \n     appear as rigorous or extensive as the one that verified the \n     numerous and diverse treaty obligations and prohibitions \n     under START I. This complex part of the treaty is even more \n     crucial when fewer deployed nuclear warheads are allowed than \n     were allowed in the past.\n\n  That is obvious. The more you get down to a smaller number, the more \nimportant cheating is, the more dramatic the effect can be, and the \nbetter verification you need.\n  Senator McCain said this:\n\n       The New START Treaty's permissive approach to verification \n     will result in less transparency and create additional \n     challenges for our ability to monitor Russia's current and \n     future capabilities.\n\n  Former CIA Director James Woolsey said:\n\n       New START's verification provisions will provide little or \n     no help in detecting illegal activity at locations the \n     Russians fail to declare, are off-limits to U.S. inspectors, \n     or are underground or otherwise hidden from our satellites.\n\n  Senator Bond made a comment that I have quoted before, which is this:\n\n       New START suffers from fundamental verification flaws that \n     no amount of tinkering around the edges can fix. . . . The \n     Select Committee on Intelligence has been looking at this \n     issue closely over the past several months. . . . There is no \n     doubt in my mind that the United States cannot reliably \n     verify the treaty's 1,550 limit on deployed warheads.\n\n  To conclude, the amendment would require the President to certify \nthat he has reached an agreement with Russia on the nonuse of covers \nthat interfere with type one inspections and accurate warhead counting \nduring those inspections. It doesn't solve the problem of determining \nthe total number of warheads Russia deploys, but it would reduce a \nmethod of deception Russia has used in the past.\n  On telemetry, the amendment would require the President to certify \nthat he has reached a legally binding agreement with Russia that each \nparty is obliged to provide the other full and unimpeded access to its \ntelemetry from all flight tests of strategic missiles, including on new \nballistic missile systems deployed by the Russians. They are free now \nto encrypt those tests. That makes it much harder to get information we \nhave found to be very valuable.\n  Finally, with regard to the material breach, the amendment contains \nan understanding that the United States would consider a violation of \nthe deployed warhead limits to be a material breach of the treaty. This \nwould include any type one inspection that revealed the Russians had \ndeployed a number of warheads on any one missile in excess of the \nnumber they declared for that missile or that they continued to use \ncovers that deny us the ability to see exactly how many warheads they \nhave on their missiles.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues would recognize that verification \nis a problem under the treaty. This is a modest way to try to deal with \nspecific aspects of that verification. I hope my colleagues would be \nwilling to support the amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate votes on the three amendments, as provided under the previous \norder, those votes occur in the order listed in that agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Might we also add that the second two votes would be 10-\nminute votes?\n  Mr. KERRY. That is a good suggestion. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe second two votes be 10 minutes in length.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me first compliment my colleague from \nArizona, who has been dogged, if nothing else, in his advocacy with \nrespect to his points of view regarding this treaty. And while I and \nother Senators may disagree with a specific amendment he proposes \nbecause of its impact as well as, in some cases, because of something \nelse, that doesn't mean the Senator isn't raising valid questions for \nfuture discussions and things on which we ought to be focused. I know \nhe spends a lot of time with this. I think all of us have a lot of \nrespect for the ways in which he has already impacted this treaty. I \ngive him credit for that.\n  This particular amendment is a combination of about four different \namendments that have come together. I understand why that happened. I \nam not complaining about that at all. It is just that there is a lot in \nit, and therefore there are different reasons one ought to oppose this \namendment.\n  Let me say that, first of all, the New START, I think in most \npeople's judgment, addresses the concerns that have been raised by the \nSenator from Arizona.\n  The purpose of warhead inspections is to count the number of warheads \non the missile. Neither side is comfortable with the other actually \nseeing the warheads, looking into it and seeing it. We are not \ncomfortable with them doing that to us, and they are not comfortable \nwith us doing that to them. That is not so much about the counting of \nthe warhead as it is often the issue of failsafe devices or counter-\nshoot-down devices and other kinds of things that might be in there \nthat we don't necessarily have a right to see and they don't want us to \nsee. So neither side is sort of looking at the actual warhead. The \nSTART treaty--the original START treaty, therefore, to deal with that \nissue, lets the inspected party cover the warheads on the front of the \ninspected missile, but it allows us to inspect any cover before it is \nused so that we know what it can and can't conceal. We know what that \ncover is permitting us to see.\n  What is more, paragraph 11 of section (2) in the treaty's annex on \ninspections says explicitly--this is in New START:\n\n       The covers shall not hamper inspectors.\n\n  We did not have that previously. That is new to this treaty.\n  As a result of what we have learned in START, we have learned how to \nlook and how to ask for things more appropriately, and our negotiators \nworked that into this treaty so as to protect our interests.\n  In fact, the covers are not allowed to hamper the inspectors in \nascertaining that the front section contains a number of reentry \nvehicles equal to the number of reentry vehicles that were declared for \nthat deployed ICBM or deployed SLBM.\n  The virtue of the New START treaty is that these declarations and the \nspecific alphanumeric numbers that are going to be attached to the \nlaunchers and these warheads allow us enormous certainty in the \nrandomness of our choices of where we go. If the Russians are cheating \nor somebody is over for one reason or another, we have great capacity \nto decide where that might be, where we think the best target of \nopportunity is, and to lock that place down and go in and check it. \nThere are enormous risks of being discovered as a consequence of the \nway we have set that up.\n  The treaty already forbids Russia from using covers that interfere \nwith warhead counting. It would create a very dangerous precedent, in \nmy judgment, to require that we negotiate now, before we put the treaty \ninto effect, a side agreement on the very same thing. That might \nsuggest that other New START provisions do not need to be obeyed \nbecause there is no side deal reinforcing them. What is the impact of \nthe side deal? Does the side agreement, incidentally, have to be \nratified by the Senate before it goes into effect? There are a lot of \nimponderables here.\n  With respect to the agreement on telemetry, the requirement for a \nlegally binding agreement with Russia that both parties have to provide \ntelemetry on all flight tests of ICBMs and SLBMs, which is what the \nSenator is seeking, would also delay the START treaty into force by the \nsame months or years about which we talked.\n  That argument has been hammered around here the last 7 days \nadequately.\n\n[[Page S10911]]\n\nThis delays the treaty. It does not act to increase the security of our \ncountry, and it already is in the resolution of ratification in the \ntreaty.\n  Given what we already understand, we know that the Russians do not \nlike trading in telemetry. I find it hard to believe, therefore, that \nif we make this treaty condition precedent on the agreement of a side \nagreement, which we know the Russians hate to do, that is a way of \nbuying into gridlock, deadlock, nothing.\n  I do not think anybody would suggest--we have already been through \nthis a little bit, incidentally. I and others strongly urged the \nPresident and his negotiators to seek as significant telemetry as \npossible. For a lot of reasons, it did not turn out that it was \nachievable from their side, but it also did not turn out it was \ndesirable on our side altogether.\n  Russia is testing new systems such as the Belava SLBM, and the United \nStates may test only existing types of missiles during the next decade. \nThat is a reason why the Russians obviously resist this very \nsignificantly.\n  A lot of people have suggested that our military does not want to \nshare the telemetry on all our flight tests of ICBMs and SLBMs. They \nare pretty happy the way the treaty is structured now, including the \nprovisions for telemetry which allow us five telemetry exchanges. We \nhave to agree on them, but they are allowed under the treaty. If that \nwere not true, there is no way the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff Admiral Mullen would have sent the letter he sent to the entire \nSenate where he stated he wants this treaty ratified now, he wants it \nimplemented now, and he believes, consistent with everything people \nsaid within our national security network, that this treaty is both \nverifiable and enhances our capacity to be able to count and know what \nthe Russians are doing.\n  The requirement for Russian agreement not to deny telemetry on the \nnew ballistic missile systems it develops during the duration of the \ntreaty is redundant with the previous part about which we just talked.\n  Again, the amendment requires a side agreement with the Russians. It \nis the absolute equivalent of amending the treaty itself and, \ntherefore, I would oppose that.\n  The New START's telemetry exchange regime involves negotiating the \nbeginning of next year, assuming this goes into effect, which missile \ntests from the past year we are willing to share.\n  May I ask how much time I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to reserve time for the Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n  The New START regime requires us to negotiate at the beginning of \nnext year what we are going to share. If we do not offer anything \ninteresting, Russia is not going to offer anything. That is the nature \nof a negotiation. You have to give to get. This amendment would change \nthat basic principle from a negotiated exchange to a literally ``give \nme something for next to nothing.'' It does not work. The Russians \nwould have to give us the good stuff while we would give them telemetry \nfrom launches that were no different from 30 other tests over the last \n20 years.\n  I have to tell you, that sort of agreement is not going to happen. It \nis in a fantasy land, and the President would never get that side deal \nwith Russia. The New START treaty would never come into force.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I will speak only for about 1 minute and \nthen give the rest of my time to Senator Feinstein who wishes to speak \nto the question of the covers.\n  I do not want to speak to the technicalities that have been raised, \nbut I want to make two points in response to Senator Kyl's concern \nabout verification.\n  We should all be concerned about the fact that right now we have no \ninspectors on the ground. We have no way to verify what is going on in \nRussia. Anything that delays our ability to get that intelligence back \non the ground in Russia adds to the urgency of the situation. That is a \nvery important point.\n  The other issue he raised was relative to why do we need to do this \nnow. The fact is, as Senator Kerry pointed out, we received a letter \nfrom ADM Mike Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, yesterday that \nsaid the sooner we ratify the treaty, the better. James Clapper, \nDirector of National Intelligence, said about New START the earlier, \nthe sooner, the better we get this done. There is a lot of reason to \nbelieve we need to act on this treaty and need to do it now.\n  I yield to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Senator Kyl is a very smart man. This is a major amendment. In my \nview, it is a deal breaker. It is a poison pill for the entire treaty. \nIt essentially provides real changes in the treaty.\n  It says the President, prior to the treaty going into effect, must \ncertify that he has achieved certain side agreements, and those side \nagreements strike directly at some of the heart of the treaty. \nTherefore, it will effectively, in my view, be unacceptable to the \nRussians and will destroy the treaty.\n  The treaty now says you cannot block an inspector's ability to \nascertain warheads on a reentry vehicle. That covers the cover issue. \nThis again says that telemetry by a prior agreement--that there be a \nside agreement on full access to telemetry for all missiles, and then \non new missiles, is one-sided. Clearly, this is not going to be \nacceptable. Then it goes into the type one inspections.\n  If you are for the treaty, there is only one vote, and it is to vote \nno. I very much regret this because I respect the Senator. As I see \nit--and there are things I cannot go into here that I tried to go into \nyesterday--this is a poison pill amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Might I inquire how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me take 3, 4, 5 of those minutes. I \nappreciate my colleagues' compliments about important issues being \nbrought up, and I also appreciate their concern that amendments of this \nsignificance would cause heartburn for the Russians and might well \nrequire them to want to renegotiate aspects of the treaty. I am trying \nto address that through the mechanism of the side agreement rather than \namendment to the treaty or some kind of other more restrictive method. \nI thought that would be the preferable way to do it.\n  It is not my intention, as with the previous amendment, to delay \nthings. I do not think it necessarily would. But I do appreciate that \non a couple of these items the Russians would not likely want to \nrenegotiate.\n  I am not so sure that would be the case with regard to the covers, \nthis question of the kind of shroud or cover you put over the missile \nbus, the top of the missile that has the warheads since the treaty does \ndeal with it, as my colleagues have pointed out, but I do not think it \ndoes so in a conclusive way.\n  The 2005 compliance report issued by the State Department to discuss \ncompliance of the Russian Government with respect to the START I treaty \nhad a couple of longstanding issues. The issue of shrouds was one that \nthey characterized as of long standing. They had a very hard time \ngetting that resolved with the Russians. In the end, there was a \nparticular accommodation reached, but it took forever. And during that \ntime, we did not have the kind of satisfaction we wanted.\n  We asked how disputes would be dealt with, and we get the same basic \nanswer. That would go to the Bilateral Consultative Commission, the \ngroup of Russian and U.S. negotiators who are supposed to work these \nthings out.\n  What I can see is a kind of repeat of what we had before. They like \nto cover these things up and that does not seem to me the way to enter \ninto a treaty where we are supposed to be in agreement with our \ncounterparts and yet we have unresolved issues we have to leave to \nanother day to be resolved through a long and probably difficult \nnegotiation process.\n\n[[Page S10912]]\n\n  Also, my colleague from Massachusetts--these were his words; he was \nnot quoting anyone--thought we had enormous certainty about this. I \nsuggest I do not think the intelligence community would use a phrase \nsuch as ``enormous certainty.'' We cannot get into here the degree of \npercentage they attach to being able to know certain things under this \ntreaty.\n  Suffice it to say that we are not absolutely sure we can do what \nneeds to be done here, and I do not think characterizing it as \n``enormous certainty'' would be an accurate way to do it.\n  Let me mention with regard to telemetry--first of all, let me correct \none thing that is a little bit of misdirection and then agree with my \ncolleagues on something else.\n  There is a suggestion that we can get telemetry on five missiles, and \nthat is true if the Russians agree. In other words, they have to \nvolunteer to do it. The five missiles they tell us about can be old \nmissiles. They do not have to be new missiles. It is a fact there is \nnothing in this treaty that requires the Russians or the United States \nto exchange telemetry on new missile tests; that is to say, tests of \nmissiles currently being developed. There are at least two the Russians \nare developing right now.\n  That leads to the second point. I think it is probably true the \nreason they did not want to agree to this is it would require them to \ngive us very valuable information. Right now, they would not be getting \nany information from the United States because we are not testing \nmissiles. But I ask, is that an asymmetry that is justified or that \njustifies a provision that says if you are not modernizing your forces \nand we are modernizing our forces, it is not fair to have us tell you \nwhat our missiles are like?\n  Under the previous treaty, both sides had to do that, and it gave \nboth sides more confidence. The Russians are developing new missiles. \nShould we not have some understanding of the capability of those \nmissiles? We are not developing any. It is almost as if the United \nStates would have to be modernizing its forces too in order to be able \nto justify a provision that said we had to exchange telemetry.\n  Maybe the United States ought to get on with the modernization of our \nmissile force so we can then go back to the Russians and say: You are \nmodernizing, we are modernizing, now how about the exchange. To me that \nis not an argument to require the Russians not to provide us \ninformation. And in fact, when the shoe is on the other foot, that \nargument falls by the wayside, and we end up putting limitations in the \ntreaty.\n  Here is an example. The Russians are not developing and do not seem \nto have any intention of developing something called conventional \nPrompt Global Strike, which is a fancy way of saying: Put a \nconventional warhead on top of an ICBM so you do not have to send a \nnuclear warhead halfway around the world to destroy a target.\n  We can see in today's conflict that we are not going to be engaging \nin a multiple nuclear exchange with another country but might well have \na need based upon intelligence that does not have a very long shelf \nlife that we want to send a conventional warhead to a specific target \nand that is something we would like to develop but the Russians are not \ninterested in doing that. So did we say to the Russians: So because you \nare not doing it and we are, therefore, we are not going to have any \nlimitation on this? No. We agreed, in fact, to a very important \nlimitation. Any missiles we use in that regard have to be counted as if \nthere were a nuclear warhead on top of it. So there is a 700-vehicle \nlimit. That is all the number of missiles we can have. And yet any \nmissiles that we put a conventional warhead on that have this ICBM \nrange have to be counted against that limit.\n\n  Well, the Russians aren't doing it, so why did we have to agree to \nsomething they are not doing? That is asymmetrical. That is not parity.\n  So it is okay for the Russians to say: Hey, if we are doing something \nyou are not doing, we are not going to be bound by anything in the \ntreaty on it. But by the way, if you are doing something we are not \ndoing, we are going to hold you accountable and bind you with a very \nimportant limitation in the treaty.\n  You see, the argument doesn't hold water. Russia and the United \nStates are not acting exactly the same with regard to our weapons. So \nto argue that anything we are doing differently from the other \nshouldn't count in the treaty is suspicious. And, in any event, it \nturns out we don't make that argument.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time on this amendment has \nexpired. The Senator has time remaining on the previous amendment.\n  Mr. KYL. Let me finish my sentence on this.\n  In any event, what is good for the goose is good for the gander. If \nwe put a limitation on the United States on something they are not \ndeveloping, then it is only fair to put a limitation on them with \nregard to something we are not developing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, do we have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 40 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield all that time to the Senator from Michigan, the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Massachusetts.\n  There has been reference made to a side agreement which was entered \ninto at the time of START I. There is a major difference between what \nhappened then and what is being proposed by Senator Kyl now.\n  That side agreement, first of all, was in front of the Senate but \nthere was no effort at that time to do what Senator Kyl's amendment \ndoes, which is to say prior to the entry into force of that treaty the \nPresident shall certify to the Senate that there was a legally binding \nside agreement. That was not part of START I, and it would seem to me \nwould absolutely derail this New START agreement.\n  Second, that was a political agreement, that side agreement that was \nentered into, which would last as long as the Presidents of both \ncountries were in office but would not necessarily last beyond that \nbecause it was not a legally binding agreement in that sense.\n  So there are two major differences between what happened at the time \nof START I and what is being proposed here by Senator Kyl. I hope we \ncould defeat the Kyl amendment No. 4860.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if any time remains, we yield it back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is yielded back.\n  Mr. KERRY. What is the parliamentary situation, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is still time remaining on the Wicker \namendment, and Kyl 4860.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly to that now, in \ndirect response to my colleague from Michigan.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, before he does that, do we have time \nremaining on either of those amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has time \nremaining on both amendments.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me quote from the START I treaty, Text of \nResolution of Advice and Consent to Ratification as Approved by the \nSenate:\n\n       The Senate's advice and consent to the ratification of the \n     START Treaty is subject to the following conditions, which \n     shall be binding upon the President: Legal and Political \n     Obligations of U.S.S.R.: That the legal and political \n     obligations of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics \n     reflected in the four related separate agreements, seven \n     legally binding letters, four areas of correspondence, two \n     politically binding declarations, thirteen joint statements . \n     . .\n\n  And so on. The two politically binding declarations are precisely the \nreference to the limitation of the SLCM numbers for both countries. I \nmean there is a dispute about whether it is legally binding in the same \nsense that the treaty itself is, but the heading of this is Legal and \nPolitical Obligations of the U.S.S.R., and it goes on to talk about . . \n.\n\n       The United States shall regard actions inconsistent with \n     these legal obligations as equivalent under international law \n     to actions inconsistent with the START Treaty.\n\n  And so on and so on. We believe these were binding and should be. It \nis no argument, however, to say that if somebody else didn't see it \nthat way, therefore, what we are asking for here is not\n\n[[Page S10913]]\n\na binding agreement. Whether you call it binding legally or binding \npolitically, in any event, I wish to see it done, because there is no \nlimitation on the SLCMs the Russians are planning to develop, and the \nsubmarine that is under development to carry them, and they could have \na strategic value as well as a tactical value. They were a subject of \nthe previous START I agreement and I think they should be a subject of \nthis agreement as well.\n  Let me summarize. The first amendment our colleagues will be voting \non is, I believe, the Wicker amendment, and then the second amendment \nis the amendment which would provide a side agreement for a limitation \non the number of Russian SLCMs--the submarine launch cruise missiles--\nand the third vote will be on the Kyl amendment relative to \nverification relating to covers on the ICBMs and telemetry on ICBM \ntests.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. How much times remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 3 minutes \non the Kyl amendment and 5 minutes on the Wicker amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, is Senator Wicker here?\n  I wonder, Senator Kyl, if we can yield back time. I know colleagues \nare waiting to vote.\n  Mr. President, by unanimous consent we yield back all time on both \nsides and go to regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, under the \nprevious order, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 4895 \noffered by the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Wicker.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are going to have one more vote tonight. \nSenators Kerry, Lugar, Kyl, and others are working on how we are going \nto work tomorrow morning. They will work this evening. Hopefully, we \ncan come in at 9 in the morning with, hopefully, an hour of debate on \nan amendment, and then we will find out where we are after that. The \nreason I asked for the attention of the Senate was to announce that.\n  However, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Levin, chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, and the ranking member, Senator McCain, each \nbe recognized for 2 minutes to explain something they are working on on \nthe Defense authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I think all of us have an interest in the \nDefense authorization bill. Senator McCain and I have been working on \nthis bill with members of the committee for about a year. This is a \nbill that has a lot of provisions critically important to our troops.\n  To give a few examples, it authorizes health care coverage for \nmilitary children, impact aid to local civilian schools, so-called CERP \nauthority, which is the commander's emergency response program, and \ntransfer of defense articles to the Afghan Army. It is about 800 pages. \nWe have removed from this bill what we thought were the controversial \nitems so that we could get it passed. We don't have the time to go \nthrough them, but that was our intent. We missed one controversial item \nwhich came over from the House having to do with Guam funding. We have \nnow reached an agreement that we would remove that provision from the \nbill. That is a removal. But we can't add any controversial items to \nthis bill; it will be objected to.\n  The only way we can do this for the troops, as we have done for 45 \nyears, is if we proceed with a unanimous consent agreement tonight. We \nhaven't\n\n[[Page S10914]]\n\nyet gotten there. I plead with our colleagues to let us get to this \nunanimous consent agreement tonight. It is the only time we can do it. \nThe House will be in tomorrow. They could take it up tomorrow, if we \npass it tonight. That is the status.\n  Senator McCain, I know, will speak on his support. But this is a plea \nfrom the two of us who have worked so hard with Members and our staffs \non a critically important bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The only thing I would add to the comments of Senator \nLevin is that there are policy provisions regarding training and \nequipment and readiness that cannot be just done by money. These are \nimportant policy decisions, important authorizations, including a pay \nraise--not for us. I urge my colleagues not to object to this Defense \nAuthorization Act. I argue it is critical to sustaining this Nation's \nsecurity.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we will offer this later tonight. We are \nnot offering it at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 4893 offered by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. \nKyl.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Bayh), the \nSenator from Alaska (Mr. Begich), and the Senator from Oregon (Mr. \nWyden) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me say to colleagues how we are going \nto proceed. With the consent of the Senator from Arizona and Senator \nLugar, we are going to accept two amendments, I believe. One of them we \nare checking with the White House and making certain we are all in sync \non it. But assuming we are, we will be able to have Senator LeMieux of \nFlorida speak for a few minutes on his amendment. In addition, there is \nSenator Kyl's amendment, which we will accept.\n  Subsequent to that, I believe Senator Thune wants to raise an issue \nregarding an amendment. We will do that. Then I think we will probably \nbe at a point where we will have an opportunity if people want to talk \non the treaty, or conceivably even on something else, I imagine there \nmay be a moment there, but I do not want to speak for the leadership on \nthat yet until we have cleared it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent--the Senator from Ohio has \nbeen trying to get the floor for most of the day, and because he wanted \nto give us the opportunity to move on the amendments, he has been very \npatient. I ask unanimous consent that he be granted 5 minutes to speak \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask the Senator, will you go ahead and handle the \nunanimous consent agreement on the two amendments. I do not have to be \nhere for that.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will do that and guarantee the Senator \nthat his amendment will be adopted. And I thank him. I want to thank \nSenator Kyl. He has actually--I know we have all been struggling here, \nbut the Senator has been extremely helpful in processing a lot of \namendments this evening, and I want to thank him for his good-faith \nefforts in doing that.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I appreciate the generosity of the senior Senator from Massachusetts \nand especially his leadership on one of the most important debates in \nthe 4 years I have been in the Senate. I thank Senator Kerry for that.\n\n\n                     Omnibus Trade Act/TAA and HCTC\n\n  Mr. President, I hold in my hand 500 pieces of paper, 500 \ntestimonials from retirees who lost their pensions and health care \nduring the GM bankruptcy. These are some of the 50,000 Americans who \nwill be hurt if we do not pass an extension of the health coverage tax \ncredit this week before the year is out.\n  This stack of paper here does not represent Delta retirees and it \ndoes not represent other retirees--thousands of others--who are in the \nsame boat as the Delphi/GM retirees.\n  Their pensions have been cut. Their employee-sponsored health care \nhas been eliminated. If we do not pass the omnibus trade bill--which \nincludes GSP, trade adjustment, the Andean trade agreement, and the \nhealth care tax credit, and some miscellaneous tariffs--if we do not \npass this, H.R. 6517, they will take in another economic blow. The \nblood from this one will be on our hands.\n  We must pass the omnibus trade bill before this Congress ends. I want \nto share a handful of letters. I know the Senator from Massachusetts \nyielded for 5 minutes, so I will do this quickly.\n  Mary Ann from Warren, OH, writes that she lost 40 percent of her \npension, all her health care, and all her life insurance earned from \nGM/Delphi. Here is what she said:\n\n       My husband is self employed and he is on my healthcare. He \n     suffers terribly with chronic pain due to degenerative disc \n     disease. He forces himself to work at least part time but \n     it's a struggle. . . . I have a cerebral condition recently \n     diagnosed. I spent a week in the hospital early this year and \n     am still paying on that too. A 75 percent hike in our \n     healthcare premiums--\n\n  And that is what will happen if we do not renew this, which will help \nthese 500 and another 50,000--\n\n     while we try to pay these medical balances on a reduced \n     pension would force us and many others into a downward spiral \n     of existence. Those who we entrust to represent us must \n     realize that our story could be theirs if life situations \n     were different. When do we start treating others how we \n     ourselves want to be treated?\n\n  Here are others.\n  Dan from Columbus, IN, writes:\n\n       Dear Senator Brown--I am a retired Delta Air Line pilot. \n     During my retirement, Delta took my retirement money that I \n     had spent a career of time accumulating and left me out in \n     the cold. The health care tax credit stepped in and helped by \n     giving our family some insurance premium help. Now this is \n     being destroyed too.\n\n  David from Atlanta, GA:\n\n\n[[Page S10915]]\n\n\n       It is very important that the health care tax credit . . . \n     be continued. After losing the pension income and insurance \n     benefits I was promised when I retired from Delta Airlines, I \n     have made significant adjustments to try to compensate for \n     the losses.\n       Still, after cutting back, the cost of living, skyrocketing \n     insurance premiums, and 2 years of trying to sell my house at \n     a substantial reduction of price while competing with \n     foreclosures, the finances of my friends and me continued to \n     erode.\n\n  Gary from Arrowhead, CA: Since Delta Airlines eliminated my pension \nand health coverage, I looked forward to a Kaiser Permanente HCTC \nqualified health insurance policy starting January 1. Without this HCTC \npassage, my premiums will be $2,600 a month.\n  These go on and on. The omnibus trade bill has received unanimous \napproval from every Democratic Member of this body. It is supported by \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Retail Federation, the AFL-\nCIO. It is my understanding most Republicans here support it. There are \njust a few blocking the passage of it.\n  On Friday, Senator Sessions objected to a request Senator Casey and I \nmade to pass the trade act. I understand his objection. I believe it \ncan be worked through. Senator Sessions said he supports the rest of \nthe package. I hope this obstruction doesn't interfere with the need to \nmove on this omnibus trade package. These 500 letters, if each of my \ncolleagues would read two or three of them, I think they would see how \nimportant it is we pass the Omnibus Trade Act. It is about the trade \nadjustment assistance language. It is about 50,000 people who will not \nbe able to afford their health insurance come January 1. Happy New Year \nto them. It also will help us with Colombia and other countries around \nthe world in our trade policies. This makes so much sense.\n  Tomorrow, Senator Casey and I and perhaps some others will ask for a \nUC. I hope my colleagues can see fit to move forward on this. It is \nsupported by business groups, by labor groups, by the majority of \npeople in this body. I am hopeful we can bring in the few people who \nstill disagree and make this work for our country.\n  I yield the floor. I thank Senator Kerry for his indulgence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I have had the opportunity to work out \nwith the Senator from Massachusetts an amendment to the resolution, \nwhich I will be offering in a second.\n  To my colleagues, what this does--we had this discussion the other \nday on the treaty. This is an amendment to the resolution that would \nrequire, within a year's time of ratification, that the President of \nthe United States certify to the Senate that the United States will \nseek to initiate with the Russian Federation negotiations on the \ndisparity between nonstrategic or tactical nuclear weapons and to make \nsure we secure those weapons and reduce the number of tactical nuclear \nweapons in a verifiable manner.\n  Remember, the Russians have a 10-to-1 ratio of tactical nuclear \nweapons over us--3,000 to 300--not talked about in this treaty, an \nimportant issue. This requires that the President will certify within a \nyear's time that the parties are going to sit down and have a \nnegotiation about the disparity, about verification, and about securing \nthese weapons. It has been agreed to by all parties.\n  With that, amendment No. 4908 has been cleared on both sides. I now \nask that the amendment, as modified by the changes at the desk, be \noffered and agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we just have \nto jump through a few hoops over here. We will not object ultimately, \nbut if I could ask the Senator if we could just wait a little longer, I \nwould object at this time but not ultimately. We need to get this \ncleared and put all the next steps together into one effort, if we can. \nIt doesn't mean we can't talk about some of the other issues, if you \nwant to, while we are waiting for that to be ready. It might be better \nto just wait until we have the agreement.\n  So, in the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has the floor.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Florida wants to \nspeak on this amendment. I ask unanimous consent that the following two \namendments be considered and agreed to: Senator Kyl No. 4864 and \nLeMieux No. 4908, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 4864 and 4908, as modified), were agreed to, as \nfollows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4864\n\n  (Purpose: To require a certification that the President intends to \n      modernize the triad of strategic nuclear delivery vehicles)\n\n       At the end of subsection (a) of the Resolution of \n     Ratification, add the following:\n       (11) Strategic nuclear delivery vehicles.--Prior to the \n     entry into force of the New START Treaty, the President shall \n     certify to the Senate that the President intends to--\n       (A) modernize or replace the triad of strategic nuclear \n     delivery systems: a heavy bomber and air-launched cruise \n     missile, an ICBM, and an SSBN and SLBM; and\n       (B) maintain the United States rocket motor industrial \n     base.\n\n\n                    amendment no. 4908, as modified\n\n  (Purpose: To require negotiations to address the disparity between \n                  tactical nuclear weapons stockpiles)\n\n       At the end of subsection (a) of the resolution of advice \n     and consent to the New START Treaty, add the following:\n       (11) Tactical nuclear weapons.--(A) Prior to the entry into \n     force of the New START Treaty, the President shall certify to \n     the Senate that--\n       (i) the United States will seek to initiate, following \n     consultation with NATO allies but not later than one year \n     after the entry into force of the New START Treaty, \n     negotiations with the Russian Federation on an agreement to \n     address the disparity between the non-strategic (tactical) \n     nuclear weapons stockpiles of the Russian Federation and of \n     the United States and to secure and reduce tactical nuclear \n     weapons in a verifiable manner; and\n       (ii) it is the policy of the United States that such \n     negotiations shall not include defensive missile systems.\n       (B) Not later than one year after the entry into force of \n     the New START Treaty, and annually thereafter for the \n     duration of the New START Treaty or until the conclusion of \n     an agreement pursuant to subparagraph (A), the President \n     shall submit to the Committees on Foreign Relations and Armed \n     Services of the Senate a report--\n       (i) detailing the steps taken to conclude the agreement \n     cited in subparagraph (A); and\n       (ii) analyzing the reasons why such an agreement has not \n     yet been concluded.\n       (C) Recognizing the difficulty the United States has faced \n     in ascertaining with confidence the number of tactical \n     nuclear weapons maintained by the Russian Federation and the \n     security of those weapons, the Senate urges the President to \n     engage the Russian Federation with the objectives of--\n       (i) establishing cooperative measures to give each Party to \n     the New START Treaty improved confidence regarding the \n     accurate accounting and security of tactical nuclear weapons \n     maintained by the other Party; and\n       (ii) providing United States or other international \n     assistance to help the Russian Federation ensure the accurate \n     accounting and security of its tactical nuclear weapons.\n       Strike paragraph (11) of subsection (c) of the resolution \n     of advice and consent to the New START Treaty.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, does the Senator wish to speak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts \nfor working on this with us. I think this is an important improvement \nthat will require that the United States seek to initiate negotiations \nwith the Russian Federation within a year's period of time. I thank my \ncolleague from Massachusetts, as well as other colleagues who were \nwilling to make this happen as part of the ratification.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. This is a constructive \namendment. We all agree that we need to reduce tactical nuclear \nweapons. Everybody who testified to us reiterated the importance of \nthat being the next step in terms of our relationship and increased \nstability. NATO allies also said it was essential to proceed to that. \nThe Senator's amendment helps us to make it clear that is the direction \nin\n\n[[Page S10916]]\n\nwhich we need to go. I thank him for his efforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amended No. \n4920 be made pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I do object. I want to say to the Senator \nthat I am delighted to have a discussion with him about this particular \nissue. But I think given the efforts we have made thus far to deal with \na fixed set of amendments has been affected somewhat by some of those \namendments that were filed late, and also not germane, requiring \ncolleagues at the last minute to consider a lot of issues on the floor \nthat are not pertaining directly to the treaty itself.\n  The subject the Senator wants to bring up and talk about, which is \nRussian cooperation on Iran, is absolutely essential to us as a matter \nof foreign policy. I want to join with the Senator in emphasizing that. \nI look forward to hearing his comments about it. I think we can have an \nimportant colloquy that could add to the record of our discussions with \nrespect to this treaty without negatively impacting the direction we \nare moving in at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, if I might, given that, speak to the \namendment. I regret that the amendment can't be voted on. The process \nhas been fairly open. A number of amendments have been considered. This \namendment was filed sometime this afternoon. It deals with an important \nsubject, which is germane to the debate that we are having with regard \nto the New START treaty.\n  One of the predicates for improving the START treaty is the so-called \nreset of our relationship with Russia. Of course, the President, as \nrecently as November 18, 2010, made a statement, which is in this \namendment:\n\n       ``The New START Treaty is also a cornerstone of our \n     relations with Russia'' for the reason that ``Russia has been \n     fundamental to our efforts to put strong sanctions in place \n     to put pressure on Iran to deal with its nuclear program.'' \n     Accordingly, the advice and consent of the Senate to \n     ratification of the New START Treaty is conditioned on the \n     expectation that the Russian Federation will cooperate fully \n     with United States and international efforts to prevent the \n     Government of Iran from developing a nuclear weapons \n     capability.\n\n  What this amendment does is to provide some assurance that all those \nintentions and statements actually come to pass. It would require the \nPresident to certify to the Senate the following:\n\n       Prior to entry into force of the New START Treaty, 1, the \n     President shall certify to the Senate that (i) the Russian \n     Federation is in full compliance with all United Nations \n     Security Council Resolutions relating to Iran; (ii) the \n     Government of the Russian Federation has assured the United \n     States that neither it nor any entity subject to its \n     jurisdiction and control will (I) transfer to Iran the S-300 \n     air defense system or other advanced weapons systems or any \n     parts thereof; or (II) transfer such items to a third party \n     which will in turn transfer such items to Iran; (iii) the \n     Government of the Russian Federation has assured the United \n     States that neither it nor any entity subject to its \n     jurisdiction and control will transfer to Iran goods, \n     services, or technology that contribute to the advancement of \n     the nuclear or missile programs of the Government of Iran; \n     and (iv) the Government of the Russian Federation has assured \n     the United States that it will support efforts at the United \n     Nations Security Council and elsewhere to increase political \n     and economic pressure on the Government of Iran to abandon \n     its nuclear weapons program.\n\n  That would be a commitment, a certification, that would be issued \nprior to the entry in force of the treaty by the President each year, \nand on December 31 of each subsequent year a similar certification \nwould be issued by the President. In fact, if the President fails to \ncertify, then it would require that he consult with the Senate and \nsubmit a report on whether adherence to the New START treaty remains in \nthe U.S. national security interest.\n  I say this because I think there is a direct connection and \ncorrelation between this treaty and the efforts of the Russians that we \nassume the Russians are going to commit to in terms of putting pressure \non Iran regarding its nuclear program and not doing things that would \nput in jeopardy the security of the region.\n  I have to say, obviously, this has a big impact on our great ally, \nIsrael, as well as the whole region. It would be very destabilizing if \nthe Iranians have a nuclear weapon. So I think the effort made by the \nadministration to ``reset relations with Russia,'' bears directly on \nthis treaty. As I said, it was stated clearly by the President as \nrecently as November 18, where he recognized that important \nrelationship. I simply say this amendment, I don't think, is anything \nthat anybody would not agree with. All it does is require not just a \nstatement that this is going to be part of our ongoing relationship \nwith Russia, but it provides an assurance, a certification that the \nadministration would make to the Senate before the treaty would enter \ninto force and each year subsequent to that with those basic issues.\n  The issues are fairly straightforward. It simply requires a condition \nthat the Russian Federation is in full compliance with all U.N. \nSecurity Council resolutions relating to Iran and the government of the \nRussian Federation assures the United States that neither it nor any \nentity subject to its jurisdiction and control will transfer to Iran \nthe S-300 air defense system or other advanced weapons systems or any \nparts thereof or transfer such items to a third party, which will in \nturn transfer such items to Iran.\n  While the S-300--for the time being, Russia has refrained from doing \nthat. There are concerns and reports that Russia has recently provided \nTehran with a new radar system allegedly through third party mediators \nfrom Venezuela and Belarus. So the concern about that coming into Iran \nthrough some third party is also something that I think is of great \nconcern to America's national security interests as well as those of \nour allies.\n  Mr. President, the amendment, again, is very straightforward. It \nrequires a certification before the entry into force of the treaty, and \nthen each year thereafter about those basic conditions that the \nRussians be in compliance with U.N. Security Council resolutions, that \nthey would not try to get the S-300 to the Iranians, directly or \nindirectly, and they would continue putting pressure on the Iranians \nwith respect to their nuclear program.\n  We know too that the nuclear reactor in Bashir is now producing \nplutonium. Russia has fueled a nuclear reactor there that is now \nproducing plutonium in Iran. That ought to be of great concern to \neverybody here as we pass judgment on this treaty, which is obviously \nimportant to our relationship with Russia, but also bears on the \nrelationship we have with other countries around the world.\n  I think anybody in the foreign policy community that you talk to \ntoday, when you ask what is the most dangerous threats the United \nStates and its allies face around the world today, Iran and nuclear \nweapons in the hands of Iran top that list.\n\n  So the efforts that we make to persuade the Russians to put pressure \non the Iranians and make sure there isn't anything going on there that \nwould destabilize or put in peril America's national security interest \nis certainly an objective we have.\n  This would require the President certify that those things are taking \nplace rather than relying on the statements and good intentions of the \nRussians. I wish, again, that I could get this amendment pending and \nget it voted on. I think it is important to have the Senate on record \nwith regard to this issue. I regret that the amendment has been \nobjected to.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to at least raise the issue, and I \ncertainly hope it is something that the administration and our leaders \nin the Senate and the entire military establishment of this country \npays close attention to in the days ahead. This issue will not go away. \nI think it bears definitely on the treaty.\n  With that, I will conclude my remarks and say I wish we had an \nopportunity to get a vote on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in, I think, 7 days, I have not made an \nobjection to an amendment that we tried to take up. I am sensitive to \nthat because we, obviously, want to provide as much opportunity to go \ninto these issues as is possible. I say to my friend from South Dakota \nthat I am happy to stay here with him and do as much as we could do to \nimpress on anybody the importance of the issue he is raising.\n\n[[Page S10917]]\n\nBut if we stayed here and went through the process of a vote, which \nwould conceivably take us a lot longer in terms of the other amendments \nwe have to finish tomorrow morning, as well as keep the Senate in even \nlater, only the votes--I think we had only one motion to table. Almost \nevery vote has been straight up or down. The votes have been 60 to 30, \nor 60-something to 28, or something like that. I think the reason is \nthat there is a fundamental flaw in the approach of this particular \namendment and the others we have had because they seek to prevent the \ntreaty from going into force.\n  The language says ``prior to the entry into force of the New START \nTreaty,'' the President has to do a series of things. Some of those may \nread in a fairly straightforward and literal way, but they are not \nnecessarily what can be done immediately or are even subject to our \ncontrol, in which case we wind up with a treaty that we have actually \npartially ratified because it cannot go into force, and it may never go \ninto force, depending on what happens with some of those things that \nare out of our control.\n  There are a lot of reports requested on one thing or another. I think \nthere is a more effective way to go at this, personally, that doesn't \nwind up with a negative impact on the treaty, where we are veering from \nour military and national intelligence leaders who would like to see \nthis put into effect as rapidly as possible. The effect of this is not \nto let that happen as rapidly as possible.\n  The Senator is 100 percent correct about our concern about Iran. We \nneed Russian cooperation in order to ever have a chance of enforcing \nthe sanctions that have been put in place, as well as finding the other \ntiers of cooperation that are going to be critical as we go forward, \nabsent Iranian shifts in policy. The fact is, what has happened through \nRussian cooperation right now is that the most significant sanctions we \nhave been able to put in place to date have been put in place. They \nwere largely achieved because of the relationship President Obama has \nachieved with President Medvedev and the reset button and the sense \nthat we are coming together, not going apart.\n  It is easy for us in the Senate to stand here and say we have to \nrequire this, we have to require that. A lot of these things I have \nfound increasingly--particularly in this time I have been chairman of \nthis committee--a lot of the things we sometimes do with good intention \nin the Senate actually very significantly complicate the life and work \nof our diplomats who spend as much time trying to meet some kind of \ncertification as they do doing the diplomacy they are meant to do.\n  I am happy to work with the Senator as chairman of this committee. We \nwill have hearings early next year on this topic of Iran and where we \nstand with respect to that nuclear program. We will look at this issue \nof Russian cooperation, and we will look at it hopefully within the \ncontext of a START treaty that is going to be ratified by the Duma and \nimplemented and that can only strengthen the resolve of both our \ncountries to focus on the challenges of Iran.\n  I thank my colleague. I have been in that position before when we \nhave not been able to get an amendment in.\n  I might add, the amendment was filed a day and a half after cloture \nwas filed. I said to Jon Kyl very clearly that we were going to try to \nbe as flexible as we could. That flexibility needed to be mostly \nfocused on those amendments that directly affect the treaty or are to \nthe treaty in its most direct sense. If we raised a point of order, \nthis would be an amendment that would be found to be not germane \nbecause it is outside those direct treaty issues. With that in mind, I \nhave taken the position I have taken. But I look forward to working \nwith my colleague, if we can, as we go forward from here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Massachusetts that \nif he would allow me to vote on the amendment, I would try to break \nthat 35-vote threshold that we have seen, to blow through that cap.\n  I appreciate the fact that the Senator shares the concerns I have \nabout Iran. All I would say is I think what this provides is an \nadditional safeguard as we move into this process and we have this \ntreaty and a clearly established connection between what is a great \nthreat, a regional threat and, I would argue, a threat beyond the \nregion, certainly to our national security as well, the Iranian threat, \nand the relationship we have with Russia and this treaty and the good-\nfaith effort that we are making through this treaty with the Russians \nto reset, that this would provide an additional level of assurance that \nthey are, in fact, cooperating and that they are following through on \nthe commitments they are making to the administration and to us as we \ndebate this treaty.\n  Again, I will not belabor the point. The point has been made. I do \nthink this is a germane amendment. I take issue with the chairman's \ncontention that it is not. But at this particular late hour and with \nhis objection to this, I know I am probably not going to have an \nopportunity to have this amendment voted on, but I hope the issue \ncontinues to stay front and center, in front of this body and before \nthe Foreign Relations Committee and the Armed Services Committee on \nwhich I serve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, let's commit to work \nto make sure that happens. I certainly will do that on my part. I look \nforward to those hearings next year. Perhaps the Senator would even \nwant to find a way to take part in them.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, Senator Reid asked me a few minutes ago if \nI would communicate where we are with respect to the START treaty, and \nI will do so.\n  As it stands now, we have two amendments that remain. One is an \namendment by Senator Kyl on modernization, which I believe is the \nintention, though not yet locked in, of the majority leader to try to \ntake up around 9 o'clock in the morning. We expect to spend somewhere \nin the vicinity of an hour on it, maybe a little bit longer than that, \nto accommodate the speakers for Senator Kyl. Then there will be one \nother amendment after that on missile defense, I believe an amendment \nthat will be offered by Senator Corker and Senator Lieberman together. \nThat amendment will be the last barrier remaining before we can get to \nthe final vote on the treaty itself.\n  It would be my hope, depending on the negotiations going on and \ndiscussions with respect to the 9/11 first responders--those are \ndiscussions taking place now--depending on that, we will have a better \nsense of when that final vote will be able to take place. I know a lot \nof colleagues are trying to figure that out in the context of flights, \nfamily, and other things. Our hope is that will become clearer in the \nnext minutes, hours, moments of the Senate.\n  That is the lay of the land. I know the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee and the ranking member have made their request to \nthe Senate regarding the Defense authorization bill.\n  Our hope is that tomorrow morning we can move rapidly through the \nremaining two amendments. It may even be possible for us to accept the \namendment on the missile defense. We are working on that language now. \nIf that happens, obviously it will clear the possibilities of a final \nvote to an earlier hour, again dependent on this discussion regarding \nthe 9/11 first responders.\n  That is the state of play.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the approval by \nthe Senate of the New START treaty.\n  On December 16, I joined Senators Inouye, Feinstein and Alexander in \na letter to President Obama to express my support for ratification of \nthe treaty and funding for the modernization of our nuclear weapons \narsenal. At the time, I was concerned that this might not be taken \nseriously as a long-term commitment. The President has responded to our \nrequest and assured me that nuclear modernization is a priority for his \nadministration and that\n\n[[Page S10918]]\n\nhe will request funding for these programs and capabilities as long as \nhe is in office. I appreciate his commitment to this long-term \ninvestment.\n  The treaty before us is not perfect. Many of our colleagues have \nbrought forth ideas and offered amendments that will help address \nconcerns about the treaty. I share concerns about missile defense, \ntactical nuclear weapons, and limits on delivery vehicles, but I cannot \ndeny the potential national security consequences of not ratifying the \nNew START treaty.\n  After listening carefully to national security experts and the debate \non the Senate floor, I have been convinced that failure to ratify this \ntreaty would diminish cooperation between our two countries on several \nfronts, including nuclear proliferation, and limit our understanding of \nRussian capabilities. Furthermore, failure to ratify this treaty would \ncause further delays in getting our inspectors back to Russia after a \n1-year absence.\n  While I am dissatisfied with the way this treaty has been considered \nby the Senate in a lameduck session, I take our responsibility to \nprovide advice and consent to international treaties very seriously; \nand I do not think that the politics of the moment should trump our \nnational security priorities. I am cognizant of the fact that the New \nSTART treaty has received unanimous endorsement by both our country's \ndiplomatic and military leadership, and it would be an unusual response \nfor the Senate not to respect and consider their views on how best to \nsupport our national security interests.\n  I agree with them on the merits of this treaty, and I will support \nratification.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today and proudly stand among the \nlong, bipartisan list of Senators, statesmen, and military leaders in \nsupport of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. The New START \ntreaty is critical to our Nation's security because it places limits on \nU.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals, supports an improving bilateral \nrelationship with Russia, and advances international nuclear \nnonproliferation efforts.\n  Over the last three decades, both the United States and Russia have \nbenefited greatly from the bilateral reduction of nuclear weapons. \nThrough the efforts of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, \nthe two superpowers embarked on gradual nuclear disarmament, agreeing \nto reduce the number of their strategic warheads and deployed delivery \nvehicles through the negotiation and signing of the first START treaty. \nUnder President Obama's leadership, we are now considering the New \nSTART treaty, which, when ratified, will reduce these numbers even more \nin both countries.\n  The ratification of the New START treaty is vital to our national \nsecurity.\n  First, this treaty helps to decrease the threat of nuclear \ndestruction and strategic miscalculation by requiring the reduction of \nstrategic offensive arms such as warheads and launchers in Russia and \nthe U.S. Supporting this effort is a strong verification regime that \nincludes on-site inspections. Without this treaty, our inspectors do \nnot have the ability to monitor Russian activities. We have not had \naccess to the Russian nuclear stockpile for over a year. Our ability to \n``trust, but verify'' must be restored.\n  Second, this treaty reinforces our important relationship with \nRussia. It advances our Nation's capacity to build durable, \nmultilateral cooperation to confront international security risks from \ncountries like Iran and North Korea. In addition, a strong relationship \nwith Russia helps to keep available the supply chains that deliver \nequipment to the brave Americans serving in Afghanistan.\n  Finally, this treaty strengthens our nonproliferation efforts around \nthe world. By ratifying the New START treaty and taking the focus off \nof strategic weapons, the United States and Russia can increase their \nefforts on tactical nuclear weapons and proliferation. The risks \nassociated with nuclear proliferation are particularly serious and \ninclude acts of nuclear terrorism against the United States and its \nallies and the destabilizing effects of new nuclear arms races.\n  For many years I have been concerned about these risks. During the \n111th Congress, I have introduced bills that would decrease the spread \nof potentially dangerous nuclear technologies around the world and \nimplement key nuclear nonproliferation recommendations offered by the \nCommission on the Prevention of the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass \nDestruction and Terrorism. I have also called for more oversight of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency's Technical Cooperation Program and \nits proliferation vulnerabilities. Ratifying the New START treaty will \nreinforce these and many other nuclear nonproliferation efforts.\n  I urge my colleagues to strengthen national security by ratifying the \nNew START treaty.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise today to echo the call \nof the Senators and Presidents who have furthered the cause of peace. I \nrise to continue this body's longstanding work to reduce the threat \nthat nuclear weapons still pose to our Nation and world.\n  Much has changed since the groundbreaking arms treaties of the 1990s. \nThe cold war has ended, and with its end the balance of power changed \ngreatly. But the threat of nuclear war has not entirely gone away.\n  Over the last decade, we have seen the U.S. attacked on 9-11. And we \nlearned about al-Qaida's ambition to acquire a weapon of mass \ndestruction.\n  One mishap or one intentional attack is all that is needed to throw \nour entire global society into a tailspin.\n  Thanks to the work done through Nunn-Lugar, the U.S. has been \ninvolved in efforts since the end of the cold war to prevent nuclear \nmaterials from falling into the wrong hands.\n  But today, with our resources spread thin due to two wars overseas \nand the threat from failed states and unstable regimes in possession of \nnuclear weapons the risk of nuclear proliferation has steadily \nincreased.\n  That is why the goal articulated by President Kennedy, built upon by \nPresident Reagan, and further advanced by President Obama is more \nimportant than ever. Moving toward a world with zero nuclear weapons is \na move toward a safer and more peaceful future.\n  Through committed negotiations on the New START treaty, the U.S. and \nRussia have renewed their commitments to this important goal. Passing \nNew START would be another momentous step toward that more peaceful \nworld.\n  But, as we have all seen in recent days, and over the course of the \nyear since the U.S. and Russia reached this historic agreement, some in \nthis Chamber are playing partisan politics with an issue that has the \npotential to impact every person in America and across the world.\n  This political posturing is short-sighted at best. And it is \ndangerous at worst. The threat of nuclear weapons is not a partisan \nissue. It is an American issue. And, more importantly, a human issue.\n  When START One was ratified in 1991, it was ratified not with just a \nsimple majority but with 93 Members of the Senate voting in favor of \nthe legislation.\n  Similarly, START Two, ratified in 1993, had the support of 87 Members \nof the Senate.\n  The New START treaty deserves similar support from this body. \nObstruction of this treaty does not strengthen our country. It reduces \nour security. And arguments to the contrary go against decades of \nbipartisan work to reduce the threat of nuclear annihilation.\n  Those opposed to ratification say this treaty will diminish our \nnational security. They argue that we cannot rely on a smaller nuclear \narsenal to effectively deter an opponent.\n  These concerns have been overhyped and hyperpoliticized. And they \nfall flat in light of the scientific evidence provided by our \nscientists and engineers at the National Labs.\n  Along with Senator Bingaman, I helped lead a visit to New Mexico's \nNational Labs while the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was debating \nratification. The scientists and engineers at the Labs briefed the \ndelegation, which also included Senators Kyl, Corker, Risch, and Thune, \non issues pertinent to this debate.\n  After participating in these briefings, I am confident of two things. \nOne, that the United States can assure our allies\n\n[[Page S10919]]\n\nthat our nuclear arsenal remains an effective deterrent. And two, that \nour scientists and engineers will be able to verify that Russia is \nabiding by its end of the bargain.\n  New Mexico will be at the forefront of verification measures because \nthe Los Alamos and Sandia National Labs have the requisite professional \nexpertise to aid the monitoring of Russian forces.\n  I have been continually amazed by the work of our National Labs in \nNew Mexico. The Los Alamos and Sandia National Labs, and the \nhardworking men and women who serve there, are truly a treasure of the \nNation.\n  Unfortunately, some on the other side of the aisle have derided the \nlabs as ``decrepit and dangerous.'' This poorly imagined and strikingly \ninaccurate description couldn't be further from the truth.\n  Los Alamos National Labs Director Michael Anastasio, Sandia National \nLabs Director Paul Hommert, and Lawrence Livermore Director George \nMiller, have been unequivocal in their testimony to the Senate Armed \nServices Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  They all agree that our labs are prepared to maintain our nuclear \nstockpile, and they are ready to lend their scientific expertise to the \noverall mission of verification and reduction.\n  To quote Director Anastasio's Senate testimony:\n\n       I do not see New START fundamentally changing the role of \n     the Laboratory. What New START does do, however, is emphasize \n     the importance of the Laboratories' mission and the need for \n     a healthy and vibrant science, technology and engineering \n     base to be able to continue to assure the stockpile into the \n     future:\n\n  Sandia National Labs also plays a major role in stockpile \nstewardship, life extension, and stockpile surveillance.\n  Director Hommert's testimony makes clear that Sandia understands the \nchallenges involved under New START but that it is ready to undertake \nthose challenges. He said:\n\n       As a whole package, the documents describing the future of \n     U.S. nuclear policy represent a well founded, achievable path \n     forward.\n\n  I believe that it is no small coincidence that the progression toward \na world without nuclear weapons will require the continued, diligent \nwork of those who first created and then secured our arsenals.\n  The safety, security, and reliability of our available nuclear \nweapons will become increasingly important to our country as we reduce \nour stockpile.\n  For New Mexico, President Obama's strategy will mean an expanded role \nfor our National Labs in managing our Nation's nuclear deterrent.\n  For our country, President Obama's strategy means that we are one \nstep closer to closing the curtain of the cold war's legacy of nuclear \narms races.\n  For the world, it means we will be taking a step forward toward \ngreater cooperation and peace, and one step back from catastrophe.\n  Fewer weapons mean fewer opportunities for mistakes or losses of \nwarheads. Fewer weapons also mean fewer opportunities for unstable \nregimes such as North Korea, Iran, or Myanmar, or individuals with \nmalicious intentions to acquire or build a nuclear weapon.\n  The two nations with the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons have a \nduty to remain vigilant in protecting the rest of the world from the \nunthinkable. By ratifying this treaty, the Senate is upholding its duty \nto protect our Nation and to protect our shared planet.\n  President Kennedy said the following during his 1962 State of the \nUnion Address:\n\n       World order will be secured only when the whole world has \n     laid down these weapons which seem to offer us present \n     security but threaten the future survival of the human race.\n\n  By ratifying this treaty, we move a step closer toward realizing this \nlegacy and continuing a longstanding policy goal of our country--the \ngoal of creating a more peaceful and secure world.\n  Let us continue our work together by ratifying this treaty and \nsending a message to the world that the United States of America will \ncontinue making significant steps towards peace.\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, New START is a bad deal for the \nUnited States. It requires us to reduce our deployed strategic forces \nwhile the Russians can add to theirs. This amounts to unilateral \nreductions.\n  The treaty gives Russia political leverage, which they will use, to \ntry to prevent us from expanding our missile defenses to protect us \nagainst North Korea and Iran. This is unacceptable.\n  The treaty fails to deal with Russia's reported ten to one advantage \nin tactical nuclear weapons or their nuclear, sea-launched cruise \nmissiles. However, the Treaty will limit our nonnuclear ballistic \nmissiles.\n  Compounding these deficiencies, the treaty's verification is weak and \nthe Russians have a poor compliance record.\n  As vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I \nhave reviewed all the relevant classified intelligence concerning this \ntreaty. I come away convinced that the United States has no reliable \nmeans to verify the treaty's central 1,550 warhead limit.\n  It is also inexcusable that the United States has forfeited in this \ntreaty the rights it enjoyed under START to full and open access to \nRussian telemetry. This amounts to giving up the ``keys to the \nkingdom,'' as it will harm our ability understand new Russian missile \ndevelopments.\n  The administration has attempted to justify giving up Russian \ntelemetry on the basis that it is not needed to verify the New START \ntreaty. This is only true if you believe that the treaty's ten or fewer \nyearly inspections of Russian missiles will provide adequate \nverification. They do not. In fact, these inspections have three \nstrikes against them.\n  Strike One: The 10 annual warhead inspections allowed under New START \nonly permit us to sample 2 to 3 percent of the Russian force.\n  Strike Two: The inspections cannot provide conclusive evidence of \nwhether Russia is complying with the 1,550 warhead limit. If we found a \nmissile loaded with more warheads than Russia declared, it would be a \nfaulty and suspicious declaration. However, we could not infer that \nRussia had thereby violated the overall 1,550 limit. The Russians could \njust make some excuse for the faulty declaration, as they have in the \npast.\n  Strike Three: New START relies on a type of on-site inspections that \nRussia illegally obstructed on certain missile types for almost the \nentire 15 year history of START. Russia's use of illegal, oversized \ncovers were a clear violation of our on-site inspection rights under \nthat treaty. As the old adage goes, ``fool me once, shame on you, fool \nme twice, shame on me.''\n  Common sense tells us that the worse a treaty partner's compliance \nhistory, the stronger verification should be. However, according to \nofficial State Department reports by this administration and the \nprevious one, Russia has violated, or is still violating, important \nprovisions of most key arms control treaties to which they have been a \nparty. In addition to START, this includes the Chemical Weapons \nConvention, the Biological Weapons Convention, the Conventional Forces \nin Europe Treaty, and Open Skies.\n  We also know that the lower the limits on our weapons, the stronger \nthe verification should be. But with these lower New START limits, our \nverification of warhead limits is much worse than under the previous \nSTART treaty, with its higher limits.\n  With all these arguments against the treaty, proponents can only \npoint to one tangible benefit--that we will know more about Russian \nforces with the treaty than without it. This is hardly a ringing \nendorsement.\n  Learning more will hardly compensate the United States for the major \nconcessions included in this Treaty. What are these concessions? \nUnilateral limits, unlimited Russian nuclear systems, limited U.S. \nnonnuclear systems, unreliable verification, the forfeiture of our \ntelemetry rights, and perhaps most importantly, handing Russia a vote \non our missile defense decisions.\n  In many cases, concerns about particular treaties can be solved \nduring the ratification process. My colleagues have my respect for \ntheir attempts to do so. Unfortunately, New START suffers from \nfundamental flaws that no amount of tinkering around the edges can fix.\n  For these and other reasons, I cannot in good conscience vote to \nratify the New START treaty.\n\n[[Page S10920]]\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    Interest on Legal Trust Accounts\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise this evening to talk about a \nprogram that is of great importance to our citizens across America who \nare struggling to access legal services. There is a program that is \ncalled the Interest on Lawyer Trust Accounts or IOLTA. This is a very \ninteresting arrangement that I was not familiar with until I came to \nthe Senate.\n  Essentially, IOLTA is interest on lawyer trust accounts, and it works \nlike this. When lawyers need to put money into a trust account, they \nare putting it in that account on behalf of a client or on behalf of an \nestate. It is not allowed under the law for the client to earn \ninterest. However, there is an arrangement that has been made over the \nyears in which banks agree to pay interest on those accounts, since \nthey are accessing those deposits--those funds--but the interest gets \ndonated to legal services for poor Americans across the United States \nof America. So it is a win-win. The client isn't allowed to get the \ninterest, but the banks pay the interest to benefit low-income \nAmericans across our Nation.\n  That is the structure of the IOLTA accounts. All 50 States have these \nprograms. Forty-two States require lawyers to deposit client funds that \ndo not earn net interest for the client into these IOLTA accounts so \nthey will earn interest to pay for civil legal services for the poor.\n  During the financial crisis, the FDIC created a program to guarantee \nthat the business and trust checking accounts that do not pay interest \nare insured--they are guaranteed--and IOLTA was included in this \nbecause they do not pay interest to the client. The Dodd-Frank reform \nbill we had, which extended these arrangements for 2 years for accounts \nthat do not pay interest to the clients, forgot to include the IOLTA \naccounts that do not pay interest to the clients but do pay interest \nthat goes to fund civil legal services for poor Americans in all 50 \nStates.\n  So we are seeking to fix this glitch. I wish to note that hundreds of \nthousands of Americans who don't otherwise have access to legal \nservices are in a position to benefit when they need such services \nacross our Nation.\n  In Oregon, we have the Oregon Law Foundation, the nonprofit, \nnonpartisan organization that administers legal aid for the poor. They \nbenefited to the tune of over $1 million in revenue in 2009. When \ninterest was a little better, they had more revenue in 2008--$2.2 \nmillion. That was a decrease from 2007 of $3.6 million. So as interest \nrates have declined, the amount of funds that have gone to fund legal \nservices for the poor have declined, but still, a few million dollars \nis better than none in terms of providing assistance.\n  In a case such as this--the Oregon Law Foundation--IOLTA funding \nmakes up 95 percent of their total revenue. So if the guarantee is not \nextended for 2 more years, we have a real problem, and it goes like \nthis. A lawyer has a fiduciary responsibility to a client to put the \nfunds into an account that protects the client. They would not be able \nto put the funds into an IOLTA account if it is not guaranteed, if they \nhave the option of putting it into a noninterest-bearing fund that is \nguaranteed and, thus, the bank's willingness to pay interest. So the \nfunding that goes for legal services across our Nation will disappear.\n  I rise to talk about this because the deadline for this is December \n31. We have a bill to fix this before the Senate. But for those who are \nfamiliar, in the Senate, any Senator has the ability to put a hold on \nlegislation, and we have a situation where a Senator has put a hold on \nthis. I think, in general, this hasn't gotten much attention, the fact \nthat this assistance that goes to low-income Americans across this \ncountry will be deeply damaged, even if 99 Senators support this, \nbecause we don't have 100 Senators. So I am rising to basically make an \nappeal to my colleagues to take a look at the legal programs in your \nStates that are funded by this.\n  There are legal education programs that are funded. I hope my \ncolleagues will recognize that what we have is a lose-lose situation if \nwe don't change this law, and that lose-lose is legal education and \nlegal services. The banks will actually make more money because they \nwill not have to pay interest. So you have a lose-lose and a win--a \nloss for the poor, a loss for the students wanting legal education, and \na win for banks receiving greater profits.\n  In this situation, the banks have been absolutely stellar citizens of \nour communities. In Oregon, we have a host of banks that not only pay \ninterest on these lawyer trust funds, but they have agreed to maintain \na floor of 1 percent interest. I would like to mention these banks \nrecognized by the Oregon Law Foundation as leadership banks. I believe \nthis list is as of the end of the year 2009. By mentioning these banks, \nI am basically saying thank you to these banks for being involved in \nthis program. They include: the Albina Community Bank, the Bank of \nEastern Oregon, the Bank of the Cascades, the Bank of the West, Capital \nPacific Bank, Century Bank, Columbia River Bank, Key Bank, Northwest \nBank, Peoples Bank of Commerce, the Pioneer Trust Bank, Premier West \nBank, Siuslaw Bank, South Valley Bank and Trust, the Bank of Oswego, \nthe Commerce Bank of Oregon, Umpqua Bank--a bank that originated in \nsouthern Oregon, in timber country, Douglas County, where I come from--\nU.S. Bank, Washington Trust Bank, and Wells Fargo.\n  So all these banks have been willing to pay interest on these lawyer \ntrust accounts, knowing they are doing good work in the community by \nassisting legal programs.\n  I mentioned one of those programs in Oregon. Let me mention a couple \nmore. The Juvenile Rights Project provides legal services to children \nand families who do not otherwise have the means to retain counsel \nthrough individual representation in juvenile court and school \nproceedings and through classwide advocacy in the courts, the \nlegislature, and public agencies. It has the only help line offering \nlegal advice for children and teenagers in Oregon. So that is the \nJuvenile Rights Project.\n  Disability Rights Oregon. The Oregon Advocacy Center provides \nstatewide legal services to Oregonians with disabilities who are \nvictims of abuse or neglect or have problems obtaining health care, \nspecial education, housing, employment, public benefits, and access to \npublic and private services. Oregonians with disabilities look to OAC--\nthat is the Oregon Advocacy Center or Disability Rights Oregon--to \nprotect and advocate for their rights in courts, with public agencies \nand with the State legislature.\n  The Classroom Law Project promotes understanding of the law and legal \nprocess for 15,000 elementary and secondary school students in the \nState of Oregon by incorporating the lessons and principles of \ndemocracy into school curriculum. Their programs include the High \nSchool Mock Trial Competition. That is an extraordinary competition. It \nis wonderful to see how a high school student can blossom when \npreparing to argue before his or her peers the facts of a case and the \nlegal principles of a case. It is an enormous education.\n  The Classroom Law Project also includes the Summer Institute training \nfor teachers. This program enables those teachers to better address the \nissues of law and legal process in their classrooms.\n  Also included is the We the People program on the Constitution and \nBill of Rights. A lot of us often carry the Constitution. We understand \nit is the foundation for our government of, by, and for the people, and \nwe want our children to get an education in the Constitution. This is \nfunded in this fashion.\n  We also have help for citizens who are trying to get into a home \nmortgage modification, such as HAMP--the Housing Affordable \nModification Program--and also families who are working through issues \nof domestic violence.\n  So here is the situation. Families addressing domestic violence \nissues, families addressing wrongful home foreclosures, children--\njuveniles--seeking legal assistance, the disabled seeking resolution of \nissues regarding access to health care, special education, housing or \nemployment are being helped. The Classroom Law Project is helping \neducate our children about the Constitution, about the Bill of Rights, \nfunding\n\n[[Page S10921]]\n\nmock trial competitions, and funding the Summer Institute training for \nteachers. These are the types of tremendous programs that are funded \nthrough the interest on lawyer trust accounts. That line of funding, \ndue to a technical overrsight, ends on December 31.\n  So I am rising to ask my colleagues, if you are the Senator who is \nholding this up, I encourage you to get the facts from your State \nbecause all 50 States participate, and then let this funding, provided \nthrough a wonderful arrangement between the banks and our lawyers and \nthese trust accounts, go forward. Who knows how many thousands, the \nmultiple of thousands who will be assisted in challenging situations if \nwe fix this before we adjourn.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "21", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/21/senate-section/article/S10921-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REGISTRATION OF MUNICIPAL ADVISERS\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, on the occasion of the Municipal \nSecurities Rulemaking Board's, MSRB, implementation of congressionally \nmandated registration of municipal advisers, I would like to briefly \nspeak on this important development. Congress in the Dodd-Frank Act of \n2010 sought to enhance the regulation of the $3 trillion municipal \nsecurities market. The law expanded the authority of the MSRB in \nrecognition of the MSRB's deep and specialized expertise, and the law \nexpanded the mission of the MSRB to protect issuers and other municipal \nentities. It directed the MSRB to write rules regulating municipal \nadvisers--persons and firms that advise municipalities and public \npension funds or solicit their business on behalf of others, which \nincludes ``financial advisers, placement agents, swap advisers'' and \nothers. The law also reaffirmed the MSRB's authority to regulate the \nconduct of municipal securities dealers. At the same time, Congress \nrequired municipal advisers to exercise a higher, fiduciary standard of \ncare to those municipal entities that seek their advice about municipal \nsecurities and other related financial matters.\n  During the Senate-House Conference for the Dodd-Frank Act, the \nconferees carefully considered and debated alternative approaches for \noverseeing municipal advisers and strengthening municipal securities \nmarket regulation. We recognized that the MSRB has written a \ncomprehensive set of rules on key issues and said that the MSRB is \nwell-equipped and experienced to write rules regulating participants in \nthe municipal markets. Over the past decades, the MSRB has accumulated \nknowledge and hired specialized expertise to write rules regulating the \ncomplex and varied municipal securities market. In addition, the \nBanking Committee in its report, S. Report No. 111-176 accompanying S. \n3217, said that the MSRB is in the best position to assure that rules \nare consistent with other rules governing the municipal markets.\n  Under the new law, the MSRB is expected to develop a robust system of \nregulation for intermediaries, including swap advisers, as it has for \ndealers. Swap advisers were specifically identified in the statute and \nmade subject to MSRB rulemaking. The financial press has reported about \nState and local governments that received bad advice from advisers and \nentered into swaps and other derivatives that they did not fully \nunderstand, that are not performing as promised, and that are now \ncosting them tremendous amounts to unwind. Those swaps are often tied \nto municipal securities issued by those same State and local \ngovernments and Congress recognized the experience of the MSRB in the \nregulation of the municipal markets.\n  The act, which authorizes MSRB regulation over municipal advisers, \nhas limited exceptions, including an exception for commodity trading \nadvisers registered under the Commodity Exchange Act or their \nassociated persons who provide advice related to swaps. This exception \ncovers swap dealers and major swap participants regulated by the CFTC. \nIt does not extend to independent swap advisers or other types of \nmunicipal advisers not explicitly exempted, which are meant to be \nsubject to the MSRB rules. I expect that the regulators of municipal \nswaps advisers would adopt rules governing advisory practices that are \nconsistent with each other as well as relevant and appropriate for the \nmunicipal markets. Thus, municipal swaps advisers would be subject to \npractice rules embodying common principles, since they have the same \ntypes of clients.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "21", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/21/senate-section/article/S10921-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10921-S10923]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NOMINATION OF ROBERT N. CHATIGNY\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the nomination of Judge Robert Chatigny to serve on the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the Second Circuit. I would like to thank my dear friend \nand colleague, Chairman Leahy, for his efforts on this nomination. \nChairman Leahy, and his staff, does an outstanding job in seeking to \nensure that the Federal courts function as our Constitution prescribes. \nI applaud him for his work and his commitment to the rule of law.\n  Judge Chatigny was first nominated to the Second Circuit last year, \nbut after a sustained and, in my view, totally unwarranted attack on \nhim by some, my colleagues on the other side refused to grant consent \nto allow his nomination to remain pending in the Senate. As a result, \nunder rule 31, his nomination, along with 12 others, including 4 other \njudicial nominees, was returned to the President on August 5, prior to \nthe August recess.\n  While I was extremely disappointed by this development, I am pleased \nthat President Obama decided to renominate Judge Chatigny to this \nposition. Judge Chatigny is an individual of outstanding character, \nkeen intellect, and extensive judicial experience. I can think of few \njurists more qualified to serve on the Second Circuit than he, and I \ncongratulate President Obama on making such an excellent selection to \nfill this vacancy.\n  For 16 years, Robert Chatigny has been a Federal judge in \nConnecticut, serving as chief judge of the District of Connecticut from \n2003 to 2009. In addition to ruling on a wide variety of cases, Judge \nChatigny has earned a reputation for integrity, intelligence, and \nstrict adherence to the rule of law.\n  I am pleased that Judge Chatigny has received the support of numerous \nformer Federal prosecutors in Connecticut who understand the importance \nof upholding the rule of law and vouch for his character and his \nqualifications. Let me quote from a letter to the Judiciary Committee \nfrom three former U.S. Attorneys, each appointed by a Republican \nPresident:\n\n       We believe that he is a fair minded and impartial judge, \n     who has the appropriate fitness and temperament for the \n     appellate court.\n\n  In addition, the Judiciary Committee has also received a letter \nsigned by 17 former assistant U.S. attorneys currently practicing law \nin Connecticut, in which they express their confidence that he will be \n``unbiased, compassionate, and temperate.''\n  This support demonstrates the high regard in which Judge Chatigny is \nheld by the members of the legal community in Connecticut that know him \nbest. In addition to the praise from the Connecticut Bar, Judge \nChatigny has been unanimously rated ``well qualified'' by the American \nBar Association.\n  Judge Chatigny's legal experience prior to his appointment reveals a \nrich understanding of--and deep commitment to--the American legal \nsystem. After graduating from Brown University and the Georgetown \nUniversity Law Center, he served as a clerk to three Federal judges, \nincluding judges Jon Newman and Jose Cabranes. Prior to his service on \nthe court, he built an excellent reputation in private practice, first \nas an associate here in Washington, before returning to private \npractice in Hartford for nearly a decade.\n  In addition, Judge Chatigny has devoted substantial time and effort \nto improving the legal profession. When the Governor of Connecticut \nsought experienced and knowledgeable public servants to help make \nbetter public policy, Judge Chatigny was an easy choice, serving on \nboth the State Judicial Selection Commission and the State Commission \non Prison and Jail Overcrowding. In addition, he has served in various \nroles with the Connecticut Bar Association, as well as being an advisor \nto the congressionally created Federal Courts Study Committee.\n  Unfortunately, Judge Chatigny has become the target of totally unjust \nattacks that threaten not only to defeat his nomination but also send a \nchilling\n\n[[Page S10922]]\n\nmessage that will endanger the independence of all Federal judges.\n  One may wonder why the nomination of a judge so well qualified and so \nhighly regarded as Judge Chatigny has drawn any opposition at all from \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle. The answer lies primarily \nin Judge Chatigny's role in the appeal of the first death penalty case \nin Connecticut in 40 years. Here are the facts.\n  Michael Ross raped and murdered eight women. His crimes were heinous \nand inhuman. He was convicted in the State courts of Connecticut and \nsentenced to death. His defense of insanity, although seriously \ncontested at trial on the basis of conflicting psychiatric testimony, \nwas rejected.\n  On January 21, 2005, 5 days before the scheduled execution, a public \ndefender filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the \nConnecticut Federal district court that came before Judge Chatigny. The \npetition presented substantial evidence challenging Ross's competency, \nalleging that under the U.S. Supreme Court's 1996 decision in Rees v. \nPayton, Ross was not competent to waive legal challenges to his death \nsentence, and that his execution would violate the 5th, 6th, 8th, and \n14th amendments.\n  Three days later, on January 24, Judge Chatigny conducted a hearing \nin the habeas case and heard testimony from a psychiatrist supporting \nthe claim of incompetency. The judge issued a stay of execution. The \nnext day, January 25, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously \ndenied the State's motion to vacate Judge Chatigny's stay and dismissed \nthe State's appeal from the stay order. Two days later, on January 27, \nthe U.S. Supreme Court, by a vote of 5 to 4, vacated the stay of \nexecution.\n  Later that same day, Judge Chatigny received new evidence bearing on \nRoss's competency, and, mindful that he had been instructed not to \nenter any order delaying the execution, nevertheless felt it his duty \nto alert all counsel to the new evidence. He therefore faxed it to all \ncounsel, and convened a telephone conference to discuss the evidence.\n  The next day, January 28, Judge Chatigny convened another telephone \nconference with all counsel and learned of the existence of additional \nnew evidence bearing on the defendant's mental competency.\n  Shortly after midnight, the State agreed to postpone the execution \nuntil Monday, January 31, at 9 p.m. Later that morning, on January 29, \ndefense counsel received information that the psychiatrist who had \ntestified for the State might now have a different opinion on the issue \nof mental competency based on the new evidence.\n  Two days later, on January 31, defense counsel filed a motion in \nState court to stay the execution. The State did not oppose the motion, \nthe motion was granted, and the death warrant expired.\n  On February 10, the State trial judge ordered a new competency \nhearing, which was conducted in the State court for 6 days in early \nApril. On April 22, the State trial judge issued a decision finding \nthat Ross was competent, and on May 10, the Connecticut Supreme Court \naffirmed. Three days after this final ruling was handed down, Michael \nRoss was executed.\n  Thereafter, a State prosecutor filed a complaint against Judge \nChatigny alleging that his actions in the Ross case constituted \njudicial misconduct. The chief judge of the Second Circuit convened a \nspecial three-judge panel to investigate the allegations. The panel \nincluded former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey, who was then \nchief judge of the U.S. District Court in Manhattan. The panel \nunanimously concluded that no judicial misconduct had occurred, and \nthat ruling was unanimously adopted by the Judicial Council of the \nSecond Circuit.\n  Despite the unanimous conclusion of these distinguished jurists that \nJudge Chatigny did nothing improper in his handling of the Ross case, \nit has become a focal point for objections to his confirmation. Some \nhave argued that the judge should not have intervened, even briefly, to \ndelay the execution of such an evil person as Michael Ross, an admitted \nkiller of 8 young women.\n  I would, however, invite my colleagues to consider carefully the \nimplications of that criticism. Here was a district judge confronted \nwith a substantial claim, in a properly presented petition for a writ \nof habeas corpus, that new evidence put in doubt the competency of a \ndefendant about to be executed.\n  The judge had two choices: he could turn his back on the matter and \nlet the execution proceed without any examination of the new evidence, \nor he could insist that constitutional standards be followed and the \nnew evidence be considered so that the execution, if and when it \noccurred, would be carried out in accordance with constitutional \nrequirements.\n  Turning his back on the case would have been the easier course. \nAccepting the challenge to consider the habeas corpus petition, I \nbelieve, took considerable courage. The judge acted in conformity with \nhis oath of office, which obliges him to uphold the Constitution of the \nUnited States. And for that, he is being savagely attacked.\n  Some critics of Judge Chatigny's nomination point out that the stay \nof execution issued by the judge was later vacated by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt by a vote of 5 to 4. And, of course, that 5 to 4 majority \nultimately prevailed.\n  But it must be noted, in assessing Judge Chatigny's decision to issue \nthe stay, that of the 13 judges that reviewed the matter--1 district \njudge, 3 Circuit Judges, and 9 Supreme Court Justices--only 5 thought \nthe stay should not have been issued, and 8 thought it was proper.\n  Even more significant is the fact that once the new evidence was \nbrought to the attention of the counsel for the State, the State \nelected not to oppose a new court hearing so that the new evidence \ncould be fairly considered. The new evidence was of sufficient value to \nrequire 6 days of hearings in the State court.\n  Ultimately, the new evidence did not change the outcome of the case, \nand Ross was executed. But if Judge Chatigny had not intervened, an \nexecution would have occurred without the 6-day hearing that the State \ncourt found necessary to determine the defendant's competency, and the \nassurance of compliance with constitutional requirements would have \nbeen lost.\n  After a call for an investigation by some legislators in Connecticut \nwas made, the Bar Association's president publicly stated that ``no one \nshould want decisions of life or death made without consideration of \nall relevant facts and circumstances,'' and that the attacks on the \njudge threatened to ``undermine'' the independence of the judiciary. \nJudge Chatigny's handling of the Ross case was praised by both the \nHartford Courant and the Connecticut Law Tribune.\n  If Judge Chatigny is to be attacked for performing his constitutional \nfunction as he saw it, what message does that send to other judges when \nconfronted with constitutional claims in cases that understandably \narouse public passions?\n  Let me respond to one other criticism that has been made concerning \nthe Ross case. The critics have quoted Judge Chatigny as saying that \nRoss should never have been convicted. Their quotation is a serious \ndistortion of what the judge said.\n  Speaking with reference to the evidence of Ross's insanity defense, \nthe judge said, expressing the traditional standard courts use in \ndetermining whether there is sufficient evidence to present an issue to \nthe jury, that ``looking at the record in a light most favorable to Mr. \nRoss, he never should have been convicted.'' Unfortunately, the critics \nhave left out the important first half of that statement.\n  Let me also briefly mention the concerns raised by some about Judge \nChatigny's treatment of Michael Ross's attorney in regards to his law \nlicense. I think this criticism does not stand up to close scrutiny.\n  It is, of course, true that Judge Chatigny had a heated discussion \nwith the Ross's lawyer regarding his client's competence. Judge \nChatigny believed strongly that a state court in Connecticut should be \ngiven the opportunity to consider new evidence of Ross's competence and \ntried to convince the attorney of this.\n  There is no doubt that the exchange between Judge Chatigny and the \ndefense lawyer was intense. However, as the Judicial Council of the \nSecond Circuit found, there was no misconduct in this episode. In fact, \nthe special committee's report stated:\n\n       The judge was clearly concerned that [the defense lawyer's] \n     reluctance to engage the\n\n[[Page S10923]]\n\n     court in the question of Ross's competence  . . . might cause \n     an unconstitutional execution. It is clear the judge's \n     concern was to repair what he perceived as a breakdown in the \n     adversarial process, resulting from an attorney's insistence \n     on adhering to his client's expressed desire to waive \n     judicial review and consent to his execution, in spite of \n     indications that the client might be without competence to \n     make such a waiver. The judge's perception of the need for \n     remedial action in his communications with the attorney was \n     reasonable. While his words were strong, when properly \n     understood they were not unreasonable.\n\n  Further, who among us in public life during debates on contentious \nissues has never said anything that we would perhaps not repeat? The \nnext business day after this episode, Judge Chatigny sought out the \ndefense lawyer and apologized for his actions. He recognized that his \nwords were ``excessive'' and at the first chance available sought to \napologize for them. I think this shows exactly the sort of humble and \nself-examining personality that we need more of on the court.\n  But perhaps most importantly, Mr. President, one verbal exchange \nbetween a judge and counsel, in the middle of a highly contentious and \nemotional court case does not shed light on the entire arc of a judge's \ncareer. As demonstrated from the record and the support he has received \nin Connecticut, this episode is an aberration and one not likely to be \nrepeated. We should not unduly punish someone with an outstanding \nrecord such as Judge Chatigny because of one heated exchange. What type \nof judicial standard would we be asking of those who aspire to the \nbench?\n  The critics have also said that the complete exoneration of Judge \nChatigny on the misconduct complaint has little, if any, bearing on \nwhether he should be confirmed for the court of appeals. Yet they \npersist in claiming that the Judge did something improper when the \nclaim of improper conduct was totally rejected.\n  On this last point, I believe it is also worth reiterating that one \nof the judges who served on that panel, Michael Mukasey, also served as \nU.S. attorney general during the waning years of the Bush \nadministration.\n  But Michael Mukasey has done more than simply reject a misconduct \ncomplaint. Once the nomination of Judge Chatigny was made, Michael \nMukasey let it be known that he supported the confirmation of Judge \nChatigny for a seat on the court of appeals. Can anyone seriously \nbelieve that a former U.S. attorney general would support a nominee to \nthe Federal bench who was not unquestionably deserving of confirmation?\n  And Michael Mukasey's support of Judge Chatigny's nomination does not \nstand alone. As I mentioned earlier, three former U.S. attorneys \nappointed by Republican Presidents, the prosecutors most familiar with \nJudge Chatigny's record, have publicly informed the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee that they strongly support his confirmation for the court of \nappeals, as have 17 former assistant U.S. attorneys.\n  One other criticism of Judge Chatigny also must be addressed. \nIndividuals have attacked Judge Chatigny because in some instances, he \nimposed a sentence below the sentencing guidelines in certain cases.\n  What his detractors ignore is that Judge Chatigny has also imposed \nsentences at or above the top of the guidelines' range and that, \naccording to Sentencing Commission statistics, Judge Chatigny's \nsentences are well within the mainstream of sentences of all the judges \nin his district.\n  Indeed, the best commentary on Judge Chatigny's sentences in criminal \ncases is the fact that in the 16 years he has been a district judge, \nFederal prosecutors have not sought to appeal even one of these \ndecisions. Let me repeat that: in 16 years as a Federal judge, \nprosecutors have never appealed one of Judge Chatigny's sentences.\n  I have served in this body for nearly 30 years. I am extremely proud \nof this institution and believe that it plays a critical role in our \nrepublic. One of the most important functions we have is to vote on \nnominees to the executive and judicial branches of our government.\n  It saddens me to note that this body has let partisan politics and \ndelaying tactics interfere with our constitutional responsibility to \nprovide advice and consent on the President's nominees. Unfortunately, \nJudge Chatigny is not the only eminently qualified judicial nominee to \nface this challenge.\n  As of November 29, the Senate had only confirmed 41 of President \nObama's Federal circuit and district court nominees so far this \nCongress. By contrast, during the first Congress of the George W. Bush \nadministration, the Senate, which at that time was controlled by \nDemocrats, confirmed 100 of that President Bush's nominees to the \nFederal bench.\n  In addition, there have been repeated roadblocks to the consideration \nof numerous well-qualified nominees to critically important posts \nwithin the executive branch. The Federal Government has an immense \namount of work to do, and obstructionist tactics have only made that \nharder.\n  I am convinced that this Judge deserves to be confirmed. He has \noutstanding qualifications and an outstanding record. No one, even his \ncritics, doubts either his qualifications or his record. I believe he \nis being opposed because he acted with great courage to live up to his \noath of office and uphold constitutional standards in one widely \npublicized case involving a despicable murderer.\n  Would that all judges display that kind of courage when put to a \nsimilar test.\n  Let me conclude with one further point. I recognize that some of my \ncolleagues believe that Judge Chatigny's handling of the Ross case \nmerits criticism. I believe, on the contrary, that his handling of the \ncase was a courageous defense of constitutional requirements, as do \nmany others, including experienced Federal prosecutors from both \npolitical parties.\n  But let us assume, for a moment, that the criticism is valid. What I \nwould then ask this body to consider is this: is the criticism of the \nhandling of one case out of the thousands over which Judge Chatigny has \npresided in 16 years as an outstanding U.S. district judge a sufficient \nreason to oppose his confirmation for the court of appeals?\n  Have we, as Senators, permitted the President's selection of a well \nqualified judge with 16 years of outstanding judicial service to be \nthwarted because in the hours before a scheduled execution, the first \nin Connecticut in 40 years, this judge thought it was his duty to make \nsure that constitutional standards, as he understood them, required him \nto act, not to overturn a conviction, not to overturn a death sentence, \nbut simply to make sure that new evidence bearing on the defendant's \nmental competence was fairly considered?\n  It goes without saying that I am very disappointed the Senate will \nnot be voting on this nomination before the end of the 111th Congress. \nJudge Chatigny is superbly qualified for a seat on the Second Circuit, \nand I believe the Senate has made a serious mistake by not confirming \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "21", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/21/senate-section/article/S10923-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10923-S10924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FLOODING IN COLOMBIA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I want to take a minute to call attention \nto a humanitarian disaster that has received only passing mention in \nthe international press and which many Senators may be unaware of.\n  On December 7, Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos declared a \nstate of ``economic, social and ecologic emergency'' as a result of \nmassive flooding which he called a ``public calamity.''\n  Heavy rains over a period of months have caused landslides that have \nswept away homes and rivers to overflow their banks, and now large \nareas of the country are inundated with water. According to a December \n17 report by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian \nAffairs which is assisting the Colombian government, so far 2.1 million \npeople have been affected by the flooding, 270 have died, 62 are \nmissing, and more than 300,000 houses have been damaged or destroyed. \nThousands of miles of roads have been obstructed, damaged or destroyed.\n  Twenty-eight of the country's 32 departments, which comprise 61 \npercent of the country, have been affected. President Santos said the \nnumber of homeless from the flooding could reach 2 million, and that \n``the tragedy the country is going through has no precedents in our \nhistory.'' What's worse, the rains are expected to continue through \nnext June.\n\n[[Page S10924]]\n\n  I do not have to remind anyone here of our close relationship with \nColombia. I also know Colombia has emergency response capabilities \nwhich may not exist in remote areas of other countries similarly \naffected by severe flooding or other natural disasters, such as \nPakistan. I was pleased to learn that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \nhas people in Colombia because the devastation is on a scale more \nmassive than any developing country could deal with alone. There may \nalso be other ways we can provide assistance.\n  I also use this opportunity to note what appears to be the growing \nnumber and intensity of natural disasters around the world that are \nstraining the international community's emergency response \ncapabilities. While no single weather event can be definitively \nattributed to climate change, scientists have long predicted an \nincrease in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events as a \nresult of global warming. They also predict that as many as 200 million \npeople could be displaced by natural disasters and climate change by \n2050. That would cause incalculable havoc for many countries.\n  President Santos, who to his credit has been out in the countryside \nwith people who have lost family members, homes and, in many cases, \neverything they own, said he canceled his trip to the U.N. Climate \nChange Conference in Cancun so he could deal with the devastation that \nclimate change is causing in his own country. Pakistani government \nofficials likewise blamed climate change for the massive floods there \nthat have affected more than 20 million people over the past several \nmonths.\n  Whatever the cause, and there isn't time today to discuss my views \nabout the role that deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels play \nin global warming, the world's climate is unquestionably changing. And \na disproportionate number of recent climate related disasters has \noccurred in the world's poorest countries where most people's lives \ndepend on agriculture. They have seen their homes destroyed, crops \ndrowned in water and buried in mud, and what few possessions they have \nswept away. Other countries have suffered years of drought, and water \nsources that have sustained life for centuries have dried up. In as \nlittle as 25 years, glaciers that millions of people and their \nlivestock depend on for drinking water have shrunk to a fraction of \ntheir size.\n  These issues are going to occupy our time and severely tax our \nresources for the foreseeable future, and we and other countries \nurgently need to develop plans to try to prevent and adapt to climate \nchange and to respond when disaster strikes.\n  I am encouraged that there is a new field of research specifically \nfocused on better understanding, preventing and responding to large \nscale displacement of people as a result of climate change and natural \ndisasters. Nongovernmental and international organizations are working \nto develop strategies to protect the world's most vulnerable people \nfrom this growing threat. We need to support this and work together.\n  I commend President Santos who has not only helped to alert the world \nto a catastrophe that had previously gone largely unnoticed outside his \ncountry, but who has taken other important steps in his first months of \noffice that have won the respect and support of the Colombian people. \nHis efforts to diffuse tensions with Colombia's neighbors, to begin \ntackling head on the daunting economic, social and judicial challenges \nfacing Colombia, and to appoint several top officials who have the \nnecessary qualifications and integrity, are admirable.\n  After a decade of Plan Colombia, U.S.-Colombia relations are entering \na new phase. While there will likely continue to be issues about which \nwe disagree, I look forward to working with President Santos and his \ngovernment on a wide range of issues of mutual interest and concern.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "21", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/21/senate-section/article/S10924-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO LULU DAVIS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, as we approach the end of this Congress \nwe are saying goodbye to people with whom we have been privileged to \nserve over the past years. We often talk about Senators who have \ncompleted their terms. In that regard, a number of my friends will be \nleaving the Senate and I am making statements about them.\n  Today, I want to talk about a woman who has served the Senate and the \nAmerican people for three decades, and whose career sets a high \nstandard of professionalism and public service that inspires countless \nothers. She was not elected to serve as a Senator, but she has been \nessential to the work of the Senate for a number of years.\n  Lula Johnson Davis began her Senate career as a legislative \ncorrespondent for Senator Russell Long of Louisiana. She later worked \nfor the Democratic Policy Committee. In 1993, she became a key member \nof our Democratic floor staff The floor staff is critical to the proper \nfunctioning of the Senate.\n  They advise Senators on floor procedure and help keep the Senate \noperating within the formal Senate Rules and the informal Senate \npractices that honor our traditions of courtesy and civility. When \nSenators are not bollixing up the proceedings, the floor staff \nfacilitates the business of the Senate.\n  They are the unseen and unrecognized teachers for new Senators. They \nhelp guide all of us through Senate consideration and voting on every \nmeasure that comes before this body.\n  She leaves the Senate having started as a legislative correspondent \nand having risen to become the Secretary of the Majority of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Through the decade of the 1990s and this first decade of the new \ncentury, as the assistant secretary and now secretary, it has been this \nwoman from Louisiana who has helped guide the Senate. We each, Senators \non both sides of the aisle, owe her our gratitude. She is a \nprofessional who helps set the right tone for all of us--Senators, \nstaff, and pages.\n  The young people, high school students from around the country, who \ncontinue their studies while serving as Senate pages for a semester or \na summer are another group of beneficiaries of Lula' s tutelage. She is \na tough but fair taskmaster. Democratic pages learn that every job, no \nmatter how small, needs to be done right.\n  They learn lessons that will serve them throughout their lives. She \nhas been a mentor, friend and role model to hundreds of youngsters from \naround the country over the years. At the end of their tour of duty, \nthey appreciate what she has given them and, I hope, share her respect \nfor the Senate.\n  She has never failed to fulfill her duties as she has steadfastly \nserved with a succession of Democratic leaders. In truth, she has \nserved not just the Democratic Senate caucus but the Senate and the \ncountry.\n  I will miss Lula Davis and wanted to say how much I appreciate all \nshe has done for each of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "21", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/21/senate-section/article/S10924-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10924-S10925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  AMERICA COMPETES REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, last Friday the Senate in an act of \nbipartisanship reauthorized the America COMPETES Act, which was first \nsigned into law August 9, 2007. It did so this time under unanimous \nconsent; the last time it took 3 days of debate. I would like to note \nthat this reauthorization continues the strong tradition of \nbipartisanship which augurs well for the ability of our Nation to \nconduct cutting edge research while innovating and competing in our \nglobal economy. In a time of concern about our budget deficit, the \npassing of this act by unanimous consent is an acknowledgment by the \nSenate as a whole that tax dollars spent on these topics is money well \nspent.\n  But behind that simple act of unanimous consent laid almost 2 years \nof hard work at the staff and Member level in the Senate.\n  First and foremost, I would like to acknowledge the leadership of \nSenator Lamar Alexander. Senator Alexander worked with members of his \nRepublican caucus to ensure their views were incorporated into this \nbill. He has kept his unwavering belief that the strength of our \nNation, its ability to proposer and create good paying jobs, rests on \nthe investment we make in educating our children in science and \neducation, conducting research at universities and laboratories and \nusing a well educated workforce to promote innovation in our global \neconomy.\n  The America COMPETES Act involved the work of three Senate \ncommittees: the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee; \nthe\n\n[[Page S10925]]\n\nSenate Committee on Health Education, Labor and Pensions, HELP; and the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. As before, Matt \nSonnesyn, who participated in the last America COMPETES effort provided \na stable and steady push to keep the bill on track. In the Commerce \nCommittee, Ann Zulkosky on Senator Rockefeller's staff worked long \nhours through a markup and subsequent staff drafts of the bill while at \nthe same time managing to reauthorize NASA. Maryam Khan and Hugh Derr \non Senator Hutchinson's staff worked with Ann throughout this time; \nRobin Juliano on Senator Harkin's staff on the HELP committee worked \nwith Christopher Eyler on Senator Enzi's HELP staff to ensure education \nprograms were updated where appropriate; Jonathan Epstein on my Energy \nCommittee staff worked tirelessly, as he did on the original bill, and \nalong with Isaac Edwards on Senator Murkowski's Energy Committee staff \nworked through energy programs and updated them to account for changes \nsince the last COMPETES Act.\n  There are other important staff I would like to acknowledge who made \nthis effort in the Senate a success: David Cleary on the HELP \nCommittee, Adam Rondinone and Neena Imam in Senator Alexander's \npersonal office, Ann Begeman, Senator Hutchinson's Commerce Committee \nStaff Director, Ellen Doneski, staff director for the majority and \nChris Martin, Andrew Ruffin, Bruce Andrews, and Brian Hendricks of the \nCommerce Committee; Trudy Vincent, my legislative director and Peter \nZamora, my education counsel; Robyn Hiestand on the Budget Committee, \nRachel Sotsky in Senator Lieberman's personal office, Lula Davis, the \nsecretary for the majority, Tim Mitchell on Senator Reid's floor staff, \nLaura Dove the assistant secretary for the minority and Bob Simon, my \nEnergy Committee staff director. Finally, I need to give a special \nthanks to the legislative counsels who worked with staff to accurately \ndraft the bill--Lloyd Ator on the Commerce Committee, Amy Gaynor who \ndrafted the HELP Committee text and Gary Endicott who drafted the \nEnergy Committee text.\n  As you can see, the America COMPETES Act involved a large number of \nbipartisan staff, all working together for the common goal of promoting \nthe ability of our nation to compete in a global economy. I am grateful \nto all of the them for their hard work.\n  I am also delighted that today, December 21, the House of \nRepresentatives passed this bill as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "21", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/21/senate-section/article/S10925-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEONHART NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise to announce that I have lifted the \nhold I placed earlier this month on Michele Leonhart's nomination to be \nAdministrator of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, DEA. I had placed \nthe hold reluctantly after numerous failed attempts to work with the \nagency for over a year on the issue of delivering pain medication to \nnursing home residents in a timely matter.\n  At a Special Committee on Aging hearing I chaired earlier this year, \npanelists detailed a recent DEA enforcement initiative that has delayed \nmany nursing home patients from receiving much-needed medication to \ncontrol their pain. For several years, nurses had been able to call \ninto pharmacies urgently needed prescriptions following a doctor's \norder. Pharmacies would fill the order, patients would get their pain \nmedication, and doctors would follow up with written confirmation of \nthe prescription. Due to the DEA's new enforcement initiative, \npharmacies face huge administrative fines if they continue to follow \nthis practice. Most disturbingly, nursing home residents sometimes must \nendure the pain for hours or even days as nursing home staff try to \nadhere to the newly enforced regulations. Finally, nursing homes have \nbeen forced to send frail and pain-ridden residents to the emergency \nroom, at great cost, simply to get pain medication that they used to be \nable to get in their nursing home.\n  At Ms. Leonhart's nominating hearing before the Judiciary Committee \nin November, I expressed my disappointment that the DEA had not \nfollowed through on the pledges made to the Aging panel in March to \nwork with us to address the problem swiftly. Nearly 2 weeks after her \nconfirmation hearing--and three months after submitting a draft \nproposal to DEA--I was told that any solution would require each State \nto grant nursing homes the authority to dispense controlled substances \npain medications. However, any solution requiring ``state-by-state'' \naction would take many years to achieve. The urgent pain relief \nsituation in nursing homes will not permit such a long-term approach. \nWhen the Judiciary Committee approved Ms. Leonhart's nomination, I \nasked to see meaningful progress on the issue prior to her final \nconfirmation.\n  I am pleased to have recently received Attorney General Eric Holder's \nassurance that he will promptly deliver the DOJ's support for a \nlegislative fix. As a result of our discussion, I am releasing the hold \non Michele Leonhart's nomination, and I look forward to introducing a \nmutually acceptable legislative fix in the opening days of the 112th \nCongress.\n  Based on our agreement, DOJ will deliver draft legislation to me in \nJanuary to permit the timely delivery of pain medications to nursing \nhome residents. The legislation will deem certain nurses or other \nlicensed health care professionals to be ``authorized agents.'' Those \nagents will be chosen and designated by the nursing home as agents of \nDEA-licensed practitioners--practitioners being the resident's \nattending physician or specialist. They will be authorized to transmit \nthe practitioner's order for a controlled substance, specifically \nschedule II drugs, to DEA-licensed pharmacies orally or by fax. The \nnursing home, while not licensed by DEA, will designate those \nauthorized to transmit a practitioner's order and to make a list of \nthose authorized agents available to the pharmacy. In exchange, nursing \nhomes, practitioners, and pharmacies will be required to take certain \nsteps to verify their accountability.\n  I happily submit for the record a document detailing the specifics of \nour agreed-upon framework for the legislation outlined above. I am \nconfident that it will ensure our mutual interests are met by enabling \nnursing home residents to have the pain medication they need while \npreventing drug diversion and misuse. I would like to thank Attorney \nGeneral Holder for his strong commitment to seeing that a Federal \nlegislative solution can be moved forward in the opening weeks of the \n112th Congress. After all, time is of the essence for nursing home \nresidents who are in need of immediate pain relief.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "21", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/21/senate-section/article/S10925-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10925-S10926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONFIRMATION OF ALBERT DIAZ\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I am pleased the Senate has confirmed \nthe nomination of Albert Diaz of North Carolina to be a U.S. circuit \njudge for the Fourth Circuit.\n  Judge Diaz is strongly supported by his home State Senators, Senators \nHagan and Burr, and he received the highest possible rating of ``well \nqualified'' from the American Bar Association's rating committee. The \nprocess Senators Hagan and Burr used to recommend these nominations to \nthe President--working in a bipartisan fashion with each other and the \nWhite House--is a model for how we can improve the judicial selection \nand confirmation process going forward.\n  I chaired the confirmation hearing for Judge Diaz in December 2009, \nand in January 2010 the Judiciary Committee unanimously approved his \nnomination by a 19-0 vote.\n  I am disappointed that it has taken the Senate almost a full year to \ntake final action on this nomination.\n  I take a special interest in the Fourth Circuit, as it includes my \nhome State of Maryland. When President Bush was in office, in May 2008 \nI chaired the confirmation hearing for Justice Steven Agee, who served \non the Virginia Supreme Court and was confirmed to be a U.S. circuit \njudge for the Fourth Circuit. Since President Obama has taken office, \nin April 2009 I chaired the confirmation hearing for Judge Andre Davis \nof Maryland, a Federal district judge in Baltimore, who was confirmed \nlast year to be a judge on the Fourth Circuit. In October 2009, I \nchaired the confirmation hearing of Justice Barbara Keenan of Virginia, \nwho had served on the Virginia Supreme Court and was confirmed in March \nof this year by the Senate. Finally, in December 2009, I chaired the\n\n[[Page S10926]]\n\nconfirmation hearing of James Wynn of North Carolina, who had served as \nan associate judge of the North Carolina Court of Appeals, and was \nconfirmed by the Senate in August 2010.\n  I mention these nominations by way of background for my colleagues, \nbecause the Fourth Circuit has had one of the highest vacancy rates in \nthe country. When I came to the Senate in 2007, out of the 15 seats \nauthorized by Congress, 5 of the seats of the Fourth Circuit were \nvacant. That means that one-third of the court's seats were vacant. Our \ncircuit courts of appeals are the final word for most of our civil and \ncriminal litigants, as the Supreme Court only accepts a handful of \ncases.\n  We should also be working to increase the diversity of the judges of \nthe Fourth Circuit. The Fourth Circuit is one of the most diverse \ncircuits in the Nation, according to the most recent Census estimates. \nIn terms of the Fourth Circuit--which consists of Maryland, Virginia, \nWest Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina--22 percent of the \nresidents are African American. In my home State of Maryland, African \nAmericans constitute 30 percent of the population. By way of \ncomparison, the U.S. population is 12 percent African American.\n  Ironically, the judges on the Fourth Circuit have not historically \nbeen known for their diversity. The first woman to sit on the Fourth \nCircuit was not appointed until 1992. The first African American to sit \non the Fourth Circuit was not appointed until 2001.\n  In recent years I am pleased that the Fourth Circuit has indeed \nbecome more diverse and representative of the population it oversees. \nThe Senate took another important step forward to increase diversity on \nthe Fourth Circuit with the confirmation of Judge James Wynn before our \nAugust recess. I am pleased that 4 out of the 15 judges on the Fourth \nCircuit--about one-quarter of the court--are now African American. And \nI am also pleased that in 2007, for the first time in history, a woman \nserved as chief judge of the Fourth Circuit. Until a vacancy occurred \nlast year, women made up 3 out of the 15 judges on the Fourth Circuit, \nor one-fifth of the court. I look forward to further increasing the \ndiversity of the Fourth Circuit in the future.\n  With the nomination of Judge Diaz, the Senate has another opportunity \nto increase diversity on the Fourth Circuit. Judge Diaz is the first \nLatino judge to ever sit on the Fourth Circuit in its history.\n  Judge Albert Diaz also comes to the Senate with a broad range of both \njudicial and legal experience in both the civilian and military court \nsystems.\n  Judge Diaz currently serves as a special superior court judge for \ncomplex business cases, one of only three in North Carolina.\n  Judge Diaz began his legal career in the U.S. Marine Corps legal \nservices support section, where he served as a prosecutor, defense \ncounsel, and ultimately chief review officer. He then moved to the \nNavy's Office of the Judge Advocate General, JAG, where he served for 4 \nyears as appellate government counsel handling criminal appeals. Upon \nentering private practice, Judge Diaz remained in the Marine Corps \nReserves, serving over the years as a defense lawyer, trial judge, and \nappellate judge.\n  Judge Diaz was the first Latino appointed to the North Carolina \nSuperior Court when he was named as a resident superior court judge in \n2001.\n  I therefore pleased that the Senate has confirmed Judge Diaz, an \noutstanding nominee who enjoys bipartisan support from his home State \nSenators and a unanimous endorsement from the Judiciary Committee. By \nconfirming Judge Diaz, the Senate takes an important step in bringing \nthe vacancy rate down on the Fourth Circuit, and for the first time in \nmany years the confirmed judges on the Fourth Circuit will be almost up \nto full strength. Finally, we will have a more diverse bench that \nbetter represents the population of this circuit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "21", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/21/senate-section/article/S10926-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10926-S10927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               DIPLOMACY\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, today I wish to talk about public \ndiplomacy. I have spent a lot of time in Africa and have built close \nrelationships with many African leaders. As you know, our country's \nofficial diplomacy is conducted by the State Department. However, \npublic diplomacy involving people-to-people interaction is equally \nimportant for promoting a positive image of America to the world. The \nUnited States is admired as a beacon of freedom for oppressed people \neverywhere. The attacks on the U.S. of 9/11 demonstrate the new \nchallenge we face by the forces of ignorance and intolerance that seek \nthe destruction of our country.\n  Today I include in the record an insightful essay that I will share \nwith the members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about the \ncritical role of public diplomacy in building bridges of good will for \nthe United States. The author is Richard Soudriette, the president of \nthe Center for Diplomacy and Democracy in Colorado Springs, CO. Mr. \nSoudriette is the founding president of the International Foundation \nfor Electoral Systems, IFES, which has promoted free and fair elections \nin over 120 countries.\n  I have a long and personal history with Richard as he was my chief of \nstaff in my office as mayor of Tulsa. Since then, he went on to be the \nfounding president of the International Foundation for Electoral \nSystem, IFES, which has promoted free and fair elections in over 120 \ncountries. Richard and I share the same heart for Africa and the same \nvision for developing countries around the world; that they continue to \nmove towards self-sufficiency and become thriving economic nations.\n  His essay discusses public diplomacy at the local level and mentions \nmy home town of Tulsa, OK, as an example of a community that has \ndeveloped innovative international visitor programs. Public diplomacy \nis vital to keeping our country safe. The best way to defeat the forces \nof extremism is to educate people around the globe about America and \nour values, culture, and people.\n  I strongly support Richard's work around the world and I ask \nunanimous consent that the statement by Richard Soudriette be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Public Diplomacy: Building Bridges of Understanding\n\n[By Richard W. Soudriette, Center for Diplomacy and Democracy, December \n                                8, 2010]\n\n       Ever since the proclamation of the Declaration of \n     Independence in Philadelphia over 200 years ago, America has \n     championed the power of the human spirit. Across the globe, \n     America is a beacon of freedom that gives hope to people \n     living under oppression.\n       Our country faces many challenges never envisioned by the \n     Founding Fathers in 1776. The deadly attacks on America that \n     occurred on September 11, 2001 revealed that extremist \n     elements seek to destroy America and all that it symbolizes. \n     Al-Qaeda and their cohorts are dedicated to the eradication \n     of human rights and democracy. Islamic extremists do a great \n     injustice to Muslims who reject the extremist philosophy of \n     hatred, ignorance, and intolerance.\n       Defeating the forces of extremism will require more than \n     military power. It also will require tenacious public \n     diplomacy to educate people from Muslim countries, as well as \n     elsewhere, about America.\n       Public diplomacy is a term that was coined by respected \n     career U.S. diplomat, Edmund Gullion, who also served as dean \n     of the Fletcher School at Tufts University. Ambassador \n     Gullion described public diplomacy as the way sovereign \n     nations openly and transparently communicate their ideas, \n     culture, and values to people of other countries.\n       Public diplomacy has become an essential component of U.S. \n     foreign policy. The Obama Administration has sought increases \n     in public diplomacy funding. The current Under Secretary of \n     State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, Judith McHale, \n     recently unveiled ``The Strategic Plan for Public Diplomacy \n     for America in the 21st Century.''\n       Despite bipartisan support for public diplomacy, the image \n     of the U.S. continues to lose ground in many parts of the \n     globe. Our image problem in many countries is documented by \n     the work of the Pew Charitable Trusts Global Image Project. \n     Some respected organizations such as the Council on Foreign \n     Relations have focused on the failings of our public \n     diplomacy apparatus. The morphing of the United States \n     Information Agency into the State Department during the \n     Clinton Administration is identified as a major cause for \n     deficiencies in our public diplomacy efforts. The Council on \n     Foreign Relations has offered recommendations to the State \n     Department to fix our public diplomacy, but these will \n     require time and funding to implement.\n       The State Department already has the means to improve our \n     public diplomacy outreach to the world. For example, the \n     State Department should make certain that ambassadors and \n     foreign service officers are fully briefed on the State \n     Department's public diplomacy strategic plan before they are\n\n[[Page S10927]]\n\n     posted abroad. Also, it should be made clear that a major \n     part of their duties will be to assist the Secretary of State \n     in implementing the plan.\n       Foreign service officers provide an immediate opportunity \n     for the U.S. to engage in effective public diplomacy. In \n     2008, the United States Advisory Commission on Public \n     Diplomacy issued a report entitled ``Getting the People Part \n     Right: A Report on the Human Resources Dimension of Public \n     Diplomacy.'' This report highlights the public diplomacy void \n     that has existed since 1999 when the United States \n     Information Agency was eliminated and its functions were \n     merged into the State Department. The report states that most \n     foreign service officers fail to grasp the importance of \n     public diplomacy, and at best, they merely pay lip service to \n     it. The report also discusses the lack of recruitment of U.S. \n     diplomats with the appropriate people skills for public \n     diplomacy. The report cites the need for more training for \n     our diplomats so that they might have the knowledge and the \n     skills to effectively interact with people from other \n     countries.\n       Newly hired foreign service officers frequently work at \n     U.S. Consulates processing visa applications for persons \n     wishing to travel to the U.S. This is a high stress job and \n     it demands that they possess strong interpersonal skills. \n     While serving as the director of the Peace Corps program in \n     the Dominican Republic, I frequently heard anecdotes from \n     Dominicans who had received rude treatment when seeking visas \n     at the U.S. Consulate. While the visa application process \n     requires extensive screening, all visa applicants should \n     receive prompt and courteous service. U.S. diplomats who \n     engage in arrogant behavior towards visa applicants create \n     ill will and plant seeds of hatred towards America.\n       Another aspect of public diplomacy that needs attention is \n     the manner in which officers of the Bureau of Customs and \n     Border Protection receive and process arriving international \n     visitors. Since the events of 2001, the work of Customs and \n     Border Protection officers has become more stressful and \n     challenging. While most officers perform well, there are some \n     who do not receive international visitors with courtesy. \n     Customs and Border Protection officers play a huge public \n     diplomacy role. When officers are surly, they offend \n     international visitors to the United States.\n       The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection should \n     incorporate customer service training into its curriculum for \n     all personnel. When developing this training, it would be \n     wise to tap the experience of companies like the Disney \n     Corporation which has a track record of receiving throngs of \n     people with respect and courtesy. Courteous treatment upon \n     arrival in our Nation can pay dividends by promoting a \n     positive image of the United States.\n       The State Department and the U.S. Agency for International \n     Development (USAID) can achieve immediate impact in public \n     diplomacy by requiring all contractors and grantees to \n     incorporate public diplomacy aspects into their work. USAID \n     utilizes many for-profit and not-for-profit organizations to \n     provide services in areas such as democracy, economic \n     development, governance, health, public works, and rule of \n     law. All organizations that undertake work abroad on behalf \n     of USAID have an important public diplomacy responsibility.\n       USAID should require grantees and contractors, whenever \n     feasible, to hire project managers who speak the language of \n     the country where they are working. Personnel working abroad \n     on USAID funded projects should undergo orientation training \n     about local culture and customs.\n       International visitor programs play a key role in \n     successful public diplomacy. For nearly sixty years, the \n     State Department has funded visits by thousands of \n     international visitors to acquaint them with our country. \n     Often, these visitors eventually become leaders in their \n     countries. The President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, traveled \n     to the U.S. in 1985 on a State Department sponsored trip. \n     Today he is regarded as one of the most pro-U.S. leaders in \n     France.\n       The State Department's Bureau of Educational and Cultural \n     Affairs funds most of the government sponsored international \n     visitor and scholarship programs. The bureau has rules in \n     place stipulating that prime contractors and grantees for \n     State Department funds must be in existence for a minimum of \n     four years. These rules stifle innovative programming by new \n     organizations and inhibit the ability of community based \n     groups beyond the Capital Beltway to access funding.\n       For most international visitor programs, the State \n     Department contracts with the same large East Coast \n     organizations. These organizations rely on a patchwork of \n     community based groups across the U.S. to organize meaningful \n     professional, educational, and cultural programs for \n     international visitors. Unfortunately, these East Coast \n     organizations pass on very little, if any, funding to \n     communities that have agreed to receive international \n     visitors. Hosting of international visitors relies on local \n     volunteers and in-kind support. The lack of financial \n     resources at the local level results in a huge disparity in \n     the quality of programming that international visitors \n     receive.\n       Some communities like Tulsa, Oklahoma do a superb job in \n     organizing and managing international visitor programs. Since \n     1995, the Tulsa Global Alliance has provided excellent \n     programs in this area. Tulsa has developed an organizational \n     model that relies on a mix of professional and volunteer \n     support. The Tulsa program has been successful in developing \n     a broad funding base that provides more than $400,000 per \n     year for international visitor activities. Funding comes from \n     corporations, individual donors, foundations, program fees, \n     and limited grants from the State Department.\n       It is recommended that the State Department modify its \n     rules for funding international visitor programs. Contracts \n     for large organizations should require that they provide \n     grants of at least 25 percent of their total project budgets \n     to be passed on to international visitor committees at the \n     local level. This funding will help provide needed resources \n     to ensure that high quality programs are offered to \n     international visitors. The public diplomacy implications of \n     these international visitor programs are too important not to \n     have sufficient funding.\n       The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the State \n     Department should give priority to funding small and newly \n     established organizations engaged in international visitor \n     programs. The Bureau should be encouraged to make available \n     up to 25 percent of its budget for international visitor \n     programs to small and newly established organizations. This \n     new approach would open the door for communities across \n     America to develop their own capacity to implement high \n     quality international visitor programs. The end goal would be \n     that each international visitor would have a fulfilling \n     experience in the U.S.\n       The security of America and the future of our democracy \n     demand more commitment to public diplomacy. To keep America \n     safe and to protect our values, ideals, and principles, we \n     must build bridges of understanding with people across the \n     globe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "21", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/21/senate-section/article/S10927-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10927-S10928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            MISSOURI 2009 MALCOLM BALDRIGE AWARD RECIPIENTS\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I think that every Senator is \nunderstandably proud of their own State, but today I have special \nreason to be proud of Missouri. Just last week, Vice President Biden \nawarded the 2009 Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Awards to five \ndifferent companies and three of those five companies hailed from the \ngreat State of Missouri. The Baldrige Award recognizes only the highest \nperforming companies in the U.S. in terms of quality and performance, \nand the fact that three out of the five awards went to Missouri \ncompanies is a testament to the spirit and work ethics of Missourians.\n  Heartland Health is a health system based in St. Joseph, MO, that has \nan extraordinary commitment to improving their patients' health rather \nthan just treating patients' sicknesses, as is all too often seen in \nthe healthcare community. The staff at Heartland Health recognizes that \nwhile providing world-class treatment for acute illnesses is vital, it \nis equally important to understand why individuals become ill, and they \ndo everything possible to prevent those patients from ever needing \nhospital care in the first place. Their mission is: ``To improve the \nhealth of individuals and communities located in the Heartland Health \nregion and provide the right care, at the right time, in the right \nplace, at the right cost with outcomes second to none.'' This is not \njust a catchy slogan, but instead it is a commitment that has yielded \nresults. Heartland Health is among the top 15 percent of all U.S. \nhospitals in patient safety; they have achieved 90 percent patient \nsatisfaction, and they have done all this while at the same time saving \nmillions of dollars by realizing efficiencies. As our entire country \nstruggles with providing quality healthcare at affordable prices, I \ninvite anyone to visit the ``Show Me'' State, where Heartland Health \nstands as an example for how a commitment to quality can yield the best \ncare available affordably. They have been appropriately recognized with \nthe Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, joining a select group of \ncompanies that are the best of the best, and I applaud Heartland Health \nand all of the great men and women who make up its team for their \nachievement and their work.\n  Honeywell Federal Manufacturing & Technologies in Kansas City, MO, \nplays an integral role in the underappreciated work of keeping our \nNation's nuclear arsenal in working order. The Kansas City Plant works \nto provide the National Nuclear Security Administration with \nelectrical, mechanical and material components manufactured to exacting \nquality specifications to help meet key national security objectives. \nHoneywell Federal Manufacturing & Technologies uses a Six Sigma Plus\n\n[[Page S10928]]\n\nContinuous Improvement Model and it has resulted in an unmatched level \nof customer satisfaction. Honeywell has also been a key partner in the \ntransition to the new state-of-the-art Kansas City Responsive \nInfrastructure, Manufacturing and Sourcing, KCRIMS, facility, which \nofficially broke ground in September. They have been a steward in \nensuring safety, quality and efficiency in all areas of their work, \nespecially with respect to the production of the nonnuclear components \nfor the Nation's nuclear weapons with NNSA. Honeywell's outstanding \nwork has also provided an essential foundation for a continued \npartnership at the new KCRIMS facility and the company's ongoing role \nas a strong member of the local Kansas City community. I am deeply \nproud of the work the men and women on the Honeywell team carry out at \nthe Kansas City Plant and of its central importance to our Nation's \nnational security and I could not be more pleased to see them \nrecognized for their work with this preeminent award.\n  MidwayUSA is a family-owned business located in Columbia, MO, that \nhas been providing shooting, hunting and reloading supplies for over 30 \nyears. The company, started by Larry Potterfield and his wife Brenda, \nexemplifies the ``Made in America'' motto by employing hundreds of \nMissourians who are themselves passionate about hunting and shooting, \ntwo activities that are centerpieces of Missouri's rich sportsman \nculture. The passion of Larry and Brenda shows in the quality of the \nwork of their entire team. MidwayUSA has earned 98 percent customer \nretention, and a 93 percent customer satisfaction rating, both \nremarkable achievements. While MidwayUSA has progressed over time from \ntaking orders by mail, then phone, and now via the internet, one thing \nthat has not changed is its mission, ``To be the best-run business in \nAmerica, for the benefit of our Customers.'' They are doing a great job \naccomplishing just this. In pursuit of that goal they have become ISO \n9000 certified, won the Missouri Quality Award for Performance \nExcellence, and now they have been recognized with the 2009 Malcolm \nBaldrige National Quality Award. In growing from nothing more than a \nsimple idea to one of the leading shooting supply retailers, MidwayUSA \nhas shown what dedication to quality and performance, coupled with \nbuilding an exceptionally committed, dedicated and skilled workforce, \ncan produce in a business. I would like to congratulate the entire \nMidwayUSA team on their success.\n  These three companies, which are not just among Missouri's finest, \nbut, as we now know, among our Nation's very best, have so much to be \nproud of. They embody the ``Show Me'' spirit when it comes to showing \nhow a business should operate. Congratulations Heartland Health, \nHoneywell Federal Manufacturing & Technologies in Kansas City and \nMidwayUSA on winning the 2009 Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award. \nI look forward to seeing what these companies and their employees \naccomplish next. I know it will be something great.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "21", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/21/senate-section/article/S10928-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. ANTHONY CERNERA\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, today I recognize the \ntremendous work of Dr. Anthony Cernera, a good friend and the very \naccomplished president of Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, CT. \nAfter 22 years of distinguished service to the Sacred Heart community, \nTony is moving on to pursue new and different opportunities in Catholic \neducation and beyond.\n  Since 1988, Dr. Cernera has led Sacred Heart with purpose and grace \nas he helped to fulfill the college's mission of preparing its students \nto be contributing members of the global community. He expanded this \nnoble mission by increasing the school's reach and the opportunities it \noffers, all while preserving the rich Catholic intellectual tradition \nthat forms its identity. He helped transform Sacred Heart from a small \ncommuter school serving Fairfield and the neighboring community into a \nvibrant residential university, introducing new and innovative degree \nprograms and course offerings to keep pace with an ever-changing world. \nThe progress he achieved helped advance a value-driven education that \nwill enrich the lives of all who receive it.\n  Dr. Cernera embodies the many deeply held values that Sacred Heart \nespouses. He does not see the world around him for what it is, but \ninstead for what it can be. Where he sees promise, he leads through \naction. With the creation in 1992 of the Center for Christian-Jewish \nUnderstanding of Sacred Heart University, Dr. Cernera has striven for a \nworld of greater interreligious dialogue, understanding and respect. As \nPresident of the International Federation of Catholic Universities, a \nfederation of over 200 Catholic educational institutions around the \nworld, Dr. Cernera has led at a global level, spreading the faith and \nvalues that define his life's work. In a world too rife with conflict \nand distrust, he has been a model member of the global community.\n  Dr. Cernera leaves behind a lasting legacy at Sacred Heart \nUniversity, with an impact that reaches far beyond the halls on campus \nand that will touch many lives for a long time to come. I wish him and \nhis wife Ruth my very best as they embark on the next great chapter of \ntheir lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "21", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/21/senate-section/article/S10928-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10928-S10929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  At 11:23 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 3874.

A bill to improve, modernize, and clarify the espionage \nstatutes contained in chapter 37 of title 18, United States Code, to \npromote Federal whistleblower protection statutes and regulations, to \ndeter unauthorized disclosures of classified information, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, the current framework concerning the \nespionage statutes was designed to address classic spy cases involving \npersons who intended to aid foreign governments and harm the United \nStates. The current framework traces its roots to the Espionage Act of \n1917, which made it a crime to disclose defense information during \nwartime. The basic idea behind the legislation, which was upheld by the \nU.S. Supreme Court as constitutional in 1919, was to stop citizens from \nspying or interfering with military actions during World War I. The \ncurrent framework was formed at a time when intelligence and national \nsecurity information existed primarily in some tangible form, such as \nblueprints, photographs, maps, and other documents.\n  Our Nation, however, has witnessed dramatic changes to nearly every \nfacet of our lives over the last 100 years, including technological \nadvances which have revolutionized our information gathering abilities \nas well as the mediums utilized to communicate such information. Yet, \nthe basic terms and structure of the espionage statutes have remained \nrelatively unchanged since their inception. Moreover, issues have \narisen in the prosecution and defense of criminal cases when the \nstatutes have been applied to persons who may be disclosing classified \ninformation for purposes other than to aid a foreign government or to \nharm the United States. In addition, the statutes contain some terms \nwhich are outdated and do not reflect how information is classified by \nthe Executive branch today.\n  Legal scholars and commentators have criticized the current \nframework, and over the years, some federal courts have as well. In \n2006, after reviewing the many developments in the law and changes in \nsociety that had taken place since the enactment of the espionage \nstatutes, one district court judge stated that ``the time is ripe for \nCongress'' to reexamine them. United States v. Rosen, 445 F. Supp. 2d \n602, 646 E.D. Va. 2006, Ellis, J. Nearly 20 years earlier in the \nMorison case, one federal appellate judge stated that ``[i]f one thing \nis clear, it is that the Espionage Act statutes as now broadly drawn \nare unwieldy and imprecise instruments for prosecuting government \n`leakers' to the press as opposed to government `moles' in the service \nof other countries.'' That judge also stated that ``carefully drawn \nlegislation'' was a ``better long-term resolution'' than judicial \nintervention. See United States v. Morison, 844 F.2d 1057, 1086, 4th \nCir. 1988.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Judiciary's Terrorism and Homeland Security \nSubcommittee, I chaired a Subcommittee hearing on May 12, 2010, \nentitled ``The Espionage Statutes: A Look Back and A Look Forward.'' At \nthat Subcommittee hearing, I questioned a number of witnesses, which \nincluded witnesses from academia as well as former officials from the \nintelligence and law enforcement communities, about how well the \nespionage statutes have been working. Since that hearing, I have been \nclosely and carefully reviewing these statutes, particularly in the \ncontext of recent events. I am now convinced that changes in technology \nand society, combined with statutory and judicial changes to the law, \nhave rendered some aspects of our espionage laws less effective than \nthey need to be to protect the national security. I also believe that \nwe need to enhance our ability to prosecute spies as well as those who \nmake unauthorized disclosures of classified information if we add to \nthe existing statutes. We don't need an Official State Secrets Act, and \nwe must be careful not to chill protected First Amendment activities. \nWe do, however, need to do a better job of preventing unauthorized \ndisclosures of classified information that can harm the United States, \nand at the same time we need to ensure that public debates continue to \ntake place on important national security and foreign policy issues.\n  As a result, I am introducing the Espionage Statutes Modernization \nAct, ESMA, of 2010. This legislation makes important improvements to \nthe espionage statutes to make them more effective and relevant in the \n21st century. This legislation is narrowly-tailored and balanced, and \nwill enable the government to use a separate criminal statute to \nprosecute government employees who make unauthorized disclosures of \nclassified information in violation of the nondisclosure agreements\n\n[[Page S10931]]\n\nthey have entered, irrespective of whether they intend to aid a foreign \ngovernment or harm the United States.\n  This legislation is not designed to make it easier for the government \nto prosecute the press, to chill First Amendment freedoms, or to make \nit more difficult to expose government wrongdoing. In fact, the \nproposed legislation promotes the use of Federal whistleblower statutes \nand regulations to report unlawful and other improper conduct. \nUnauthorized leaks of classified information, however, are harmful to \nthe national security and could endanger lives. Thus, in addition to \nproposing important refinements to the espionage statutes, this \nlegislation will deter unauthorized leaks of classified information by \ngovernment employees who knowingly and intentionally violate classified \ninformation nondisclosure agreements.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4051\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``The Espionage Statutes \n     Modernization Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) As of 2010, the statutory framework with respect to the \n     espionage statutes is a compilation of statutes that began \n     with Act of June 15, 1917 (40 Stat. 217, chapter 30)(commonly \n     known as the ``Espionage Act of 1917''), which targeted \n     classic espionage cases involving persons working on behalf \n     of foreign nations.\n       (2) The statutory framework was formed at a time when \n     intelligence and national security information existed \n     primarily in a tangible form, such as blueprints, \n     photographs, maps, and other documents.\n       (3) Since 1917, the United States has witnessed dramatic \n     changes in intelligence and national security information, \n     including technological advances that have revolutionized \n     information gathering abilities as well as the mediums used \n     to communicate such information.\n       (4) Some of the terms used in the espionage statutes are \n     obsolete and the statutes do not fully take into account the \n     classification levels that apply to national security \n     information in the 21st century.\n       (5) In addition, the statutory framework was originally \n     designed to address classic espionage cases involving persons \n     working on behalf of foreign nations. However, the national \n     security of the United States could be harmed, and lives may \n     be put at risk, when a Government officer, employee, \n     contractor, or consultant with access to classified \n     information makes an unauthorized disclosure of the \n     classified information, irrespective of whether the \n     Government officer, employee, contractor, or consultant \n     intended to aid a foreign nation or harm the United States.\n       (6) Federal whistleblower protection statutes and \n     regulations that enable Government officers, employees, \n     contractors, and consultants to report unlawful and improper \n     conduct are appropriate mechanisms for reporting such \n     conduct.\n       (7) Congress can deter unauthorized disclosures of \n     classified information and thereby protect the national \n     security by--\n       (A) enacting laws that improve, modernize, and clarify the \n     espionage statutes and make the espionage statutes more \n     relevant and effective in the 21st century in the prosecution \n     of persons working on behalf of foreign powers;\n       (B) promoting Federal whistleblower protection statutes and \n     regulations to enable Government officers, employees, \n     contractors, or consultants to report unlawful and improper \n     conduct; and\n       (C) enacting laws that separately punish the unauthorized \n     disclosure of classified information by Government officers, \n     employees, contractors, or consultants who knowingly and \n     intentionally violate a classified information nondisclosure \n     agreement, irrespective of whether the officers, employees, \n     contractors, or consultants intend to aid a foreign power or \n     harm the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Accordingly, the advice and \n     consent of the Senate to ratification of the New START Treaty \n     is conditioned on the expectation that the Russian Federation \n     will cooperate fully with United States and international \n     efforts to prevent the Government of Iran from developing a \n     nuclear weapons capability.\n       (B) Prior to the entry into force of the New START Treaty, \n     the President shall certify to the Senate that--\n       (i) the Russian Federation is in full compliance with all \n     United Nations Security Council Resolutions relating to Iran;\n       (ii) the Government of the Russian Federation has assured \n     the United States that neither it nor any entity subject to \n     its jurisdiction and control will--\n       (I) transfer to Iran the S-300 air defense system or other \n     advanced weapons systems or any parts thereof;

\n     and\n       (iv) the Government of the Russian Federation has assured \n     the United States that it will support efforts at the United \n     Nations Security Council and elsewhere to increase political \n     and economic pressure on the Government of Iran to abandon \n     its nuclear weapons program.\n       (C) Each annual report submitted pursuant to paragraph (10) \n     shall include a certification by the President that between \n     the date the New START Treaty entered into force and December \n     31, 2011, or, in subsequent reports, during the previous \n     year--\n       (i) the Russian Federation was in full compliance with all \n     United Nations Security Council Resolutions relating to Iran;\n       (ii) neither the Government of the Russian Federation nor \n     any entity subject to its jurisdiction and control has, with \n     the knowledge of the Government of the Russian Federation, \n     transferred to Iran the S-300 air defense system or other \n     advanced weapons systems;\n       (iii) neither the Government of the Russian Federation nor \n     any entity subject to its jurisdiction and control has, with \n     the knowledge of the Government of the Russian Federation, \n     transferred to Iran goods, services, or technology that \n     contribute to the advancement of the nuclear weapons or \n     missile programs of Iran; and\n       (iv) the Russian Federation has supported efforts at the \n     United Nations Security Council and elsewhere to increase \n     political and economic pressure on the Government of Iran to \n     abandon its nuclear weapons program, and has not sought to \n     weaken initiatives aimed at increasing such pressure.\n       (D) If in any annual report submitted pursuant to paragraph \n     (10) the President fails to make the certification described \n     in subparagraph (C), then the President shall--\n       (i) consult with the Senate regarding the implications of \n     the Russian Federation's actions for the national security \n     interests of the United States;\n       (ii) seek on an urgent basis a meeting with the Russian \n     Federation at the highest diplomatic level with the objective \n     of persuading the Russian Federation to fully support United \n     States and international efforts to prevent the Government of \n     Iran from developing a nuclear weapons capability; and\n       (iii) submit a report to the Senate promptly thereafter, \n     detailing--\n       (I) whether adherence to the New START Treaty remains in \n     the national security interests of the United States;
