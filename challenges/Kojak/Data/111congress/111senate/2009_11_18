Mr. President, when baseball legend Lou Gehrig retired \nafter playing 2,130 consecutive games, every expert drew the same \nconclusion: this record will never be broken. Of course, they were \nwrong.\n  Throughout history, forecasters have sentenced themselves to ridicule \nfor prematurely assuming a skyscraper's height would never be topped, \nfor promising an invention's ingenuity would never be outdone, or for \ncontending an athletic feat would never be surpassed.\n  Even so, I am willing to risk predicting that many of Senator Robert \nByrd's records will never be matched. Since coming to the Senate in \n1959, Senator Byrd has cast more than 18,500 votes. No one else, past \nor present, even comes close. He is the only Senator who has ever been \nelected to nine full terms in this body. He has presided over both the \nshortest session in Senate history--not even one second long--and \npresided for the longest continuous period--more than 21 hours. No one \nhas ever served on a Senate Committee longer than Senator Byrd. Just \ndays after being sworn in, he joined the Appropriation Committee he \nwould later chair. He has held the most leadership positions in Senate \nhistory, and continues to serve as our President Pro Tempore.\n  And just moments ago, when this body was gaveled into session, \nSenator Byrd realized one more unparalleled accomplishment: he has just \nbecome the longest-serving Member of Congress in U.S. history.\n  Every day since January 3, 1953--that is 56 years, 10 months and 16 \ndays--West Virginians have been proud to be presented in Washington, by \nRobert Byrd.\n  He began his service in the House the same day Alaska became our 49th \nState, and was months into his Senate service when Hawaii became our \n50th.\n  Senator Byrd has served in this Nation's Congress for more than a \nquarter of the time it has existed. And he has served in Congress \nlonger than more than a quarter of today's sitting Senators--and the \nPresident of the United\n\n[[Page S11442]]\n\nStates--have been alive. That doesn't even count one Senator who was \nborn just days after his first election to represent West Virginia's \nSixth Congressional District, and a second who was born just weeks \nafter that.\n  A dozen men have called the Oval Office his own while Senator Byrd \nhas called the Capitol building his office.\n  He twice won every single one of West Virginia's 55 counties. And \nthroughout one of the longest political careers in history, no one ever \nhas defeated Robert Byrd in a single election.\n  But though each one of those campaigns--after each of the 12 times he \nhas taken an oath to represent the people of West Virginia--on every \nsingle one of the 20,774 days he has served--he has never taken the \nprivilege for granted.\n  As a former leader of both the majority and the minority caucuses in \nthe Senate, he knows better than most that legislation is the art of \ncompromise. It is telling that the man who has served here longer than \nany other American has come to the conclusion that we must work \ntogether as partners, not partisans, for the good of our country--and, \nof course, the State of West Virginia.\n  He has seen partisanship and bipartisanship; war and peace; recession \nand recovery; and his perspective is invaluable to the way we carry \nourselves as U.S. Senators.\n  Senator Byrd's legislative accomplishments are many, and he continues \nto accumulate them. And while those accomplishments fortify his \nincomparable legacy, he is perhaps best known in this Chamber as the \nforemost guardian of the Senate's complex rules, procedures and \ncustoms.\n  He has not concerned himself with such precision as a pastime or a \nmere hobby. He has done so because of the unyielding respect he has for \nthe Senate. And on this momentous occasion, I say to my friend that the \nSenate returns that unyielding respect to him.\n  By virtue of his longevity, Robert Byrd has known and worked with \nmany of the greats of the United States Senate. By virtue of his \nintegrity, he has long since established himself among the greats.\n  There will never be another Senator like Senator Byrd, and today's \nmilestone is another record that will never be broken.\n  Congratulations, Robert C. Byrd, an orphan who changed history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/18/senate-section/article/S11442-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it has been nearly 30 years now since \nSenator Byrd started delivering a series of lectures that ultimately \nbecame the book that all of us are familiar with and which all of us \nadmire. And the story of how those lectures came about says a lot about \nthe man who has now served in Congress longer than any other man or \nwoman in the history of our country.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S11442, November 18, 2009, the Record reads: It has been \nnearly 30 years now since . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. \nPresident, it has been nearly 30 years now since . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  The story goes that it was a quiet Friday morning here in the Senate \nand Senator Byrd, as the majority leader, went down to the floor \nwithout planning to say much of anything at all, except that there \nwouldn't be any votes that day. But then he looked up to the gallery, \nand he saw one of his granddaughters up there with some of her \nclassmates, and he thought it might be a good idea if they had \nsomething to talk about when they got back to school.\n  So, quite extemporaneously and quite by happenstance, he delivered a \nspeech to an empty Chamber on the history of the Senate. A week went \nby, and the same thing happened again. Senator Byrd came to the floor \nto make some brief statement about the floor business. He looked up to \nthe gallery, and he saw another one of his granddaughters. Of course he \ncouldn't give a history lesson to one and not to another. So he gave \nanother history lesson.\n  Well, 7 years and about 2 million words later, he stopped giving \nthose history lessons. And now we will always have them. And we are \ngrateful for that, and for this man. Robert Byrd once said that what is \nsometimes considered to be the result of genius is more the result of \npersistence, perseverance, and hard work. To be a good Senator, he \nsaid, one has to work at it. And now, longer than anyone else in our \nhistory, he has lived by those words.\n  Today, Robert Carlyle Byrd sets a record that has been more than 56 \nyears in the making. The records just keep adding up. Three years ago, \nhe became the longest serving Senator in our Nation's history. A few \nmonth after that, he became the only person ever elected to nine full \nterms in the Senate. He has now served in the U.S. Congress for 20,774 \ndays.\n  He has cast 18,500 votes in the well of this Chamber. He is the \nlongest serving member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. He has \npresided over the Senate's shortest session and its longest continuous \nsession. He is the only sitting Member of Congress to receive a law \ndegree, a degree that was presented to him by President John F. \nKennedy, just one of 12 Presidents that Senator Byrd has served \nalongside during his distinguished career.\n  Senator Byrd will tell you that he has been anchored over the years \nby the values he learned at the feet of his foster parents, by the \nsupport and love of his beloved Erma, whom we were all sad to lose, by \nthe U.S. Constitution, and by his faith in God. In a long life, he has \nknown his share of hardships and triumphs. But he has run the race as \nif to win. He is still at it and we are grateful for his astonishing \nrecord of service to the people of West Virginia, to the United States \nSenate, and to the Nation he loves.\n  In achieving this latest milestone, Senator Byrd surpasses a former \ncolleague of his--Carl Hayden, another legendary figure who served the \npeople of Arizona in the Senate for 42 years. Carl Hayden was known to \nmany as the ``Silent Senator.'' That probably isn't a phrase many would \nuse to describe Senator Byrd. But what they both share is an undying \nlove of this great country of ours and of the U.S. Congress. So I would \nlike to join my colleagues, my fellow Americans, the people of West \nVirginia, and the Byrd family in celebrating this historic occasion. \nSenator Byrd, congratulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/18/senate-section/article/S11442-3", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11442-S11443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               GUANTANAMO\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this morning, the Attorney General will \nappear before the Senate Judiciary Committee for an oversight hearing. \nAmong other matters, he will be asked questions about the \nAdministration's recent decision to voluntarily bring terrorist \ndetainees from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, into the United States, including \nfor purposes of civilian trial.\n  I, myself, have questions for the Attorney General.\n  The administration justifies sending Kahlid Sheik Mohammed and his \nfellow 9/11 plotters to civilian court, while prosecuting other foreign \nterrorists in military commissions because, it says, the former \ntargeted civilians on American soil, while the latter attacked military \ntargets overseas, like the warship USS Cole. I find this a truly \ntroubling distinction.\n  First, is that rationale not internally inconsistent and, frankly, \ndisingenuous? Everyone knows the Pentagon is a military target. Indeed, \nit is our Nation's foremost military command and control installation. \nWhat does it say to the military families of those service men and \nwomen who were killed that day to ignore that Kahlid Sheik Mohammed \nattacked a military target on 9/11?\n  Second, under this rationale, is the administration not telling \nterrorists that if they target defenseless U.S. civilians on our own \nsoil they will get the rights and privileges of American citizens, \nwhereas if they attack a military target, like the USS Cole, which can \ndefend itself, they will not get these rights and privileges? Does that \napproach not reward terrorists with benefits--like potentially \nproviding them access to sensitive information, and providing them a \nplatform for propagandizing--for attacking civilians here in the U.S., \nrather than military targets abroad?\n  In short, I think the administration has made an ill-advised decision \nby bringing foreign terrorists from Guantanamo Bay into the United \nStates. There are a lot of well-known\n\n[[Page S11443]]\n\ndownsides and dangers from doing so. I have not heard of any benefit to \nus of bringing these terrorists here.\n  In his testimony before the Judiciary Committee today, the Attorney \nGeneral has the opportunity to explain the administration's decision--\nsomething he has yet to do before the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/18/senate-section/article/S11443-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, at a time when unemployment is at a 25-\nyear high and with a Federal deficit breaking the $12 trillion mark, \nthe House of Representatives passed a health care bill that raises \ntaxes more than $700 billion. This is the House-passed health care bill \non this desk. I expect the Senate version, which may be produced today, \nwill be of similar size.\n  Who gets taxed under the House-passed bill? Let's take a look.\n  At the top of the list is small business. A small business surtax in \nthe bill takes $150 billion out of our job creators. That is on page \n344 of this massive 2,000-page House bill. We all know small businesses \nare the biggest job generators in the country. They employ well over \nhalf of those who have employment in our country.\n  Second, we have an employer tax. The employer tax raises $135 billion \nin taxes through a new mandate on employers. That is on page 281 of \nthis massive 2,000-page bill. The NFIB, the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, which represents small business, estimates that \nmandate would cost about 1.6 million jobs. That is a 1.6 million job-\nkilling tax at a time when the national unemployment rate is 10.2 \npercent.\n  Insured Americans, item No. 4 on this chart--let's look at the tax on \ninsured Americans. Billions of new taxes to pay for comparative \neffectiveness research rationing in this 2,000-page bill. That is on \npage 1179, a tax on those who are insured.\n  Then we have attacks on those who are uninsured, item 3 on the chart. \nThey get taxed as well, a 2.5-percent income tax on the uninsured. That \nis on page 303 of this roughly 2,000-page bill.\n  Medical devices, upon which those who are sick depend heavily, will \nalso be taxed. People needing lifesaving medical devices will also \nreceive a tax increase, on page 347 of this massive 2,000-page bill. \nThere will be a $20 billion tax on medical devices. Of course, that \nwill be passed straight on to the consumers. So that will, in effect, \nbe a tax on those Americans who are sick and who need medical devices.\n  There is also a tax on the chronically ill. On page 332 of this \n2,000-page effort to restructure the American health care system, we \nfind flexible spending accounts would be capped at $2,500 and phased \nout over time. How does that affect the chronically ill? As a result, \ntens of millions of families, many of whom are managing chronic \nillnesses, will see billions in tax-saving benefits from these FSAs \nwiped out, right here on page 332 of this 2,000-page bill.\n  What does all this mean to small business? David Boland is the \nmanager at Boland Maloney Lumber, Louisville. He wrote to my office to \nsay what it means:\n\n       Health care reform that does nothing to control costs--\n\n  And we already know from CBO and from the actuaries that the Health \nand Human Services bill does not control costs--\n\n     but merely increases the burden on small businesses through \n     mandates and tax hikes is a dangerous and risky proposition \n     that will imperil my company and our national recovery.\n\n  Don't take it from me; listen to David Boland. He gets it. He knows \nthat slashing Medicare, increasing premiums, and raising taxes in a \nrecession is not reform.\n  It was actually a front-page story in the Washington Post this \nmorning, a company in Louisville that kind of underscores what I am \ntalking about. The front-page story in today's Washington Post \ndescribes the ongoing struggles of a small manufacturer in my hometown \nof Louisville who is fighting to save jobs. This business owner wants \nto be more productive so he can hold onto his workers. But all of these \ncrushing taxes, many of which would apply to his company, are simply \nnot going to be helpful.\n  Finally, yesterday I spoke about Medicare cuts, the massive Medicare \ncuts in this bill we are shortly going to be considering. It is \nimportant to remember that Senate Democrats recently tried to pass a \nso-called doc fix that would have forced seniors to pay higher premiums \non top of $\\1/2\\ trillion they want to cut from Medicare. Fortunately, \nthis bill was rejected by a wide bipartisan majority. While we all \nthink this problem needs to be addressed, this is not the way to do it. \nI am confident that should a similar bill pass the House later this \nweek, we will reject it again on a bipartisan basis.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/18/senate-section/article/S11443-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

On this actually very \nmomentous day, November 18, 2009, my dear friend and colleague becomes \nthe longest serving Member of Congress in the history of this Nation. \nOn Friday, he will also celebrate a warm and joyous birthday.\n  Senator Byrd passes the incredible Carl Hayden of Arizona who served \nhonorably in the House and then the Senate for 56 years, 319 days. We \ncome together today as an institution to recognize that no Senator in \nhistory has cast more votes or has been elected by his colleagues to \nmore leadership positions than Robert C. Byrd, no one else--a sign of \nthe enormous warmth and tremendous respect and the unwavering \nadmiration we all share for Senator Robert C. Byrd.\n  I am lucky every day to call Senator Byrd my friend, as I have been \nable to work with him in the Senate for the last 25 years and for the \npreceding 8 years when I was a Governor. But most importantly and most \npowerfully, Senator Byrd always makes me so very proud to be a West \nVirginian.\n  At our State capitol in Charleston, they are honoring Senator Byrd \nwith a special celebration today. The same is happening in small towns, \ncities and communities all across our State. My fellow West Virginians \nare giving thanks for Senator Byrd's voice and for his vision. We are \ngrateful for his strength and his rock-solid principle, which over the \nyears has come to define West Virginia as surely as our endless hills \nand beautiful streams.\n  The people of my State love and respect Senator Robert C. Byrd, in \npart because so many share his very powerful story. So many have \nbattled against the odds and continue to fight every day to try to make \na better life for themselves and for their community. They are proud of \ntheir State, even knowing their State is not known by many, but they \ntake pride in their unity.\n  Senator Byrd learned early in life what it meant to be loyal, have a \nstrong work ethic, and possess an untiring faith in God. And it was \nthese values these innately West Virginia values that guided his every \naction, and made him such a strong fighter for our State. Even in the \nhardest, youngest days of his life, Senator Robert C. Byrd never grew \ndiscouraged. It was not his nature. Growing up, he faced enormous \nchallenges, but he had something called an iron will and he had a sense \nof purpose.\n\n  Now years later, we can sum up that purpose with the phrase \n``fighting for West Virginia.'' It has always rung true, whether it is \nhis 50th birthday or, in fact, his 92nd birthday. Whether he was a \nfreshman in the House or the Senate's longest serving Member, it\n\n[[Page S11444]]\n\nhas never changed with Robert C. Byrd. His fight for West Virginia is \nfundamental to his world, which is West Virginia's world. It is in his \nblood. It is a sacred cause.\n  It is not just the building of roads, that which is so often \nassociated with Senator Byrd--and to be sure, those roads have \ntransformed our State and connected us with other parts of the Nation \nand to each other--but so much more. When you pick up a local \nnewspaper, always some institution, some college, some volunteer fire \ndepartment, some research institute at a university or college has been \nhelped by Senator Byrd. It is his job, but it is also his very special \nhonor at which he excels because of his love for West Virginia.\n  Ultimately, it is work: it is simply hard work, and Robert Byrd never \nshied away from it for the people of West Virginia, for the \nConstitution and, yes for this institution, the Senate and its special \nplace in our government and our Nation.\n  This week, I think of the many birthdays past that he has shared with \nmany of us and with his precious wife Erma, his partner in everything, \nwho gave him the great strength and great faith to reach great heights. \nIt was a little sad to me--and I think to all of us who know him--the \ncost to him of her death. He changed just a little bit in ways that are \nhard to explain but ways which are very deep within his soul because he \nloved and depended on her so much. And I know that as we mark this \ntremendous milestone today, she is with us with great joy in her heart.\n  Please allow me to take this special moment to thank my beloved \nfriend and congratulate him on this profound day in the whole history \nof the Senate, which truly sets him apart from all the rest. I am \ndelighted to celebrate such an incredible milestone.\n  I wish him a wonderful birthday, many years of service, and all the \nhappiness in the world. But most of all, I thank him for what matters \nthe most to me, and that is his profound service to the people of the \nState of West Virginia.\n  For more than half a century, West Virginia has had in Robert C. Byrd \na great man leading us in our greatest battles. And for that, we are \ntruly blessed.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise this morning, along with a group \nof my colleagues who will be here, to talk about the importance of \naddressing health care reform to help small businesses. Senator \nLandrieu is leading this effort, and she is going to be coordinating \nthe speakers this morning.\n  Mr. President, before I begin, I want to thank Senator Rockefeller \nfor his eloquent comments about Senator Byrd. My family lived in West \nVirginia for about 30 years and truly appreciated the difference \nSenator Byrd made for the State, and I am very honored to be able to \nserve with him, even for a very brief time. So I say to Senator \nRockefeller, thank you very much for those comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/18/senate-section/article/S11444-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11444-S11445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, as the former owner and manager of a \nsmall retail business, I know very personally what it is like to worry \nabout meeting the payroll, about whether you can pay for the inventory \nto keep your business going, about complying with the myriad of \nregulations you have to comply with.\n  As a former Governor, I certainly understand it is business and not \ngovernment that creates jobs and drives new ideas and innovation. But I \nalso know that government has a vital role to play in addressing the \nchallenges businesses and small businesses face, especially in these \nvery difficult economic times. One of those challenges small businesses \nare struggling with is the high cost of health care.\n  In New Hampshire, between 2002 and 2006, small businesses paid 42 \npercent more in premiums for health insurance for their employees; and \nfor our smallest businesses, those with fewer than 10 employees, the \nincrease was almost double that--a 71-percent increase in the cost of \npremiums.\n  So what does that mean for the small businesses and their employees \nwho want health care? It means small businesses have to make the tough \ndecision to either drop coverage for their workers or to increase the \nemployee contributions, often to the point where their workers cannot \nafford coverage.\n  Everywhere I go in New Hampshire, I hear from small business owners \nwho tell me about these tough decisions they face. I heard this concern \nfrom Adria Bagshaw who testified this summer at a Small Business \nCommittee field hearing Senator Snowe and I did in Portsmouth, NH. \nAdria and her husband Aaron own the W.H. Bagshaw Company, a fifth-\ngeneration family manufacturing company in Nashua, NH. They offer \nhealth insurance to their 18 employees and cover a portion of the \nmonthly premium for them. But with those premiums at $1,100 per month \nper family, they spent more on health insurance for the first half of \nthis year than they spent on the raw materials they need to make their \nproducts at their manufacturing company. Understandably, Adria worries \nthey are going to need to cut back on the quality of health insurance \nplans they offer their employees or the amount the company covers to \nhelp pay for those premiums.\n  I have also heard from people such as Chick Colony who is a small \nbusiness owner in Harrisville, NH. He has a wonderful weaving company \nthat has been in Harrisville for generations. He e-mailed me, saying:\n\n       The cost of health insurance is the biggest problem that \n     our small . . . business faces.\n\n  They have 24 employees. He went on to say:\n\n       The present system is expensive, inefficient and broken. I \n     can't tell you how the 20 to 35 percent annual rate increases \n     depress us all and there is no end in sight. Over the past \n     five years, most of our employees have had to drop coverage \n     because they simply can't afford to pay their share of the \n     premium. I really believe that the time has come to put the \n     existing system out of its misery.\n\n  Certainly we hope we can do that.\n  I have also heard from Kevin Boyarsky, who is an owner of a small \nprinting company in Concord. He told me:\n\n       Health insurance premiums have gone up 30 percent last year \n     and 22 percent the year before. It's now a very big item in \n     our company's budget. We want to grow and be competitive, but \n     the high costs make it hard. From a small business \n     perspective, I can't attract employees without good coverage, \n     but if I hire you now, I'll only be able to offer you 50 \n     percent of the individual plan. It's all I can afford and it \n     isn't very attractive to employees.\n\n  Small businesses in New Hampshire and across the country are burdened \nby high premiums for health insurance. In fact, statistics show us that \nsmall businesses pay, on average, 18 percent more than large plans for \nthe same insurance policy. And for small businesses that do not offer \ntheir employees health insurance, they cite the high cost of premiums \nas the reason why.\n  We need comprehensive health reform to help these small businesses. \nThe small business owners I have spoken with want to offer insurance to \ntheir employees, both because they believe it is not only the right \nthing to do, but it is critical to being competitive, to recruiting and \nretaining good employees. But as they so often tell me, the high cost \nof insurance stands in their way.\n  Health reform is critical to these folks. We can help them by passing \ncomprehensive insurance reforms that rein in health care premiums, so \nit stabilizes costs, and provide tax credits to small businesses to \nhelp them afford the cost of health insurance. I believe we must take \nthese measures to help level the playing field for small businesses and \nto make insurance premiums more affordable.\n  Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. That is where most \nof the jobs in this country are created. We have to control health care \ncosts to relieve the financial burden, so that so many of these small \nbusinesses in New Hampshire and across the country no longer have to \nface the choice of whether they can keep health insurance or hire \nemployees.\n\n[[Page S11445]]\n\n  I urge all of my colleagues to work together so we can pass \ncomprehensive health reform legislation. We need to pass it, and we \nneed to pass it soon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

BYRD\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, as the 100th Member of the Senate, it is my \ngreat honor to pay tribute to this body's longest serving Member, \nSenator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, on the occasion of his record-\nsetting 20,774th day as a Member of Congress.\n  I have the fondest memories, as a young staffer here, of listening to \nthe sounds of Senator Byrd's fiddle wafting from his suite on the first \nfloor of the Russell Senate Office Building. And I am proud today, as I \ndo most days, to wear a wristwatch which was given to me, generously, \nby Senator Byrd over 20 years ago as I was completing my tenure as \nchairman of the Democratic Party of the United States.\n  I pay tribute to Senator Byrd on behalf of myself and the people of \nthe Commonwealth of Massachusetts, but I also pay tribute on behalf of \nmy predecessor and a great friend of Senator Byrd's, former Senator \nEdward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts.\n  It is true that Senator Kennedy and Senator Byrd did not always see \neye to eye on every issue. Senator Kennedy used to joke that it was \nSenator Byrd who taught him how to count votes in their whip race in \n1971. Actually, he taught us both how to count votes because I was a \nyoung aide to Senator Kennedy in his whip's office at the time and it \nturned out that Senator Byrd clearly could count votes more accurately \nthan we could.\n  Over the years since, Senator Kennedy was always proud to be in this \nChamber when his friend Senator Byrd would speak. As Senator Kennedy \nonce said, he knew Senator Byrd was an expert on the Roman Senate, and \nhe was sure Senator Byrd's ``wisdom and oratorical skill would make \neven Cicero envious.''\n\n  Senator Byrd and Senator Kennedy shared a love of the Senate, and \nthey shared a love of poetry. One poem they returned to over the years \nwas entitled ``A Psalm of Life'' by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Senator \nByrd, of course, knows this poem by heart, and so I need not read it \nall today. Instead, let me recite the last few stanzas to the Senate \nand for the Record, as these words sum up the force that is Senator \nByrd:\n\n     ``Lives of great men all remind us\n     We can make our lives sublime\n     And, departing, leave behind us\n     Footprints on the sands of time;\n\n     ``Footprints that perhaps another\n     Sailing o'er life's solemn main,\n     A forlorn and shipwrecked brother\n     Seeing, shall take heart again\n\n     ``Let us then be up and doing,\n     With a heart for any fate;\n     Still achieving, still pursuing,\n     Learn to labor and to wait.''\n\n  Throughout his brilliant career, Senator Byrd has made so many \nfootprints on the sands of time. He has touched, taught, and inspired \nhundreds of colleagues from every State and thousands upon thousands of \nSenate staff members have marveled at his genius, his dedication to the \npeople of West Virginia, and his unparalleled service to the Senate and \nto this country.\n  I join all my colleagues in wishing him well on this special day in \nthe history of the Senate, and I congratulate him on his incredible \nservice to the State of West Virginia, to the Senate of the United \nStates, and to the United States of America.\n  We thank you, Senator Byrd, for your service, and we congratulate \nyou.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, let me commend my colleague, the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, for his comments about Senator Byrd. I also want to \njoin in recognizing and celebrating Senator Byrd's service to West \nVirginia and to our country. As a new Member to this body, I did not \nhave the occasion to work as closely with Senator Byrd as others. \nHowever, as a resident of the Commonwealth of Virginia, not only did I \nfollow the enormous respect Senator Byrd has engendered here in the \nSenate, but I have also watched with awe Senator Byrd's ability to \nbring jobs back to West Virginia. He was able to relocate many Federal \nagencies and activities, oftentimes that may have previously resided in \nVirginia, to the State of West Virginia.\n  I join my colleagues in commending Senator Byrd, not only for his \nenormous service to this body and to our country, but as someone who \nhas been a tireless advocate for his home State of West Virginia.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in commenting on \nand thanking Senator Byrd for his extraordinary leadership, not just \nfor the people of West Virginia but the people of our Nation--in fact, \nto millions of people around the world--because of the policies he has \ndriven here, the speeches, the words he has put behind so many of the \nmost remarkable policy decisions over the last half century. His work \nhas had enormous impact, again, not just in his State and in our Nation \nbut worldwide.\n  I am speaking also as a Senator from Louisiana to give firsthand \nwitness to his sensitive and timely and extraordinary leadership after \nthe Katrina and Rita disasters, now almost 4\\1/2\\ years ago; it will be \n5 years this August. That is hard to believe. The hurricanes and the \nsubsequent levee failures devastated one of the great cities in America \nand one of the great regions. There were very few people who stood up \nin Washington. The administration at the time had a hard time grasping \nthe scope of the disaster. But there was one person who understood. \nThere were several others, but one in particular understood--amazingly, \nwithout even having gone down there, which was very hard to understand \nif you didn't go to New Orleans or south Louisiana. But he \ninstinctively understood because of his compassion and great empathy \nthat has been developed over a lifetime of caring, giving, \nunderstanding, and listening.\n  Senator Byrd heard the cries of the people and he responded. Because \nof his leadership on the Appropriations Committee, despite having so \nmuch stacked against us, he was able to step up. I will never forget \nand the people of our State will never forget the friend we have had in \nSenator Byrd. He continues, to this day, to watch after our recovery \nand support it. When New Orleans makes its 300th anniversary, which \nwill be 2018--our city will be 300 years old--there will be a person \nwho needs to be thanked on that day for helping the city to reach its \n300th birthday, and that would be the great Senator from West Virginia \nRobert C. Byrd.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I have the great privilege of rising \nto pay tribute to my chairman, the longest serving Senator in the \nhistory of this country, the senior Senator from West Virginia, Robert \nC. Byrd.\n  He has reached a milestone among many in his career. It is an \nextraordinary record of service and dedication and patriotism to the \ncountry, and it reflects the values of the people of West Virginia and \nof this great Nation. Senator Byrd's extraordinary service is measured \nnot just in length but accomplishments, but the length is impressive, \nindeed. He has 20,744 days of service as a Member of Congress--over 56 \nyears, 10\\1/2\\ months. Over that time, Senator Byrd has cast over \n18,500 rollcall votes, witnessed the inauguration of 11 Presidents, and \nhe has been successful in 15 out of 15 elections.\n  For over 60 years, Senator Byrd has represented the people of West \nVirginia tirelessly, with a great deal of energy and a great deal of \nsuccess. He started in the West Virginia House of Delegates and then \nwas elected to the West Virginia State Senate. Then he went to the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives. Finally, he came here to the U.S. Senate, \nwhere he is currently serving in an unprecedented ninth full term.\n  I think Senator Byrd's success is a reflection of his steady \nprogress, learning first about the people of his home State as he \nworked among them, knowing them well because they were his friends and \nneighbors; and then going on into local government and dealing with the \nconcerns as a State representative and then as a State senator; and \nthen coming to the House of Representatives, understanding the \noperation of the House and how he could help the people of West \nVirginia; and finally, he coming here to the U.S. Senate.\n\n[[Page S11446]]\n\n  What is incredibly impressive about Senator Byrd is that he is not \nonly the longest serving Senator in the history of this country, he is \nthe most knowledgeable Senator with respect to the history of our body. \nHe is the author--he literally wrote the book on the U.S. Congress and \nthe Senate, among so many others that he has written. This reflects his \nincredible talent and intellect but also his incredible hard work and \ntenacity, and it reflects the range of experience he has had.\n  No one knows this body better than Robert Byrd. No one has served it \nlonger. Nobody has served it with the same kind of energy, insight, and \ndedication. It has been reflected in West Virginia, across the Nation, \nand across the globe. For example, in 1947, shortly before Senator Byrd \nfirst came to Washington D.C. as a U.S. Congressman, there were only \nfour miles of divided four-lane highway, in West Virginia. Today, as a \nresult of Senator Byrd's work, the expansive Appalachian Development \nHighway System is nearing completion. He understood, as we must today, \nthat economic development is not only a fundamental need, but that it \nresults largely from the infrastructure improvements that speed \ncommerce and literally connect people to one another.\n  Senator Byrd also is a tireless advocate for miners, those men and \nwomen--principally men--who go down and literally risk their lives in \nthe coal mines. He knows this firsthand. As a result, mining-related \ninjuries in West Virginia have significantly declined since Senator \nByrd came here--the results of his actions, the results of his \nunderstanding, and the results of his commitment to the people he \nserved. He worked hard each and every day for those who risk their \nlives in a dangerous occupation and deserve the attention and respect \nof this body and our country.\n  He has done much more than help the people of West Virginia. As I \nindicated before, as the greatest scholar in our body, he has \ndemonstrated a profound understanding and respect for the Constitution \nof the United States. He has shown that not just in words but in deeds. \nHe has been prepared to stand up when he thought constitutional values \nwere being impaired. Indeed, no commitment is greater to Senator Byrd \nthan his commitment to the Constitution and the values therein. He has \nstood up forcefully and persuasively on so many occasions to defend the \nConstitution and to serve truly the oath we all take to preserve, \nprotect, and defend the Constitution.\n  On Friday, Senator Byrd will celebrate his 92nd birthday. He will \ncelebrate that in his usual fashion: He will work, I am sure. He will \nwork for the people of West Virginia, for the people of this country, \nand for the people of the world. He will reflect back on his dearest \npartner, his wife, who was his support, comfort, and inspiration. He \nwill reflect upon his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. \nHe will reflect upon a life well lived in service to his country. But \nmore important, he will look ahead to the work he will do as he \nfinishes this term and prepares for his next election to represent the \npeople of West Virginia.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge the service \nof Senator Byrd, the senior Member of the Senate who, today, will \nbecome the longest serving Member of the U.S. Congress ever in our \nNation's history.\n  When I first came to this body as a young aide to Senator Howard \nBaker 42 years ago, Senator Byrd had already been here as a Senator for \n10 years. He had been in the Congress 6 more years than that.\n  I remember when he, Senator Baker, was elected majority leader and \nSenator Byrd was the Democratic leader, Baker went to Byrd and said: \nBob, I have a proposal for you. I will never learn the rules as well as \nyou know them, so I won't surprise you if you won't surprise me.\n  Senator Byrd said to Senator Baker: Howard, let me think about it.\n  So he thought about it overnight, came back, and that was their deal \nthe next day, and that is the way they worked for 4 years in managing \nthis Senate. Senator Byrd and Senator Baker both read David \nMcCullough's book. Senator Byrd told me it changed their minds about \nthe Panama Canal in 1980 in a decisive decision that was controversial \nin the Senate. I worked with him and the late Senator Kennedy, whom the \nPresiding Officer succeeded, on American history, and we have \nlegislation pending which I hope we will pass when we reauthorize the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act consolidating all the Federal \nGovernment's activities to encourage our children to learn U.S. history \nso they will know what it means to be an American.\n  Senator Byrd now more than ever is a part of that history. He is an \nindispensable Member of this body. He teaches us as well as serves with \nus and we honor him for his service.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/18/senate-section/article/S11446-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11446-S11450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to once again join my \ncolleagues in addressing the need for comprehensive health care reform. \nThe Senator from New Hampshire, Mrs. Shaheen, earlier spoke on health \ncare reform and its effect on small business. I know my colleague, \nSenator Udall from Colorado, is going to be speaking soon. And I know \nwe are going to be joined, as well, a little bit later by Senator \nLandrieu, who takes a leadership role on the issues affecting small \nbusinesses, as chair of the Small Business Committee. I rise today to \nstress how important health care reform is to the small business \ncommunity. Currently, there are small businesses across America that \nhave been hit very hard by the effects of the recession. Small \nbusinesses are struggling as they try to keep their doors open, with \nthe enormous constriction of credit that is taking place. Small \nbusinesses are struggling to have the finances to expand; even healthy \nsmall businesses, as we have seen. Banks continue to draw back in \ncapital and try to build up their own balance sheets. The people who \nhave taken the hardest hit by the restriction on capital and the \nrestriction on lending have been small businesses across this country.\n\n  So we have the enormous challenges small businesses have felt by the \nrecession that has been exacerbated by the constriction of lending, and \nthen we add on top of that the enormous challenges that small \nbusinesses face in the health care market. The only people who pay \nretail--who pay full price for their health care benefits in America \ntoday--are small businesses and those who purchase health care on the \nindividual-based market. There is no group that will more benefit, or \nhave more to gain from meaningful health care reform, than small \nbusinesses.\n  Small businesses currently lack the bargaining power of large firms \nand pay as much as 18 percent more for the same health insurance as \nlarger companies. If you work in a large company you get the benefit of \nthe larger pool, and you are better able to bargain for your health \ninsurance rates. If you are poor and cannot afford health insurance, \nyou get access to Medicaid. If you are a senior, you get access to \nMedicare. Small businesses are the group that falls through the cracks. \nThey don't have access to this purchasing power, and consequently pay, \non average, about 18 percent more for health insurance than larger \ncompanies.\n  As health insurance costs continue to rise, more and more small \nbusinesses can no longer even afford to offer health insurance to their \nemployees. And if they do, their employees can't afford the co-payments \nto purchase health insurance. In fact, nearly one-quarter of the \nuninsured in our country works for small businesses. Between 2000 and \n2009, the percentage of firms with less than 10 employees--the heart of \nsmall businesses--offering insurance coverage fell from 57 percent to \n46 percent. Among people with employer-based coverage in January of \n2006, one-sixth lost their coverage by 2008. Nearly three-quarters of \nsmall businesses that do not offer coverage to their employees cite \nhigh premiums as the reason. Small businesses want to offer health \nbenefits to their employees, but are priced out of the market and \ncannot afford it.\n  Many small business employees are left uninsured and, in turn, rely \non the health care system to pick up the costs when they get sick. It \nis these people who show up at emergency rooms and access the most \ninefficient part of our health care system. They are oftentimes not \npeople who are unemployed, but employees of small businesses. Enacting \nmarket reforms such as creating\n\n[[Page S11447]]\n\ninsurance exchanges will finally give small businesses affordable \noptions. Their employees will have a place to purchase insurance at \nlarge pool rates and, by insuring more people, reform will help drive \ndown the cost of health insurance for all Americans. Insurance \nexchanges will also significantly reduce administrative costs for small \nbusinesses by enabling them to easily and simply compare the prices, \nbenefits, and performance of health care plans.\n  I know a number of us are working on a series of amendments for when \nthe health care bill gets to the Senate floor to try to make sure we \nadd further disclosure requirements and more transparency to our health \ncare system. Right now we don't have a free market in our health care \nsystem because nobody knows what the providers actually pay, and what \nthe doctors and hospitals actually charge. Small businesses will \nbenefit by trying to bring transparency to these health insurance \nexchanges.\n  Additionally, reform will enact consumer protections such as \nprohibiting insurance companies from denying coverage based on \npreexisting conditions and dropping people when they are sick. This is \nparticularly a challenge to small businesses. If you only have a small \ngroup of employees and a few have preexisting conditions, those \npreexisting conditions drive up the cost of providing insurance for \nthis smaller pool. Oftentimes this results in pricing small businesses \nout of the market. Reforms such as eliminating preexisting conditions \nwill dramatically help small businesses and their employees obtain \naffordable health insurance.\n  These protections are vital for small business employees because they \nhelp level the playing field in the small group market. They guarantee \nthe option of large pool rates, lower costs, and prohibit insurance \ncompanies from arbitrarily penalizing small businesses when one of \ntheir employees becomes seriously ill.\n  Lowering health care costs for employers is also key to our ability \nto compete in the global economy. If American business is going to come \nout of this recession and we can compete with countries around the \nworld, we have to take on the cost of health insurance. American \nworkers are more productive than any other workers in the world. But \neven with that increased productivity, if American businesses have to \npay $3,000 to $4,000 more per employee because of higher health \ninsurance costs than our competitors that puts American businesses at a \ndramatic disadvantage.\n  As health care costs continue to rise, other business investments are \nsacrificed. Forty percent of businesses say health care costs have a \nnegative impact on other parts of their business. As I mentioned, with \nthe great reduction of credit availability to small businesses and in \nthis challenging economic climate, American businesses cannot afford to \nbe at such a disadvantage. With health care reform, more of our \nNation's dollars will go toward investments in our economy.\n  Health care costs also stifle productivity. Too many Americans end up \nstaying in jobs simply because the employer provides health insurance. \nThey aren't able to move around, or move into entrepreneurial startup \nfirms where innovation and real growth potential takes place. Startup \nfirms and, again, small businesses are often not able to offer health \ninsurance. Consequently, we have good workers who are not able to move \ninto these firms and help spur job growth because they are caught in \ndead-end jobs. They are constrained by the security of health insurance \noffered at their old jobs or perhaps because they have a preexisting \ncondition and can't move to a new situation.\n  Again, if we do health insurance reform right, it will put in place \nreforms such as the elimination of preexisting conditions requirements \nthat will allow more freedom of movement within the job workforce.\n  So, once again, I join my colleagues in making this case. We have \nmade it time and again. Health care reform is necessary to make sure \nAmerican businesses remain competitive. Health care reform is necessary \nbecause health care costs are the single largest driver of our Federal \ndeficit. Health care reform is necessary because if we don't address \nrising costs, Medicare will be insolvent by 2017. If we don't reform \nthe system, costs will also rise for families; an average Virginia \nfamily, for example, within the next decade, will be paying nearly 40 \npercent of their disposable income to meet their health insurance \npremiums.\n  I will close my comments with where I started. Small businesses are \nthe only players in our market who still pay retail for their health \ncare costs and are increasingly being priced out of the market. Reform \nis imperative for the small business community.\n  I know my friend, the Senator from Colorado, is about to speak, and \nour leader on small business issues, the Senator from Louisiana, who \nhas been so diligent on leading these efforts and making sure that \nsmall businesses are protected in health care. We must get this right. \nWe must get this bill to the floor. And we must provide needed relief \nto the small businesses that will generate the economic recovery that \nwe're all hoping for.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Good morning. I, too, before I speak on health \ncare, wish to join my colleagues in congratulating Senator Byrd. I, \ntoo, am in awe of all of his accomplishments, and I, too, admire his \naffection for the Senate and will endeavor in my service here to model \nhis example.\n  I join my colleagues this morning to discuss an issue of great \nimportance to Colorado and to me. These past few weeks, as the \nPresiding Officer has, along with many of us on this side of the aisle, \nI have spoken about comprehensive health insurance reform as a key to \nstrengthening and securing the lives of middle-class Americans. One of \nthe most important components of that goal is ensuring that we do \neverything we can to help small business owners and their employees get \naffordable health coverage.\n  As the Senator from Virginia mentioned, over the last 15 years, small \nbusinesses have created over 65 percent of the new jobs in our country. \nYet the power of this job creation machine is being threatened by the \nexploding costs of health care. It will only get worse if we don't act.\n  If we do not pass health insurance reform, small business owners will \ncontinue to see the costs of providing benefits eat away at their \nbottom line. In my home State of Colorado, premium costs for small \nbusinesses are projected to more than double over the next decade. \nThese unsustainable cost increases not only harm current businesses, \nbut they prevent the growth of new ones. More and more would-be \nentrepreneurs across the country are deciding not to start their own \ncompanies due to the fear that they would not have access to affordable \ninsurance for their families or for their employees.\n  Unfortunately, this fear is too often justified. In the insurance \nmarket today, small businesses lack the bargaining power to get \naffordable rates that many large employers enjoy. They find themselves \nsubject to unpredictable and massive spikes in premiums. That is why it \nis so important that we pass a health care reform bill that takes \nproactive steps to address the rising costs of health care. I have to \ntell my colleagues I have been encouraged by the proposals I have seen \nthus far.\n  For example, a recent analysis of the nonpartisan CBO, the \nCongressional Budget Office, score of the Senate Finance Committee bill \nestimates that the reforms therein would save small businesses $65 \nbillion every year for the next decade. The proposal would do this, in \npart, by taking steps to transform our health care delivery system to \none that produces higher quality care at lower costs. It would also \ninclude tax credits specifically designed to help cash-strapped small \nbusinesses provide coverage to their employees.\n  Additionally, new reinsurance programs would reimburse employers \nstruggling with particularly high catastrophic costs. In addition to \nthese probusiness proposals, we also need to make sure the market \noffers new and affordable options for those employers who want to offer \ncoverage but currently cannot afford to do so. The new health insurance \nexchanges envisioned under the reform packages before us would permit \nsmall employers to purchase policies that spread risk across a\n\n[[Page S11448]]\n\nmuch larger population. New consumer protections would also keep costs \ndown by prohibiting insurers from charging higher premiums on the basis \nof health status or gender.\n  Right now, being a woman is a preexisting condition under the terms \nof many insurance policies. That is just not acceptable. Employers \nwould also be able to keep expenses down by promoting personal \nresponsibility--offering wellness premium discounts to employees who \nmake healthy choices.\n  Enacting meaningful health care reform is necessary for ensuring \nproductive small businesses, new American jobs, and a strong economy. \nIndependent and unbiased analyses estimate that in the next 10 years, \nreform can save upward of 80,000 small business jobs and raise wages by \nmore than $30 billion annually. Those are very promising numbers.\n  As the Senate begins its historic floor debate on health insurance \nreform, you can expect that I and my colleagues will continue reminding \nthe other side of the aisle just how critical reform is to the small \nbusiness community. No amount of misleading rhetoric or misdirection by \nthe defenders of the status quo will be enough to convince the American \npeople we should continue forward on our current unsustainable path.\n  I say to all my colleagues: Let's work together over the coming weeks \nto strengthen this legislation, empower small businesses, and put \nAmerica's health care system on the road to recovery.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. As I yield the floor, I wish to acknowledge \nthe great leadership of the chairman of the Small Business Committee, \nthe Senator from Louisiana.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kirk). The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado and \nthe Senator from Virginia for their remarks earlier this morning on the \nsubject I am also going to speak on, which is the urgency for us to \nprovide important help to millions of small businesses out there that \nare depending on us to get this reform done right.\n  I wish to speak for a minute about reforms for small business in \nAmerica. There were many different reasons expressed by Members of \nCongress about why they began engaging in this very tough debate on \nhealth care. Many different issues brought us to the table. One of the \nissues that brought me to this table of reform and negotiation was the \ndesperate plight of small businesses in America that have nowhere to \nturn.\n  As my colleagues have said in their very excellent statements this \nmorning, the unpredictable and unsustainable and skyrocketing costs of \nhealth care to small business in America is damaging their ability to \ngrow, is participating in an uptick of bankruptcies, is diminishing \ntheir ability to hire people and create jobs at a time when our country \nneeds those jobs created, perhaps more than ever in the last 25 or 30 \nyears. Until we get health care right for small business, they cannot \nget job creation right for America. It is as simple as that.\n  So as difficult as this debate has been--and it has been very long, \nvery arduous, with lots of different views--one thing we must do, in \nthe final weeks and months of the debate, is get it right for small \nbusiness. I have heard from hundreds of small business owners as \nchairman of the Small Business Committee. My members have heard from \nhundreds. We have heard from thousands, through their representative \nassociations, from conservative associations, to moderate, to more \nliberal associations representing a broad stretch of small businesses \nin this country, saying this is their No. 1 issue.\n  Just this week, Barbara Biersmith, who owns Sylvan Learning Center in \nMonroe, LA, a small business owner--1 out of the 27 million that exist \nin the United States of America--and 27 million is a lot of people, a \nlot of businesses and employees. She is one. She is quoted in the \nMonroe News Star this week:\n\n       As a business owner, I have struggled in vain for more than \n     22 years to find a way to provide health insurance for my \n     employees.\n       Health insurance providers tell me I have too few employees \n     to make a group. Or they tell me that some of my employees \n     have preexisting conditions that excludes them from a group \n     and that would make the group too small.\n       The kind of highly educated, experienced people I prefer to \n     hire nearly always have preexisting conditions. Who doesn't \n     have a preexisting condition by the age 30?\n\n  Considering that being a woman of childbearing age is considered a \npreexisting condition, I think she is right. Who doesn't have one these \ndays based on the interpretation of these policies? She goes on to say:\n\n       Because my business can't provide good health benefits \n     effectively, I am restricted to hiring people who are covered \n     by their spouse's medical insurance.\n\n  This is something that is not talked about often. I know my colleague \nfrom Washington is waiting to speak. I will go through this as quickly \nas I can. I hear this over and over again when I am on the streets and \nin towns and communities back home and I don't hear it here. Let me say \nit. I have any number of people who come up to me and say: Senator, \nthank you for working hard on health care. I am a little concerned or \nconfused about what you all are doing but try to get it right because \nmy health care is through my spouse who works for the government or my \nhealth care is through my spouse who works for a big company, and if I \ndidn't have that health care, I wouldn't have any.\n  I was in a restaurant last week, and the gentlemen who owns it told \nme this: I couldn't be a small business owner but for my health care \nthat is covered through my spouse.\n  It is right to get the policy right so everybody can have access to \naffordable health care coverage.\n  She goes on to say:\n\n       I hope and pray our representatives and Senators soon pass \n     Federal legislation to help the really small businesses of \n     America.\n\n  Let me say I hope that help is on the way. If we can negotiate this \nbill, in terms of robust exchanges, subsidies for small businesses, \nparticularly these very small businesses of under 10 employees or 25 \nemployees, it would help. The situation Barbara is facing is not \nacceptable and must be corrected. But her situation is not unique, as I \nsaid. According to a report by the Small Business Majority, the health \ncare costs for small businesses are expected to increase from $156 \nbillion in 2009 to $2.4 trillion by 2018.\n  Before I put up the next chart, I need to repeat these numbers \nbecause they are dramatic. These are numbers published by the Small \nBusiness Majority's report, based on actual data. This is a bill that \nsmall business cannot pay. This is a bill they cannot pay. We must get \nthe costs moving in a different direction. It will take some time, but \nwe must get this chart going from up to down. That is why I have pushed \nevery day of this debate to focus on cost containment. Not only is it \nimportant for taxpayers and government, it is absolutely critical for \nsmall businesses to have more choices at lower costs.\n  This chart shows the graph in a different way. This shows the \ncumulative cost of health care benefits--the first one. This is \nindicating job loss, and 178,000 small business jobs will be lost in \n2018 due to the high cost of health care. That is up from 39,000. \nCompanies can't continue to hire if they have to pay higher premiums \nfor the employees they still have working for them.\n  Costs are high because of a broken insurance market where insurers, \nin order to satisfy their stockholders, put a greater focus on their \nbottom line. I understand that when you are in business, you need to \nmake a profit. I understand that is why you are in business. I have no \nproblem with people making profits--and significant ones--as long as \nthe rules are fair and as long as there is opportunity to keep our \nvalues in order. One of the values we have in America is people going \ninto business making a profit but making sure, if you are in the \nbusiness of insurance and delivering benefits, that is what you are \ndelivering to the people you are trying to serve. So we need some \nadjustments in those rules and regulations. That is what I think we are \ndoing in our reform bill.\n  More alarmingly, getting back to the statistics, according to some \nreports, including a recent New York Times article, the insurance \ncompanies are planning to raise rates even higher today in anticipation \nof our reform effort. This is very unsettling, and the\n\n[[Page S11449]]\n\nsooner we act the better I think we will be--to help reform this \nmarket, to bring some order to the framework. That would be extremely \nhelpful.\n  Lack of choice and competition is a problem, as I said. In Louisiana, \nour two top insurers maintain 74 percent of the market. In Alaska, I \nunderstand, there are two insurers maintaining 95 percent of the \nmarket. This is not real choice. It is not real competition. That is \nwhy the exchanges we have in most of the base bills, making them more \nrobust, making subsidies as generous as we can to encourage individuals \nto assume responsibility for their health care, as well as subsidizing \nsmall businesses to encourage them to get into these large pools, I \nbelieve--and many of us believe--that will help to drive down costs, as \nwe reform the private market.\n\n  To level the playing field for small businesses and to provide \nworking families with more choices at lower costs, the bill we will \nvote on in the Senate will have as robust an exchange system as \npossible. These exchanges will allow businesses and individuals to pool \nto give them the negotiating power and to spread risk.\n  We estimate today that small businesses pay retail, as the Senator \nfrom Virginia. Mr. Warner said. Everybody else pays wholesale. Small \nbusiness pays retail. The price of paying retail is a minimum of 18 \npercent more on premiums that they are paying. So we want to get that \nsavings. The exchanges will achieve that. The exchanges will also \nachieve lower administrative costs, so you don't have to hire a full-\ntime lawyer or accountant to navigate the wide variety--actually, there \nare limited choices today, but you will have more transparency, more \nrobust exchanges.\n  Finally, regardless of the level of benefit choices, there should be \na limit on how much individuals must spend out of pocket and a minimum \nstandard of care among all the plan levels. These are some of the \nprotections we are working on for small businesses, which will benefit \nindividuals as well.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for being on the floor this morning. I \nthink Senator Cantwell, the Senator from Washington, who is here to \ngive voice to this important part of the debate. Again, we have \nhundreds of Members of Congress. We all came to this debate carrying \nvarious issues and with greater concerns than others. One of my great \nconcerns has been, as we try to find a way to dig ourselves out of this \ngreat recession--some say the worst economic situation since the Great \nDepression--the only way we are going to do that is for businesses to \ncreate jobs. Right now, there is a big burden that they have been \ncarrying alone. They need help, support, and they need more tax \ncredits, more robust subsidies, and a more orderly private market \nframework that allows the insurance companies to be in business and to \nmake a profit but also allows small businesses to be able to afford \nquality coverage for American workers, so we can get back to being the \nmost productive workforce in the world.\n  I yield the floor for the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor to join my \ncolleagues to talk about the rising cost of health care on small \nbusinesses. I thank the chair of the Small Business Committee, Senator \nLandrieu, from Louisiana. She has been an outspoken and articulate \nadvocate for small business. She is constantly focusing on what we are \ngoing to do to help small businesses in America, and she wants to make \nsure any health care legislation that is passed out of the Senate \nfocuses on that. That is very important because we know that when we \ntalk about small businesses in this current environment, they are at a \ndisadvantage when it comes to our health care system. That is to say \nthey have long been the backbone of the American economy. Small \nbusinesses employ about 40 percent of our workforce. Even in a \ndownturn, the job creation we are going to see is going to come from \nsmall businesses. If we can address their concerns in health care \nreform about the rising cost of health care, then we are going to be \ndoing ourselves a favor because they are going to be able to grow more \njobs and grow the economy.\n\n  I applaud the Senator from Louisiana for her efforts and join with my \ncolleagues, Senators Warner, Udall, and Shaheen, in coming down here to \ndescribe why we think it is so important that we get health care reform \nand that we do something about this because we really do want to get \nour economy going, and we certainly want to control costs so that small \nbusinesses can grow jobs.\n  Why is this so important? We have seen a 120-percent increase in \npremiums over the last 10 years. That is to say, from 1999 to 2009, \ninsurance premiums have increased 120 percent--120 percent. What family \nin America can sustain the constant increase in insurance premiums \nevery year? The fact is, they cannot.\n  In my State, we have seen a sharp rise in those who are without \nhealth insurance because the premiums keep going up. More and more \nsmall businesses have to make choices between keeping employees on the \nrolls or cutting back on their health insurance. And they are making \nthose choices. It puts all of us at a disadvantage.\n  What should we be doing instead about the rising costs of premiums in \nhealth care? We should be doing something to bend the cost curve. You \nwill hear many of my colleagues, as you did this morning, talk about \nbending the cost curve and why it is so important. Right now, if we \nlook at what is happening with health insurance, as I said, it already \nincreased 120 percent over 10 years. The next 10-year period, it is \nsupposed to increase in the same way, double in cost, increase about \n7.9 to 8 percent a year. So that means if we do nothing, small \nbusinesses are going to continue to see this escalator of costs keep \ngoing up for, and that means they are going to employ fewer and fewer \npeople because they cannot afford the health care coverage.\n  We see that general inflation is about 2 percent, but this increase \nin premiums is about, as I said, 7 to 8 percent. Why are we seeing this \nhuge increase in the cost of premiums if general inflation is only \nabout 2 percent? This, in my opinion, is what the health care debate \nshould be about. This difference between general inflation and health \ncare cost increases should be the entire debate. What are we going to \ndo to drive down the costs so that health care costs are kept more in \npace with inflation?\n  Why are these statistics so important? The issue is that, according \nto the National Small Business Association, only 38 percent of small \nbusinesses provided health insurance last year. That is down 61 percent \nfrom 1993. So we are continuing to see that shrinkage in people \noffering coverage. Of those who do offer coverage, 72 percent say they \nare struggling to continue to offer coverage to their employees.\n  An MIT study shows that the cost of health care to small business \nwill more than double in the next 10 years, just as it has in the last \n10 years, and that small businesses pay up to 18 percent more than the \nsame coverage for larger firms. What that means is small businesses are \nbeing disadvantaged. They are being disadvantaged because they do not \nhave the same clout in the marketplace as a large employer to negotiate \nbenefits and drive down costs.\n  What do we want to do about that? What we want to do is give small \nbusinesses the same kind of negotiating power large companies have to \nnegotiate for benefits. In fact, health care reform and helping small \nbusinesses should be able to negotiate with insurance companies to \ndrive down the costs of their plans.\n  This is something that is already part of the underlying bill we \npassed out of the Finance Committee. I am sure that when we see \nlegislation coming to the Senate floor this Friday, we will see the \nsame kind of provision, at least with the basic health plan, a \nprovision I helped coauthor in the legislation that would allow States \nto negotiate on behalf of the uninsured, allowing those who are \nemployed in small businesses to help lower the costs. In our State, \nthis plan has driven costs down 30 to 40 percent lower than what those \nindividuals would be able to get in an individual market. That is \namazing, the fact that they have been able to pool together 40,000 to \n60,000 people, go to the marketplace, and say to insurance providers: \nIf you want access to our insurance business, you have to\n\n[[Page S11450]]\n\ngive us a discount. I call it the Costco model. I don't know how many \npeople here this morning understand the Costco model, but the Costco \nmodel is something where you buy in bulk and you make large purchases. \nYou should get a discount. That is what we are saying. We want to give \nsmall businesses the same kind of purchasing power large businesses \nhave so they can drive down costs. That is going to be a critical \ncomponent of this legislation, and this Senator, along with my \ncolleagues who are out on the floor today, is going to make sure that \nnegotiating power exists in a final bill for small business.\n  Second, we need to make sure we also have provider reform, that \nprovider payments reward not just volume but value. Right now in our \nhealth care delivery system, there is a lot of focus given to what I \nwould say is the quantity of health care that is delivered, the fee-\nfor-service system that basically ends up having insurers paying \nphysicians for the number of patients they have seen or the number of \ntests they have ordered but is not generated or focused on payment to a \nphysician based on the outcome of the patient. There are provider \nreforms in this legislation that will also help drive down the cost to \nsmall businesses because those providers will be focusing on what it \ntakes to deliver health care to those individuals.\n  Third, we need to have better transparency on drug pricing because \ntransparency of cost is something that will help us in negotiating, as \na government purchaser, better health care benefits. Right now, there \nis a lot of unknown about health care costs in drug pricing because \nmiddlemen basically negotiate discounts on behalf of their customers \nbut end up pocketing some of those benefits.\n  We want to make sure all three of these points are part of vital \nlegislation to help drive down the cost for small businesses.\n  I have many small businesses come into my office. I met with some in \nthe State of Washington. We are very proud of the diverse array of \ncompanies that exist in our State. A lot of people look at some of the \nmajor employers such as Boeing or Microsoft or, as I mentioned, Costco, \nStarbucks. Washington State is home to many entrepreneurs. There are \nmany great companies that may be the big companies of the future but \nare the small businesses today, and they need our help and assistance.\n  Two of those, Kent and Linda Davis, run a technology consulting firm \nand pay $1,500 per month for health insurance--$1,500 per month. They \njust learned that in 2010 their premiums will increase by another $300 \nper month. This is the third substantial increase they have had in a \nrow. They want to hire more employees, but they cannot because of the \ncost of health care.\n  Another successful entrepreneur who has come into my office, Gene \nOtto, is the owner of the San Francisco Street Bakery. You might think \nthe San Francisco Street Bakery is in San Francisco, but it is actually \nin Olympia, WA, and it employs 20 people. Over the past decade, the \nincreases in health insurance premiums have forced them to take \ndramatic reductions in the level of benefits and the number of \nemployees they can cover. This is a company that wants to grow. They \nwant to expand. They have great products and great services.\n  It is people such as the Davises and Gene Otto who are the economic \nengine of our economy. They are going to continue to depend on us to \nmake sure that in this legislation and in this legislative debate, we \nare going to do everything we can to help small businesses grow.\n  Small businesses cannot grow if health care costs are going to rise 8 \nto 10 percent a year. It will hamper the ability of those small \nbusinesses to meet the demands and challenges of their workforce and \nkeep them healthy, facing an economy that has been certainly challenged \nby this big downturn we have seen but that needs to go back to growth \nin the future. They want to be part of that. They want to be part of \nthat growth, and they want to be part of helping our economy recover. \nBut to do that, we are going to have to do something to control health \ncare costs.\n\n  I applaud my colleagues who I know share these same issues and \nconcerns: the Senator from Virginia, who has been very outspoken on the \nfact that we have to change our system to make sure we are bending the \ncost curve and focusing on driving down costs with provider reforms; my \ncolleague from Louisiana, who is focused on making sure small \nbusinesses have clout and access to small business negotiations that \nlarge companies have; my colleague Senator Shaheen, who also has been a \nbig supporter of making sure we have provider reform in the system; and \nSenator Udall, who comes from a State that knows health care costs are \na key component. If we want our economy to grow, we have to drive down \nhealth care costs.\n  Two of our former colleagues have been on the floor in the last few \nminutes--the Vice President of the United States and the Secretary of \nInterior. We are glad they have come up to Capitol Hill to continue \ndiscussions with us about how important this legislation is. I thank \nthem for that. I thank them for their service to our country and for \ntheir willingness to serve in the administration. We certainly miss \nthem in the Senate. But I think it emphasizes the urgency of the health \ncare legislation, that our economy is struggling, that we want it to \ngrow, that we think small businesses are going to be a key component of \nthat, but we have to give them negotiating power. We have to give them \nthe ability to negotiate with insurance plans to drive down the costs, \nand we have to do better at reforming the system so we can see that \ngrowth happen in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, will you please let me know when 8 \nminutes has elapsed?\n  I, too, see the Secretary of Interior on the floor, who formerly was \na Member of this body. We miss him. We are glad he is here. We are glad \nhe is taking care of the treasured landscapes of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/18/senate-section/article/S11450-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11450-S11456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, an unusual thing is about to happen \nhere: an actual debate is about to break out on the floor of the Senate \nabout health care. Sometimes we are talking past each other. My friends \non the other side talk about jobs and small business, so let me start \nthere.\n  The difference between the Democratic proposals for health care and \nthe Republicans is the Democrats start with a 2,000-page bill, more or \nless, with a government takeover, with more than $1 trillion in \nspending, with new taxes, higher premiums, and Medicare cuts, and we \ndon't believe they can spend that much more money without increasing \nthe debt--in other words, all going in the wrong direction.\n  We believe we ought to be reducing costs step by step, and the \nRepublican proposals say that step No. 1 should be small business \nhealth plans. They are saying they have an idea about small businesses, \nand we are saying the same thing.\n  In my few minutes today, I would like to show why our proposals are \nbetter than theirs. For example, Senator Enzi of Wyoming, who was \nchairman and is now the ranking Republican member of the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, has a small business health \nplan he has been trying to get this Senate to vote on for years. In \nfact, this plan came up before the Senate, and our Democratic friends \nblocked it. They like to say Republicans are the party of no; they are \nthe party of no because on May 11, 2006, they voted no to small \nbusiness health plans which would lower health care costs for thousands \nof employees in this country.\n  Let me be specific about that and why it is superior to the \nsuggestion that has been made in the Finance Committee bill, the 2,000-\npage bill which has come out of the Senate Finance Committee. In the \nEnzi plan, the Republican plan, we would allow small businesses to come \ntogether and pool their resources. What that means is, if I have a \nsmall business with 50 people and you have one with 100 people and you \nhave someone with open heart surgery, you cannot afford to keep paying \nfor health insurance anymore because that one employee's health care \ncosts make it impossible for you to do that or you have to lay people \noff or you\n\n[[Page S11451]]\n\nhave to reduce wages. That is what happens in the real world. What we \nare saying is, let's let small businesses come together, pool the \nresources, and offer insurance that way--spread the risk, in other \nwords.\n  What does the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office say the effect \nof that proposal would be on small businesses and their health care \ncosts?\n  This is what the CBO said: No. 1, enacting the Republican proposal--\nwhich we would hope would gain Democratic support--would extend more \ninsurance to at least 750,000 Americans who are employees of small \nbusinesses. That is No. 1, more people insured.\n  No. 2, it would lower the cost of insurance premiums, not raise them \nas this 2,000-page bill would--lower the cost of insurance premiums for \nthree out of four employees.\n  No. 3, it would reduce the cost of Medicaid, the government program \nfor low-income Americans, by $1.4 billion.\n  More people covered, lower premiums, and a lower cost--that is what \nthey mean by bending the curve. So if that is the proposal, why do the \nDemocrats not allow us to vote on it? You see, we believe these 2,000-\npage bills with higher premiums and higher taxes, with Medicare cuts--\nwe have these bills all over the place. Senator Reid, the distinguished \nmajority leader, has one in his office. He has been meeting secretly \nfor weeks with people--we don't even know who--writing a bill which may \nemerge as early as today. Then when we get it, we will all have to read \nit. I am sure we will find more premiums, more taxes, more Medicare \ncuts, probably additions to the debt, probably more transfers of cost \nto State governments.\n  We have Governors who are Democrats and Republicans saying: Please \ndon't do that to us. We are in the worst condition we have been in \nsince the Great Depression, and you are going to dump a lot of costs on \nus that we didn't volunteer to pay. We can't afford it. We have to \nbalance our budgets.\n  That is probably what is coming. What should we do instead? We said \nday after day on this floor that we should set a goal--reducing costs, \nthe cost of premiums, the cost of health care to the government--and we \nshould move step by step toward that goal.\n  We said step No. 1 should be small business health insurance plans. \nStep No. 2 should be to allow competition for insurance across State \nlines. That would reduce costs. Step No. 3 would be to reduce junk \nlawsuits against doctors, which some States have done, and which \neveryone agrees drives up costs, encourages defensive medicine, and \ncauses doctors to move out of rural areas so that pregnant women have \nto drive 60 or 80 miles to Memphis or halfway across Alaska to get \ntheir prenatal health care or check into hospitals for 3 weeks in a big \ncity so when they have their baby they will have a doctor available. \nThat is the effect of that.\n  Then health insurance exchanges so you can shop for cheaper health \ncare, then reducing waste, fraud, and abuse. The General Accounting \nOffice has said $1 out of $10 in the Medicaid Program, which the \nDemocratic proposals will expand, is wasted. It goes down the drain \nevery year--$32 billion.\n  If we really want to reform health care, why do we keep coming up \nwith these 2,000-page bills and trillion-dollar costs and higher \npremiums and higher taxes and Medicare cuts and additions to the debt \nat a time when we have 10 percent unemployment? What is that going to \ndo to small businesses? New taxes are going to create more jobs?\n  We have the Finance Committee bill with $900 billion of new taxes \nover 10 years when fully implemented. That is not going to create new \njobs. New taxes are passed on.\n  If you run a business with 40 people or 100 people or 150 people, and \nyou get a big new tax, what do you do? You layoff an employee, you \nreduce wages, you stop offering health care. You have to do that or you \ngo out of business. That is what happens.\n  We would like to see a debate. We think the way to reform health care \nis, instead of these 2,000-page bills, let's set a goal--reducing \ncosts. Let's go step by step in that direction to re-earn the trust of \nthe American people. Instead of talking in grand rhetoric about small \nbusinesses--they do have a plan embedded in the Finance Committee bill, \nbut it is typically different from the plan we have proposed. Instead \nof allowing small businesses to pool their resources in the way I \nsuggested so they, the small businesses, could be in control of their \nown health insurance, make decisions about it--no; the Democratic small \nbusiness plan would not allow small businesses to pool their resources. \nIt puts the government in charge of making decisions about what kind of \ninsurance the small businesses could purchase. That is really a debate \nwe ought to have.\n  As President Obama, correctly said earlier this year, the health care \ndebate is not just about health care. The health care debate, said the \nPresident--correctly, I would respectfully say--the health care debate \nis a proxy for the role of the Federal Government in American lives. So \nwould this debate about how to help small businesses be the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 8 minutes.\n  The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I would like to focus my remarks today on \nhealth care as many others have done. Actually, I am very glad to see \nthe debate today was focused on small businesses and the impact of what \nwe do on them.\n  I am surprised, however, to see those who are discussing the current \nlegislation that is before us are discussing it as something that will \nbenefit small businesses and will help to drive down the cost curve \nbecause, as remarkable as it may seem, this legislation that both the \nHouse and the Senate have had under consideration--hopefully what we \nwill now see in the near future as the final product that we will be \nable to review--will drive up the cost curve and increase the cost of \nhealth care, not only for small businesses but for everybody in \nAmerica.\n  If we ask most Americans what they want in health care reform, they \nwill tell us they want to stop the spiraling cost of health care \ninsurance. Yet the legislation we see does exactly the opposite. Over \nthe last few weeks I have come to this floor to discuss tax increases \nthat were contained in the health care legislation passed by the Senate \nFinance Committee, both in terms of the big picture and, more \nspecifically, in terms of what it means to middle-income Americans and \nto small businesses and to any American who wants to answer the \nquestion: How would this bill affect me and my family?\n  We have already heard the answer to that question in a number of \ndifferent contexts, but I think it bears repeating. Under the Senate \nFinance bill, if you have insurance, you get taxed. If you do not have \ninsurance, you get taxed. If you don't want to purchase insurance, you \nget taxed. If you have a job, you get taxed. If you need medical \ndevices, you get taxed. If you take prescription drugs, you get taxed. \nIf you have high out-of-pocket medical expenses, you get taxed.\n  The list goes on. The reason is this legislation will create new, \nbrandnew massive entitlement programs to the tune of what we do not \nclearly know yet but which will almost certainly be in the neighborhood \nof $2 trillion. It pays for them--or offsets the cost of those on the \nTreasury--by increasing taxes on the American people by hundreds of \nbillions of dollars and by cutting Medicare by hundreds of billions of \ndollars.\n  We still do not have the ``merged'' Senate bill before us to review \nand debate, but we do have the House-passed bill to review. There have \nbeen a number of rumors and discussions in the media about what kind of \nnew tax increases the Senate bill will have when it is finally \ndisclosed. In fact, we hear we may find out, as a country--the people \nof America may find out tonight what this bill that has been negotiated \nand created behind closed doors actually contains. I would like to take \na few minutes to review some of the provisions that we expect to be \nthere.\n  The House version of the health bill contains more than $752 billion \nof tax increases. Some of these tax increases are the same ones we have \nalready seen in the Finance Committee bill, such as the medical device \ntax, the $2,500 cap on flexible spending accounts, the prohibition on \nprepurchase health care accounts--FSAs and HRAs--and the doubling of \ntax penalties for those in emergency situations who must use a portion \nof their health savings account to pay for nonmedical bills.\n\n[[Page S11452]]\n\n  There are many other new tax increases in the House bill which we \nhave not seen in the Senate finance bill that we also need to review. \nFrom the beginning of this process the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee has stated his intention to use only health-related offsets \nto pay for health-related spending. If there is to be new health-\nrelated spending, that is definitely the right approach. We all know \nwhat a difficult circumstance our country faces today when it comes to \njobs. The current unemployment rate is 10.2 percent. The last thing we \nneed to do is to enact policies that would make it even tougher for \nU.S. companies, particularly small businesses, to create new jobs. But, \namazingly, the House bill contains more than $80 billion in tax \nincreases on domestic U.S. job-creating companies that have no \ninvolvement in the health care industry.\n  Not only do these provisions violate the idea that we should be \nstaying within the health care arena to find offsets on the health care \nbill, but these antijob tax increases are the last thing we need in \nthis fragile economy. The largest tax increase in the House bill would \nalso have a devastating effect on the job creators in our country, \nparticularly small businesses, that are the top job creators. This $460 \nbillion so-called ``millionaire surtax'' is bad policy for many \nreasons.\n  First, like the $80 billion tax increase on domestic companies that I \njust mentioned, this tax increase grabs hundreds of billions of dollars \nfrom outside the health care arena to pay for a massive expansion of a \nnew health care entitlement.\n  Second, although this provision is being billed as a tax increase on \nmillionaires, the Joint Tax Committee reports that one-third of the \nrevenue it will generate is not from individual income of millionaires \nbut from small businesses. As we know, many small businesses file their \ntaxes as individuals, and it would be these small businesses, the job \ncreators of our economy, that would be facing this new punitive surtax.\n  Third, although you would think we would have learned our lesson from \nthe alternative minimum tax, like the AMT, this new surtax would also \nnot be indexed for inflation. That means, over time, this would creep \nfurther and further down the income scale, and more and more small \nbusinesses and middle-income families would be suddenly hit by this \nsurtax.\n  Fourth, this surtax would not only apply to ordinary income, it also \napplies to capital gains and dividend income which are currently taxed \nat lower rates. The capital gains and dividend rates are currently 15 \npercent. If Congress doesn't act before next year, the rates will go \nback up to the pre-2003 levels of 20 percent for capital gains and up \nto a maximum of 39.6 percent for dividends.\n  The President has said he doesn't intend to extend the current lower \nrates for individuals making less than $200,000 a year or for families \nmaking less than $250,000 a year. But if we add in this new surtax in \nthe House bill, Americans above those thresholds who are currently \npaying a 15-percent capital gains tax rate would see their tax rate \njump to 25.4 percent in 2011, and those currently paying the 15 percent \ndividends rate would see their rates jump to 45 percent by 2011.\n  Such a tax increase would violate yet another one of President \nObama's tax pledges to the American people. Most of us are very \nfamiliar with his promise.\n  Most of us are familiar with his promise that no individual making \nless than $200,000 a year or a family making less than $250,000 a year \nwould see any increase in their taxes. In fact, in his words, ``not by \none dime''--not an increase of their income tax, their payroll tax, \ntheir capital gains tax. In his words, not any of their taxes. Yet we \nsee hundreds of billions of dollars of these taxes falling squarely on \nthe middle class. In a speech in Dover, NH, on September 12, 2008, \nPresident Obama said:\n\n       Everyone in America--everyone--will pay lower taxes than \n     they would under the rates Bill Clinton had in the 1990s.\n\n  This surtax clearly breaks that promise to millions of additional \nAmericans.\n  Recent press reports have suggested that, in a need for even more tax \nrevenue to pay for all of the new spending in the Senate, the Senate \nleader may include an increase and an expansion of the Medicare payroll \ntax. The Medicare payroll tax is funded by a 2.9-percent payroll tax \nlevied on every dollar earned by employees. Half of this tax is paid by \nthe employee and the other half by the employer, although in reality, \nthe entire burden falls on the employee because the tax is taken from \nthe employee's available wages. Revenue from this tax goes into the \nMedicare trust fund and is intended to be used for Medicare expenses \nwhen that individual enters retirement. Under this new plan, Senate \nDemocrats are considering applying this Medicare tax to capital gains, \ndividends, interest, royalties, and partnerships for American families \nearning more than $250,000. None of this income is currently subject to \nthe Medicare payroll tax.\n  In addition, Democrats are said to be contemplating raising the \nemployee's share of this tax, currently 1.45 percent of wages, to 1.95 \npercent. Press reports indicate this would raise up to 40 or 50 billion \nnew dollars in revenue. This proposal would make a bad bill even worse. \nIt would fundamentally change the way Medicare financing occurs. By \napplying what has traditionally been a payroll tax to nonpayroll income \nand by using this money for a new non-Medicare entitlement, it breaks \nthe link between the Medicare tax base and Medicare benefits. As the \nWall Street Journal pointed out, this new tax would ``sever the link \nbetween the tax paid over a lifetime and the medical benefits received, \nofficially making Medicare an income redistribution program.''\n  It would additionally hurt growth. These additional taxes on savings \nand investment act as disincentives for these activities which are the \nprimary drivers of wealth creation. It would kill jobs. Imposing these \nnew taxes would hurt small businesses. Because many small businesses \npay their taxes at the individual level, imposing higher individual \nincome taxes hurts these engines of job creation.\n  Finally, it doesn't fully finance health care shortfalls. According \nto Bloomberg, House Democrats rejected this proposal, now being \nconsidered by the Senate, ``because lawmakers concluded they may need \nto increase the payroll tax in the future to pay Medicare benefits that \nare projected to outpace revenue.'' The New York Times pointed out that \n``the higher payroll tax would not be sufficient in the long run [to \neven protect Medicare].''\n  In closing, for all the talk about this need to rush the bill through \nso we can achieve the objective the American people seek in health care \nreform, the bill does not reduce the cost of medical care. It increases \nit. The bill does not reduce the cost curve for health care insurance. \nIt increases it. And in accomplishing this, it also increases taxes \nacross the board on Americans and cuts Medicare by deep rates that will \ncause Medicare to face insolvency even earlier than it otherwise would \nhave.\n  For all these reasons, we need to slow down and start working \ntogether, step by step, to remember the original objective; that is, to \nbend the cost curve down and stop these spiraling increases in health \ncare insurance that Americans are facing and that are driving American \nfamilies to the edge.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, from media reports, certainly not because \nMembers on this side of the aisle have been told about it, I understand \nthe majority leader is now corralling the final three Democrats, which \nI am sure he will succeed in doing, in order to secure 60 votes to move \nforward with the greatest takeover of the private sector in health care \nby legislation perhaps in the history of this country. Of course, I \nwould not know that myself, nor would any Member on this side of the \naisle, because of the fact that there is no communication between the \nmajority leader and Republicans. I understand they have 60 votes. I \nunderstand they will get 60 votes. I understand that they may likely be \nable to railroad this through the Senate. Then, again, they will gather \nin a small room, and they will come out with significant changes and \nrevisions in the form of a conference report.\n  I have been having townhall meetings around my State of Arizona, the\n\n[[Page S11453]]\n\nsecond hardest-hit State in America because of the economic downturn. I \nassure my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, there is a \nrevolution going on out there. It is a peaceful revolution. They do not \nwant increased costs of a reform commitment that would be up to $3 \ntrillion, that would cut Medicare by $500 billion and tax Americans \nacross the entire income spectrum by an additional $500 billion. My \nfriends across the aisle may not have gotten the message from the \nelections in New Jersey and Virginia not that long ago. Americans want \ncost control, and they want affordable and available health care. They \ndon't want increases in taxes. They don't want the government taking \nover the health care system. Yet that is what is going to be delivered.\n  A lot of people, may I say, may not trust the word of some of us on \nthis side of the aisle and may think we are uninformed or we are just \npoliticians. Maybe we ought to listen to Dr. Jeffrey Flier, dean of the \nHarvard Medical School. I have never been that great of an admirer of \nHarvard, but the dean of the Harvard Medical School states in today's \nWall Street Journal, entitled ``Health Debate Deserves a Failing \nGrade''--and he has some criticism for this side of the aisle that \nperhaps is deserved--\n\n       As the dean of the Harvard Medical School, I am frequently \n     asked to comment on the health-reform debate. I'd give it a \n     failing grade.\n       Instead of forthrightly dealing with the fundamental \n     problems, discussion is dominated by rival factions \n     struggling to enact or defeat President Barack Obama's \n     agenda. The rhetoric on both sides is exaggerated and often \n     deceptive. Those of us for whom the central issue is health--\n     not politics--have been left in the lurch. And as the \n     controversy heads towards a conclusion in Washington, it \n     appears that the people who favor the legislation are engaged \n     in collective denial.\n       Our health-care system suffers from problems of cost, \n     access and quality, and needs major reform. Tax policy drives \n     employment-based insurance; this begets overinsurance and \n     drives costs upward while creating inequities for the \n     unemployed and self-employed. A regulatory morass limits \n     innovation. And deep flaws in Medicare and Medicaid drive \n     spending without optimizing care.\n\n  During the last campaign, I proposed addressing the issue of \nemployer-provided health benefits, doing away with it in return for a \n$5,000 refundable tax credit. Tens of millions of dollars in attack ads \nwere leveled against it. I proposed it not because it was easy, not \nbecause I didn't think the American people didn't need straight talk. I \ndid it because it is one of the fundamental problems with the cost of \nhealth care in America. If someone gets something for free, they are \nnot going to be careful about the money that is spent.\n  Ronald Reagan once said: Nobody ever washed a rental car. He is \nright. So when people receive free medical care that they don't have to \npay for and that they don't have to have accountability for, it is \nobvious that that is misused.\n  Again, there is the story this morning about some $49 billion in \nwasteful spending in Medicare. The numbers go on and on.\n  Why is it that the dean of the Harvard Medical School says ``the \nrhetoric on both sides is exaggerated and often deceptive''? Maybe it \nis. But the rhetoric on both sides becomes more intense because of a \nfailure to sit down and try to work something out together. At no time \nduring this entire, long, drawn-out process have there been serious \nnegotiations between Republicans and Democrats. Not once. Of course, \nthe rhetoric gets exaggerated on both sides and even deceptive. We are \nnot doing what the American people expect us to do, and that is sit \ndown together and work these things out on one of the greatest \nfinancial crises this Nation faces.\n  Dr. Flier goes on to say:\n\n       Speeches and news reports can lead you to believe that \n     proposed congressional legislation would tackle the \n     problems of cost, access and quality. But that's not true. \n     The various bills do deal with access by expanding \n     Medicaid and mandating subsidized insurance at substantial \n     cost--and thus addresses an important social goal. \n     However, there are no provisions to substantively control \n     the growth of costs or raise the quality of care. So the \n     overall effort will fail to qualify as reform.\n\n  Dr. Flier is alleging that there is no control of the growth of costs \nor rise in the quality of care. We all know that the cost of health \ncare is unsustainable. The Medicare trustees have said in 7 years it \nwill go broke. I believe forcing more Americans into Medicaid, a public \nprogram that gets failing grades for access to care and the quality of \ncare, is not the right approach to covering millions more Americans.\n  Dean Flier goes on:\n\n       In discussions with dozens of health-care leaders and \n     economists, I find near unanimity of opinion that, whatever \n     its shape, the final legislation that will emerge from \n     Congress will markedly accelerate national health-care \n     spending rather than restrain it.\n\n  The whole problem with health care in America is not the quality of \nhealth care, it is the accessibility and affordability. Dr. Flier says \n``the final legislation that will emerge will markedly accelerate \nnational health care spending rather than restrain it.''\n  Dr. Flier continues:\n\n       Likewise, nearly all agree that the legislation would do \n     little or nothing to improve quality or change health-care's \n     dysfunctional delivery system.\n\n  This isn't just Dr. Flier's opinion. Look at Samuelson's article the \nother day about the effects of what has been passed by the House and \nwill apparently be before us. Democrats are proposing a $3 trillion \nexpansion of government health care, including $1 trillion in Medicare \ncuts and tax increases. But experts tell us the legislation would do \nlittle or nothing to improve quality or change health care's \ndysfunctional delivery system. Senate committees have spent months \nwriting bills and spinning the benefits of legislation, and experts \ntell us the efforts fail the basic test.\n  On March 5 of this year, the President is quoted as saying:\n\n       If people think we can simply take everybody who's not \n     insured and load them up in a system where costs are out of \n     control, it is not going to happen. We will run out of money. \n     The federal government will be bankrupt; state governments \n     will be bankrupt.\n\n  The President is right. But the Democratic leadership writing these \nbills is not listening. Partisan reform designed behind closed doors \nwill bankrupt this country, in effect committing generational theft. \nThe majority leader continues to put his bill together in a secret \ncommittee of one with a deaf ear to what experts tell us is needed. And \nwe wait. We wait with great anticipation to see how high taxes and fees \nwill be increased. We wait with great anticipation to finally \nunderstand how Senate Democrats will force a government health \ninsurance entitlement into our health care market. We will wait to see \nhow much they will cut Medicare. And these are Medicare cuts, my \nfriends, have no doubt about it. We will wait to see the new mandates \non individuals and employers to buy government-designed insurance.\n\n  We already know that the Senate Finance Committee bill includes \nroughly $508 billion in new taxes on individuals and businesses.\n  Beginning in January of 2010, health insurers would also be required \nto pay annual nondeductible fees totaling $60.4 billion over 10 years.\n  Beginning in January of 2010, medical device manufacturers are \nrequired to pay $40 billion in new nondeductible fees.\n  Beginning in January 2010, prescription drug manufacturers are \nrequired to pay $22 billion in new nondeductible fees.\n  By the way, in case my colleagues missed it, surprise, surprise, the \npharmaceutical industry has now dramatically increased their prices, \nwhile the cost of living has gone down. What a shocker. Those great \npeople from the pharmaceutical lobby who have been willing to make such \n``sacrifices'' for the American people are raising their prices in an \nunprecedented fashion, totally disconnected to the absolutely \nnonexistent increase in the cost of living. And the administration \ncontinues to oppose drug reimportation from Canada, where seniors could \nget prescription drugs for about half of what it is now costing them.\n  Beginning in 2013, Democrats raise taxes by $201 billion by \nincreasing taxes by 40 percent on certain family health care plans with \nhigher coverage values, payable by insurance companies or employers.\n  Beginning in 2013, taxpayers who deduct medical expenses on their tax \nreturns will pay $15 billion more in taxes.\n\n[[Page S11454]]\n\n  Taxes on individuals who fail to maintain government-approved health \ninsurance coverage will pay $4 billion in new penalties, breaking \nPresident Obama's promise that no one with income under $250,000 would \npay higher taxes.\n  Businesses that are struggling to keep the doors open and keep \nworkers employed in this recession will see higher taxes of $23 billion \nin the form of mandates and penalties for failing to offer government-\napproved health insurance.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to read the article in the New York Post \nentitled ``Obamacare: Buy now, pay later'' by the well-respected \neconomist Robert Samuelson. He writes:\n\n       There is an air of absurdity to what is mistakenly called \n     ``health-care reform.'' Everyone knows that the United States \n     faces massive governmental budget deficits as far as \n     calculators can project, driven heavily by an aging \n     population and uncontrolled health costs. As we recover \n     slowly from a devastating recession, it's widely agreed that, \n     though deficits should not be cut abruptly (lest the economy \n     resume its slump), a prudent society would embark on long-\n     term policies to control health costs, reduce government \n     spending and curb massive future deficits. The administration \n     estimates these (deficits) at $9 trillion from 2010 to 2019. \n     The president and all his top economic advisers proclaim the \n     same cautionary message.\n       So what do they do? Just the opposite. Their far-reaching \n     overhaul of the health-care system--which Congress is halfway \n     toward enacting--would almost certainly make matters worse. \n     It would create new, open-ended medical entitlements that \n     threaten higher deficits and would do little to suppress \n     surging health costs. The disconnect between what President \n     Obama says and what he's doing is so glaring that most people \n     could not abide it. The president, his advisers and allies \n     have no trouble. But reconciling blatantly contradictory \n     objectives requires them to engage in willful self-deception, \n     public dishonesty, or both.\n\n  Those are not my comments, Mr. President. Those are the comments of \nRobert Samuelson, one of the most respected economists in America.\n  I want to take another minute to talk about how the influence of \nspecial interests--I mentioned the pharmaceutical companies and the \ndeal they cut so the administration would oppose drug importation from \nCanada, that there would not be competition for Medicare patients. But \nlet me talk about probably the most powerful force in this whole \ndiscussion of legislation, and that is the trial lawyers of America.\n  There is no provision for medical liability or medical malpractice \nreform in this legislation. In fact, it was passed by the House that if \nStates have enacted reforms, they will not be eligible for any \nadditional funding to try and fund demonstration projects to reduce the \ncost of medical malpractice.\n  Everybody knows, ask any physician, they will tell you, they practice \ndefensive medicine. They do so because of their fear of finding \nthemselves in court and being wiped out. Sometimes these additional \nprocedures and tests are not so comfortable for the patient, but, most \nimportantly, they dramatically increase costs. Time after time after \ntime, any effort we have made to put in medical malpractice reform--and \nwe will do it again when the majority leader gives birth to whatever \nyou want to call this--then, the fact is, they are not seriously \ninterested in reducing costs, but they are seriously dependent on the \nlargesse and generosity of the trial lawyers of America, and it is an \noutrage. It is an absolute outrage.\n  I would point out, when the President talks about, ``demonstration \nprojects,'' there is a demonstration; it is called Texas. The State of \nTexas was hemorrhaging doctors and physicians and medical care \npractitioners. They reformed the medical malpractice. There have now \nbeen reductions in premiums. There have been reductions in lawsuits. \nThere have been doctors and physicians and medical care providers \nflowing back into the State of Texas. It is proven. It is not \neverything we want. But it shows that medical malpractice reform can \nreduce health care costs.\n  And what have my friends on the other side and a couple on this side \ndone? They have refused to consider in any significant way what \neveryone agrees could reduce health care costs in America. Outrageous. \nSo do not be surprised when our approval rating is 18 percent. The \napproval rating of Congress: 18 percent. And in the townhall meetings I \nhave been having, I have not met anybody in that 18 percent.\n  We need truth and honesty in our national discussion on health care \nreform, not spin, not budget gimmicks, not cuts to Medicare, not higher \ntaxes, not government takeover, and not trillions in new health care \nspending.\n  We have $12 trillion in debt, 10 percent unemployment--17 percent \nreal unemployment in my State--and an economy that is still struggling. \nMeanwhile, Wall Street makes obscene profits and bonuses that are \nunbelievable. We cannot afford another $3 trillion open-ended health \nentitlement. Americans deserve an honest discussion of ideas without \nartificial deadlines, and real solutions that will bring our \nskyrocketing health care costs under control.\n  Finally, I guess we are told that maybe this evening there may be \nsomething that will emerge with white smoke from the majority leader's \noffice and we will be given the manifesto that he will call health care \nreform, and that will begin a great debate. I believe the question will \nbe: Will the special interests and the big spenders and those who are \nin favor of government control of health care in America win or will \nthe American people win?\n  That is why the American people are aroused. If they stay aroused, \nand if we continue to see the tea parties and the townhall meetings and \nthe expressions of anger and frustration the American people feel, we \nwill beat this back and we will go back to the bargaining table--for \nthe first time we will go to the bargaining table and sit down, \nRepublicans and Democrats, together.\n  History shows there has been no successful reform in America without \nbipartisanship, and I do not believe this will be the first one. I \nhope--I hope and pray--it will not be.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, one of the hallmarks of the Democrats' \nhealth care bill is that it spends a tremendous amount of money--more \nthan $1 trillion. When the true 10 year costs are reflected, it is \nactually well over $2 trillion. That is a hefty price tag, and most \nAmericans want to know who is going to pay for this.\n  Contrary to what Democrats want you to believe, this bill will be \npaid for by all Americans, including low- and middle-income families \nand small business owners. So for the next week, I want taxpayers as \nthey go about their daily activities to take a moment to understand why \nthey will be paying a new tax for each day of their hardworking week.\n  Monday is not usually a favored day for most folks during the week--\nand if this health care reform passes, it will be absolutely a \nmiserable day for families making less than $200,000 a year. That is \nbecause 91 percent of you will start the week off by paying a $200 \nbillion tax on health insurance.\n  I have talked about this before at length, this so-called tax on \n``Cadillac'' plans. It is actually a 40-percent tax on high-cost \npremium ``Cadillac'' plans. But the people who are going to pay for \nthese plans and for this tax are more likely driving minivans, used \ncars, and cars that are paid off. That is because it disproportionately \nimpacts middle-income families.\n  That is new tax No. 1. But there are more.\n  The 40-percent insurance plan tax is what I just talked about. But \nall told, there are seven new taxes in this health care bill, and maybe \nmore to come. These new taxes, as shown on this chart, fall on some \npeople directly and on others indirectly. The nonpartisan Joint Tax \nCommittee testified that these new taxes--however they are named--will \nact as excise taxes and will be passed on to consumers to some extent.\n  So, on Tuesday, as your kids are getting ready to get off for school, \ndo not forget that you will be paying higher taxes on insurance \npremiums because of a new tax on insurance companies. It is the \ninsurance tax. I want to quote a letter the Joint Tax Committee wrote. \nRemember, this is the nonpartisan Joint Tax Committee. They wrote to me \nin response to my concern over this debilitating tax. I quote:\n\n       An insurer offering a family health plan that exceeds the \n     excise tax threshold and is subject to the excise tax faces \n     an increase in the cost of offering that health coverage. \n     Generally, we expect the insurer to pass along the cost of \n     the excise tax to consumers by increasing the price of health \n     coverage.\n\n\n[[Page S11455]]\n\n\n  So Tuesday is not a great day either in this new week of taxes.\n  On Wednesday, our small businesses--the engine of our economy--will \nbe taxed if they do not offer health insurance. That is the employer \ntax, tax No. 3. The employer tax will hit small businesses and make it \nmore expensive to hire workers. I do not think that is a good idea when \nthe Nation is facing an over 10-percent unemployment rate. Those who \nare hired will see their wages reduced because of the required employer \n``responsibility'' payments. That is what they are called.\n  The Congressional Budget Office--which again is a nonpartisan \nentity--has explicitly stated:\n\n       Although the surcharges would be imposed on the firms, \n     workers in those firms would ultimately bear the burden of \n     those fees. . . .\n\n  The tax credit to small businesses does little to help because it \nonly helps firms with 25 employees or less, and it is temporary. Also, \nthis tax credit drops off so suddenly for firms with more than 10 \nemployees that some firms will be penalized--actually penalized--for \nadding jobs or raising workers' pay--clearly, a perverse incentive.\n  So Wednesday is clearly not a good day for small businesses or their \nemployees, especially those making minimum wage. So I hope you didn't \nhave to call in sick on Thursday, because if you go to a doctor and get \na prescription, there is a new tax on the pharmaceutical companies that \nyou will pay. This is tax No. 4, the drug tax. Don't think about using \nyour health savings account or flexible spending account for the over-\nthe-counter medication you need as well. Under the House plan, \nnonprescription medications can no longer be purchased with moneys from \nthese accounts, and under the Senate plan, there is a $2,500 cap for \npretax dollars that can be used in these accounts. The weekend is so \nnear on Friday; but wait, if you need some lab work done, you will have \nto pay a new tax on clinical laboratories. This is the lab tax.\n\n  You think your work is over on Saturday, but you will still be paying \nmore taxes under this bill. If you need surgery, there is a new tax on \nmedical devices, such as pacemakers, prosthetics, and hearing aids. \nThis is No. 6. This raises the cost of health care. This is passed on \nto the consumers. All these taxes have one thing in common: They do \nraise the cost of health care for middle-income Americans.\n  My Democratic colleagues may claim they are raising taxes on health \ncare companies, not people, and people will be better off once all this \ntax money is collected in Washington and then used as subsidies. The \ntruth is, the people are paying and many are in the middle class who \nDemocrats claim would be spared. It is true some people may, on a net \nbasis, get more subsidy than they pay in higher taxes, but over 46 \nmillion middle-income families will pay more than they receive. In \nother words, their health care costs in the net are going to go up. \nThey lose under this health care bill and these are middle-income \nAmericans.\n  According to the analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice, from which I wish to quote now, these taxes:\n\n       Would increase costs for the affected firms, which would be \n     passed on to purchasers and would ultimately raise insurance \n     premiums by a corresponding amount.\n\n  So now it is Sunday, historically a day of rest but not for these new \ntaxes. There is one more tax that again falls squarely on lower and \nmiddle-income families, a penalty excise tax for failure to obtain \ninsurance. That is tax No. 7. We are faced with a bill where, according \nto the Congressional Budget Office, at least seventy-one percent of the \nindividual mandate penalties would fall on the backs of American \nfamilies making less than $120,000 a year. Remember what the President \nsaid: No new taxes on anybody making $250,000 a year or less. Actually, \nprobably over 90 percent of this tax will be paid by those on whom the \nPresident said not one dime in new taxes will be raised. Yet under this \nbill that is coming before the Senate, their taxes are raised and they \nare raised significantly.\n  Well, we have run out of days of the week, but the Democrats are not \nfinished yet. If you have been using pretax dollars in a flexible \nspending account, which most Federal employees have and a lot of other \npeople who are employed by other companies have as well, and you pay \nfor services not covered by your plan, such as speech therapy for a \nchild with autism, you are out of luck under this bill. As I said \nearlier, the Federal spending accounts are capped at $2,500 in this \nbill, so your income tax will rise as well as your medical expenses. If \nyou have been dealing with extraordinarily high medical expenses and \nhave been counting on qualified medical expenses tax deductions to pay \nfor care or tuition for a special needs school, again, you are out of \nluck. The itemized deduction bar will be raised from 7.5 percent to 10 \npercent of your income in this bill. In other words, this bill hurts \nthose who are being hit hardest by medical catastrophes.\n  In committee, my colleagues and I on the Republican side tried to \ninject some limits to this tax mania. We offered an amendment to carve \nout lower and middle-income families from paying taxes. I offered an \namendment to protect the middle class, specifically, from the onerous \npenalty excise tax for those who fail to obtain insurance. \nUnfortunately, on party-line votes, the Democrats voted down those \namendments.\n  I offered an amendment to eliminate the growing threat that the 40-\npercent insurance tax posed to every American with insurance, but, once \nagain, the majority voted it down. We offered amendments to strike some \nof these specific, heavy-handed new taxes, but, once again, the \nmajority, on party lines, voted them down. We tried to apply \nlimitations so these taxes would not go into effect if they caused \nconsumer costs to rise. The majority, again, voted them down. We tried \nto prevent these new taxes from hurting veterans, but as Democrats \nfirst accepted it, they then passed a second amendment to eliminate the \nprotections. We tried to ensure that vulnerable Americans would not be \nhit with a tax increase on catastrophic medical costs. Again, the \nDemocrat majority in committee voted it down. After losing every \nattempt to remove these new, onerous taxes, we tried to preserve the \nability of Americans to continue to use their flexible spending \naccounts. Once again, that was voted down by the majority.\n  There are at least seven brand new taxes in this bill--one, two, \nthree, four, five, six, seven new taxes--with more taxes being \ndiscussed. Before the final bill is completed, I am sure there will be \nmore taxes in this bill. The House bill has a surcharge on small \nbusinesses. They are also talking about adding a value-added tax, which \nwould be a regressive national sales tax on everyone, and a new \nwindfall profits tax on insurance companies. There is even talk of a \ntax on soda pop. All these taxes do is cost Americans more money \nwithout giving them much in return. Even if the spending in this bill \nwas worthwhile, these sweeping and unreasonable taxes would more than \noutweigh the benefits.\n  It is very clear America's lower and middle classes will bear the \nbrunt of these new taxes. On top of that, they will not be allowed to \nkeep the insurance plans they have. Instead, they will be forced into a \nnew experimental system that will succeed only in exploding our deficit \nspending for generations to come.\n  So where is the break for hard-working families, we have to ask. \nUnder this plan, they pay for government-run insurance to cover more \nAmericans. They lose their own insurance--many of them--along the way, \nand they watch as deficits continue to eclipse their children's \nfutures. That is not even close to the American way.\n  On behalf of millions of American workers, families, and small \nbusinesses that sent us to Washington to be their voice, I cannot stand \nby and watch the majority destroy our chance for meaningful health care \nreform that does not bankrupt our Nation. I am going to do everything \nin my power to stop these new taxes from becoming reality. I am \nconfident, with the American people behind us, we can stop these new \ntaxes. We can start over, in a bipartisan way, and go step by step and \ncome up with health insurance reform that controls costs, preserves and \neven improves quality, and doesn't end up with a government-run health \ncare system that cuts over $500 billion in Medicare and raises $500 \nbillion in new taxes.\n\n[[Page S11456]]\n\n  I urge our colleagues to work together--not as Republicans and \nDemocrats but as Americans--so we can preserve the quality of health \ncare we have enjoyed in this country for so long but do it in a way \nthat is more affordable and provides more access to more Americans.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this week, New Mexicans of all \npolitical persuasions have been recalling the life of a legendary \nfigure of our State, Bruce King, who served as Governor during three \ndifferent decades and who taught by example that public service is an \nhonorable calling.\n  Governor King died last Friday at the age of 85. He used to tell the \nstory about a former Governor who was the graduation speaker at Bruce's \nhigh school graduation. The former Governor looked at the very small \nclass of teenagers and said:\n\n       One of you could grow up to be governor of this state.\n\n  Bruce looked around at his other classmates and figured that the \nGovernor had to be speaking to him. Sure enough, in the course of time, \nand after serving as Santa Fe County commissioner, a State legislator, \nand speaker of the house in New Mexico, he was, in fact, elected \nGovernor. In fact, he served as Governor for 12 years, longer than \nanyone else in the history of New Mexico.\n  In all of those years, he never failed to make the people of New \nMexico his first priority. With him at every step of the way, from \ntheir ranch in Stanley to Santa Fe and back again, was the remarkable \nAlice Martin King, his wife. She was a great force in her own right. \nShe was a champion for children in our State. She died last December.\n  My own history with Bruce King began when I was just out of law \nschool. I was serving then as an assistant attorney general in New \nMexico and was assigned the job of being counsel to the constitutional \nconvention which our State had in 1969. Bruce, who was then speaker of \nthe house, was elected president of that convention. I learned a great \ndeal about the legislative process and about New Mexico history and \nabout our State in general as a result of the effort to work with Bruce \nin that capacity. His management of the process and the people involved \nwith the constitutional convention was masterful. He was always \ninclusive, he was always listening, and he was always working to get \nthe best result. In short, he was the model of a legislative manager.\n  Today I recall being privileged to serve as attorney general during \nBruce's second term as Governor, from 1979 to 1982. We worked closely \ntogether on a number of issues. I was impressed all over again at his \nknowledge of New Mexico and his genuine love for its citizens. He was \ngregarious and kind. He never knew a stranger. He shook hands with \neveryone in our State. He shook every hand in our State, whether there \nwas a voter attached to it or not. People were delighted to see Bruce \ncoming and to hear his famous reply when asked: How are you doing, \nGovernor? He would reply: Mighty fine--regardless of how difficult the \ncircumstances the State and he were facing.\n  Our friendship extended for 40-plus years. With my fellow New \nMexicans, I will miss him greatly. His sons Bill and Gary, his brothers \nDon and Sam, and the entire King family have lost tremendously. Every \nNew Mexican feels this loss and joins his family in honoring his life.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise to celebrate the life \nand mourn the passing of one of New Mexico's great public servants. \nThis past Friday Bruce King, the three-time Governor of New Mexico and \na constant advocate for regular folks, for the average person, left \nthis world after 85 years of devotion to his family, to his community, \nand to his State.\n  Bruce King was a self-made man who came from modest roots. Back in \n1918, his parents traveled to New Mexico from Texas and traded their \nModel T for a homestead tract where they raised Bruce and his siblings. \nAlong the way the elder Kings instilled in their children an \nappreciation for a hard day's work, a compassion for people, and a love \nof public service.\n  Bruce carried those lessons into adulthood and into a life defined by \npublic service. He served in the Army in World War II, as a Santa Fe \nCounty commissioner, as a member of the New Mexico House of \nRepresentatives and later speaker of that same House of Representatives \nand, finally, as a three-term Governor elected in 1970, 1978, and then, \nonce more, in 1990.\n  Bruce's legacy as Governor will be felt for generations. Due in no \nsmall part to the advocacy of his devoted wife Alice, Governor King \ncreated a new cabinet level department focused on the welfare of New \nMexico's children. We called it the Children, Youth and Families \nDepartment. Thanks to Bruce and Alice's vision, more New Mexico \nchildren are safe and secure. More are healthy and ready to learn, and \nmore have the support they need to follow their dreams. Governor King's \ncontributions didn't end there. His leadership was instrumental to the \ncreation of New Mexico's large and enduring rainy day funds which to \nthis day continue to provide substantial support for education. He \nreformed New Mexico's school funding formula so that money is equally \ndistributed across the State. Thanks to Governor King, State education \nfunding now follows the student, regardless of income or geography. He \nalso was an advocate for aggressive economic development, recruiting a \nnew Intel plant to Rio Rancho, for the creation of a better, safer \nStatewide road system, and for the establishment of a new border \ncrossing with Mexico.\n  But despite all of these achievements, what New Mexicans will most \nremember Bruce for is something more simple and much harder to come by \nin politicians these days. Bruce was not in politics for the power, for \nthe prestige. He was in politics because of the people. He loved the \npeople of New Mexico and the people of New Mexico--from Lordsburg to \nClayton to Shiprock and Carlsbad and everywhere in between--loved him \nright back. Bruce enjoyed nothing more than talking to New Mexicans. \nAlmost every morning you would find him doing just that at El Comedor \nRestaurant in Moriarty, NM. He had a booming voice and was famous for \ngreeting friends and strangers alike with a handshake and a down home \n``How y'all doing? Fine. Fine.''\n  I will always remember Bruce as a true cowboy from Stanley who had \nthe most generous spirit. He always saw the best in people. He always \ndid the right thing for New Mexico. My family was fortunate to call \nBruce and Alice our friends. Our daughter Amanda even went to work for \nAlice in her first job out of college. She stayed close with both of \nthem, ever since.\n  New Mexico will miss the Kings. We all know our State is a better \nplace for their service and dedication to its people. As Governor King \nis laid to rest this week, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring \nthis remarkable public servant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/18/senate-section/article/S11456-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11456-S11457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Madam President, when the Senate considers the \nnomination of David Hamilton to the Seventh Circuit U.S. Court of \nAppeals later this afternoon, I intend to vote no. Some may regard this \nas perhaps inconsistent with my vote yesterday when I joined with a \nnumber of my colleagues on this side of the aisle in voting for cloture \non the nomination. I certainly do not regard the two positions as \ninconsistent.\n  While I do not believe this nominee should be confirmed, I do believe \njudicial nominees deserve a straight up-or-down vote. I have come to \nthe Chamber today to explain my views on the Hamilton nomination and \nexpand upon why I voted as I did yesterday.\n  Our process for consideration of judicial nominees is broken. It has \nbeen broken since I came to the Senate in 2003. In fact, on April 30, \n2003, I was among 10 freshman Senators, bipartisan, who wrote our \nrespective leaders to say the confirmation process needed to be fixed. \nFor reasons I can't fathom, we still seem to be light-years away from a \nprocess in which a President's judicial nominees come to the floor \nexpeditiously for a straight up-or-down vote. This is a far cry from \nthe process I am told the Senate adhered to prior to 2001 when there \nexisted a strong presumption against the filibuster of judicial \nnominees. A cloture vote on a nomination was virtually unprecedented.\n  I understand all of that changed in February of 2001 when our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle decided they would engage in \nthe regular practice of blocking the confirmation of courts of appeals \nnominees with whom they had ideological disagreements through the use \nof the filibuster process.\n  Miguel Estrada, deemed ``well-qualified'' by a unanimous vote of the \nAmerican Bar Association, had to suffer through seven failed cloture \nvotes. This was in his bid to serve on the DC Circuit. Finally, he \ndecided to move on with his life.\n  Priscilla Owen, also a recipient of a unanimous ``well-qualified'' \nrating by the ABA, suffered through four failed cloture votes before \nultimately being confirmed to the Fifth Circuit.\n  David McKeague, a Sixth Circuit nominee, unanimously deemed ``well-\nqualified'' by the ABA was filibustered. I could go on.\n  In the 2003 letter, my cosigners and I noted that in some instances \nwhen a well-qualified nominee for the Federal bench is denied a vote, \nthe obstruction is justified on the ground of how prior nominees, \ntypically the nominees of a previous President, were treated.\n  Without doubt, a number of President Bush's nominees to the U.S. \ncourt of appeals were treated unfairly by this body. Off the top of my \nhead, I can probably count 11 nominees to the courts of appeals, each \nof whom was deemed qualified to serve by the American Bar Association \nraters, many ``well-qualified'' in that rating, who had to suffer the \nfilibuster.\n  It would not be my place to venture an opinion whether this entered \ninto the cloture debate yesterday. However, I wish to make clear this \nis not how I evaluate judges for confirmation. In voting to end debate \non the nomination of Judge Hamilton, I wanted to make the point that \nthe qualified nominees of a President to the Federal bench deserve a \nstraight up-or-down vote. This is what I believe the Constitution \nexpects of this body in most cases.\n  Having said that, I have substantial concerns about the elevation of \nJudge Hamilton. I have considered his record on the Federal district \ncourt in Indiana as well as criticisms of his record. I regard it as my \npersonal responsibility to consider these matters. My confirmation \nvotes reflect my personal judgment as to the qualifications of the \nnominee.\n  As a Senator and as a mother, I have grave concerns about Judge \nHamilton's judgment in recommending executive clemency for a 32-year-\nold police officer who was convicted of violating Federal child \npornography laws. The defendant pled guilty to Federal charges that he \nphotographed in one case and videotaped in the other sexual encounters \nwith two women, one age 16 and the other age 17. Although it may have \nbeen lawful for the defendant to engage in these encounters under the \nlaws of Indiana, it is not lawful to photograph them under the laws of \nthe United States.\n  Judge Hamilton went out of his way to argue that the 15-year \nmandatory minimum sentence imposed by Congress for such violations was \na miscarriage of justice in this case. He argued vociferously that \nexecutive clemency is warranted. This Senator does not understand why \nJudge Hamilton would choose this cause to champion. While I understand \nJudge Hamilton has imposed substantial sentences in other child \npornography cases, I do not agree with his reasoning in this matter and \ncannot, in good conscience, support his confirmation.\n  With that, Madam President, I appreciate the attention of the Chair. \nI yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  I rise this afternoon to speak about health care. We all have been \nconcentrating on this issue for many months, and we are now into a \nperiod of time when we will be getting a bill very soon to the floor. \nThat is our hope and our expectation.\n  One of the parts of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee bill that I voted on, as did the Presiding Officer this \nsummer back in July when we passed our bill out of committee, one of \nthe real priorities in that bill, and what I believe will continue to \nbe a priority in the final legislation before the Senate, is children \nand what happens to children as a result of health care reform. We have \na lot to be positive about in terms of legislation over the last decade \nor more as it relates to children, and I will speak about that.\n  In terms of that guiding principle, I have a very strong belief--and \nI think it is the belief of a lot of people in this Chamber and across \nthe country--that every child in America--every child in America--is \nborn with a light inside them. For some children, that light is limited \nby circumstances or their own personal limitations, but no matter what \nthat light is, we have to make sure the light for their potential burns \nas brightly as we can possibly ensure. For some children, of course, \nthat light is almost boundless. You almost can't measure it because the \nchild has advantages other children don't have or they have a family \ncircumstance that allows them to grow and to develop and, therefore, to \nlearn and to be very successful. But I believe every child in America \nis born with a light, and whatever the potential is for that child, we \nhave to make sure he or she realizes it. We have a direct role to play. \nThose of us who are legislators, those of us who are working on the \nhealth care bill have an obligation, I believe, to make sure that light \nshines ever brightly.\n  One of the other themes under this effort to expand health care for \nAmericans is to focus on children who happen to be either poor or who \nhave special needs. I believe the goal of this legislation, as it \nrelates to those children, those who are poor or children with special \nneeds, is four words: ``No child worse off.'' We need to ensure that a\n\n[[Page S11458]]\n\npoor child isn't worse off at the end of this debate and enactment of \nhealth care reform and that a child with special needs is not worse \noff. I think that is the least we should do when it comes to protecting \nour children.\n  There are at least two programs--one older than the other but both \nvery important--that relate to our children. The older of the two \nprograms is the Medicaid Program. It has been around for more than 40 \nyears now. Medicaid, as it pertains to children, is a program we have \ncome to rely upon to provide children with very good medical care, the \nbest medical care, in some ways, that a child can have. We have to make \nsure we pay attention to how Medicaid is treated in this bill. We will \ntalk a little bit more about that in a moment.\n  In Pennsylvania, the State I represent, we have a 15-year experiment \nwith the Children's Health Insurance Program or CHIP. The one thing we \nknow about CHIP is it works. It works very well for children. As we \nknow, in a general sense, the Children's Health Insurance Program is \nfor children of low- and middle-income families in America who can't \nget coverage from their employer, for one reason or another, and don't \nhave a family income that is low enough to qualify for Medicaid. So it \nfills a gap that had been there for years. We know, with regard to the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, today there are about 7.8 million \nchildren covered. That is wonderful. I am very proud and happy about \nthat, but we are even happier and more positive about the future \nbecause the reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program \nmeans that by 2013, 7.8 million children covered will rise to 14.1 \nmillion children. So an easy way to think about children's health \ninsurance is 14 and 13: 14 million kids covered in the year 2013. That \nis a tremendous achievement--historic in American history. We have \nnever had anything close to that, to have 14 million children covered \nin a good program such as CHIP.\n  The caveat to that is we still have millions--by some estimates 8 \nmillion--of children who will not be covered even in 2013. One of the \nreasons we are debating health care reform is to make sure we are doing \neverything possible to strengthen the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram and do not allow it to be weakened in any way.\n  One way to weaken it--and fortunately the Senate Finance Committee \ndid not do this in their final bill--is to take a stand-alone, \nsuccessful, effective Children's Health Insurance Program and put it in \nthe health insurance exchange. It may sound good--within one system--\nbut I believe, and many others believe, it would be very bad. The \nFinance Committee, led by Senator Rockefeller, worked very hard to make \nit possible to keep the Children's Health Insurance Program as a \nseparate stand-alone program. I believe we have to do that.\n  As we know, legislation passed recently in the House. The health care \nbill got through not just the committees but through the House itself. \nOne of the problems with the House bill is it would end the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program in 2013. We don't want to do that. We want to \nmake sure, in the Senate, we do it differently than the House did.\n  One component that is good about the House bill on this subject, \nhowever, is it does expand Medicaid. The House bill expands Medicaid \nfor children to 150 percent of poverty for all States, and States would \nget assistance in paying for this expanded population. But then there \nis another caveat in terms of what I think has to be improved upon in \nthe Senate. Children above 150 percent of poverty will go into a new \nexchange, which I think is, as I said before, the wrong way to go. We \nwant to make sure, if something such as that were to happen, they would \nhave cost-sharing protections and better benefits. Unfortunately, if \nthey go into that exchange, they would not. This could have a direct \nimpact on a State such as Pennsylvania. By one estimate, in \nPennsylvania alone, this means that nearly 100,000 children who \ncurrently have children's health insurance coverage would lose it \nbecause of that change. So we want to make sure we don't go in the \ndirection the House did as it relates to this issue of children's \nhealth insurance and the exchange--keeping it out of the exchange.\n  We do need to expand Medicaid for children and we need to maintain \nCHIP as a stand-alone program. What are some of the numbers here? We \nare talking about nationally, in the Medicaid Program, 30 million \nchildren enrolled in Medicaid. As I said before, enrolled in CHIP are \n7.8 million kids. Putting them together we have one-third of all \nchildren in America covered by those two programs. But as I said \nbefore, we still have plenty--millions and millions--of children who \nstill are not covered by either program.\n  We hear a lot of acronyms around here, but one important acronym for \nthis debate, as it relates to children and to health care, is EPSDT: \nearly pediatric screening diagnosis and treatment. The American Academy \nof Pediatrics has called EPSDT the ``gold standard'' for children's \nhealth care. This is essential that we keep that kind of standard in \nplace. That means Medicaid, for example, covers all medically necessary \ntreatment for children, including preventive care, primary care, \ndental, hearing, vision, and it goes down the list.\n  Unfortunately, sometimes people say: Well, under commercial coverage \nyou will get as much coverage for children of the same quality. \nUnfortunately, that is not true. There may be advantages to provider \nnetworks of commercial coverage for families who are wealthy enough, \nhave the means to afford it and who can get out of the network and pay \nfor something extra, but, of course, many families don't have that \nbenefit.\n  I wish to spend a couple moments on EPSDT. I will go to the first \nchart. The Commonwealth Fund and George Washington University did an \nexcellent comparison of the benefits between commercial insurance and \nMedicaid. The first benefit we have on this chart is called \ndevelopmental assessment. Some of these terms get a little long and \nthere is a lot of policy jargon. One of the most important things for \nany child, especially very young children, is to have regular and high-\nquality developmental assessments, so we can catch anything that might \nbe going wrong at an early enough age and give that child the benefit \nof early intervention and treatment in the dawn of their lives, in the \nearly months and years of their lives. We can see, under Medicaid, for \nexample, that this developmental assessment is covered. We can also see \nthat under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, there is a lot \nof verbiage there which I will not read, but suffice it to say it is \nlimited. It is not covered to the extent it is in Medicaid.\n\n  Another example is this phrase down here: ``Anticipatory guidance,'' \nanother fancy term of policy, but it is this simple: It is helping \nparents understand what they should be expecting from their child \nphysically, emotionally, and developmentally so they can get help, as I \nsaid before, early enough in the life of that child. This kind of \nguidance, again, is covered under Medicaid but not explicitly covered \nunder the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program, which, as a \nbeneficiary of that program, is a great health insurance program for \nFederal employees, but even something that significant, in terms of \ncoverage and quality, would not be, in my judgment, good enough for \npoor children who should be covered in terms of developmental and \nanticipatory guidance with their parents under Medicaid. So Medicaid is \nbetter for poor children than even something as significantly good as \nthe Federal employees plan.\n  Let me go to the next chart. I know we are getting close to our time \nand I will be observing that. This chart shows EPSDT as it relates to \nphysical, speech, and related therapies. We have heard horror stories \nfrom mothers of children with disabilities--either mild or severe. \nPhysical therapy, speech therapy, and occupational therapy, these are \nall critical to a child who may have a disability. Sometimes early \nintervention can help a child recover to normal functioning and \nsometimes it is a disability that persists throughout a child's life. \nUnder Medicaid, again, beyond the medically necessary threshold, basic \ntherapies, such as physical, speech, and occupational therapy, are \ncovered without limitation. I think it is vitally important we ensure \nthat under Medicaid we continue to fortify that program so our children \ncan get that kind of quality coverage.\n  Let me conclude with a couple thoughts, very briefly. No. 1 is, at \nthe\n\n[[Page S11459]]\n\nend of this process of getting a health care bill enacted, I believe we \nhave to live up to that basic standard of four words for poor kids: \n``No child worse off'' at the end of the road. Dr. Judith Palfrey, a \npediatrician, child advocate, and president-elect to the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics, spoke at one of our hearings earlier this year, \nand here is what she said:\n\n       Sometimes, we as child advocates find it hard to understand \n     why children's needs are such an afterthought and why, \n     because children are little, policymakers and insurers think \n     that it should take less effort and resources to provide them \n     with health care.\n\n  I think that challenges all of us to make sure children are not \nsecond-class citizens when it comes to health care reform and what we \ndo.\n  Let me conclude with this thought: As I said before about that bright \nlight inside every child who is born, we have to do everything possible \nto make sure that at the end of the road, at the end of this debate, \nand at the end of voting on this bill, we ensure that that light burns \never brightly, especially for children who happen to be poor or have \nspecial needs.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I understand that according to the \nunanimous consent agreement, I have the floor for a period of time now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/18/senate-section/article/S11459-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11459-S11465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GLOBAL WARMING\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, next month, thousands of U.N. delegates \nfrom over 190 nations, members of the press, and eco-activists from \naround the world will descend upon Copenhagen as a part of the U.N. \nConference on Global Warming. Yet, even before it begins, that U.N. \nconference is being called a disaster.\n  Just this morning, the Telegraph--a UK newspaper--noted:\n\n       The worst-kept secret in the world is finally out--the \n     climate change summit in Copenhagen is going to be little \n     more than a photo opportunity for world leaders.\n\n  Not too long ago, however, the Copenhagen meeting was hailed to be \nthe time when an international agreement with binding limits on carbon \ndioxide and other greenhouse gases would finally be agreed upon.\n  The eco-activists believed that with a Democratic President in the \nUnited States and a Democratically controlled House and a \nDemocratically controlled Senate, we would finally push through \nmandatory cap-and-trade legislation, and the United States would \nfinally be ready to succumb to the demands of the U.N. I say demands of \nthe United Nations because there are so many people in this Chamber who \nthink if something isn't multinational, U.N. or something else, it is \nnot good. You have to ask: Whatever happened to sovereignty in this \ncountry?\n  Not too long ago, the Copenhagen meeting was hailed as a time that \nall this would come to an end and they would be successful and pass in \nthis country the largest tax increase in history. In reality, it will \nbe a disaster. Failure comes at a high cost. Despite the millions of \ndollars spent by Al Gore, the Hollywood elite, the U.N., climate \nalarmists, it has failed.\n  Perhaps the Wall Street Journal said it best in an article entitled \n``Copenhagen's Collapse.'' I will read this because I think it is \nworthwhile:\n\n       The Climate Change Sequel is a Bust.\n\n  The editorial states:\n\n       ``Now is the time to confront this challenge once and for \n     all,'' President-elect Obama said of global warming last \n     November. ``Delay is no longer an option.'' It turns out that \n     delay really is an option--the only one that has worldwide \n     support. Over the weekend, Mr. Obama bowed to reality and \n     admitted that little of substance will come of the climate \n     change summit at Copenhagen next month. For the last year, \n     the President has been promising a binding international \n     carbon-regulation treaty a la the Kyoto Protocol.\n\n  We remember that.\n\n       But instead, negotiators from 192 countries now hope to \n     reach a preliminary agreement that they'll sign such a treaty \n     when they meet in Mexico City in 2010.\n\n  Wait a minute. That is 2010. That is next year. This year, it hasn't \neven come yet. This is Copenhagen 2009.\n  I am continuing to read:\n\n       The environmental lobby is blaming Copenhagen's preemptive \n     collapse on the Senate's failure to ram through a cap-and-\n     trade scheme like the House did in June, arguing that ``the \n     world'' won't make commitments until the United States does. \n     But there will always be one excuse or another, given that \n     developing countries like China and India will never be \n     masochistic enough to subject their economies to the West's \n     climate neuroses. Meanwhile, Europe has proved with Kyoto \n     that the only emissions quotas it will accept are those that \n     don't actually have to be met.\n\n  We say that because many of these Western European countries made \ncommitments for emissions and they have not met them.\n  During my position as chairman and ranking member of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee, since 2003, I have been the lead Senator \nstanding and exposing the science, the cost, and the hysteria about \nglobal warming alarmism. I will be traveling to Copenhagen leading what \nhas been called the truth squad, to say what I said 6 years ago in \nMilan, Italy. Let's keep in mind what these meetings are. The U.N.--\nthat is where this all started, with the IPCC at the U.N.--said that \nthe world is going to come to an end because of CO2 \nemissions. They started having these meetings, and they have had--I \ndon't know how many. They started in 1999, I think. They had the one in \nMilan, Italy, in 2003, the only one I went to. They were inviting all \nthe countries to come in and join this club, saying we are going to do \naway with CO2.\n  It is interesting that one of the participants I ran into in 2003 was \nfrom West Africa--and I remember this well because I knew this guy knew \nbetter. I said: What are you here supporting this for? He said: This is \nthe biggest party of the year. We have 190 countries coming in, and it \nis a big party. It is all you can eat and drink. So anyway, the United \nStates is not going to support a global warming treaty that will \nsignificantly damage the American economy, cost American jobs, and \nimpose the largest tax increase in American history. Further, as I \nstated in 2003, unless developing countries are part of the binding \nagreement, the United States will not go along, given the unemployment \nrate of 10 percent--10.2 now--and given all the out-of-control spending \nin Washington. The last thing we need is another 1,000-page bill that \nincreases costs and ships jobs overseas, all with no impact on climate \nchange.\n  That was in Milan, Italy. I remember in Milan, Italy, all the \ntelephone poles had my picture on them, ``wanted'' posters, because of \nsomething I said, which I will quote in a minute. I said then that the \nscience was not settled, and it was an unpopular view. Since Al Gore's \nscience fiction movie, more and more scientists, reporters, and \npoliticians are questioning global warming alarmism. I am proud to \ndeclare 2009 the year of the skeptic, the year in which scientists who \nquestion the so-called global warming consensus are being heard.\n  Rather than continue down a road that will harm the U.S. economy and \ninternational community, we should forge a new path forward that builds \non international trade, new and innovative technology, jobs, \ndevelopment, and economic growth.\n  If you have followed the Senate, you will know that the Senate's \nposition on global warming treaties couldn't be more clear. In 1997, \nlet's remember what happened then. President Clinton and Vice President \nAl Gore were attempting to get us to ratify the Kyoto treaty. We passed \nsomething in the Chamber called the Byrd-Hagel resolution. It passed 95 \nto 0. It said this: If you bring back anything from Kyoto or anywhere \nelse for us to ratify, and if that treaty we are supposed to ratify \neither doesn't include developing countries or is harmful to our \neconomy, then we will not ratify it. I think the Byrd-Hagel resolution \nstill commands strong support in the Senate. Therefore, any treaty \nPresident Obama submits must meet this criteria or it will be easily \ndefeated.\n  Proponents of securing an international treaty are slowly \nacknowledging that the gulf is widening between the United States and \nother industrialized nations that are willing to\n\n[[Page S11460]]\n\ndo what developing countries such as China want them to do. The gulf \nhas always been wide, but it is continuing to get wider. When we talk \nabout China and about the fact that they are talking about restricting \nCO2 emissions in the United States, some think that surely \nChina will follow our lead. It is interesting that China is cranking \nout two coal-fired power-generating plants every week.\n  With certain failure at Copenhagen, it is safe to say cap and trade \nis dead. Look at the record: the Byrd-Hagel amendment in 1997, the \ndefeat in the Senate of the McCain-Lieberman bill in 2003, and defeat \nof McCain-Lieberman in 2005, defeat of the Warner-Lieberman bill, and \nno bill on the Senate floor in 2009.\n  From my very first speech on the Senate floor as chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, on July 28, 2003, I outlined \nthe staggering cost of global warming solutions such as Kyoto. In my \nspeech, I said the most widely--I am quoting now from what I stated in \n2003:\n\n       The most widely cited and most definitive economic analysis \n     of Kyoto came from Wharton Econometric Forecasting \n     Associates.\n\n  According to the Wharton School, their economists, Kyoto would cost \n2.4 million U.S. jobs, reduce GDP by 3.2 percent, and that would equate \nto somewhere between a $300 billion and $330 billion tax increase \nannually--an amount greater than the total expenditure on primary and \nsecondary education.\n  In terms of a tax, when I looked at that tax--and this was back in \n2003 and they talked about a $300 billion tax increase--I wanted to \nlook and see how I could better understand that. I recall, prior to \nthat, the largest tax increase in the last three decades was called the \nClinton-Gore tax increase of 1993. That tax increase was a $32 billion \ntax increase. I thought, wait a minute, we are about to impose upon the \nAmerican people a tax increase that is 10 times greater than the 1993 \nClinton-Gore tax increase. This chart shows what that would be. These \nare the tax increases. This is the increase we are talking about, the \n$32 billion tax increase. This is what it would have been had we signed \nthe Kyoto treaty or any of the accords since that time. So we are \ntalking about huge amounts of money. I said that because of Kyoto, \nAmerican consumers would face the higher food, medical, and housing \ncosts--costs for food, an increase of 11 percent; medicine, an increase \nof 14 percent; housing, an increase of 7 percent; and at the same time, \nan average household of 4 would see its real income drop by $2,700 in \n2010 and each year thereafter. Under Kyoto, energy and electricity \nprices would nearly double, and gasoline prices would go up an \nadditional 65 cents a gallon.\n  Again, we are not talking about Jim Inhofe, a Senator, making these \nstatements. This was actually out of the Wharton School of Economics \nand their forecast at that time. I went on to note that CBO found that \n``cap and tax'' is a regressive tax, arguing that the Congressional \nBudget Office found that the price increases resulting from a carbon \ncap would be regressive; that is, they would place a relatively greater \nburden on lower income households than on higher income ones. As to the \nbroader macroeconomic effects of carbon cap-and-trade schemes, CBO \nsaid:\n\n       A cap and trade program for carbon emissions could impose \n     significant costs on the economy in the form of welfare \n     losses. Welfare losses are real costs to the economy in that \n     they would not be recovered elsewhere in the form of higher \n     income. Those losses would be borne by people in their roles \n     as shareholders, consumers, and workers.\n\n  Some might respond that government can simply redistribute income in \nthe form of welfare programs to mitigate the impacts on the poor, but \nCBO found otherwise. They said:\n\n       The government could use the allowance value to partly \n     redistribute the costs of a carbon cap-and-trade program, but \n     it could not recover these costs entirely.\n\n  Further:\n\n       Available research indicates that providing compensation \n     could actually raise the cost to the economy of a carbon cap.\n\n  That was what we quoted from the CBO in 2003. Yet, as the saying \ngoes, the more things change, the more they stay the same. CBO, EPA, \nthe DOE, CRS, the National Black Chamber of Commerce, NAM--everyone now \nagrees that cap and trade would be extremely costly and destroy jobs. \nNo matter how hard alarmists try to recast their cause--whether it is \ngreen jobs or clean energy jobs or clean energy revolution--and they \nare starting to reword it from ``global warming'' to ``climate \nchange.'' The general public has realized global warming isn't taking \nplace, and they cannot use that, so they changed that to climate \nchange. Now they cannot use that anymore, and they can't use cap and \ntrade, so they talk about a green jobs program.\n  Cap and trade is a loser for America. I have also pointed out the \ninconvenient fact that cap-and-trade solutions are all pain and no \nclimate gain. In the first speech in 2001, I noted that even Al Gore's \nown scientist admitted Kyoto would do nothing to solve global warming. \nLet me refresh the memory of the American people. In 2003, Al Gore had \nhired Dr. Tom Wigley, a senior scientist at the National Center for \nAtmospheric Research. The challenge he posed to him was, if we, along \nwith all other developed nations, were to sign on to the Kyoto Treaty \nand live by its emissions restrictions, how much would this reduce the \ntemperature in 50 years?\n  The answer was it would be 0.07 of 1 degree Celsius by 2050. It would \nactually be 0.13 degrees Celsius by 2100. These things are not even \nmeasurable. We go through 50 years of the highest tax increase in the \nhistory of America. What do we get for it? Maybe you will get, \naccording to his own scientist, Dr. Tom Wigley, 0.07 of 1 degree \nCelsius.\n  I also mentioned in the 2003 speech everyone's favorite alarmist, \nJames Hansen. I said at that time:\n\n       Similarly, Dr. James Hansen of NASA, considered the father \n     of global warming theory, said the Kyoto Protocol ``will have \n     little effect'' on global temperature in the 21st century. In \n     a rather stunning follow-up, Hansen said it would take 30 \n     Kyotos--let me repeat that--30 Kyotos to reduce warming to an \n     acceptable level. If one Kyoto devastates the American \n     economy, what would 30 do?\n\n  Those following the climate debate closely know James Hansen went on \nrecord this summer against the Waxman-Markey-Kerry-Boxer bill. It is \nnot going to pass now. At that time, it looked as if it was going to \npass. Even James Hansen, one of the strongest proponents, said:\n\n       Cap and trade is the temple of doom. It would lock in \n     disasters for our children and grandchildren. Why do people \n     continue to worship a disastrous approach? Its fecklessness \n     was proven by the Kyoto Protocol.\n\n  That is James Hansen on the other side of the issue.\n  Now we have top Obama officials making the same points. EPA \nAdministrator Lisa Jackson was before our committee. Keep in mind, she \nis an Obama appointee. She is now Administrator of the EPA. She said in \nresponse to a question I had--I said: Is this chart correct? In other \nwords, if we were to pass this bill and to restrict our emissions of \nCO2, would it have any effect? She said: No, I agree with \nthat chart. Of course, I am encouraged. She said:\n\n       I believe the central parts of the [EPA] chart--\n\n  That is this chart--\n\n     are that U.S. action alone will not impact world \n     CO2 levels.\n\n  I often said how I appreciate the honesty of Lisa Jackson. It is \ndifficult for her to admit that if we passed a bill, it would not have \nany effect on reducing worldwide emissions of CO2.\n  You could carry that argument a little bit further because if we were \nto ration CO2 in our country, that would cause jobs to \nleave. We understand that. They would go to countries such as China, \nIndia, and Mexico, where they don't have any restrictions at all. So it \nwould have the effect of increasing CO2.\n  Over the past several years, we have seen a growing number of \nDemocrats--yes, Democrats--agreeing with my position. Today, with a \nDemocratic Congress and a Democratic President, some may be surprised \nby the number of Democrats who want nothing to do with cap and trade.\n  Politico--we are all familiar with that publication--reported on \nMonday that:\n\n       Lawmakers from coal and manufacturing-heavy States aren't \n     happy that more liberal Democrats are using the Copenhagen \n     negotiations to ratchet up pressure to move the bill forward. \n     ``I'm totally unconcerned about Copenhagen.''\n\n\n[[Page S11461]]\n\n\n  This is a quote by Democratic Senator Jay Rockefeller from West \nVirginia.\n  He said:\n\n       I'm concerned about West Virginia.\n\n  I am glad to hear some of my Democratic colleagues making these \nstatements.\n  They also reported--still quoting from Politico:\n\n       Virginia Democratic Sen. Jim Webb said on Monday he would \n     not back the cap-and-trade legislation sponsored by Sens. \n     John Kerry and Barbara Boxer, another blow to the troubled \n     Senate climate change bill. ``In its present form I would not \n     vote for it,'' he said. ``I have some real questions about \n     the real complexities on cap and trade.'' Webb is the latest \n     in a series of Democratic moderates to raise significant \n     concerns with the climate bill, which has floundered since \n     passing the House in late June.\n\n  That is quite some time ago.\n  Or consider Democratic Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska. The Hill \nrecently reported on a CNBC interview with Senator Nelson, writing:\n\n       ``A cap-and-trade bill to address climate change cannot \n     pass Congress this session,'' said Sen. Ben Nelson, Democrat \n     from Nebraska. Nelson, a centrist Democrat whose vote is key \n     to leaders wielding its 60-vote majority in the Senate, said \n     he and his constituents had not been sold on the cap-and-\n     trade system proposed in the House and Senate bills to \n     address global warming. ``No,'' Nelson simply responded when \n     asked if those cap-and-trade bills can pass through this \n     Congress during an interview with CNBC. ``I haven't been able \n     to sell that argument to my farmers, and I don't think \n     they're going to buy it from anybody else,'' Nelson said. ``I \n     think at the end of the day, the people who turn the switch \n     on at home will be disadvantaged.'' The pessimistic \n     assessment makes Nelson a thorn in the side of his party's \n     leaders--\n\n  Who are trying to push this through from the Democratic Party.\n  Perhaps the biggest blow to any Senate climate bill came last week \nfrom 14 Senate Democrats, primarily from the Midwest, who in a letter \nchallenged the allocation formula of Kerry-Boxer and Waxman-Markey. The \nletter was signed by Senators Al Franken, Amy Klobuchar, Mark Udall, \nMichael Bennet, Robert Byrd, Carl Levin, Debbie Stabenow, and Sherrod \nBrown.\n  What about the prospects for 2010? As Lisa Lerer of Politico reported \nlast week:\n\n       An aggressive White House push on jobs and deficit \n     reduction in 2010 may be yet another sign that climate-change \n     legislation will stay on the back burner next year. ``There \n     is a growing chorus in the party that thinks we should be \n     doing something more to spur job creation and not necessarily \n     tackle cap and trade right now,'' said a moderate democratic \n     Senate aide. White House officials told Politico on Friday \n     that President Barack Obama plans to curb new domestic \n     spending beyond jobs programs and focus on cutting the \n     federal deficit next year. In the Senate, Majority Leader \n     Harry Reid has hinted that Democrats plan to take up a job-\n     creation bill, in the wake of the announcement of the 10.2 \n     percent unemployment rate. In the House, some lawmakers are \n     beginning to push a major highway bill for next year to focus \n     on job creation. None of this is promising for the major \n     climate change bill.\n\n  That was a quote that came out of Politico.\n  Also, Darren Samuelsohn with E News reported this week that:\n\n       Next November's midterm elections loom large, leaving the \n     climate bill sponsors until about the end of March to notch \n     the 60 votes necessary to pass their bill off the floor and \n     into a conference with the House that would best be finished \n     before the summer. ``Conventional wisdom is that you have \n     until the spring to get controversial issues moving,'' said \n     Sen. Ben Cardin, a lead co-author of the climate bill that \n     the Environment and Public Works Committee passed earlier \n     this month. ``If not, it's difficult to see getting through \n     closer to the elections.''\n\n  What he is saying there, when you get closer to the elections, then \nyou want to be more consistent with what Americans believe.\n  Mr. Samuelsohn reported that the Democrats fear a repeat of the \ndisastrous 1992 Btu tax vote. He quotes Al Gore as saying, ``Yes, I \nthink the Btu [post-traumatic stress disorder] is a factor in this \ndebate.''\n  To refresh your memory, Madam President, the Btu, back in 1992, was a \nhuge tax increase on energy. People realized they would have to pay for \nit. That passed the House, ironically, with 219 votes, the same narrow \nmargin this cap-and-trade bill passed 15 years later.\n  Samuelsohn also writes that according to Democratic Senator Jay \nRockefeller of West Virginia, ``the talk on the street'' was that an \nelection year cannot be good for passing the climate bill in the \nSenate, even though he did not agree with that opinion. ``There's some \npossibility of people saying that it's too controversial a bill in an \nelection year,'' quoting Rockefeller, ``which is sort of the opposite \nof how a democracy ought to work.'' I do agree with him on that. ``You \ngo ahead and take your chances on that and get reelected. But people's \nbusiness should come first.''\n  By now the message should be clear: It is not just Republicans but \nDemocrats who are blocking passage of cap and trade in the Senate. The \nsooner we are honest with the international community of the \nimpossibility of the Senate moving forward with cap and trade, the \nsooner we can begin work on an all-of-the-above energy bill to develop \ndomestic energy resources, create jobs, and provide consumers with \naffordable, reliable energy.\n  I don't like the idea that sometimes promoters of cap and trade say \nthis is an energy bill. What you are doing is restricting energy. Right \nnow, we are dependent on coal, oil, gas, and, hopefully in the future, \nnuclear. Those who are pushing for this green energy, which we all want \nsomeday--what do we do 10, 15, 20 years from now? Just 2 weeks ago, \nthey came out with a study that said the United States of America is \nNo. 1 in possession of recoverable natural resources. Yet 83 percent of \nthese natural resources are off limits, primarily due to the moratorium \nset by Democrats saying: We don't want you to drill offshore or some of \nthese other places. It seems inconceivable to me that we are the only \nnation in the world that does not develop its own resources.\n  Anyway, the tipping point from the most memorable tidbit from my 2-\nhour global warming speech in July of 2003 was my comments about the \nscience behind global warming. Now 6 years later, as I head to the next \nU.N. global warming conference, I am pleased by the vast and growing \nnumber of scientists, politicians, and reporters all over the world who \nare publicly rejecting climate alarmism, those who want to scare people \ninto some kind of action: Water is going to rise up, the world is \ncoming to an end--all of that. They are rejecting these alarmists now.\n  When I made those comments on the Senate floor, few people were there \nto stand with me. Today, I have been vindicated, and I am proud to \nshare the stage with all those who now dare to question Al Gore, \nHollywood elites, and the United Nations.\n  Early in my 2003 speech, 6 years ago, I said:\n\n       Much of the debate over global warming is predicated on \n     fear rather than science. Global warming alarmists see a \n     future plagued by catastrophic flooding, war, terrorism, \n     economic dislocations, droughts, crop failures, mosquito-\n     borne diseases, and harsh weather--all caused by man-made \n     greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n  For the next 2 hours, I presented arguments by a number of leading \nscientists who disputed that picture of the future. I argued that \nactivists attempting to propagate fear would fail to convince the \nAmerican people. I then concluded my remarks saying:\n\n       With all the hysteria, all the fear, all of the phony \n     science, could it be that man-made global warming is the \n     greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people? It \n     sure sounds like it is.\n\n  My remarks were immediately ridiculed by alarmists in the mainstream \nmedia. Alarmists then and since have used every name in the book to \ndiscredit me. Nevertheless, I continued to make my case in speech after \nspeech on the Senate floor, highlighting arguments by numerous \nscientists that contradicted the notion that the science behind global \nwarming was ``settled.''\n  Every time you quote a scientist, they always come back and say: Oh, \nno, you can't talk about the science; the science is settled.\n  The first time the McCain-Lieberman bill came to the Senate floor was \n2003. McCain-Lieberman was essentially a cap-and-trade bill similar to \nwhat we are looking at today. I remember well, Republicans were in the \nmajority. I was chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. I can remember we were given 5 days on the floor to debate \nthis bill, 10 hours a day, roughly 50 hours. I remember going over this \nand debating this on this very floor of the Senate in 2005. It\n\n[[Page S11462]]\n\nwas the McCain-Lieberman bill, and only two Senators came down during \nthat week to give me support. Fast forward to 2008. The same bill came \nup, except this time it was called the Warner-Lieberman bill, another \ncap-and-trade bill, just like we are talking about today. At that time, \nit didn't take 5 days to defeat it; it took 2 days, and 23 Senators \ncame down to join me in that effort. What do I credit for the reversal? \nYou might be surprised by my answer. It is none other than the winner \nof a Nobel Peace Prize and an Oscar. It is Al Gore.\n  The media blitz of 2006, which included an avalanche of magazine \ncovers, hour-long global warming documentaries, celebrity rock concerts \naround the world, and, of course, Al Gore's very own science fiction \nmovie, caused an unprecedented response from scientists from around the \nworld.\n  Later that year, I took to the Senate floor debunking much of Al \nGore's movie and the media hype. I said then--and this is, again, 2006:\n\n       In May, our Nation was exposed to perhaps one of the \n     slickest science propaganda films of all time: former Vice \n     President Al Gore's ``An Inconvenient Truth.'' In addition to \n     having the backing of Paramount Pictures to market this film, \n     Gore had the full backing of the media, and leading the \n     cheerleading charge was none other than the Associated Press.\n\n  I noted a report that appeared on June 27, 2006, by Seth Borenstein \nof the Associated Press that boldly declared ``Scientists give two \nthumbs up to Gore's movie.'' I took issue with the Borenstein article \nand pointed out--and this is a quote from 3 years ago:\n  ``The article quoted only 5''--listen, Madam President--``only 5 \nscientists praising Gore's science, despite AP's having contacted 100 \nscientists.''\n  They contacted 100 scientists and they could only find 5 scientists \nwho praised it.\n\n       The fact that over 80 percent of the scientists contacted \n     by the AP had not even seen the movie or that many scientists \n     have harshly criticized the science presented by Gore did not \n     dissuade the news outlet one bit from its mission to promote \n     Gore's brand of climate alarmism. I am almost at a loss [I am \n     quoting from 3 years ago] as to how to begin to address the \n     series of errors, misleading science and unfounded \n     speculation that appear in the former Vice President's film. \n     Here is what Richard Lindzen, a meteorologist from MIT, has \n     written about ``An Inconvenient Truth.'' He said: ``A general \n     characteristic of Mr. Gore's approach is to assiduously \n     ignore the fact that the Earth and its climate are dynamic; \n     they are always changing even without any external forcing. \n     To treat all change as something to fear is bad enough; to do \n     so in order to exploit that fear is much worse.''\n\n  That is Richard Lindzen, one of the top scientists at MIT. In that \nsame 2006 speech I then proceeded to give a brief summary of the \nscience that the former Vice President promoted in either an inaccurate \nor misleading way. Let me read a list of these.\n  He promoted the now debunked ``hockey stick'' temperature chart in an \nattempt to prove man's overwhelming impact on the climate. He attempted \nto minimize the significance of the medieval warm period and the little \nice age.\n  Let's put them together. If you remember the famous hockey stick, \nthat was the one that showed climate, increasing temperature, and then \nall of a sudden there is a hockey stick. That is when it started going \nup.\n  It ignored the fact that in the 14th century and again in the 16th \ncentury we had the medieval warm period and the little ice age. In the \nmedieval warm period it was far warmer than it has been since that \ntime.\n  In that same movie, insisting on a link between increasing hurricane \nactivity and global warming that most scientists at this time do not \nbelieve--and it doesn't exist. The science has come out since that time \nand said very clearly that science is not there. Every year they say \nthis coming year it is going to be greater hurricanes. It doesn't \nhappen. For 5 consecutive years they predicted that and it hasn't \nhappened.\n  He asserted that today's Arctic is experiencing unprecedented warmth, \nwhile ignoring that the temperatures in the 1930s were warmer than in \nthat time. He claimed the Antarctic was warming and losing ice, but \nfailed to note this is only true of a small region and that the vast \nbulk has been cooling and gaining ice during that period. He hyped \nunfounded fears that Greenland's ice is in danger of disappearing.\n  If you were to say that maybe there is some truth in the global \nwarming issue, I had occasion, I say to my good friend who is \npresiding, a few years ago, not too many years ago--my background is \naviation. I decided to replicate the flight of Wylie Post going around \nthe world. One of my stops there, where Wylie Post stopped, was in \nGreenland. Their history books are full of the time things were \nflourishing in Greenland. The Vikings came in, they were growing things \nthat hadn't been grown. Then when the cycle went through and it started \ngetting colder, they died and disappeared. I think you can argue we are \ngoing to have these cycles. God is still up there. We have always had \nHim; we are going to continue to have Him.\n  Back to the film. He erroneously claimed the icecap on Mount \nKilimanjaro is disappearing--and that is not supported--due to global \nwarming, even while the region cools and researchers blame the ice loss \non local land use practices.\n  He made assertions of massive future sea level rise far afield from \nany supposed scientific ``consensus'' and not supported in even the \nmost alarmist literature. He incorrectly implied that a Peruvian \nglacier's retreat is due to global warming, ignoring the fact that the \nregion has been cooling since the 1930s and other glaciers in South \nAmerica are advancing. He blamed global warming for water loss in \nAfrica's Lake Chad, despite NASA scientists concluding that local \npopulation and grazing factors are the more likely culprits. He \ninaccurately claimed polar bears are drowning in significant numbers \ndue to melting ice when in fact they are thriving.\n  The population of the polar bear has quadrupled since 1960 and today, \nof the 13 polar bear populations in Canada, they are all increasing \nexcept for one and that is in the western Hudson Bay area where they \nhave hunting regulations and issues they are working on now not related \nto weather.\n  He completely failed to inform the viewers that the 48 scientists who \naccused President Bush of distorting science were part of a political \nadvocacy group set up to support Democratic Presidential candidate John \nKerry in 2004.\n  You could make a whole speech on each of the assertions made in that \nscience fiction movie called ``An Inconvenient Truth,'' and they have \nbeen disproven. At the end of the speech I challenged those in the \nmedia to reverse course and report on the objective science of climate \nchange, to stop ignoring legitimate voices in the scientific community, \nquestion the so-called consensus, and to stop acting as a vehicle for \nunsustainable hype.\n  The reaction by the American public was so overwhelming that my \nSenate Web site crashed after that. Thousands of people came to my site \nto read and watch the speech. In fact, I was flooded with e-mails \nsupporting the work.\n  I also noted in 2006, in that speech, many scientists were just \nstarting to speak out against the so-called consensus on global \nwarming. In April of that year, 60 prominent scientists who questioned \nthe basis for climate alarmism sent a letter--these were Canadian \nscientists, 60 of them sent a letter to the Canadian Prime Minister and \nthey wrote:\n\n       If, back in the mid-1990s we knew what we know today about \n     climate Kyoto would almost certainly not exist, because we \n     would have concluded it was not necessary.\n       I say that because Canada was one of the countries that did \n     sign onto the Kyoto treaty. They are saying today, if we had \n     known then what we know now, we wouldn't have done it.\n\n  I discovered how many prominent scientists were disputing the claims \nof global warming alarmism in 2007 and I released my first report \ndetailing over 400 scientists who did not buy the consensus. If you \nwant to go back to any of these, I have a Web site, inhofe.senate.gov. \nYou can see who they are.\n  After that report, the list continued to grow and more scientists \nbegan publicly challenging global warming fears. In 2008, I updated the \nreport with over 650 scientists and today that stands at well over 700 \nskeptical scientists. The chorus of skeptical scientific voices \ncontinues to grow louder every day as the consensus collapses.\n  I think this is important. A lot of the scientists were intimidated \nat that\n\n[[Page S11463]]\n\ntime with the withdrawal of various grants and other things coming from \nboth the Federal Government or some more liberal groups that are out \nthere. The fact is they had the courage to come forward and say the \nconsensus is not there even though everyone thought it was for so many \nyears. This momentous shift has caused the mainstream media to take \nnotice of the expanding number of scientists serving as ``consensus \nbusters.'' A November 25, 2008 article in Politico noted that a \n``growing accumulation'' of science is challenging warming fears, and \nthat the ``science behind global warming may still be too shaky to \nwarrant cap-and-trade legislation.'' That was a year ago.\n  In Canada's National Post, it noted on October 20 of 2008 that ``the \nnumber of climate change skeptics is growing rapidly.'' The New York \nTimes environmental reporter Andrew Revkin noted on March 6, 2008, ``As \nwe all know, climate science is not a numbers game. There are heaps of \nsigned statements by folks with advanced degrees on all sides of the \nissue.''\n  In 2007 a Washington Post staff writer, Juliet Eilperin, conceded the \nobvious, writing that climate skeptics ``appear to be expanding rather \nthan shrinking.''\n  We have seen this happening for the last 2 years. Yet it will be 2009 \nthat will be remembered as the year of the skeptic. Until this year, \nany scientist, reporter, or politician who dared raise even the \nslightest suspicion about the science behind global warming was \ndismissed and repeatedly mocked. Who can forget Dr. Heidi Cullen of the \nWeather Channel. She was on every week. I don't think she is on \nanymore; I haven't seen her in quite some time. She was the one who \nsaid, in 2007, that the American Meteorological Society should revoke \nits seal of approval for any television weatherman who expresses \nskepticism that human activity is creating a climate catastrophe.\n  She said:\n\n       If a meteorologist can't speak to the fundamental science \n     of climate change, then maybe the AMS shouldn't give them the \n     seal of approval.\n\n  This is what she wrote in December 21 in a blog on the Weather \nChannel:\n\n       It's like allowing a meteorologist to go on air and say \n     that hurricanes rotate clockwise and tsunamis are caused by \n     the weather. It's not a political statement . . . it's just \n     an incorrect statement.\n\n  Of course there was Robert Kennedy, Jr., also in 2007, who called \nanyone who didn't agree with his views on global warming ``traitors.'' \nHe spoke before a liberal group called the Live Earth Concert in July \nof 2007. He stated, Robert Kennedy, Jr.:\n\n       Get rid of these rotten politicians that we have in \n     Washington, who are nothing more than corporate toadies for \n     companies like Exxon and Southern Company. These villainous \n     companies that consistently put their private financial \n     interest ahead of the interests of all of humanity. This is \n     treason and we need to start treating them as traitors.\n\n  Al Gore, of course, said anyone who dares question the science should \nbe equated with those who question the Moon landing.\n  Aside from the distasteful and derogatory ridicule by such alarmists, \na major statement by a manmade-to-global-warming believer severely \nundercut their claims. This year one of the United Nations IPCC--let me \nmake sure people understand this. The IPCC, Intergovernmental--this is \na panel put together in the United Nations of people to try to sell the \nidea that manmade gases--anthropogenic gases, CO2, methane--\ncause global warming. One of the U.N. scientists told more than 1,500 \nscientists gathered at the conference in Geneva, Switzerland: ``People \nwill say this is global warming disappearing. I am not one of the \nskeptics. However, we have to ask the nasty question ourselves, or \nother people will do it.''\n  Remember, this quote comes from Mojib Latif, who Andrew Revkin from \nthe New York Times describes as ``a prize-winning climate and ocean \nscientist from the Liebniz Institute of Marine Sciences at the \nUniversity of Kiel, in Germany.''\n  This remarkable admission of the need to ask nasty questions comes \nnearly 2 years after I first pointed out these very facts on the Senate \nfloor in my October 26 of 2007 speech on the Senate floor. This is what \nI said at that time. I am quoting now. I always hesitate quoting myself \nbut it is important that we were talking about this 2 years ago. I \nsaid:\n\n       It's important to point out that the phase of global \n     warming that started in 1979 has, itself, been halted since \n     1979. You can almost hear my critics skeptical of that \n     assertion. Well, it turns out not to be an assertion but an \n     irrefutable fact, according to the temperature data United \n     Nations relies on. Paleoclimate scientist Dr. Bob Carter, who \n     has testified before the United States Senate Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works, noted on June 18 of this year: \n     ``The accepted global average temperature statistics used by \n     the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change--that's the \n     United Nations--showed that no ground-based warming has \n     occurred since 1998. Oddly, this 8-year-long temperature \n     stability has occurred despite an increase over the period of \n     time of 15 parts per million or 4 percent in the atmospheric \n     CO2. Second, lower atmosphere satellite-based \n     temperature measurements, if corrected for non-greenhouse \n     influences such as El Nino events and large volcanic \n     eruptions, show little if any global warming since 1979, a \n     period over which atmospheric CO2 has increased by \n     55 parts per million, or 17 percent.\n\n  To try to say it is tied to CO2 is interesting because \nimmediately following World War II, the largest increase in the \nemissions of CO2 took place starting about 1946. Yet that \ndidn't precipitate a warming period, it precipitated a cooling period \nduring that time.\n  The very people who had long called the science settled and those who \nwent so far to say the science behind global warming was unequivocal \nnow admitted that nasty questions must be raised. Those questions are \nnow being raised by the media. On October 8, the BBC, the British \nBroadcasting Company, stunned the journalism community with an article \nby their climate correspondent Paul Hudson. The headline asked, ``What \nhappened to global warming?'' Hudson wrote in that article, October 8:\n       This headline may come as a bit of a surprise, so too might \n     the fact that the warmest year recorded globally was not 2008 \n     or 2007, but [was] in 1998. But it is true. For the last 11 \n     years we have not observed any increase in global \n     temperatures. And our climate models did not forecast it, \n     even though manmade carbon dioxide, the gas thought to be \n     responsible for warming our planet, has continued to rise.\n\n  (Mr. CARDIN assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. The article continues to note the lack of global warming \nrecently and mentions the fact that many scientists are predicting a \ncoming global cooling.\n  Following the BBC, other British news outlets have run similar \nheadlines. The UK Sunday Times wrote ``Why everything you think you \nknow about global warming is wrong.'' This is coming from Great \nBritain. The Daily Mail, another major publication in Great Britain, \nhad a headline: ``Whatever happened to global warming? How freezing \ntemperatures are starting to shatter climate change theory.'' \nAustralia's Herald Sun has picked up on the trend as well. Columnist \nAndrew Bolt, noting the turning tide of media around the world, wrote:\n\n       This is like the moment in the Emperor's New Clothes, in \n     which the boy calls out ``but he's naked!\"\n\n  Let's be clear. Some of the media were already beginning to question \nthe consensus even before that announcement.\n  Television personalities were coming around as well. In April, \nCharles Osgood, host of ``CBS News Sunday Morning'' and a noted \nenvironmentalist, questioned global warming projections. He asked:\n\n       Right now, global warming is a given to so many, it raises \n     the question: Could another minimum activity period on the \n     Sun counteract, in any way, the effects of global warming?\n\n  Osgood later scolded himself for even questioning global warming \nbefore stating:\n\n       I'm sure you'll be hearing more about this solar dimming \n     business, now that the story is out. Remember, you heard it \n     here first . . .\n\n  Lou Dobbs, formerly with CNN, has also joined the chorus questioning \nthe alarmists, consensus. In January, Dobbs compared the belief in \nmanmade global warming to a religion.\n  He stated:\n\n       They bring this thing to a personal belief system. It's \n     almost a religion, without any question . . .\n\n  Dobbs also criticized what he called ``crowding out of facts and \nobjective assessment of those facts . . . there's such selective \nchoices of data as one\n\n[[Page S11464]]\n\ndiscusses and tries to understand the reality of the issues that make \nup global warming.''\n  In September, another dramatic announcement came from Houston \nChronicle science reporter Eric Berger. He stated:\n\n       Earth seems to have at least temporarily stopped warming. \n     If we can't have confidence in short-term prognosis for \n     climate change, how can we have confidence in long-term?\n\n  The bright light is also fading on the U.N. IPCC. In August, the New \nYork Times ran the headline ``Nobel Halo Fades Fast for Climate Change \nPanel.'' The article notes:\n\n       As the panel gears up for its next climate review, many \n     specialists in climate science and policy, both inside and \n     out of the network, are warning that it could quickly lose \n     relevance unless it adjusts its methods and focus.\n\n  Weeks later, on September 23, the New York Times again acknowledged a \nshift in public moods and scientific evidence when it stated that the \nU.N. faced an ``intricate challenge: building momentum for an \ninternational climate treaty at a time when global temperatures have \nbeen relatively stable for a decade and may even drop in the next few \nyears.''\n  Given the media's track record, this is hardly surprising. As I noted \nin my 2006 speech, the media runs hot and cold in their coverage of \nclimate change. Quoting here, I said at the time:\n\n       Since 1895, the media has alternated between global cooling \n     and warming scares during four separate and sometimes \n     overlapping time periods. From 1895 until the 1930s, the \n     media peddled the coming ice age.\n\n  Everyone is going to die. We are going to freeze to death.\n\n       From the late 1920's until the 1960's they warned of global \n     warming. From the 1950's until the 1970's they warned again \n     of a coming ice age. This makes modern global warming the \n     fourth estate's fourth attempt to promote opposing climate \n     change fears during the last 100 years. Recently, advocates \n     of alarmism have grown increasingly desperate to try to \n     convince the public that global warming is the greatest moral \n     issue of a generation. Last year, the vice president of \n     London's Royal Society sent a chilling letter to the media \n     encouraging them to stifle the voices of scientists skeptical \n     of climate alarmism. During the past year, the American \n     people have been served up an unprecedented parade of \n     environmental alarmism by the media and entertainment \n     industry, which link every possible weather event to global \n     warming. The year 2006 saw many major organs of the media \n     dismiss any pretense of balance and objectivity on climate \n     change coverage and instead crossed squarely into global \n     warming advocacy.\n\n  Maybe one reason the media is starting to come around is that the \npublic is shifting as well. It is easy to sell magazines, books, and \nmovie tickets when you have everyone eating out of your hand believing \nthat a climate catastrophe is right around the corner. Once the \naudience isn't buying that story anymore, it might be time to start \nacknowledging the other side.\n  If we look at Time magazine, I remember back in 1975, Time magazine--\nand Newsweek of the same year--said another ice age is coming. There it \nis. This is 1974. This was in Time magazine. Another ice age is coming. \nThen you fast forward to about 3 years ago. That same Time magazine had \na picture of the last polar bear in the world standing on the last ice \ncube and saying: Now it is global warming.\n  This is why the media is coming around. Polls are showing an \nunprecedented shift in public opinion on the science of climate change \nas well as cap-and-trade proposals in Congress. Only a few weeks ago, \nin October, Politico reported:\n\n       As the nation struggles to climb out of a recession, 45 \n     percent rated the economy as the most important issue in \n     deciding their vote if the congressional election were held \n     today, followed by 21 percent who said government spending, \n     20 percent who chose health care reform and 9 percent who \n     said the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Just 4 percent of the \n     people said climate change was the top issue.\n\n  I can remember when that was 60 percent.\n  The people have caught on. You are going to see the media, if they \nwant to sell their stuff, come back and change their position. We are \nseeing that now.\n  Economic worries also led a majority of Americans to place jump-\nstarting the economy ahead of concerns about the environment. Even as \nthe Obama administration is pushing for climate protection legislation, \n62 percent of those polled agreed that ``economic growth should be \ngiven priority, even if the environment suffers to some extent.'' The \nremaining 38 percent believe that ``protection of the environment \nshould be given priority, even at the risk of curbing economic \ngrowth.''\n  Further, earlier this year Gallup released a poll that found that 41 \npercent of the people believe global warming claims are exaggerated. \nWhat about the effect of Al Gore's climate scare campaign? The Gallup \npoll editor Frank Newport says he sees no evidence that Gore is \nwinning. Newport said:\n\n       It's just not caught on, they have failed. Any measure that \n     we look at shows Al Gore's losing at the moment. The public \n     is just not that concerned. [ . . . ] Ask people to name the \n     biggest concerns, and just 1 percent to 2 percent cite the \n     environment. The environment doesn't show up at all, it's Al \n     Gore's greatest frustration. We seem less concerned than more \n     about global warming over the years . . . Despite the movies \n     and publicity and all that, we're just not seeing it take off \n     with the American public. And that was occurring even before \n     the latest economic recession.\n\n  Again, further quoting Frank Newport:\n\n       As Al Gore I think would say, the greatest challenge facing \n     humanity . . . has failed to show up in our data.\n\n  Polls have also shown that when looking at environmental issues only, \nclimate change continually ranks dead last among concerns. This wasn't \ntrue a few years ago. This is what is taking place now. This is after \nall the media hype, all the hysteria.\n  The Gallup poll in March found global warming ranked last in the \nUnited States among environmental issues. This is just environmental \nissues. Air and water pollution, toxic waste, animal and plant \nextinctions, the loss of tropical rain forests all ranked as a greater \nconcern than global warming.\n  As Gallup stated:\n\n       Since more Americans express little to no worry about \n     global warming than say this about extinction, global warming \n     is clearly the environmental issue of least concern to them.\n\n  These are the environmentalists.\n\n       In fact, global warming is the only issue for which more \n     Americans say they have little to no concern than say they \n     have a great deal of concern.\n\n  The public is also unwilling to accept legislation on climate change \nthat would cost them money. Rasmussen found that 56 percent of \nAmericans said they are not willing to pay any additional taxes or \nutility costs to fight global warming.\n  The clear rejection of fear and hysteria is leading many on Capitol \nHill to change their tune on climate legislation. Turning away from \nusing scare tactics, the left is now trying to sell cap and trade as \nclean energy legislation. Don't say climate change, don't say global \nwarming, don't say cap and trade anymore. Say clean energy economy--\nthat is something that sells. So if you keep renaming the same thing, \nmaybe it will sell.\n  As the New York and the L.A. Times have recently reported, the White \nHouse, concerned by the lack of support for their cap-and-trade \ninitiatives, is using poll-tested talking points to help push one of \nthe President's biggest priorities. The New York Times caught on to \nthese new talking points earlier this year, reporting:\n\n       The problem with global warming, some environmentalists \n     believe, is ``global warming.'' The term turns people off, \n     fostering images of shaggy-haired liberals, economic \n     sacrifice and complex scientific disputes, according to \n     extensive polling and focus group sessions conducted by \n     ecoAmerica, a nonprofit environmental marketing and messaging \n     firms in Washington.\n\n  The L.A. Times also reported:\n\n       Scratch ``cap and trade'' and ``global warming,'' \n     Democratic pollsters tell Obama. They're ineffective . . . \n     Control the language, politicians know, and you stand a \n     better chance of controlling the debate. So the Obama \n     administration, in its push to enact sweeping energy and \n     healthcare policies, has begun refining the phrases it uses \n     in an effort to shape public opinion. Words that have been \n     vetted in focus groups and polls are seeping into the White \n     House lexicon, while others considered too scary or \n     confounding are falling away.\n\n  Despite his longtime work on cap and trade, Senator John Kerry \nactually went so far as to say he didn't even know what cap and trade \nis, saying in September:\n\n       I don't know what ``cap and trade'' means. I don't think \n     the average American does. This is not a cap-and-trade bill, \n     it's a pollution reduction bill.\n\n\n[[Page S11465]]\n\n\n  While Senator Kerry says he doesn't know what cap and trade is, the \nAmerican public knows what it is: a massive new energy tax, plain and \nsimple.\n  It has been kind of interesting to watch this change, watch the \nphraseology change as time has gone by. But we know this: Nothing has \nreally changed since Kyoto. It is the same thing, cap and trade, the \nlargest tax increase in the history of America.\n  Let me conclude by saying just how encouraged I am to say that the \ntide has turned--not is turning, it has turned. The skeptics' challenge \nhas been heard, and I am glad to see that more and more journalists are \nno longer reporting the hyped fears that many want the American public \nto believe. Media outlets around the world are more skeptical today of \nmanmade climate fears, and they are also more aware of the enormous \ncost of climate legislation. More importantly, polls are showing that \nthe people are no longer buying the hype either.\n  The bottom line is that efforts to pass the largest tax increase in \nAmerica's history have clearly failed, handing the American people a \ntremendous victory.\n  It has been a long time, some 8 years.\n  I see the Senator from Vermont is very anxious to counter these \nthings I have been saying. That is perfectly all right. That is one \nthing about this body--you have the opportunity to do that. There is no \none I consider a better friend than the person presiding right now, \nfrom Maryland. He and I were elected together many years ago to the \nHouse of Representatives. We disagree on this issue.\n  What I am reporting here is science, and the people have come to an \nagreement. After 8 years, the truth finally does come out.\n  Winston Churchill said: Truth is incontrovertible. Ignorance may \nprevent it. Panic may resent it. Malice may destroy it. But there it \nis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/18/senate-section/article/S11465-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11465-S11467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I do disagree with my friend from \nOklahoma very much, but that disagreement will have to wait for another \nday because today I want to deal with another crisis, and that is the \nsituation regarding health care.\n  I come to the floor to urge my fellow Senators to go forward in \npassing the strongest possible piece of health care reform \nlegislation--legislation which is comprehensive, covering all basic \nhealth care needs; legislation that is universal, covering every man, \nwoman, and child in our country; and legislation, importantly, that is \ncost effective both for individuals and for our Nation.\n  I think all of us understand the United States today is in the midst \nof a major health care crisis. Mr. President, 46 million Americans have \nno health insurance and, importantly, even more are underinsured with \nlarge copayments and deductibles. We have heard some of our rightwing \nfriends talk about death panels. Let me tell you about the reality of a \nreal death panel, not a phony death panel, and that is, this year in \nthe United States, according to Harvard University, some 45,000 \nAmericans will die because they lack health insurance and they do not \nget to a doctor when they should.\n  Mr. President, 45,000 will die this year. And if we do not take \naction, 45,000 or more will die next year. This is the United States of \nAmerica. To see tens of thousands of our fellow country people dying \nbecause they do not have access to a doctor is an abomination, it is \nnot acceptable, and that needs to change.\n  Among many other reforms we need to bring about as we go forward with \nhealth care reform is a revolution in terms of primary health care. \nToday, 60 million Americans, including many with health insurance, do \nnot have access to a doctor. The result of that is, when they get sick, \nthey go to the emergency room, at great cost, or they delay getting \nhealth care, and they end up in the hospital being treated for a far \nmore serious illness than they would have had if they were treated \ninitially. Clearly, this is an absurdity. It costs us lives. It costs \nus money. We have to change that.\n  I am very happy to say that in that regard I have introduced \nlegislation that has 25 cosponsors in the Senate and which has been \nincorporated into the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions bill, \nwhich would quadruple--quadruple--the number of federally qualified \ncommunity health centers in our country over a 6-year period, which \nwould mean there would be a community health center providing excellent \nquality health care, dental care, mental health counseling, low-cost \nprescription drugs in every underserved area in the country. We go from \nabout 1,300 centers to 5,200 centers.\n  Also in this bill, we would increase by 10 times the amount of money \nfor the National Health Service Corps so we can provide debt \nforgiveness for those people in medical school who want to practice \nprimary health care, which in Vermont and around this country is a \ndesperate, desperate need. We absolutely need to increase the number of \nprimary health care physicians we have.\n  When we talk about health care reform, we also have to include dental \ncare. Dental care is often sometimes pushed aside. But I can tell you, \nin many regions of this country, people are finding it virtually \nimpossible to gain access to a dentist and, oftentimes, they simply \ncannot afford the dental care they need. So when we talk about health \ncare, we have to include dental care in that.\n  Furthermore, when we are talking about health care reform, it is \nabsolutely imperative we begin to address the fact that in the United \nStates of America we spend far more on prescription drugs than do \npeople of any other country. This is not just a financial issue for the \nindividual; this is a health care issue. I have talked to physicians \nwho tell me--and I think this is common not just in Vermont but all \nover the country--that some 25 to 35 percent of their patients do not \nfill the prescription the doctor writes because they cannot afford to \ndo that. So what sense is it when somebody goes to the doctor that the \ndoctor writes out a prescription but that individual cannot afford to \nfill that prescription? We need to deal with the high cost of \nprescription drugs, and we can do that in several ways.\n  No. 1, when I was in the House, I was the first Member of Congress to \ntake American citizens over the Canadian border to purchase \nprescription drugs there that cost a fraction of what they cost in the \nUnited States. So we need to pass what is called reimportation--the \nright of Americans and the right of people who manage prescription \ndrugs, who are in that business, to be able to purchase safe, FDA-\napproved medicine from abroad at a fraction of the price the drug \ncompanies are selling those products to them in this country. That will \nlower the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans.\n  Second of all, we, obviously, have to negotiate prescription drug \nprices under Medicare Part D. When we do that--and we lower the cost \nthat Medicare is paying--we can end the doughnut hole which is now \ncausing so many problems for senior citizens today who go above the \nfirst part, where Medicare is paying about $2,500, and then they have \nto pay 100 percent of the cost, which is hurting a whole lot of \nseniors.\n  Thirdly, we must deal with the biologics issue. My colleague Senator \nSherrod Brown of Ohio has been strong on this issue, so that we stop \ndrug companies from having exclusivity for 12 years, preventing generic \ncompanies from getting into the market and lowering the cost of \nbiologics. That is a very important issue.\n  Any serious health care reform legislation must include strong cost \ncontainment. Insurers have increased premiums 87 percent over the past \n6 years, while premiums have doubled over the last 9 years--increasing \nfour times faster than wages. If present trends continue, health \ninsurance premiums will double over the next 8 years, which will be a \ndisaster for millions of Americans and, in fact, for our entire \neconomy.\n  Today, the United States spends far more per capita for health care \nthan any other country on Earth. That is a very important point for us \nto understand. We are now spending over $7,000 per person, and yet \ndespite spending almost twice as much as any other industrialized \ncountry, our outcome in terms of infant mortality, in terms of life \nexpectancy, in terms of immunization and preventable deaths, is often\n\n[[Page S11466]]\n\nbehind other countries. So we are spending huge amounts of money; we \nare not getting value for what we are spending.\n  The cost of health care in this country is now 16 percent of our GDP, \nand it continues to soar at a rate that is basically unsustainable. So \nthis is not, again, just an issue for individuals. This is an issue for \nour economy and our Nation.\n  If you look at a company such as General Motors--General Motors which \nwent bankrupt--they were spending more money on health care per \nautomobile than they were on steel. Small business owners in Vermont \nand across this country are finding it harder and harder not only to \nprovide decent health care coverage for their workers, but in many \ninstances they cannot even provide health care to themselves. What ends \nup happening is, instead of investing their profits into expanding \ntheir businesses and creating more jobs, all of that money is going \ninto the soaring health care costs.\n  But when we talk about the personal impact of our disastrous health \ncare system on individuals, there is no better example than looking at \nbankruptcy. In this country today, we have approximately 1 million \nAmericans who are going bankrupt because of medically related costs. It \nis not hard to understand why: You lose your job in the midst of a \nsevere recession. Somebody in your family becomes very ill. Well, how \ndo you come up with the money if you do not have any health insurance, \nor even if you do have an inadequate health insurance program? The \nanswer is, you go bankrupt. So, incredible as it may sound, close to a \nmillion people in this country this year are going bankrupt because of \nmedically related illnesses.\n  I have talked a little bit about some of the problems that are out \nthere--and there are many more. What is the answer? I do not think \nanyone has a perfect answer. But I do think the United States should be \nlooking at other countries around the world. Why do we end up spending \nso much and get relatively poor value for what we are spending? When we \ndo that, when we look at countries throughout Europe, Scandinavia, \nCanada, and so forth, I think it leads one to the conclusion that if we \nare serious about providing quality, affordable care to all Americans, \nin a cost-effective way, then we must move toward what many of us call \na Medicare-for-all single-payer program.\n\n  I understand, as I think many people do, that because of the power of \nthe insurance companies and the drug companies and the medical \nequipment suppliers, because of their campaign contributions, because \nof their lobbying, the truth is, a single-payer program has never been \non the table from day one since this whole discussion began. I think \nthat is very unfortunate. It is doubly unfortunate because we have many \nthousands of physicians in this country, including the 16,000 members \nof Physicians for a National Health Program, and other health care \nproviders, the largest nurses union in this country, in support of a \nsingle-payer system. Millions of Americans want us to move that way. \nBut because of big money interests, that discussion does not even begin \nto get to the floor.\n  Well, I intend during the course of the debate to offer an amendment \non a national single-payer system. We will see how many votes we get. \nBut what I am also trying to do is give States flexibility so that, if \nthey so choose, they can move forward with a single-payer approach. My \nguess is that if one State does it--whether it is Vermont, California, \nPennsylvania--whichever that State may be, if it works well, if \neverybody in that State has good quality health care, in a cost-\neffective way, it will spread all over the country. I intend to do my \nbest to see that language is in the bill, which will allow States to do \njust that.\n  A single-payer national health insurance program is a system in which \na single public or quasi-public agency organizes health financing, but \ndelivery of care remains largely private. This is not a government \nhealth care program. It is not what they do in the United Kingdom. It \nis public insurance privately delivered.\n  The reason we spend more--and this is an issue that has gotten \namazingly little discussion--why do we end up spending almost twice as \nmuch as any other country? Well, I think that is a good question to \nask. I do not hear a whole lot of answers. The reason is we have a \npatchwork system of for-profit payers. We have private insurance. What \nis the function of a private insurance company?\n  Everybody in America understands the function of a private insurance \ncompany is not to provide health care, it is to make money. What we end \nup with are 1,300 private insurance companies, with thousands of \nseparate systems, each geared to a different group, each geared to make \nas much money as it possibly can. The result is we as a nation are \nspending about 30 cents of every $1 not on doctors and medicine and \nnurses; we are spending it on administration and bureaucracy, huge \nprofits, advertising, billing, sales, marketing--you name it; we spend \nit--rather than spending it actually on trying to keep people healthy \nor make them well.\n  Single-payer financing is the most significant way I know to end the \nwaste and bureaucracy of the current system. What the studies suggest \nis if we move toward a single-payer system, we would save over $350 \nbillion every single year, getting rid of all of that bureaucracy, that \nwaste--the paper shuffling that has nothing to do with making people \nwell.\n  Under a single-payer system, all Americans would be covered for all \nmedically necessary services, including doctor, hospital, long-term \ncare, mental health, dental, vision, prescription drug, and medical \nsupply costs. In other words, unlike anything else I have been hearing, \nit would be comprehensive: all of your basic health care needs. \nPatients, of course, would remain free to choose the doctor and \nhospital they would want, and doctors would retain autonomy over \npatient care, which often is not happening today as they have to argue \nwith insurance companies as to what kind of therapies they can \nprescribe. Physicians would be paid fee-for-service according to a \nnegotiated formulary or receive salary from a hospital or nonprofit HMO \ngroup practice. Hospitals would receive a global budget for operating \nexpenses. Health facilities and expensive equipment purchases would be \nmanaged by regional health planning boards. A single-payer system would \nbe financed by eliminating private insurers and recapturing their \nadministrative waste. Modest new taxes would replace premiums and out-\nof-pocket payments currently paid by individuals and businesses. Costs \nwill be controlled through negotiated fees, global budgeting, and bulk \npurchasing.\n\n  Well, that is where, in my view, we should be going. That is not \nwhere we will go. As I said earlier, that approach is anathema to the \ninsurance companies, the drug companies, the medical equipment \nsuppliers, all of the big money interests, and they have, \nunfortunately, enormous power over what goes on in Congress, so we are \nnot going to go there.\n  Let me say a few words about where we are going. Obviously, we are in \nthe middle of that right now. Last week the House came forward with \ntheir bill. Majority Leader Reid is now trying to meld the two bills in \nthe Senate from the HELP Committee and from the Finance Committee, and \nwe expect that new legislation will be out very shortly. I have not \nseen it; I don't know if anybody has. Let me express a few words of \nconcern about what I have seen in the discussion and the legislation \nthat has been passed in the House.\n  First of all, the average American is saying--I get this in Vermont \nevery day, and I am sure the Presiding Officer gets it in Maryland \nevery day--all right, hey, good, health care reform. That is great. \nWhat is it going to cost me? What do I get? How much am I going to have \nto pay, and what do I get for what I pay? That is the question on the \nminds of millions of Americans.\n  The answer is, at this point--and, again, we have not seen Senator \nReid's bill which will be out almost momentarily, but let me just tell \nmy colleagues about what was in the Senate Finance Committee bill so \neverybody has a sense of what we are talking about.\n  Under the Finance Committee bill--and that is going to change; \nwhether it goes up or down, I don't know, but it will change--a family \nof four in Vermont earning $44,000 a year, which is not an unusual sum \nin my State, would pay about $3,087 in annual premiums, while the \nFederal Government\n\n[[Page S11467]]\n\nwould pick up the rest of the total of $14,700 in premiums. In a year \nwith high medical expenses--in other words, somebody gets ill, somebody \nhas an accident and ends up in the hospital for 3 weeks--that family \nwould pay up to $5,800 out of pocket. So you have premiums of $3,087, \nout-of-pocket costs of $5,800. That is a total potential payment in \npremiums and out-of-pocket expenses of $8,887 for health care under the \nFinance Committee's bill. This would be about 31 percent of the net \nincome, aftertax income, of a family in Vermont, and I don't know that \nVermont is any different than Maryland or any other State earning \n$44,000--31 percent.\n  Somebody could tell us that is health care reform, but I really don't \nsee it. Asking people in this country who, admittedly, have had a tough \nyear with illness to pay 31 percent, and then say, hey, we passed \nhealth care reform, that, frankly, is not good enough for me, and I am \ngoing to do everything I can to make sure the final product out of the \nSenate is a lot better than that for ordinary middle-class families.\n  The second issue that concerns me as we proceed down the line in \nterms of this health care debate is the issue of public option. I think \nthere is a lot of confusion about what a public option is, but let me \nsay this: My belief is the vast majority of the American people want to \nhave a choice as to whether they stay in a private insurance company or \nwhether they go into a Medicare-type public option which is funded by \npremiums. It is not Medicare; it is funded by premiums. But there are \nlarge numbers of Americans, for right reasons--I agree with them--who \ndo not trust private insurance companies because they understand that a \nprivate insurance company wants to make as much money as possible off \nof their premiums. They would like the choice of looking at and maybe \ngoing into a public option. My view is we should make that choice \navailable to as many people as possible.\n  I have the sad thought that many folks out there are hearing us \ntalking about a public option saying: Hey, that is great. I am going to \nhave a choice. I don't like my employer-based health care. Now I am \ngoing to have a public option. That is great.\n  Let me break the bad news to you if that is what you believe. That is \nnot the case as it now stands. Relatively few people--people who are \ncurrently uninsured; small, very small, businesses; people who today \nget their insurance companies privately for themselves or their \nfamilies; the self-employed, those are the people for whom a public \noption is currently available based on what has been passed. I think \nthat is wrong. I think we need to expand it. Frankly, I think virtually \nevery American should have that choice.\n  There is the great debate: Should Members of Congress have the public \noption as our rightwing friends talk about? Yes, we should. And if the \npublic option is better than Blue Cross Blue Shield or private \ninsurance companies, many of us would take it. But as does everybody \nelse, we deserve the option. That is what it is, an option. If you like \nprivate insurance, it is working well for you, stay with it. If you \nlike the public option because it is better for you, you go with it. \nLet's give as many Americans the choice, not 2 or 3 percent but the \nvast majority of the people in our country who are now in private \ninsurance.\n  That takes us to another issue because, in the midst of a bill which \nis very complicated--and I am not a great fan of complicated. I think \nwhen you have a bill that is 1,900 pages, that just begs for the big \nmoney interests and the special interests to get their little things in \nit, and I worry about that a whole lot. This is much too complicated, \nbut there it is. I think the House bill is 1,900 pages. But when we \ntalk about opening the public option for more Americans, it means to \nsay you have to open the exchange, the gateway for more Americans. The \ngateway means if you choose either your private insurance company or a \npublic option, you are going to get subsidized by the Federal \nGovernment. Right now, as this bill stands, there are many people stuck \nin bad private insurance plans.\n  Maybe you work for Wal-Mart, maybe you work for Dunkin' Donuts, maybe \nyou work for McDonald's, and they are offering you some kind of \ninsurance program which either costs a fortune or doesn't cover very \nmuch. Well, under the current legislation, up to now at least, you are \nstuck with that. That is what you have. That is not health care reform, \nto be stuck in a bad Wal-Mart plan. We have to do better than that. So \nwe want to expand that gateway for more people.\n  The other question is--I don't know what Majority Leader Reid's bill \nis going to end up costing, but the estimates are that we are looking \nat about, over a 10-year period, $800 billion to $1 trillion. Well, the \nsimple question is, Where is the money coming from? Where is the money \ncoming from?\n  There are some people who have said: Well, maybe we want to tax good, \nstrong insurance programs out there. That is the way to go. Well, not \nfor this Senator, it is not, and I will do everything I can to oppose \nany movement in that direction. Workers have fought, in many cases, \nlong and hard--given up wage increases--in order to get decent health \ninsurance programs for their families, and now we are going to tax \nthem? Not me. I am not going to do that. This country has the most \nunequal distribution of income and wealth. The rich are getting much \nricher while the middle class is shrinking.\n  I think it is fair as we move forward in health care reform to ask \nthe wealthiest people in this country to start paying their fair share \nof taxes.\n  There is another issue which is kind of a local issue, I admit, and \nthat is on the impact on early-acting States in terms of Medicaid \nreimbursements. It was just in the newspapers today--and I am very \nproud of this--that for whatever it is worth, according to some group, \nthe State of Vermont is now the healthiest State in the country. What \nthat tells me and what I know for a fact is that Vermont, which is not \na wealthy State, has said we are going to take care of our kids. We are \ngoing to make sure that as many kids as possible are involved in what \nwe call our SCHIP program. It is called Dr. Dinosaur. It is a very \ngood, popular program. We are going to have other public health \ninsurance programs. We are going to do the best we can.\n\n  I am proud that today Vermont was acknowledged to be perhaps the \nhealthiest State in the country. I am not going to sit by idly while \nVermont and Massachusetts--another State that has taken major steps \nforward--are penalized because we have made reimbursement rates. \nBecause we have done the right thing is not a reason to penalize us. I \nam all for helping out States that have not done the right thing, but \nwe should not and will not penalize States that have done the right \nthing.\n  So let me conclude by saying this: This country faces a major crisis \nin health care. Because of the power of big money, we are not going to \ndo the right thing and pass a Medicare-for-all, single-payer approach, \nwhich is the only way to provide quality, affordable, cost-effective \nhealth care for all Americans. What we are now looking at is a 1,900-\npage bill which is enormously complicated which clearly has been \nheavily influenced by the drug companies, by the insurance companies, \nand by every other special interest that is making billions off of \nhealth care.\n  I think it is very important as we proceed down this path to take a \nvery hard look at the end of the day as to what this bill will mean for \nmiddle-class families, for working-class families, and for the \nfinancial stability of our country as a whole. I am going to do \neverything I can to make sure this bill is something worth voting for--\nworth voting for.\n  So with that, I thank the Chair for the indulgence, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I seek recognition to speak on the \nnomination of Judge Hamilton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/18/senate-section/article/S11467-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11467-S11471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NOMINATION OF JUDGE DAVID HAMILTON\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I come to the floor--I am a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee--to raise significant concerns about this nominee. There is \nno question he is a fine man. There is no question he has a lot of \nexperience, a great\n\n[[Page S11468]]\n\neducation. But there is also no question in my mind that he is a highly \nactivist Federal judge who will be promoted to a level of making final \ndeterminations on most of the decisions that come before him and his \ncircuit.\n  He does have a distinguished history, but his history is complicated \nby, in my opinion, a view that it doesn't matter what the Congress \nsays; that it doesn't actually matter what precedent says; it doesn't \nmatter what stare decisis, the precedent of the Supreme Court, says; he \nbelieves he can rule against that.\n  After attending his hearings, I would note there were over 10,000 \npages of decisions and his vote on the committee was well before we \ncould actually consider all 10,000 pages of decisions. He was voted out \nof our committee.\n  I want to raise in detail some of my problems and then give some case \nhistories to back them up. For example, I asked Judge Hamilton whether \nhe thought it was appropriate for a judge to consider foreign law when \ninterpreting the Constitution. Rather than recognize the court should \nnot be looking to foreign law when interpreting our Constitution, Judge \nHamilton used an analogy of judges considering law review articles of \nAmerican lawyers with consulting decisions of foreign courts. He \nstated:\n\n       [C]ourts . . . will look to guidance from wise commentators \n     from many places--professors from law schools, experts in a \n     particular field who have written about it. And in recent \n     years, the Supreme Court has started to look at some courts \n     from other countries where members of the Court may believe \n     that there is some wisdom to be gained. As long as it is \n     confined to something similar to citing law professors' \n     articles, I do not have a problem with that.\n\n  I have serious concerns with that. Let me put out what those are. \nWhat he fails to recognize when he equates the two is that professors \nwho are writing on American law in American journals are writing about \nthe interpretation of our Constitution based on American statutes and \nAmerican values. They begin their analysis with an understanding of the \ncreation of our Constitution by our Founders and our system of limited \ngovernment.\n  When American courts look to foreign law, they are considering \nopinions and wisdom of people who do not share our values and who are \nunfamiliar with American statutes and constitutional interpretations. \nBy conflating the two types of references, Judge Hamilton tries to \nminimize the damage courts can inflict on our Constitution when they \nlook to foreign courts for guidance.\n  I was even more disturbed by Judge Hamilton's answers to my written \nquestions following his hearing. In his responses, Judge Hamilton \nembraced President Obama's empathy standard, writing that empathy was \n``important in fulfilling [the judicial] oath.''\n  As a matter of fact, Supreme Court Justice Sotomayor cited just the \nopposite. What she said was that she looks at facts, not empathy. She \nrejected the empathy standard.\n  He also explained why he believed he fit this standard and emphasized \nhis effects-based approach, stating:\n\n       Because I will continue to do my best to follow the law, to \n     treat all parties who come before me with respect and \n     dignity, and to understand how legal rules or decisions will \n     affect behavior and incentives for different people and \n     different institutions.\n\n  That is nowhere in the oath of a judge. Nowhere is that. Considering \nthe consequences of his ruling and how that might affect people should \nnot be part of the decisionmaking, in making the ruling.\n  These statements following his hearing only confirmed what I feared \nprior to his hearing: that Judge Hamilton embraces a liberal activist \nphilosophy and has implemented that philosophy in his legal decisions.\n  As evidence of his activist tendencies on the bench, I will turn now \nto some of his opinions as a district court judge that illustrate his \npropensity to allow his personal biases to influence his decision. In \nthe case of Women's Choice v. Newman, Judge Hamilton succeeded in \nblocking the enforcement of a valid Indiana law for informed consent \nfor 7 years--7 years. The law required doctors to give certain medical \ninformation to women in person before an abortion could be performed \nand required a waiting period before an abortion was performed.\n  There is already precedent, clearly by Casey, in the Supreme Court. \nWhen overturning Judge Hamilton's ruling, the Seventh Circuit harshly \ncriticized his decision by stating:\n\n       [F]or seven years, Indiana has been prevented from \n     enforcing a statute materially identical to a law held valid \n     by the Supreme Court in Casey, by this court in Karlin, and \n     by the Fifth Circuit in Barnes. No court anywhere in the \n     country (other than one district judge in Indiana) has held \n     any similar law invalid in the years since Casey . . . \n     Indiana (like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) is entitled to put \n     its law into effect and have that law judged by its own \n     consequences.\n\n  That is a harsh review.\n  Further, Judge Coffee, in his concurring opinion in this case, was \neven more critical of Judge Hamilton's opinion, and he specifically \ncriticized Hamilton's reliance on one study which was conducted by the \nPlanned Parenthood-affiliated Guttmacher Institute.\n  Here is what he said about Judge Hamilton's decision:\n\n       [His decision] invades the legitimate province of the \n     legislative and executive branches.\n\n  That is the problem with judicial activists. They see no limits. They \ntake a personal bias, and they use that bias rather than interpreting \nthe statutes and looking at precedent. They make their own decision. \nFor 7 years Indiana was without a duly-passed statute passed by the \nelected representatives of that State, in error, because Judge Hamilton \nbelieved something different.\n  He didn't rely on precedent. He relied on his personal bias, a strong \npersonal bias that said that wasn't right, when all the other courts \nhad recognized the precedent by Casey.\n  Here is what Judge Coffee also said:\n\n       As a result, literally thousands of Indiana women have \n     undergone abortions since 1995 without having had the benefit \n     of receiving the necessary information to ensure that their \n     choice is premised upon the wealth of information available \n     to make a well-informed and educated life-or-death decision. \n     I remain convinced that [Judge Hamilton] abused his \n     discretion when depriving the sovereign State of Indiana \n     of its lawful right to enforce the statute before us. I \n     can only hope that the number of women in Indiana who may \n     have been harmed by the judge's decision is but few in \n     number.\n\n  As the Seventh Circuit properly notes, as a result of his activism, \nJudge Hamilton effectively prevented the people of Indiana from \nenforcing a duly enacted, reasonable restriction on abortion in \nviolation of existing law and Supreme Court precedent.\n  In two other cases, Judge Hamilton succeeded in excluding traditional \nreligious expression from the public square. In the case of Hinrichs v. \nBosma, Judge Hamilton prohibited prayers in the Indiana State \nLegislature that mentioned Jesus Christ while allowing those that \nmentioned Allah. The Seventh Circuit reversed that decision.\n  In another case, Grossbaum v. Indianapolis-Marion County Building \nAuthority, Judge Hamilton's decision prohibited a rabbi from placing a \nmenorah in a public building. A unanimous Seventh Circuit court panel \nreversed Judge Hamilton's ruling and noted that he had ignored two \nSupreme Court cases that were directly on point.\n  Why would a learned judge ignore precedent? There is only one reason \nfor ignoring precedent, and that is a judicial activist bias that he \ndoes not have to follow the law; that he is not limited by the \nConstitution, but he is limited to his personal feelings and his \npersonal beliefs. That is the exact opposite of what we want in terms \nof neutrality of those directing court proceedings.\n  Judge Hamilton's record also suggests he is empathetic toward \ncriminal defendants rather than the victims of crimes. According to the \nAlmanac of the Federal Judiciary, local practitioners have said Judge \nHamilton ``is the most lenient of any judge in the district. . . .''\n  ``He is one of the more liberal judges in the district.''\n  ``He leans towards the defense.''\n  ``He is your best chance for downward departures.''\n  ``In sentencing, he tends to be very empathetic to the downtrodden or \nthose who commit crimes due to poverty.''\n  Blind justice doesn't recognize wealth when you commit a crime. It \ndoesn't recognize wealth. If, in fact, that were the case, we should \nhave more severe penalties for people who have greater means. But, \ninstead, we treat everybody the same under the law.\n\n[[Page S11469]]\n\n  I believe his judicial record confirms the statements of these local \npractitioners. For example, in the case of United States v. Woolsey, \nJudge Hamilton ignored the prior conviction of a defendant in order to \navoid imposing a life sentence and was reversed by the Seventh Circuit. \nHe ignored a prior conviction. He chose to ignore it. Activist, not \nfollowing the law, not following the Code of Judicial Conduct. You do \nnot get the choice to ignore it. It is a breach of his judicial oath. \nYet he does it.\n  Here is what the Seventh Circuit said as they criticized Judge \nHamilton's decision:\n\n       [The] Indiana district court was not free to ignore \n     Woolsey's earlier conviction . . . we have admonished \n     district courts that the statutory penalties for recidivism . \n     . . are not optional, even if the court deems them unwise or \n     an inappropriate response to repeat drug offenders.\n\n  In yet another case demonstrating his empathy toward criminals, Judge \nHamilton took the unusual step of issuing a separate written order of \njudgment and conviction ``so that it may be of assistance in the event \nof an application for executive clemency'' because he believed the 15-\nyear mandatory sentence he was forced to impose on a child pornographer \nwas too harsh.\n  In this case, U.S. v. Rinehart, the defendant, a police officer, pled \nguilty to two counts of producing child pornography after he took \npictures of a 16-year-old girl engaged in ``sexually explicit conduct'' \nand took videos of himself and a 17-year-old girl engaging in sexual \nrelations. These images ended up on his home computer, and he was \ncharged under the Child Protection Act of 1984.\n  In a separate written order of judgment, Judge Hamilton concluded by \nstating his personal views in this case and urging executive clemency. \nHe is stating his personal views in this case, in other words, not that \nof a judge. He has stepped out of being a judge. Now, using the role of \na judge, he is using his personal views to influence clemency. Here is \nwhat he said:\n\n       This case, involving sexual activity with victims who were \n     16 and 17 years old and who could and did legally consent to \n     the sexual activity, is very different. But because of the \n     mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years required by 18 U.S.C., \n     2251(e), this court could not impose a just sentence in this \n     case. The only way that Rinehart's punishment could be \n     modified to become just is through an exercise of executive \n     clemency by the President. The court hopes that will happen.\n\n  He later confirmed to us that he thought that action was appropriate. \nWhen Congress passed the Child Protection Act of 1984, at issue in this \ncase, it determined that in order to strengthen Federal child \npornography laws, a child is defined as someone under the age of 18. So \nwhat did Judge Hamilton do? He said what we say doesn't make any \ndifference. The fact that the legislative body signed it, and it was \nput into law by the executive branch--he didn't think that counted \nbecause he didn't agree with it. So he went outside of it to try to get \nclemency based on him thinking we were wrong. He didn't have any basis \nof law to do it, but then did it anyway.\n  In our constitutional system of government the power to create \nlegislation is assigned to the Congress and a judge must simply \ninterpret the law as it is written. This judge refused to do that.\n  When a judge second-guesses Congress, criticizes its legislative \ndecisions as being unfair, and invites a grant of clemency, he \nundermines the rule of law and the confidence the American people have \nin their government. Judge Hamilton's action in this case belies his \ntendency to empathize with criminal defendants.\n  These are just a few of the statements and opinions in Judge \nHamilton's record that form the basis of my opposition. I believe he is \nan activist jurist. He has shown that he will allow his personal biases \nand prejudices to affect the outcome of cases before him. I do not \nbelieve he deserves a promotion to the Seventh Circuit where he will be \neven less constrained by precedent and the possibility of a reversal on \nappeal.\n  I will be voting against his confirmation, and I believe the people \nof this country should be very wary of other judges who have an \nactivist bent, who disrespect the rule of law, who believe they do not \nhave to look at precedent, who, because their personal bias is \ndifferent than what the law says, believe they can be in a position to \neffect change in the law rather than have it come through, or all the \nway to the court, to do that.\n  The job of the judge is to interpret the law and the facts carefully. \nThis judge does not do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The distinguished assistant \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I rise to speak in support of the nomination of David \nHamilton, who is President Obama's nominee to serve on the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the seventh Circuit.\n  This appellate court has jurisdiction over three states, including my \nhome State of Illinois. Because the Supreme Court takes so few cases \nthese days, the circuit courts have the final word in 99 percent of \nFederal cases. In other words, the buck stops with the Seventh Circuit \nfor the vast majority of my constituents when they have a legal \ngrievance.\n  Yesterday, we had to have a cloture vote on the Hamilton nomination \nbecause a majority of Republican Senators wanted to filibuster it. \nThree-quarters of the Republican caucus voted to filibuster Judge \nHamilton. That is astonishing.\n  Judge Hamilton is a moderate, mainstream judge who has earned an \noutstanding reputation during his 15 years of service on the Federal \ndistrict court. He has strong bipartisan support, including the support \nof Republican Senator Richard Lugar.\n  Another reason I was surpri ed to see the filibuster attempt is \nbecause, during the Bush administration, Senate Republicans made speech \nafter speech about their fervent belief that every judicial nominee \ndeserved an up or down vote on the Senate floor. If I had a dollar for \nevery time a Republican Senator advocated for this position, I would be \na wealthy man.\n  This was such an article of faith among the Senate Republicans during \nthe Bush years that they tried to change the rules of the Senate to ban \nthe filibuster of judicial nominees and to require up or down votes. \nThis was called the ``nuclear option'' and the Senate spent days and \nweeks debating this issue. Thankfully, a handful of courageous \nRepublican Senators opposed it, and this cynical effort was defeated.\n  We are today seeing a complete double standard when it comes to the \nway some of my Republican colleagues are treating judicial nominations. \nWhen President Bush was in office, they wanted to rubberstamp every \nnomination. Now that the tables have turned and we have a Democratic \nPresident, we have seen unprecedented obstructionism from the \nRepublican side.\n  Under President Bush, over half of his judicial nominees were \nconfirmed by voice vote or unanimous consent. The Democrats consented \nto their confirmation without requiring time being spent on a rollcall \nvote on the Senate floor. The Republicans, by contrast, haven't agreed \nto a voice vote or unanimous consent on a single one of President \nObama's judicial nominees.\n  In addition, many of the Bush nominees were confirmed within days of \nbeing approved by the Judiciary Committee. The average circuit court \nnominee under President Bush was confirmed just 29 days after being \nvoted out of the Judiciary Committee. By contrast, the average Obama \ncircuit court nominee has had to wait 141 days between the committee \nvote and confirmation. President Obama's circuit court nominees have \nhad to wait five times longer than President Bush's nominees for a \nvote.\n  As a result, the Republicans have ground the judicial nomination \nprocess almost to a halt. They have agreed to votes on only seven of \nPresident Obama's judicial nominees.\n  Let's compare this confirmation rate with the number of judges who \nwere confirmed by Thanksgiving under past Presidents. Under President \nBush, there were 18 judges confirmed by Thanksgiving. Under President \nClinton, there were 28. Under the first\n\n[[Page S11470]]\n\nPresident Bush, there were 15. Under President Reagan, there were 29, \nand under President Carter there were 26. President Obama has had only \n7 judges confirmed--due to Republican stalling tactics.\n  The Republican obstructionism isn't limited to President Obama's \njudicial nominations. As of today, they are holding up 40 different \nnominations, including 10 judicial nominees and 30 executive branch \nnominees. The vast majority of these nominees are noncontroversial. \nThey were passed with unanimous support in the Senate committee of \njurisdiction.\n  Many of the individuals who are being held up by Senate Republicans \nhave been nominated for important administration positions and long-\nvacant Federal judgeships. Without Senate confirmation of these \nnominees, many Americans will see delays in their ability to seek \njustice in our courts, and delays in the ability of the Obama \nadministration to tackle some of our most pressing national problems.\n  Unlike many of the judicial nominees sent up by President Bush, the \ncurrent President has bent over backwards to identify consensus \nnominees--like Judge David Hamilton--who have bipartisan support. Many \nof President Bush's judicial nominees, by contrast, did not have \nbipartisan support or home-State Senator support. With many of \nPresident Bush's nominees, it was clear that the Bush White House \nwanted to pick a fight, rather than a judge.\n  President Obama is a breath of fresh air. Every single one of his \njudicial nominees has the support of their home State Senators, be they \nDemocrats or Republicans.\n  Senator Lugar--a conservative Republican from Indiana--came to the \nSenate floor this week and made a strong and compelling case for Judge \nHamilton's confirmation. When he introduced Judge Hamilton to the \nSenate Judiciary Committee in April, Senator Lugar said the following:\n\n       I believe our confirmation decisions should not be based on \n     partisan considerations, much less on how we hope or predict \n     a given judicial nominee will ``vote'' on particular issues \n     of public moment or controversy. I have instead tried to \n     evaluate judicial candidates on whether they have the \n     requisite intellect, experience, character and temperament \n     that Americans deserve from their judges, and also on whether \n     they indeed appreciate the vital, and yet vitally limited, \n     role of the Federal judiciary faithfully to interpret and \n     apply our laws, rather than seeking to impose their own \n     policy views. I support Judge Hamilton's nomination, and do \n     so enthusiastically, because he is superbly qualified.\n\n  I hope my colleagues across the aisle will keep these words in mind \nwhen they vote on the Hamilton nomination.\n  Is Senator Lugar the only Republican in Indiana who supports Judge \nHamilton? No. Another prominent Republican supporter is the president \nof the Indiana Federalist Society: Geoffrey Slaughter. The Federalist \nSociety is an organization of ultraconservative lawyers, and they don't \ntypically support Obama nominees. But the Indiana Federalist Society \npresident has said:\n\n       I regard Judge Hamilton as an excellent jurist with a \n     first-rate intellect. He is unfailingly polite to lawyers. He \n     asks tough questions to both sides, and he is very smart. His \n     judicial philosophy is left of center, but well within the \n     mainstream.\n\n  Does that sound like the type of judicial nominee who should be \nfilibustered?\n  The critics of Judge Hamilton have singled out a handful of decisions \nin his 15 years on the bench and 8,000 cases. Senator Lugar has done an \nexcellent job explaining why Judge Hamilton's rulings were sensible and \ndefendable.\n  The Hamilton nomination has been pending on the Senate floor for \nnearly 6 months. Enough is enough.\n\n\n                      Nomination of Mary L. Smith\n\n  Madam President, I would also like to discuss another nominee whom \nthe Republicans have been stalling: Mary L. Smith. She is President \nObama's nominee to be the Assistant Attorney General for the Tax \nDivision at the Justice Department. Mary is from my home State of \nIllinois, and Senate Republicans have been holding up her nomination \nfor over 5 months.\n  Mary Smith is a highly qualified nominee who has had a distinguished \n18-year legal career. After graduating from the University of Chicago \nlaw school, she clerked for a prestigious Federal judge and then \nlitigated at a large Chicago law firm. She then worked as a trial \nattorney in the Justice Department's Civil Division and as a lawyer in \nthe Clinton White House.\n  Mary returned to private practice and joined the international law \nfirm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, where she focused on \nbusiness litigation. After 4 years at Skadden, she went to work at Tyco \nInternational, where she managed what has been called the most complex \nsecurities class action litigation in history.\n  Mary has also been deeply devoted to pro bono work and public \nservice, which really tells the story of a lawyer's dedication to the \nprofession. She serves on many bar association boards including the \nChicago Bar Foundation, which helps provide free legal services to low-\nincome and disadvantaged individuals.\n  Mary Smith is not only a highly qualified nominee, she is a historic \nnominee. Mary is a member of the Cherokee Nation and, if confirmed, she \nwould be the first Native American to hold the rank of Assistant \nAttorney General in the 140-year history of the Justice Department. She \nwould be the highest ranking Native American in DOJ history.\n  I was sorry to see that when we took up Mary Smith's nomination in \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, the Republican members voted against \nher. They alleged she was unqualified for the job because she doesn't \nhave as much tax law experience as other recent Tax Division nominees.\n  The Judiciary Republicans are grasping at straws with this \nallegation. First of all, it is an inherently subjective determination. \nThere is no record of how much time Mary Smith has spent working on tax \nissues compared with previous nominees.\n  It is true Mary is not a traditional tax lawyer, but she has worked \non tax law and tax policy issues throughout her career. During the \nyears she worked at Tyco International, she worked closely with that \ncompany's tax department on responding to IRS subpoenas and assessing \nthe complex tax implications of the $3 billion settlement of the Tyco \nsecurities litigation.\n  When she served in the Clinton White House she worked with \ncongressional offices, the Treasury Department, and the National \nEconomic Council to address tax disparities between Indian tribes and \nState governments.\n  And more recently, she served on President Obama's Justice Department \ntransition team, and she helped review and analyze the Tax Division, \nthe very office she has been nominated to lead.\n  The second reason the Republican allegation about Mary Smith's \nqualifications is off base is because Mary has more litigation, \nmanagement, and Justice Department experience than previous Tax \nDivision nominees. Those are critical qualifications to lead the Tax \nDivision. In this respect, Mary Smith is more qualified than her \npredecessors.\n  Mary is a seasoned litigator who has had multiple trials and \ncourtroom experience. The head of the Tax Division needs first and \nforemost to be a person with litigation experience, and Mary Smith fits \nthe bill. She has been a litigator in the Justice Department, in two \nlarge law firms, and in one of the largest corporations in the country. \nTwo of the recent Tax Division leaders--whom the Judiciary Republicans \nhold up as models of what it takes to lead that office--had no \nlitigation experience and never had a single trial.\n  Mary is also more qualified than some of her predecessors when it \ncomes to management experience. The Tax Division is an office with over \n350 attorneys. When she worked on the Tyco litigation, Mary managed \nover 100 lawyers and a $50 million budget. She managed large litigation \nteams while working at the Skadden Arps law firm. And during her \nservice in the White House, she helped manage and coordinate the work \nof multiple Federal agencies. None of the other recent Tax Division \nnominees had as much management experience as Mary Smith, a fact that \nhas little value to the Judiciary Republicans who voted against her.\n  Mary also has more Justice Department experience than her recent \npredecessors. She worked in the DOJ Civil Division as a trial attorney, \nand she was a key member of President Obama's DOJ review team last \nwinter. She understands the Justice Department as an institution, and \nthe perspective of the DOJ career staff.\n\n[[Page S11471]]\n\n  In short, Mary has an excellent background to lead the Tax Division. \nShe has litigation experience, management experience, DOJ experience, \nand tax experience. None of the previous heads of that office had all \nof these qualifications combined.\n  One of those prior Tax Division leaders, Nathan Hochman, has come \nforward in support of Mary Smith's nomination. Mr. Hochman was the head \nof the Tax Division under President George W. Bush, so he's not exactly \na partisan Democrat. Mr. Hochman wrote a letter to the Senate and said \nthe following:\n\n       I am confident Mary will provide strong leadership for the \n     [Tax] Division and is a good choice. . . . Mary's private \n     practice experience in complex financial litigation gives her \n     a working background for the type of cases litigated by the \n     [Tax] Division.\n\n  I would suggest that President Bush's Tax Division leader has a \nbetter understanding of what it takes to lead the Tax Division than a \nhandful of Senators.\n  Ted Olson is another prominent Republican who supports Mary Smith for \nthis position. Mr. Olson is one of the most respected lawyers in \nAmerica and he served as the Solicitor General at the Justice \nDepartment under President George W. Bush. He worked closely with the \nTax Division and represented that office in cases before the Supreme \nCourt.\n  Ted Olson wrote a letter to the Senate and called Mary Smith ``a \nfirst-rate litigator'' and ``a fine choice to be this nation's \nAssistant Attorney General for the Tax Division.''\n  The Senate has received dozens of other letters of support for Mary \nSmith, including many from our Nation's leading Native American \nleaders. They are eager for the Senate to confirm Mary so she can \nbecome the highest ranking Native American in the history of the \nJustice Department.\n  The month of November is National American Indian and Alaska Native \nHeritage Month. We would honor our Native American community by \nconfirming Mary Smith this month.\n  I urge my Republican colleagues to stop blocking this important \nnomination and agree to a vote on my Illinois constituent, Mary Smith.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I rise today to speak in opposition to \nthe nomination of Judge David Hamilton for the Seventh Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  First of all, I would like to speak on the state of the judicial \nnomination process in the Senate. For several weeks now, I have \nlistened to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle speak on this \nfloor about so-called obstructionism by the minority regarding judicial \nnominations. For 214 years, the U.S. Senate enjoyed a tradition of \nholding fair up-or-down votes on judicial nominees regardless of the \nSenate's political makeup. Beginning in 2003, my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle ended that tradition when they successfully \nfilibustered 10 judicial nominations by President Bush whom they \nconsidered ``out of the mainstream.'' At the time, we insisted that \nthis was a bad and inefficient precedent to set. However, the other \nside insisted on traveling down that road. Now the majority claims that \nif we in the minority care about the good of the country, we should \njust let any judicial nomination by the President sail through the \nSenate without any objection. I would encourage those Senators to come \nto my office to listen to the hundreds of Kentuckians who call and \nwrite every day in opposition to the nomination of Judge Hamilton and \ntell those people that they are being ``obstructionists.''\n  Judge Hamilton's judicial record is not only insufficient for the \nSeventh Circuit, it is downright scary. He prides himself on blatant \njudicial activism. On multiple occasions, Judge Hamilton has argued \nthat judges have the power to change the Constitution when making court \ndecisions. He has stated:\n\n     part of our job here as judges is to write a series of \n     footnotes to the Constitution.\n\n  If Judge Hamilton would have properly read the Constitution, I am \nsure he would have realized that it explicitly says that Congress is \nthe only branch which has the authority to make any kind of additional \nmark to that document.\n  Looking at his record, Mr. Hamilton has issued some very troubling \nrulings on child predators. He specifically invalidated a law that \nrequired convicted sex offenders to provide information to law \nenforcement agencies for tracking purposes. In another instance, Mr. \nHamilton petitioned the President to grant clemency for someone guilty \nof producing child pornography. The Supreme Court only hears a small \nfraction of petitioned cases, and, in many cases, precedent is set at \nthe circuit level. Does anyone want someone on the bench setting this \nkind of precedent?\n  Furthermore, in practicing his judicial activist point of view, Judge \nHamilton struck down an Indiana law that simply required women to \nreceive medical information on the effects of an abortion before going \nthrough the procedure. This is a commonsense law and similar laws have \nnever been invalidated by any other judge in the country. The Seventh \nCircuit Court, to which Mr. Hamilton has been nominated, reversed and \nwas harshly critical of this ruling. The Seventh Circuit reversed \nanother outlandish ruling of Judge Hamilton's. He prohibited prayer in \nthe Indiana House of Representatives that mentioned Jesus Christ, but \ninconsistently allowed prayers that mention Allah. These outline a very \ntroubling pattern on the bench.\n  If any of the President's judicial nominees deserve scrutiny, Judge \nHamilton is one of them. His record is clearly out of the mainstream of \npublic opinion and he clearly is motivated to push his own political \nagenda. A good judge is able to set aside his or her own personal \nopinions when deciding cases. I do not believe that Judge Hamilton can \ndo this. I strongly encourage my colleagues to oppose this nomination.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD.

Madam President, I wish to make some brief comments. I will \nyield to my colleague from Colorado, Senator Udall, in a moment, and \nthen at the conclusion of his comments I will propound a unanimous \nconsent request. I will not do that until I know there is an objection \nthat will be rendered, and I would certainly wait until I know that is \ncoming. I will not, obviously, make the request until that person \narrives so they can express their objection. Regretfully, I might add, \nthey are going to express that objection, but, nonetheless, I don't \nwant them to be worried that I would somehow try to sneak this in, \nknowing there is an objection to be filed.\n  I rise this afternoon in support of legislation that would do \nsomething that I think most Americans would support as well, regardless \nof where you live and what your economic circumstances may be; that is, \nto freeze interest rates on existing credit card balances until the \nfull protections of the Credit Card Accountability Act we wrote earlier \nthis year go into effect. As many of my colleagues will recall, on a \nvote of 90 to 5, we passed a bill early this year by a near unanimous \nvote because we all heard the same stories from our constituents across \nthe country: Credit card companies charging outrageous fees; consumers \nfinding out that the interest rates had been jacked up for no apparent \nreason whatsoever; families struggling to make ends meet and being \ndriven further and further and further into debt by what I would \ndescribe as abusive practices.\n  On that day, on the day we passed the bill, we declared that credit \ncard companies were unfairly padding profits at the expense of the \npeople we work for, so we put a stop to it. Today, it is no different, \nunfortunately. Knowing that the Credit Card Act will finally protect \nconsumers from these abuses, the industry has tried to make one last \ngrab for their customers' pocketbooks, and that is what has been going \non over these past several months. I think this behavior is deplorable, \nto put it mildly. We can, once\n\n[[Page S11472]]\n\nagain, put a stop to it, and that is what I will be proposing shortly.\n  The legislation I rise to discuss would immediately freeze interest \nrates on credit cards to ensure that Americans are protected until the \nfull provisions of that law go into effect in February. The holiday \nseason is upon us. Hard-pressed Americans want to go out and do what \nthey can to help their families and to celebrate at a very difficult \ntime. Some joy--and a lot of that will have to occur, obviously, by \ntaking a credit card out to make those purchases during the holiday \nseason, the Thanksgiving break coming up, for putting food on the \ntable, traveling, calling a family member, calling a friend. All those \nactivities, to some degree, given the hardship people are feeling, will \nrequire them to use that credit card in too many cases.\n  To do so, of course, they are watching in this window an industry \ncontinuing to skyrocket these rates as well as these fees on people.\n  Let me tell my colleagues something: The reason we allowed a gap \nperiod between the passage of the legislation and the imposition of the \nregulations or the statutory requirements was because the industry came \nto me and said: Senator, we are going to need some time to administer--\nto change how we provide these kinds of benefits to people, so would \nyou give us a little window here to operate. On the basis of that \nrequest, we did so. They wanted longer, but we thought February was \nfine. If that had been what they had done, I think most of us would say \nwe understand that. Unfortunately, they have taken that window and used \nit as a way to jam in on the consumers of this country, particularly at \na time when, again, people are losing their jobs, their homes, their \nhealth care, their retirement, and the holiday season is upon us.\n  Every 6 months, card companies will be required, under our bill, to \nreview each account they hit with a high rate hike since January of \n2009 and reduce the rate if the customer has become less of a credit \nrisk.\n  As consumers, obviously, we have a responsibility to spend within our \nmeans and to pay what we owe. We bear that responsibility. But the \ncredit card industry as well has a responsibility to deal with their \ncustomers honorably. There is nothing honorable about what has happened \nwith these significant rate increases and fees. Most importantly, they \ndon't have a right to rip off American families, especially when the \nCongress has already gone on record opposing the very actions they are \nengaging in and doing so in a timeframe that was given to them to \nadjust to the new changes that will occur under the credit card \nlegislation. Instead of fulfilling that obligation, they are using it \nas a window to grab as much as they can out of the pockets of hard-\npressed consumers.\n  So let us help consumers have a break in all this. I see my colleague \nfrom Colorado and I will yield to him for a couple minutes and when he \nfinishes his remarks I will make a unanimous consent request that we \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 189, the Credit \nCard Rate Freeze Act; further, that the bill be read a third time and \npassed, and that a motion to reconsider be laid upon the table with no \nintervening action or debate. This would provide us a window of about \n12 weeks--that is what it amounts to, between now and the 1st of \nFebruary--during this holiday season to put a stop to these outrageous \nrates and fees being charged to people.\n  I hope my colleagues, whether you agreed with the bill--although most \ndid; 90 colleagues voted for the bill in the spring--why wouldn't you \njoin us today in allowing 12 weeks for a freeze on these rates that are \noccurring to give our fellow citizens across this country a chance to \nmeet these obligations.\n  With that, I yield to my colleague from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I rise in support of the \nmotion that has been made by the senior Senator from Connecticut, which \nrequests consent for the Credit Card Rate Freeze Act. I wish to \nassociate myself with his remarks. I am a proud original cosponsor of \nhis bill. I wish to urge, as our chairman has, our friends on the other \nside of the aisle to lift their holds on this important legislation.\n  Credit card companies have forced unfair and abusive practices on \nAmerican consumers for too long. I have fought for several years and \nintroduced a number of bills that would put an end to these practices. \nWe passed a law this year that will level the playing field for \nconsumers and put an end to the worst abuses by February of next year.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what has been happening since then. Credit \ncard companies are using that time before the new law goes into effect \nto get rate and fee hikes in under the wire. It is happening at the \nworst time possible, as the chairman pointed out. American families are \nstruggling in a recessionary period. The last thing our families need \nis higher interest rates and extra fees, especially on consumers who \nare already playing by the rules.\n  This has been a classic case of a David versus Goliath situation. I \nsay it is time to take on Goliath and stop credit card companies from \ngaming the system at the expense of American consumers. This bill \nChairman Dodd and I are supporting would provide consumers and small \nbusinesses who play by the rules a better foundation to pay off their \ndebts, or to buy groceries and business supplies, and most important, \nthey should get fair treatment from the credit card companies.\n  This is a critically important bill for economic recovery. It is the \nright thing to do. I urge my friends on the other side of the aisle to \njoin us and allow it to move forward.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank my colleague for his remarks. Many \nothers have similar views on this. I regret that there is going to be \nan objection filed to a measure that would have allowed us to do \nsomething meaningful for our fellow citizens at this time of the year.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of Calendar No. 189, S. 1927, the Credit \nCard Rate Freeze Act of 2009; further, that the bill be read the third \ntime and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nwith no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, on behalf of several Senators on this \nside of the aisle, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I am sorry there is an objection. I \nwill yield to the Senator from New Jersey. I will take the floor after \nthe Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, to my colleague from New York, Senator \nBennet and I are here on a different matter. If the Senator will be \nbrief, I am happy to wait until he finishes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator for his usual graciousness. I \ncommend my colleague from Connecticut for the outstanding job he has \ndone on this issue. I regret that the consent to move to the \nlegislation has been blocked.\n  The bottom line is this: We know there are real problems in the \ncredit card industry. We know that things are happening you would never \nimagine would happen. People are moving interest rates--maybe you had \nyour balance at $4,000, 7 percent, and you know your family budget, and \nthen it goes up to $23,000. This legislation would have stopped that.\n  What the banks are doing now is jumping the gun and moving things \nahead in a way that is very wrong. To move up the date would simply \nmake sure this legislation affects more people than it would have. It \nis a good idea. I hope we will still reconsider it later. I hope the \npublic, who cares about this, will let all Senators from both sides of \nthe aisle know how important this is.\n  With that, I thank the Senator from Connecticut. He has been such a \nleader in fighting for consumers throughout this session. He deserves \nevery American's thanks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I know my colleague from Colorado, \nSenator Bennet, wants to speak to this issue as well. He has been a \nchampion, along with me and several others, to try to bring justice to \nan issue that is incredibly important.\n\n[[Page S11473]]\n\n  It is no secret that decades of indifference and discrimination in \nlending practices at the U.S. Department of Agriculture have made it \ndifficult for minority farmers--specifically Hispanic farmers--to make \na living at what they love to do and have done, in many cases, for \ngenerations, leaving many no choice but to leave the farms and ranches \nthey have tended to all of their lives.\n  In the year 2000, 110 Hispanic farmers brought a lawsuit against the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture for the same egregious discriminatory \npractices that resulted in a historic settlement with African-American \nfarmers. For 8 long years, under the last administration, thousands of \nHispanic farmers who joined the suit waited and waited and waited for \njustice. Some of them died waiting and will never be made whole. For 8 \nlong years, the Bush administration did nothing.\n  These hard-working farmers, Hispanic families, who bought a piece of \nland and built a family farm--their small piece of the American dream--\nwere wrongly denied loans and other benefits in violation of the Equal \nCredit Opportunity Act by county committees that review Farm Service \nAdministration credit and loan applications for approval. Consequently, \nthese farmers filed suit in the hope that it would change the \ndiscriminatory practices at the USDA, how it treated America's minority \nfarmers; but under the Bush administration, nothing changed, the \ndiscrimination continued.\n  Then something did change. We got a new President and a new Secretary \nof Agriculture, who described past practices at the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture as ``a conspiracy to force minority and socially \ndisadvantaged farmers off of their land.'' Consequently, the \nadministration committed to appropriate $1.25 billion in the fiscal \n2010 budget to settle some of the outstanding discrimination lawsuits \nbut not all of them. To date, Hispanic farmers, women, and Native \nAmericans have not yet seen a settlement.\n  We need to remedy this situation once and for all. The new U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture Secretary needs to make these farmers whole. \nSecretary Vilsak has created a task force to review the park and civil \nrights complaints and announce new efforts for the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture to end any and all discriminatory practices, and I commend \nthe secretary for addressing this lingering issue. But more needs to be \ndone.\n  As I said, along with seven of my colleagues, in a letter to the \nPresident, quoting from that letter, we said:\n\n       The U.S. Department of Agriculture's corrective role in \n     this instance has been clearly laid out, and there remains no \n     legitimate reason to delay action for any of the affected \n     groups.\n\n  The fact is that 8 years after a do-nothing Republican administration \nthat earned the U.S. Department of Agriculture the designation of ``the \nlast plantation,'' putting people's lives and livelihoods at risk, we \nsimply cannot wait any longer. Certainly, for example, Alfonso and Vera \nChavez cannot wait any longer. The Fresno Bee reported last week that \nMr. and Mrs. Chavez stopped farming 7 years ago when they could not get \na USDA loan. In fact, they said they not only could not get the loan \nbut they were discouraged from applying and, even worse, they believed \nthey were given misinformation so they would not apply. To quote Vera \nChavez, who told the reporter, ``It was like they didn't want us to \nhave the money.''\n  Mr. and Mrs. Chavez owned 300 acres. They sold off 200 of those \nacres, shut down their packing house, and leased the remaining hundred \nacres to survive. Vera said, ``It is why we have been hanging onto \nthose 100 acres, so my children and grandchildren can have a little \npiece of land we worked so hard to get. I am not going to give up. But \nwe have written so many letters, had so many meetings, and nothing \nseems to be moving forward.''\n  We need to move this forward. It is about fairness, about doing what \nis right. When we see discrimination in any form, and when those who \nhave been wronged because of their race, gender, or heritage are forced \nto sell what they have worked a lifetime to build--abandoned by the \nlast administration that cared more about Wall Street than Main \nStreet--we have to make things right for them, for people like Vera and \nAlfonso Chavez. We need to make sure that they can keep their farms and \ngive them back their lives. All these farmers are asking for is a \ncommonsense solution sooner rather than later, because they have waited \nlong enough.\n  I received a letter that is addressed to the President. It is a \nletter from the named plaintiff in the landmark case Pigford v. \nGlickman. That was a case that brought together African-American \nfarmers in that landmark decision, who were also discriminated against. \nThe letter to the President by Mr. Pigford says, referring to Hispanic, \nNative-American, and women farmers:\n\n       They have suffered the same discrimination by the United \n     States Department of Agriculture as African American farmers. \n     Just as USDA addressed the claims of African Americans on a \n     classwide basis, it should similarly settle the \n     discrimination claims of Hispanic and other minority farmers \n     on a classwide basis.\n       . . . Furthermore, it makes no sense for four minority \n     groups to suffer the identical discrimination from the same \n     federal agency and yet only one of those four groups to be \n     compensated on a classwide basis.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Mr. President, fundamental fairness and simple practice \n     demand that you close the entire book on all discrimination \n     at USDA and, consistent with section 14011, ``resolve all \n     pending claims and class actions in an expeditious and just \n     manner.''\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Mr. Pigford's \nletter to the President.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                November 18, 2009.\n     President Barack H. Obama,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Obama: As the named plaintiff in the \n     landmark case Pigford v. Glickman, I urge you to direct the \n     Secretary of Agriculture and the Attorney General to begin \n     immediately good faith negotiations to resolve the pending \n     discrimination lawsuits brought on behalf of Hispanic, Native \n     American and women farmers pursuant to Section 14011 of the \n     Food, Conservation and Energy Act of 2008 (``2008 Farm \n     Bill''). They have suffered the same discrimination by the \n     United States Department of Agriculture (``USDA'') as African \n     American farmers. Just as USDA addressed the claims of \n     African Americans on a classwide basis, it should similarly \n     settle the discrimination claims of Hispanic and other \n     minority farmers on a classwide basis.\n       As you may be aware, between 1997 and 2000, in addition to \n     my lawsuit, three other identical lawsuits were filed in the \n     same courthouse: my suit on behalf of African American \n     farmers, Keepseagle v. Glickman on behalf of Native American \n     farmers, Garcia v. Glickman on behalf of Hispanic farmers and \n     Love v. Glickman on behalf of women farmers.\n       In my case and the Keepseagle case, two different judges \n     (Friedman and Sullivan) certified the cases as class actions \n     on the basis of USDA's admitted failure to investigate \n     discrimination complaints filed by African American and \n     Native American farmers at USDA's behest. USDA failed to \n     investigate the complaints because it had secretly dismantled \n     its civil rights investigatory apparatus in the early days of \n     the Reagan Administration. In the Love and Garcia cases, \n     however, a different judge, Judge Robertson, refused to \n     certify classes on the same basis that Judges Friedman and \n     Sullivan had applied in my case and Keepseagle, respectively, \n     notwithstanding the fact that the D.C. Circuit had renewed \n     those certifications on at least three occasions and had \n     found no fault with the certifications. Indeed, in my case, \n     the D.C. Circuit expressly approved a settlement that has to \n     date resulted in nearly $1 billion being paid to \n     approximately 15,000 African American farmers.\n       While USDA and DOJ use the lack of class certification as \n     an excuse to refuse to bring about a just and efficient \n     resolution of these cases through negotiations of classwide \n     settlements, such excuses ring particularly hollow. First, \n     USDA and DOJ have steadfastly refused to settle the \n     Keepseagle case despite the fact that it was certified as a \n     class action eight years ago. Second, tens of thousands of \n     African American farmers who missed the filing deadline to \n     participate in the settlement in my case have filed new \n     lawsuits pursuant to Section 14012 of the 2008 Farm Bill. \n     While none of these cases has been certified as a class \n     action, the government has expressed its desire to settle \n     these on a classwide basis and you have announced your \n     intention to appropriate an additional $1.25 billion to cover \n     their damage claims. Third, of the four identical cases \n     handled by three different judges, two judges have certified \n     classes on the basis of USDA's admitted failure to \n     investigate discrimination claims. Fourth, class \n     certification is a procedural matter that does not address \n     the underlying discrimination that is in fact admitted.\n       Secretary Dan Glickman, the original defendant in all four \n     cases, has testified before Congress that USDA has ``a long \n     history of\n\n[[Page S11474]]\n\n     . . . discrimination'' and that ``[g]ood people . . . lost \n     their family land not because of a bad crop, not because of a \n     flood, but because of the color of their skin.'' Rosalind \n     Gray, a former director of USDA's Office of Civil Rights, has \n     testified that ``systemic exclusion of minority farmers \n     remains the standard operating procedure for FSA [the Farm \n     Service Agency].''\n       In addition, both during his confirmation hearing and \n     subsequently, Secretary Vilsack made strong statements \n     expressing the administration's desire, consistent with \n     Section 14011 of the 2008 Farm Bill, to settle all of the \n     pending discrimination cases. Unfortunately, USDA's action \n     have fallen short of the promises contained in Secretary \n     Vilsack's statements. Indeed, the refusal by USDA and DOJ to \n     entertain settlement discussions on a classwide basis is \n     totally at odds with the clearly expressed will of Congress \n     as expressed in Section 14011 and irreconcilable with \n     Secretary Vilsack's repeatedly stated desire to settle all \n     the pending lawsuits. Furthermore, it makes no sense for four \n     minority groups to suffer the identical discrimination from \n     the same federal agency and yet only one of the four groups \n     to be compensated on a classwide basis. The Clinton \n     Administration properly saw fit to order USDA and DOJ to \n     begin negotiations with the representatives of the African \n     American farmers when confronted with the obvious injustice \n     in that case. In announcing last spring an additional $1.25 \n     billion for African American farmers who missed the filing \n     deadline in my case, you stated your hope that your action \n     would ``close a chapter'' in the sorry history of USDA \n     discrimination against minority farmers. Mr. President, \n     fundamental fairness and simple practice demand that you \n     close the entire book on all discrimination at USDA and, \n     consistent with Section 14011, ``resolve all pending claims \n     and class actions in an expeditious and just manner.'' \n     (Emphasis added.) The only thing standing between ``an \n     expeditious and just'' resolution of these cases is the will \n     to do it. You, sir, are in a unique position to end once and \n     for all USDA's all-too-well deserved reputation as ``the last \n     plantation'' and to bring long-overdue accountability and \n     transparency to the USDA-administered farm credit and non-\n     credit farm benefit programs.\n           Respectfully,\n                                               Timothy C. Pigford.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. We urge Secretary Vilsak to ensure all farmers will be \ngranted the same consideration so they can begin to rebuild their lives \nand their farms this year. Despite clear language in section 14011 of \nthe Food Conservation and Energy Act of 2008, which urges the \nadministration to settle lawsuits brought by Hispanic and other \nfarmers, the administration clearly needs to assure Hispanic farmers, \nmany who have come to me, Senator Bennet, and others to ask for help, \nthat it fully intends to address these cases consistent with section \n14011 of the 2008 farm bill.\n  We simply cannot continue down this winding road to nowhere. To \nignore the plight of the thousands of Hispanic farmers, families who \nseek nothing more than justice, who want only a chance to keep the \nfarms and ranches they worked so hard for all of their lives, is wrong.\n  For 8 years, thousands of families like the Chavezes were ignored. \nNow we need to change that. We need to move quickly to resolve what is \nclearly and patently unfair and unjust. You will never turn the page on \nthe past discriminatory practices within USDA until all victims--every \nlast one of them--are made whole for the loss of their land, their \ndignity, and their hope for a decent life for themselves and their \nfamilies. Let us move quickly to give them the chance they have waited \nfor, the chance to rebuild their lives.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I am very pleased to rise today to join \nthe Senator from New Jersey to discuss the injustices committed against \nHispanic farmers over the course of many years. I also thank Senator \nMenendez, the congressional Hispanic caucus, and my colleagues who have \ncome to the floor to demonstrate their leadership on this issue.\n  For the reasons Senator Menendez laid out, it is long past time to \ncall attention to this indefensible injustice and to lend our voices to \na better way forward. As is well known, for years--decades--minority \nfarmers were systematically discriminated against when they visited \nlocal USDA farm service agency offices all across this country. They \nwere denied loans and farm program assistance because of their skin \ncolor, ethnicity, or gender. Senator Menendez did a good job describing \nthe case.\n  I want to give some examples from my State, because in many cases, \nbecause of this discrimination, these farmers lost their livelihoods \nand their way of life. If we choose to let some of them make their \ncase, and deny that chance to others, then we repeat these historic \ncivil rights wrongs all over again.\n  Among the many letters I have received is a declaration from Mr. \nGomez of Alamosa, CO, a former USDA employee who served his country for \n30 years. In seven pages of excruciating detail, Mr. Gomez explains how \nhe, as a loan officer, witnessed discrimination in granting of FSA \nloans. Reasons loans were denied were recorded as ``insufficient \nexperience,'' or other subjective terms. As Mr. Gomez gained more \nresponsibility, he was eventually in a position to review loan \napplications from around the region he supervised, and he became \nincreasingly aware of a pattern of discrimination.\n  In another letter, Mr. Sandoval of Antonito, CO, tells of repeatedly \nbeing turned away from local loan offices and denied FSA loans on \ngrounds that he did not have the ``character'' necessary. Mr. Sandoval \nexplains how his inability to access credit through the USDA limited \nhis ability to grow his farming operation and become a more successful \nfarmer.\n  Another Mr. Sandoval of Commerce City, CO, writes:\n\n       This has been going on for so long that some farmers have \n     lost their lives waiting for justice to prevail.\n\n  Mr. DeHerrera, also of Antonito, CO, writes:\n\n       In desperation, I approached [someone] at the . . . FSA to \n     request a loan of approximately $80,000 so I could at least \n     keep the farm from being foreclosed. . . . He told me very \n     hatefully that they refused to approve either my loan or the \n     loan of the Sandoval brothers.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       I am convinced [FSA] refused to approve the Sandoval's loan \n     because both the buyer and the seller of the farmland to be \n     purchased were Hispanic American farmers.\n\n  Reading through the many letters I have received from Hispanic \nfarmers in Colorado and the meetings I have had all across my State and \nthe letters from people all over the country, a pattern emerges--one of \nthinly veiled discrimination that starts by discouraging Hispanic \nfarmers from applying for FSA loans in the first place. All too \nfrequently, this discrimination resulted in the loss of a farm and the \nloss of a way of life.\n  I have had farmer after farmer say they had to get out of the \nbusiness of farming, that they could not leave their farms to their \nchildren, which is the only dream they have in their life, because of \nthe discrimination they suffered at the hands of our Federal \nGovernment.\n  President Obama's new Agriculture Secretary, Tom Vilsack, has \nrepeatedly, much to his credit, emphasized his commitment to addressing \nthe longstanding civil rights problems that have plagued the Department \nand to charting a new era. I commend the Secretary's commitment and the \ndedication the Obama administration has made to chart a new future for \nthe USDA.\n  Yet that does not fix the wrongs of yesterday. Congress has taken \nsome positive steps, and the administration has created a process for \nresolving the claims of some minority farmers, even dedicating \nsignificant funds toward this end. But a path to justice has not yet \nbeen charted for Hispanic farmers.\n  The best way America can send a message that our government will not \ndiscourage minorities from participating in public programs, will not \ndiscriminate against them, is proactively to pursue justice.\n  It is time the administration and Congress come together and do more \nthan just acknowledge past wrong doing at the USDA. It is time to \naddress that wrongdoing.\n  I will say that my predecessor in this job, Ken Salazar, our great \nSenator from Colorado, now our Interior Secretary, comes from a part of \nmy State called the San Luis Valley. Ken Salazar's family settled that \nland long before Colorado was even a State. If you drive down there and \nvisit San Luis, what you will see is an irrigation ditch that was dug \nbefore our State was even a State. Among the names of the people, the \nnames of the farmers and the ranchers who were entitled to take water \nfrom that ditch because\n\n[[Page S11475]]\n\nthey had been there, and had been there to dig that ditch, is the name \nSalazar, the proud name Salazar. It is wrong, after generations of \npeople have committed their lives and their families to agriculture in \nplaces such as Colorado and all across the country, that we have \ndiscriminated against them for decades and, when that discrimination is \ndiscovered because of some legal technicality or because they got the \nwrong judge, they find themselves unable to redress that \ndiscrimination.\n  I am very pleased to have the chance to be here today with Senator \nMenendez and other colleagues to call this to the attention of the \nadministration and to say that we need to do more than just acknowledge \nthis problem. It is time for us to help address the problem.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, today I join my colleagues in \nbringing this body's attention to an issue of fundamental fairness that \ncontinues to remain unaddressed.\n  More than 10 years ago, Hispanic farmers from my home State of \nColorado joined other Hispanic farmers throughout the country to stand \nup against injustice. They chose to confront--rather than accept--\ndiscrimination when they filed their case against the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture on grounds that the Farm Service Agency denied loans and \ndisaster benefits in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and \nthe Administrative Procedure Act.\n  Earlier this month, I met some of these farmers in Colorado's San \nLuis Valley. Many of these men and women proudly trace their heritage \nto some of the first settlers of Colorado who were the first to till \nthe soil of the San Luis Valley and establish Colorado's earliest \nfarming communities, spurring the development of southern Colorado.\n  Now, I understand that every farmer takes on enormous risk to keep \nour country fed and prosperous. Yet when these farmers applied for \nFederal assistance intended to make them whole again--assistance \nintended to help family farmers stay in business--the record suggests \nthat this aid was denied or delayed, not because their request lacked \nmerit but because of their Hispanic heritage.\n  I found that shocking. It wasn't any weather event that led these men \nand women to financial hardship or the loss of their family farm. The \nobstacles they faced when applying for a loan or disaster assistance \nwere far worse than any drought, flood, hail or windstorm they had ever \nconfronted. It was discrimination based on their heritage that kept \nthem from receiving timely support from an agency whose mission is to \nsupport all of America's farmers equally.\n  Evidence of discriminatory practices in the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture is an unfortunate and shameful part of our history. On \nseveral occasions, I have joined my colleagues in the Senate and in the \nHouse to express our desire to bring this disgraceful chapter to a \nclose. During the most recent debate on America's 2008 farm bill, we \naffirmed that it is the sense of Congress that all pending claims and \nclass actions brought against the Department of Agriculture by socially \ndisadvantaged farmers or ranchers be resolved in an expeditious and \njust manner.\n  I would like to acknowledge that Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack \nhas been courageous in this matter, and I am pleased that the \nadministration views this as a priority. I am also pleased that the \nSecretary has expressed his intent to ensure that no other farmers \nexperience the same discrimination and that he will take definitive \naction to improve USDA's record on civil rights. I remain ready and \nwilling to work with the administration and my colleagues to support \nthis policy.\n  I want to emphasize that this is an issue of fundamental fairness. \nThe sooner we can resolve this, the sooner we can look forward to a \nUSDA that serves all Americans equally. It is my hope that these cases \nbe resolved expeditiously and fairly so that the farmers and their \nfamilies who have suffered the real effects of discrimination can \nfinally put this matter to rest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/18/senate-section/article/S11475-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11475-S11482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COMMENDING ROBERT C. BYRD\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 354, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 354\n\n       Whereas, Robert C. Byrd has served for fifty-six years in \n     the United States Congress, making him the longest serving \n     Member of Congress in history,\n       Whereas, Robert C. Byrd has served over fifty years in the \n     United States Senate, and is the longest serving Senator in \n     history, having been elected to nine full terms;\n       Whereas, Robert C. Byrd has had a long and distinguished \n     record of public service to the people of West Virginia and \n     the United States, having held more elective offices than any \n     other individual in the history of West Virginia, and being \n     the only West Virginian to have served in both Houses of the \n     West Virginia Legislature and in both Houses of the United \n     States Congress;\n       Whereas, Robert C. Byrd has served in the Senate leadership \n     as President pro tempore, Majority Leader, Majority Whip, \n     Minority Leader, and Secretary of the Majority Conference;\n       Whereas, Robert C. Byrd has served on a Senate committee, \n     the Committee on Appropriations, which he has chaired during \n     five Congresses, longer than any other Senator;\n       Whereas, Robert C. Byrd is the first Senator to have \n     authored a comprehensive history of the United States Senate;\n       Whereas, Robert C. Byrd has throughout his service in the \n     Senate vigilantly defended the Constitutional prerogatives of \n     the Congress;\n       Whereas, Robert C. Byrd has played an essential role in the \n     development and enactment of an enormous body of national \n     legislative initiatives and policy over many decades: now, \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate recognizes and commends Robert C. \n     Byrd, Senator from West Virginia, for his fifty-six years of \n     exemplary service in the Congress of the United States.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, when Senator Robert C. Byrd first \nentered the Senate in January 1959, he shared the floor with three \nfuture Presidents: Senators Lyndon Johnson, John Kennedy, and \noccasionally, when a tie-breaking vote was needed, Vice President \nRichard Nixon. Those men now belong to history, but Senator Byrd is \nstill making history.\n  It is an honor to see him make history, once again, as he becomes the \nlongest serving Member of Congress in the history of America. He has \ngiven 56 years, 10 months, and 16 days--a total of 20,744 days--of \ndedicated service to the Congress, to the Constitution of the United \nStates of America, and, of course, to his beloved West Virginia. What a \nremarkable achievement.\n  Senator Byrd's masterful, four-volume history of this body is the \ndefinitive account. His own historical records could fill nearly a \nvolume of history for the Senate on its own. He served in Congress \nwith--not under--11 different Presidents. Three and a half years ago, \nhe became the longest serving Senator in our Nation's history, and he \nis the only Senator ever elected nine times to the Senate. He has cast \nmore votes--18,585--than any other Senator in history. All these \nrecords are unlikely ever to be broken.\n  He has also presided over both the shortest session of the Senate in \nhistory--six-tenths of a second on February 27, 1989--and the longest \ncontinuous session--21 hours, 8 minutes--on March 7 and 8, 1960. He has \nheld more leadership positions--majority whip, minority leader, \nmajority leader, and President pro tempore--than any other Senator in \nhistory.\n  During the administration of President Jimmy Carter, Senator Byrd, \nthen the majority leader of this body, was criticized by some for not \ndoing enough to help the President of his party. Senator Byrd replied:\n\n       I am not the President's man. I am a Senate man.\n\n  He is a passionate and unyielding defender of Senate rules and \nprerogatives--not as an end in themselves but as a means of preserving \nour Constitution and our balance of power.\n  I will always remember his eloquent and valiant effort which he waged \nin 2003 to try to persuade this Senate not to grant broad war-making \nauthority to the executive branch. He was a true study in political and \nmoral courage and it was not missed on the population of America. When \nmy wife and I attended church in Chicago at Old St. Patrick's, our \nregular parish, after the\n\n[[Page S11476]]\n\ncommunion, as we were kneeling in our pews, an older man came by and \nleaned over, obviously having followed the Senate debate on the war in \nIraq, and said to me in a voice that could be heard around the church: \n``Stick with Bob Byrd.'' I told Senator Byrd that story and he loved \nit.\n  It is fitting that Senator Byrd keeps a copy of the Constitution in \nhis breast pocket because its promises and obligations are always that \nclose to his heart. In 2001, he was named West Virginian of the Century \nby his Governor and legislature. Indeed, the name ``Robert C. Byrd'' is \nnearly synonymous with West Virginia.\n  The story of his early life is the story of struggle and great \nachievement. It also is a story highlighted by his marriage to his high \nschool sweetheart Erma Ora James Byrd, a coal miner's daughter. He \nmarried her in 1937, and she was his rock for 69 years.\n  He never gave up on his dream of higher education, earning his law \ndegree from American University in 1963 after attending night school \nfor 10 years. He earned his bachelor's degree from Marshall University \nin 1994, at the age of 77.\n  He has been winning elections for 63 years, and he has never--not \nonce--lost a race. He was elected in 1952 to the House, where he served \nthree terms. Before that he served in the house of delegates and the \nsenate of his home State of West Virginia. He is the only person in the \nState's history to carry all 55 of the State's counties--a feat he \naccomplished several times--and the only person in the State's history \nto run unopposed to the Senate of the United States.\n  Eleven years ago, Senator Byrd spoke about his devotion to the Senate \nas part of the Leader Lecture Series. He called this Senate ``the \nanchor of the Republic, the morning and evening star in the American \nconstitutional constellation.''\n  He described the great panoply of men and women who have served in \nthis body. He has said this Senate ``has had its giants and its little \nmen, its Websters and its Bilbos, its Calhouns and its McCarthys.''\n  I would offer as well that there has only been one Robert C. Byrd. He \nis a unique patriot, a singular Senator, a Senator's Senator.\n  We are honored to share this historic milestone with him today. We \nthank him for his lifetime devotion to America, the Senate, and his \nbeloved Constitution. West Virginia can be proud of this great man who \nhas served them so well for so long.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I hope Senator Byrd may be \nwithin the reach of my voice because I wish to add my voice to the many \nwho have commended him for his public service, especially today as we \nmark a milestone in the history of this Nation because our Senate \ncolleague, our President pro tempore, becomes the longest serving \nFederal lawmaker since the founding of this country.\n  Many this week are depicting Robert Byrd's long list of achievements \nin numbers, and it is large numbers, and there are certainly many of \nthose achievements. The Senator from West Virginia, for instance, \nactually began serving in the Senate the same year that Alaska became a \nState, 1959. He has been elected to no fewer than nine Senate terms. \nBefore the Senate, he served in the House for 6 years, and now in the \nSenate for 50 years, 10 months, and 18 days. He has cast well over \n18,500 votes.\n  Senator Byrd has presided over the longest session of the Senate--\nmore than 21 hours--and he has presided over the shortest. We have had \nno fewer than 11 Presidents since he first took office.\n  But the numbers don't tell all of the story because Robert Byrd has \nbeen one of the greatest representatives of and advocates for the folks \nin his beloved State of West Virginia. He is that larger-than-life, \nthat iconic figure in our Nation's history too. He is the Senate's \npremier Member-observer. He is the Senate's institutional history.\n  I flash back to that first day--and you never forget the first event \nof an occurrence in your life. It was my maiden speech, my first speech \non the floor of the Senate 9\\1/2\\ years ago. I was at one of those \njunior desks right over there. I gave my maiden speech. It was actually \non the budget. We happened to have a surplus then. I was laying out how \nwe ought to preserve that surplus; as a matter of fact, even use it to \npay down the national debt. I happened to mention in the course of my \nremarks that it was my maiden speech. All of a sudden those doors swung \nopen and in strode Senator Byrd, that white shock of hair flowing as he \ntook his place over there on the center aisle.\n  As I finished my remarks, he said: Will the Senator from Florida \nyield? And I said: Of course, I yield to the senior Senator from West \nVirginia. Senator Byrd proceeded to give extemporaneously a history of \nthe maiden speeches in the Senate.\n  Of course, I was spellbound, I was awestruck, as I listened to this \nwalking American political history book recite from memory, on that \nparticular occasion, something that had been important to this Senator \non the occasion of my very first speech in this extraordinary august \nbody.\n  Senator Byrd continues to be the Senate's conscience. In the spirit \nof Thomas Jefferson, Robert Byrd has always put public service ahead of \npersonal fortune. On many of our desks--and it is certainly in my \npersonal office in the Senate--are Senator Byrd's addresses on the \nhistory of the Senate. There were more than 100 of them delivered in \nthe past 10-year period. They have been called the most ambitious study \nof the Senate that had ever been undertaken. Every day they serve to \nremind me of the living history of this institution and its vital role \nin our democracy.\n  Senator Byrd has been a dear personal friend to so many of us. He has \nbeen such a mentor.\n  Madam President, since the Vice President of the United States has \njust entered the Chamber, I wanted to recall for him that 9 years ago, \nin our freshman class of Senators, Senator Byrd took us on as a special \nproject to teach us the protocol of how to preside. I can tell you what \nclass a Presiding Officer comes from now, if it was a class that was \nunder the tutelage of Senator Byrd, because there was a right way and a \nwrong way to preside in the Senate. The Vice President is acknowledging \nthat is true.\n  By the way, I have the privilege of standing at the desk the Vice \nPresident used to occupy. I particularly chose this desk because not \nonly has he been such a great mentor to me personally but a very dear \nfriend.\n  With Senator Byrd, all of us grieved with him 3 years ago when his \nbeloved wife Erma passed away. I know he yearns for her and wishes she \ncould be by his side on this historic day.\n  Now there is another number that is going to be important in Robert \nByrd's life. In just 2 days, he celebrates his 92nd birthday. We all \nhope we can be here with him for many more years.\n  Remember what President Reagan had to say about age and leadership. \nHe said:\n\n       I believe that Moses was 80 when God first commissioned him \n     for public service.\n\n  If the Lord is using that same commissioning for Senator Byrd, at 92, \nhe has a long way to go. The Lord would certainly say to Senator Byrd: \nWell done, my good and faithful servant.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I congratulate Senator Byrd on this \nhistoric milestone. It has been my pleasure and a great honor to work \nand serve with Senator Byrd during his service to our Nation. He has \nserved as a devoted champion to his home State of West Virginia. \nSenator Byrd is worthy to be part of the history of the United States, \nas he now becomes the longest serving Member of the Congress of the \nUnited States of America. I am pleased to join my colleagues in paying \ntribute to his great service and the accomplishments of this great \nAmerican, Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, following on the heels of \nmy colleague Senator Inouye, I congratulate Senator Byrd on his many \nyears of public service. Today Senator Byrd passed a landmark in the \nSenate. He is the longest serving Senator. He came to the Congress in \nmy father's class of representatives in 1954. My father Stewart Udall \nand the entire Udall clan\n\n[[Page S11477]]\n\ncongratulate him on his record-setting years of public service.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to Senator \nRobert C. Byrd as he becomes the longest-serving Member of Congress in \nAmerican history. Senator Byrd has served 56 years and 320 days. During \nhis time in the Senate Senator Byrd has cast more than 18,500 votes, \nmore than any Senator in history.\n  Senator Byrd was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in \n1952, and he was sworn in to the U.S. Senate on Jan. 3, 1959. This was, \ncoincidentally, the same day that Alaska became a State, and before \nHawaii was admitted to the Union. He is now serving an unprecedented \nninth term in the Senate.\n  Yet, to discuss only his longevity would do a grave disservice to the \nreality of what Senator Byrd has meant to the U.S. Senate and to this \ncountry. Many distinguished Members have had long careers in the \nSenate, but I believe it is safe to say that none have contributed more \nto the preservation of the history, traditions and strength of the \nSenate than Robert C. Byrd. His knowledge of and reverence for the \nConstitution has served over these many years to remind us time and \nagain of the beauty, eloquence, and timelessness of that document, and \nthe importance of relying upon it as the touchstone of our \ndeliberations.\n\n  Senator Byrd has had many great legislative and oratorical \nachievements in his time in the Senate, but I wanted to refer briefly \nto just one today. His outspoken opposition to giving President George \nW. Bush the power to wage war against Iraq was an inspiration to those \nof us who shared his views, and he never forgot those who were with him \non that vote. The eloquence and passion with which he expressed his \nviews were extraordinarily powerful; his floor speeches exemplified the \npower of language to shape ideas. I believe that what has transpired in \nIraq since those speeches has affirmed the courageous stance that he \ntook.\n  In conclusion, it is an honor and a privilege to serve with Senator \nByrd, and I congratulate him on this great milestone.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I wish to pay special tribute to Senator \nRobert C. Byrd. Today, Senator Byrd becomes the longest-serving Member \nin the illustrious history of the U.S. Congress. What an amazing \naccomplishment! He already holds the distinction as the longest-serving \nSenator, and is the only Senator in U.S. history elected to nine full \nterms.\n  Considering that Senator Byrd won his first election, to the West \nVirginia House of Delegates, in 1946, it may be that he is the longest-\nserving elected official in history--period.\n  When Robert Byrd was elected to the Senate in 1958 after serving in \nthe House for 6 years, he was part of a large, distinguished class that \nincluded such future giants as Hugh Scott, Gene McCarthy, Edmund \nMuskie, and Philip Hart (D-MI). He has surpassed them all.\n  According to the Senate Historical Office, Robert Byrd was the \n1,579th person to become a U.S. Senator. Since he was elected to the \nSenate, another 334 individuals have become U.S. Senators. All in all, \nRobert Byrd has served with over 400 other Senators. And I am certain \nthat all of them have held their colleague, as I do, in the highest \nesteem.\n  Senator Byrd's modest beginnings in the hard-scrabble coal fields of \nAppalachia are well known. Suffice it to say that his life is the \nquintessential American success story.\n  I think every young American should learn about Senator Byrd's life \nas an example of what hard work and persistence and devotion can \naccomplish in this country.\n  Senator Byrd married his high-school sweetheart, Erma Ora James, \nshortly after they both graduated from Mark Twain High School in 1937. \nHe was too poor to afford college right away and wouldn't receive his \ndegree from Marshall University until 60 years later when he was 77. In \nbetween, he did something no other Member of Congress has ever done: he \nenrolled in law school at American University and in 10 years of part-\ntime study while serving as a Member of Congress, he completed his law \ndegree.\n  Senator Byrd was married to his beloved Erma for nearly 69 years, and \nhas been blessed with two daughters, six grandchildren, and seven \ngreat-grandchildren.\n  During his Senate tenure, Robert Byrd has been elected to more \nleadership positions than any other Senator in history. He has cast \n18,585 rollcall votes. Only 28 other Senators in the history of the \nRepublic have cast more than 10,000 votes; Strom Thurmond is the only \nother Senator to cast more than 16,000 votes. Senator Byrd's attendance \nrecord over the past five decades just under 98 percent is as \nimpressive as the sheer number of votes cast he has cast.\n  Senator Byrd's legislative accomplishments, from economic development \nand transportation to education and health care, are legendary. It is \nno surprise that he has won 100 percent of the vote of West Virginians \nin a previous election, 1976, or carried all 55 of West Virginia's \ncounties.\n  In the meantime, he has written five books, including the definitive \nhistory of the U.S. Senate.\n  Perhaps the highest tribute to Senator Byrd can be found in his \nbiographical section of the ``Almanac of American Politics,'' which \nstates: ``Robert Byrd may come closest to the kind of senator the \nFounding Fathers had in mind than any other.'' His fealty to the U.S. \nSenate and to the Constitution has served as an inspiration, a lesson, \nand a guiding light to all of us who have been privileged to follow him \nin this chamber.\n  Robert E. Lee said, ``Duty is the most sublime word in our language. \nDo your duty in all things. You cannot do more. You should never wish \nto do less.'' Senator Robert C. Byrd has done his duty in all things--\nto himself, to his family, to his State, to his Nation, and to God.\n  I am honored to join his and my colleagues here in the Senate, West \nVirginians, and all Americans in paying tribute to this great Senator \nand this great man.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I rise today to recognize the longest-\nserving lawmaker in congressional history; I rise to recognize a \nleader; and I rise to recognize a friend.\n  Senator Byrd has served in Congress for over 56 years. His tenure has \ntraversed 9 elections, 18,000 votes, 20,000 days, and 11 Presidents. I \nhave had the privilege of serving with Senator Byrd on the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security. I am proud of our \nefforts to protect Americans and make our Nation more secure, \nespecially in the area of border security and addressing the threat of \nweapons of mass destruction. Senator Byrd was a terrific partner, and I \nvalued his input. And when we would give introductory remarks at the \ncommittee markup of our bill, I have never received such generous \ncompliments from another lawmaker. I hope Senator Conrad, my \ncounterpart on the Budget Committee, is taking notes.\n  More recently, it is a testament to his character and sense of duty \nthat after battling illness and absence earlier this year, Senator Byrd \nreturned to once again craft our Nation's homeland security budget: a \n$44 billion measure that funds natural disaster response, antiterrorism \nefforts, and other critical programs to meet and repel the various \nthreats facing our homeland.\n  Lastly, I want to recognize Senator Byrd for his dedication to the \nSenate as an institution and his understanding of its inner workings. \nNo one can better recite or describe Senate rules and parliamentary \nprocedures or better defend them. His encyclopedic knowledge of the \nSenate, as well as the copy of the U.S. Constitution which he always \ncarries in his jacket pocket, is something that we can all respect and \nappreciate. He is a man committed to the principles and laws that \nfounded our great Nation, and for that we should be thankful.\n  In closing, we have much to thank Senator Byrd for: merit-based \nscholarships; teacher training programs; and the strengthening of \nAmerican history curriculum in our schools. But one thing that many of \nus and our constituents might take for granted, Senator Byrd is \nresponsible for the cameras in the Senate Chamber. As he often does, \nSenator Byrd put it eloquently when he said that proceedings should be \ntelevised to prevent the Senate from becoming the ``invisible branch'' \nof government. I couldn't agree more.\n  Before yielding the floor, let me be one of the first to wish our \nesteemed colleague an early Happy Birthday. He\n\n[[Page S11478]]\n\nturns 92 this Friday. Happy Birthday, friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I will be 30 seconds because I believe we \nare ready to adopt a resolution. It has been a long time since I was a \nyoung Senator listening to a man who was even then a giant of the \nSenate. For hours, Senator Robert C. Byrd would speak eloquently, and \nusually from memory, on the history and traditions of the Senate. Even \nthen, it was clear to me there had been few combinations more \nfortuitous in the history of our Nation than that of Robert Byrd and \nthe Senate.\n  We celebrate today as he becomes the longest serving Member in the \nhistory of the Congress. There have been many beneficiaries of that \nlong service: the people of West Virginia, whom he has served so ably; \nthe citizens of the United States, who have been fortunate to reap the \nrewards of his knowledge and commitment; and, more personally for us \nhere, the Members of the Senate, and most personally, me.\n  His career is even more remarkable for its depth than for its length. \nIn addition to more than half a century in this body, Robert Byrd \nmanaged to work as a butcher, a ship welder, and a Member of the House \nof Representatives. He learned to play the fiddle, became a recognized \nexpert on Rome's senate, and wrote or edited nine books. It says much \nabout him as a person that he was never out of place in the coal \ncountry of West Virginia, even as he moved to the highest levels of our \ngovernment.\n  There is seldom any doubt where Senator Byrd stands on an issue, be \nit the decision to go to war in Iraq or a challenge to the prerogatives \nof the Senate. But in those instances where history or his own \nreflection have shown him to be mistaken, he has shown the rare grace \nto accept responsibility for his own imperfections, and ask for \nforgiveness. In this, as in many other things, he is truly an example \nto emulate.\n  He is rightfully honored not just for his knowledge of the Senate, \nbut for a fierce determination to protect its traditions, procedures, \nand its role in our system of government. I have seen this \ndetermination up close, perhaps never so clearly as in 1996, when he \nand I, along with Senator Moynihan, filed an amicus brief with the U.S. \nSupreme Court on the subject of the line-item veto. Congress's approval \nof the law establishing this veto occurred over Senator Byrd's powerful \nand learned opposition, and after it became law, he continued to oppose \nwhat he saw, and I saw, as a clear violation of the constitutionally \nmandated separation of powers. In this instance and many others, the \nSenate and the Nation have benefitted from his immense knowledge of the \nConstitution and his ability to focus that knowledge on the issues \nbefore us. Before party or personal preference, Robert Byrd places the \nConstitution--a document always at hand in the Senator's pocket.\n  More than 3 years ago, Senator Byrd reached another milestone--\nbecoming the longest serving Member of the Senate. Let me repeat \nsomething I said then: ``That is the tribute we can all pay to Robert \nByrd: to defend this institution, to stand for its procedures, and to \ncarry, as he does, at least in our hearts, the Constitution, as he \ncarries the Constitution on his body.''\n  I conclude with congratulations not just to Senator Byrd and not just \non the longevity of his service, but on the depth of its quality and \nthe love he has for the Senate, his commitment to constitutional \ngovernment. We remember this day also his love for his beloved wife \nErma who was a blessing to Robert, a blessing to their family, and a \nblessing to our Senate family.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I would like to commend and congratulate \nmy colleague Senator Robert Byrd on the momentous accomplishment of \nbecoming the longest serving Member of Congress.\n  Senator Byrd has spent 56 years and 320 days serving the people of \nWest Virginia, in that time casting more than 18,500 votes.\n  He is a fierce advocate for his home State of West Virginia, a mentor \nand disciplinarian with new Senators. And he possesses an encyclopedic \nknowledge of Senate history, rules, and procedure. The current \nPresident pro tempore of the Senate, he has held more leadership \npositions than anyone in Senate history.\n  I am honored to have worked alongside a man who will go down in \nhistory as a great American public servant, and I look forward to \nworking with Senator Byrd for years to come.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, how lucky we are to have the great \nSenator from West Virginia--20,744 days spent in this ``sanctuary,'' \nthis Senate Chamber, which I have heard him call, on more than one \noccasion, ``the very temple of constitutional liberty.''\n  Within just a few days of my arriving here in 2001, I was instructed \nin no uncertain terms to go and see Senator Byrd, to listen to him, and \nto learn from him. And so I went and I listened and I learned. I \nlearned about the history of this great body. I learned about the \nimportance of the rules and decorum of the Senate.\n  It is such an honor to be a Member of this body but also an awesome \nresponsibility. For 20,744 days, Senator Byrd has been fighting for the \npeople who sent him here, for the great men and women of West Virginia, \nand for all the people of this country.\n  He is an inspiration.\n  I was proud to be 1 of the 22 Senators who stood with him against the \nIraq war. I was proud to stand with him on so many occasions to fight \nfor the working men and women of this country--whether they be coal \nminers in West Virginia or autoworkers in Detroit. And I am proud to \nstand here today, with so many of my colleagues, to honor Senator \nByrd's remarkable service.\n  Right outside my office, I proudly display a print of a painting made \nby the Senator from West Virginia, a very beautiful scene of West \nVirginia tranquility. Whenever I see it, which is every day, I am \nreminded of my colleague, of his extraordinary service, of his fierce \ndedication to liberty, and of his humble respect for the Constitution \nof our great country.\n  Madam President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his \nfriendship, for his wisdom, and for his great service to our country.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, today we honor Senator Robert C. Byrd for \n20,744 days of service in the Congress of the United States. That feat \nof endurance is laudable, but certainly not surprising.\n  This is the man who has memorized volumes of poetry and analyzed \nlibraries of great books, histories, legislation, and speeches. This is \nthe man who attended law school at night while serving in the House of \nRepresentatives and then the Senate. This is the man who remembers \nevery important date--Veterans Day, Mothers Day, the Fourth of July--\nwith a carefully crafted, masterfully delivered oration on the Senate \nfloor. This is the man who has held the most powerful positions in the \nSenate and has faced the most powerful adversaries on its floor and in \nCommittee.\n  No one should be surprised, then, that this is the man who has served \nlongest in the United States Congress.\n  But we are not just here to commemorate the days Senator Byrd has \nserved. We are here to honor the service he has rendered.\n  Senator Byrd has served West Virginia. In those 20,744 days \nrepresenting them, Senator Byrd has spent countless hours--in the \nAppropriations Committee, on the floor, in the offices of his \ncolleagues--fighting for his people.\n  Senator Byrd has served the Senate. When I was first elected, Senator \nByrd schooled me, as he has almost everyone in this body, in the \nnuances of Senate rules and traditions. He sat on the floor when I gave \nmy first speech and made me understand the gravity and privilege of \nbeing a U.S. Senator. He has written the definitive, four-volume \nhistory of the Senate while earning himself a place in those pages \nalongside Senators Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, Robert Lafollette.\n  And Senator Byrd has served this country. He carries our Constitution \nnext to his heart and wields it like a sword against those who put \npolitics above principle. He has defended the Senate's constitutional \npowers in front of the Supreme Court, arguing passionately against the \nline item veto--and in front of the world, arguing for the Senate's \nproper role in issues of war and peace.\n\n[[Page S11479]]\n\n  In years of working with Senator Byrd, I have had the honor of \ngetting to know a true American patriot and call him friend. Senator \nByrd has never let down the people of West Virginia and steadfastly \nupheld our beloved Constitution. He will forever be known not just as \nCongress's longest standing member but as its strongest standing \nmember. I thank him--as he taught me, through you, Mr. President--for \nhis friendship and his service to the Senate, to the Constitution, and \nto the United States of America.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I would like to add my congratulations \nto Senator Robert C. Byrd on his historic achievement today. Not only \nis he the longest serving senator in the history of this body, but \ntoday he is the longest serving Member of Congress in the history of \nour Nation.\n  For more than 50 years, Senator Byrd has been a steadfast defender of \nthe Constitution and the principles on which it stands. Senator Byrd is \ntruly a statesman, a patriot, a proud son of West Virginia, and an \nimportant voice in the history of this country.\n  Senator Byrd has come a long way from the coal fields of West \nVirginia where he grew up in poverty and learned the value of hard \nwork. He first came to Washington in January 1953--20,774 days ago--\nwhen he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. He served in \nthe House for three terms before being elected to the Senate, where he \nhas served the people of West Virginia faithfully for the last 50 \nyears.\n  Over the years, Senator Byrd has never forgotten his roots and the \nState and the people that he loves. The people of West Virginia have \nrecognized his achievements and hard work on their behalf in the Senate \nand have elected him for an unprecedented nine terms in the United \nStates Senate. He has served with 11 Presidents. Can you believe that?\n  To add to his long list of achievements, Senator Byrd has also held \nmore leadership positions than any other Senator in history. This \nincludes Senate majority whip, chairman of the Democratic Conference, \nSenate minority leader, and Senate majority leader. Currently, Senator \nByrd is the president pro tempore. Throughout his career, Senator Byrd \nhas cast nearly 18,600 roll call votes in five decades of service in \nthe Senate. I'd say that's an unprecedented record.\n  Senator Byrd is also the longest serving member of the esteemed \nAppropriations Committee. He has served as its chairman or ranking \nmember since 1989 until stepping down earlier this year. It has been my \nhonor to serve with him on the Appropriations Committee and I have \nlearned a tremendous amount under his leadership.\n  Many of us know Senator Byrd as our resident historian. He has a \nwealth of knowledge about the procedures of the Senate and shares \nenthusiastic stories of the many interesting events that have occurred \nin this Chamber. He is also the author of a magisterial four-volume set \nabout this body entitled ``The Senate, 1789-1989'', and other works.\n  He also had a unique talent outside the halls of Congress. Senator \nByrd learned to play the fiddle at a young age and carried it with him \neverywhere he went. His skill with the instrument led to performances \nat the Kennedy Center and on a national television appearance on Hee \nHaw. He even recorded his own album, Mountain Fiddler.\n  No tribute to Senator Byrd would be complete without mentioning his \nlife's love, Erma Ora James. For nearly 69 years, the Byrds were \ninseparable, traveling throughout their native West Virginia and \ncrossing the globe together. Sadly, Mrs. Byrd passed away on March 25, \n2006, but Senator Byrd speaks lovingly of her and their life together \neach day.\n  The times have changed considerably since Senator Byrd first came to \nWashington. We have seen a man walk on the Moon. We have mapped the \nhuman genome, and we have seen unbelievable technological advances that \nhave changed the way we live, work and communicate. But through it all, \nthe one constant is Senator Byrd's steadfast championing of our \nConstitution and the people of West Virginia.\n  Senator Byrd is to many the voice of the Senate, and it has been my \nprivilege to serve with him and learn from his stories and wisdom. The \nSenate is a stronger institution and a better place because of the many \nyears of service of Senator Byrd. I join my colleagues in offering my \ncongratulations to him on this important day and wish him well as he \ncelebrates his 92nd birthday later this week.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I join my colleagues today in \ncongratulating Senator Robert C. Byrd on reaching yet another milestone \nin a long and very distinguished career.\n  Today, Senator Byrd has served 20,774 days--that is 56 years and \n10\\1/2\\ months in Congress--making him the longest serving Member in \nU.S. history.\n  Senator Byrd has attended 18,582 Senate rollcall votes.\n  He cast his first votes in the Senate, in January 1959, when Dwight \nEisenhower was President. John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson were \namong his Senate colleagues. And Hawaii was not yet a State.\n  He has served in the Senate longer than 10 of his current colleagues \nand President Obama have been alive--Bob Casey, Jr., Amy Klobuchar, \nBlanche Lincoln, John Thune, David Vitter, Mark Pryor, Mark Begich, \nMichael Bennet, Kirsten Gillibrand and George LeMieux.\n  He has been elected to the Senate an unprecedented nine times, and \nhas served alongside 11 U.S. Presidents.\n  Senator Byrd has seen great changes in these past 56 years. Yet he \nhas never lost sight of where he came from.\n  He grew up in poverty among the coalfields of Southern West Virginia.\n  His adoptive parents early on instilled in him a strong work ethic. \nHe was a butcher, a gas station attendant, a grocery store clerk, and a \nshipyard welder before winning a seat to the West Virginia State \nLegislature and eventually being elected to Congress.\n  Senator Byrd earned a law degree from American University in 1963--\nthe only person to have ever begun and completed law school while \nserving in Congress.\n  The ``Almanac of American Politics'' has said that Senator Byrd ``may \ncome closer to the kind of senator the Founding Fathers had in mind \nthan any other.''\n  I wholeheartedly agree. And so he has set the standard for all of us \nto follow.\n  We, of course, all know him as a great orator with a love of \nlanguage. His speeches on this floor often quote poetry and the \nclassics--Roman historian Titus Livius is a favorite.\n  Senator Byrd is a man of conviction. He always speaks his mind. He \nnever minces words.\n  He is our fiercest defender of the U.S. Constitution--in fact, he \ncarries a pocket version of this dynamic document wherever he goes.\n  There is no one who has loved this institution so dearly. He adores \nit so much he has authored four volumes about the history of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  In a speech he gave earlier this year when he marked 50 years in the \nU.S. Senate, Senator Byrd said: ``The Senate has served our country so \nwell because great and courageous Senators have always been willing to \nstay the course and keep the faith. And the Senate will continue to do \nso as long as there are members who understand the Senate's \nconstitutional role and who zealously guard its powers.''\n  He of course leads this list.\n  Yet Senator Byrd's highest priority has always been serving the \nconstituents of his beloved Mountain State.\n  As a longtime chairman and member of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee he has sent home millions of dollars in needed Federal funds \nfor economic renewal and infrastructure projects. These monies have \ngone to build highways, dams, educational and health institutions, and \nFederal agency offices throughout West Virginia.\n  He has long been a strong proponent of education. The valedictorian \nof his high school class, Senator Byrd has fought for teaching of \n``traditional American history'' in the Nation's public school system. \nIt is an issue true and dear to my heart as well.\n  Today, thanks to Senator Byrd, the Department of Education awards \nmillions of dollars each year in grants to fund training programs to \nimprove the skills of history teachers.\n  Senator Byrd's love of the Senate and of his fellow West Virginians \nknows no bounds. It is exceeded only by the love of his beloved wife \nErma who passed away 3 years ago. In a statement this week marking his \nown\n\n[[Page S11480]]\n\nmilestone, Senator Byrd said ``I know that she is looking down from the \nheavens, smiling at me and saying congratulations my dear Robert but \ndon't let it go to your head.''\n  I have had the privilege of working on the Appropriations Committee \nwhile Senator Byrd was chairman. There has been no one who has been \nmore faithful to the Constitution, to the goals and rules of the \nSenate, or has served this body more honorably.\n  I consider myself lucky to have served alongside this great statesman \nfor 17 years.\n  Again, congratulations Senator Byrd. You are a true American Patriot.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I wish to make a few remarks about one \nof the most remarkable men ever to serve in the Senate, Robert C. Byrd \non this milestone of service. When I came to the Senate, he was my \nteacher. We went to school to him. He told all of the new Members about \nthe rules of the Senate and we all got copies of his book on the \nhistory of the Senate. We were all mightily impressed, because he had \nan encyclopedic understanding of this Senate.\n  I have heard him over the years refer to the Senate as the great \nSenate or the second great Senate, the Roman Senate being the first \ngreat Senate and the U.S. Senate being the next great Senate. The pride \nhe has in this institution, the way he respects it and reveres it, I \nthink is second to none who has ever served here. I believe that.\n  I remember one night--I don't know why it was so late, but it was \nsometime during the debate over Afghanistan or Iraq, and I was here \nspeaking. It was 8 or 9 o'clock at night, later than this--and Senator \nByrd was the Presiding Officer. I told this fabulous story somebody had \nshared with me. It was a history of Rome, and it was about what the \nRomans did when they had terrorists and pirates. When they could stand \nthe disgrace no longer, the Romans all got together and said we have to \ntake action, and they selected the leading man of the country and gave \nhim a whole fleet of ships and I think 100,000 or more soldiers. They \nissued a directive to every city on the Mediterranean that they would \ncooperate with Rome, and they set about to destroy the pirates. The \npirates had captured a Roman leader or two. They raided the coast of \nRome, and the disgrace was intolerable and they finally got together \nand crushed them in short order.\n  I was the last one to speak, as I am tonight, and he asked me to come \nup to the Chair. He said, that was Marc Antony; ``I think that was 6 \nAD.'' So he is a real student of history and the Roman Empire and the \nRoman Senate.\n  I also would normally preside over the Senate on Fridays, and Senator \nByrd at 11 o'clock would appear through the door almost every Friday \nand he would make a speech. They were remarkable speeches. He had a \nremarkable talent for speaking. He would quote poetry at length without \na single note, or quote the Scripture without notes. I still can \nremember some of his speeches. One of my favorites was his discussion \nof the failure of modern textbooks.\n  One of the things that irked him--and he quoted from them--is that \nthey didn't recognize the difference between a democracy and a \nrepublic, and there is a difference. He delineated that with great \nclarity. Finally, at the conclusion, he referred to those books as \ntouchy feely twaddle, and I thought that was a phrase I liked. I have \nremembered it ever since.\n  He also discussed the little school he attended. My father attended \none like that and my grandmother taught in one like that. But the \nhighlight of their day was to be selected to be the one to take the \nbucket and go down to the spring and get a bucket of water to put in \nthe barrel so the kids would have something to drink. They were taught \nwell. He made clear that they were well taught. This was not poor \neducation; it was a good education. But, that is the way the school was \nconducted. He noted they had a single dipper for the class and all the \nstudents used it to dip in the barrel to get the water whenever they \nneeded it. I guess the EPA would have them in jail today if they were \nto try such a thing as that.\n  He has been and still remains a fierce advocate of issues he \nconsiders important. We did not agree on the Iraq war, and Senator Byrd \nwas fierce in his opposition. He articulated it aggressively and fairly \nand in a tough, effective manner. He was one of the most effective \nSenators on that matter.\n  We agree on a number of issues involving immigration. I strongly \nbelieve that the immigration system in this country is broken and we \nneed to create a lawful system and that we cannot tolerate the \ncontinued lawlessness, and he agreed. He doesn't believe people have a \nright to just walk into the country illegally and claim they are a \ncitizen, then just wait a little bit and get amnesty.\n  What kind of law is that? On many of those votes, we shared a common \nview. I guess I will say he is a person who answers to his own sense of \nright and wrong. It is a deep sense of right and wrong. He is a man who \nunderstands the Scriptures, a man of deep personal faith and there are \nthings he believes that are right and there are things he believes are \nwrong and he doesn't do what he thinks is wrong. It is the kind of \nmodel that I think is a good one for all of us in the Senate.\n  I find Senator Byrd to be one of the most refreshing and brilliant \nmen I know in the Senate. I say this with some real confidence: Nobody \nloves the Senate more than Robert C. Byrd.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Robert C. Byrd from West Virginia. Today, \nSenator Byrd becomes the longest serving Member of the U.S. Senate, the \nlongest serving Member of the U.S. Congress, and the longest serving \nMember in Congressional history. Today, Senator Byrd marks his 20,744th \nday in the Congress. This is an extraordinary milestone for a man who \nhas played such an important role in the Senate.\n  Senator Byrd has a compelling personal story. He lost his parents as \na young child and was raised by his aunt and uncle in a coal mining \ncommunity. He became the first in his family to attend college and law \nschool, working a series of jobs to support himself and his family. He \nwas blessed with a wonderful wife, Erma Ora Byrd, who was beloved in \nthe Senate family.\n  Senator Byrd never forgot where he came from. His work on behalf of \nthe people of West Virginia is legendary. He never forgot the coal \nmining community he came from. He always worked to strengthen the \nopportunity ladder that he used to put himself through college and law \nschool. He never forgot the people and communities that too often are \nleft out and left behind.\n  When I first came to the U.S. Senate in 1987, Senator Byrd was the \nmajority leader. He helped me get on some of the best committees, \nincluding the Appropriations Committee. Senator Byrd helped me learn \nthe arcane Senate procedure. He helped me learn the ropes on the \nAppropriations Committee and how the appropriations process could be \nused to help communities and people in Maryland--and to create jobs.\n  As majority leader and as chairman, Senator Byrd set a tone of \nbipartisanship. He worked across the aisle to meet the day-to-day needs \nof his constituents and the long-range needs of our Nation.\n  I join my colleagues in celebrating Senator Byrd's many \naccomplishments--and in thanking him for his friendship.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution and preamble be agreed to en bloc, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table en bloc; further, that any statements \nwith respect to Senator Byrd be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 354) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I know Senator Byrd is about to speak, \nbut I sat here in this row for years with my dear friend from West \nVirginia. We have been friends for the 35 years I have served here. In \nhis mind I am but a junior Member of the Senate, having been here only \n35 years, but they have been especially good ones because he is here. I \nwill save something for later on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The very distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia.\n\n[[Page S11481]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. Thank you, Pat. I thank Senator Reid, my \nleader. I thank Senator McConnell, and I thank my colleague and dear \nfriend, Senator Jay Rockefeller, and all Senators, everyone, for their \ngood words and for this outstanding resolution.\n  Today, Madam President, is much more than a commemoration of the \nlength of service of one Senator. Today also celebrates the great \npeople of the great and mighty State of West Virginia who have honored \nme by repeatedly placing their faith in me. Because of those wonderful \npeople in West Virginia, this foster son of an impoverished coal miner \nfrom the great hills of southern West Virginia has had the opportunity \nto walk with Kings, to meet with Prime Ministers, and to debate with \nPresidents.\n  I have had the privilege not only to witness, but also to participate \nin, the great panorama of history. From the apex of the Cold War to the \ncollapse--the collapse--of the Soviet Union, from my opposition to the \n1964 Civil Rights Act to my part in securing the funds for the building \nof the memorial to Martin Luther King, from my support for the war in \nVietnam to my opposition to President George W. Bush's war with Iraq, I \nhave served with so many fine Senators in the Congress, and I have \nloved every precious minute of it.\n  I recall those days a long time ago when I walked 3 miles down a \nhollow in the snow in order to catch a bus to attend a two-room school \nin Mercer County in southern West Virginia. In Stotesbury, WV, after \nschool, I went from house to house collecting scraps of food. I was the \nscrap boy, collecting scraps of food to feed the hogs of my coal miner \ndad, raised in a pen beside a railroad track to support the family \nbudget.\n  Little could I have ever imagined or dreamed while I was feeding \nthose hogs or walking in the snow to catch a bus to school that one day \nunder God's great mercy I would become the longest serving Member in \nthe history--the great history--of the U.S. Congress. I am grateful, \nsimply grateful to an Almighty God for having had an opportunity to \nserve my State of West Virginia and to serve our great Nation. My only \nregret is that my dear wife Erma is not here to enjoy this moment with \nme. But I know--yes, I do--that she is smiling down from heaven and \nreminding me not to get a big head.\n\n  Again, I thank all Senators. I thank all West Virginians. May the \ngreat God Almighty continue to bless these United States of America, \nand may he keep her forever free.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to honor and extend my warmest aloha \nto my colleague, mentor and good friend--Senator Robert C. Byrd--for \nreaching this unprecedented milestone.\n  My colleague from West Virginia has held the most prestigious and \ninfluential positions in this legislative body.\n  Today he is the Senate President Pro Tempore, but we know him as the \n``Dean of the Senate.''\n  We are so lucky to have him--as he continues to maintain the highest \nstandards in Senate decorum and constitutional procedure.\n  Senator Byrd has served this country for nearly a quarter of its \nexistence--56 years, 10 months, 16 days.\n  His dedicated service to his State and this country--and his \nunrivaled knowledge of parliamentary procedure--continues to be an \ninspiration to me, and many others in Congress and to people around the \ncountry.\n  Senator Byrd's inspiring story is rooted in his modest upbringing and \nsteadfast determination to serve his country.\n  Growing up, his parents' taught him the value of hard work. He worked \nas a butcher and grocer, won election to the West Virginia Legislature, \nthen to Congress.\n  His work ethic allowed him to earn a law degree from American \nUniversity--while serving in the House.\n  But he is not all work. Senator Byrd and I share a love for music and \nthe arts. He is an accomplished musician. His amazing fiddle playing \nwas even showcased at the Grand Ole Opry.\n  He is a man of great faith. We have attended Senate Prayer Breakfast \ntogether for many years. His favorite hymn is ``Old Rugged Cross.'' I \nhave enjoyed singing it with him a number of times.\n  He is a scholar in the history of democracy and our country. Senator \nByrd often cites our founding fathers and Greek philosophers to remind \nus of where we have come from. He always carries a copy of the \nConstitution in his pocket.\n  When I was a freshman Senator in 1990, he generously helped me learn \nthe ways of this great institution.\n  I still have the notes he gave me on how to preside--always insisting \nthat we follow the proper, time-tested procedures--and that we give our \nfull attention to the Senate floor.\n  His years of masterful legislation have become such a consistent \nforce in this lawmaking body that he has his own procedural budget rule \nnamed after him: The Byrd Rule.\n  Senator Byrd is an embodiment of the democratic spirit.\n  We have looked to him for his steady leadership for so many years, \nand as our country faces new 21st century challenges, we are fortunate \nthat we still have his wisdom today.\n  It is a pleasure to serve with him.\n  I again want to extend my aloha and my congratulations to Senator \nRobert C. Byrd for this amazing milestone. Thank you for what you do \nfor this institution Senator Byrd. I look forward to the future \ntogether with you. God bless you, Robert Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am privileged to stand here to say a few \nwords about my friend, Robert C. Byrd.\n  When I got here in 1976--I almost said 1776. But when I got here in \n1976--some people think I have been here since 1776--Robert C. Byrd was \nthe majority leader in the Senate. Actually, it was 1977 when I \nactually took my seat here. I have to say, he was one of the finest \nmajority leaders I have seen in all of my 33 years in the Senate. There \nwas literally nobody who knew the rules as well as Robert C. Byrd. \nSenator Byrd was an expert on the rules, and he taught me a great deal. \nIn my first years in the Senate, we were on opposite sides in the labor \nand law reform debate, but it was a time of great learning for me as a \nyoung Senator, and he was very patient. He was very kind, very decent \nto two young Senators, Senator Lugar and myself, who both came at \nexactly the same time. I will never forget that.\n  In the intervening years, I have seen this man play his fiddle and do \nit with such joy. I have seen him love his wife the way a man ought to \nlove his wife. I have seen him be kind to his dog. I have seen him be \nkind to numerous people. I have seen him go out of his way for all of \nus, from time to time. Yet there was no more formidable Senator on the \nfloor of this Senate than Senator Byrd.\n  As he has continuously, through the years, educated us on ancient \nhistory, modern history, the Constitution, anybody who has listened to \nthose discussions and remarks on the floor has to acknowledge this is \none very bright and intelligent man.\n  To think he got his law degree, if I am not mistaken, while he was \nserving as a U.S. Senator--and I know he hardly ever missed a vote. \nThat he went on to law school and got a law degree while he was, at the \nsame time, a sitting U.S. Senator is pretty remarkable to me. I don't \nknow anybody else in this body who could have done that. It is an \namazing thing.\n  He has gone out of his way in those years for those of us who were \nyounger and didn't know an awful lot about the procedural rules, who \ndidn't know a lot about the Senate. He has been a stickler for the \nrules and made sure the Senate has always respected them as now we, the \nSenators, respect him--not only for his knowledge of the rules but for \nthe way he has conducted himself all these years.\n  I don't know of any other Senator who has done as much for his State \nas Senator Byrd--unless it was Senator\n\n[[Page S11482]]\n\nStevens from Alaska. In the many years they were both on the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, they were towers of strength. I have been \namazed at the strength, the endurance, the intelligence, and the \nabsolute kindness and decency Senator Byrd has shown as he has evolved \nas a Senator from those early days when not many people knew him, to \ntoday when all of us are honoring him.\n  What an achievement, to be the longest-serving Member in the history \nof the Congress. This is a very important day to Senator Byrd and to \nall of us. I can truthfully say that I love and respect him. We have \nhad our share of differences over the years, but they have always been \ncordial. I look forward to serving here in the Senate with Senator Byrd \nfor many more years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my good friend from West \nVirginia, I spoke this morning on his remarkable record of achievement.\n  We are all proud of your service to your State and to our country. I \nsent you a note including my remarks from this morning about this \nremarkable record you have now achieved. Of course, you broke the \nrecord of a Senator from Arizona. One of his successors is here on the \nfloor and would like to address that matter as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I prematurely congratulated Senator Byrd \nyesterday for breaking the record of Carl Hayden, who has up to now \nheld the record and was in the House of Representatives the day Arizona \nbecame a State. He served all the way up until I believe 1968.\n  Senator Byrd reminded me: No, it is not until tomorrow, at whatever \nhour it was.\n  I said: Well, I think you will probably make it.\n  Of course, his response was: The Lord willing.\n  That has been a motto of Senator Byrd throughout his career: The Lord \nwilling. We hope the Lord is willing for many more days so the record \nwill be even harder to break.\n  We congratulate you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/18/senate-section/article/S11482-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Madam President, it is my understanding that I am going \nto be recognized for approximately 15 minutes, and I seek unanimous \nconsent that Senator Grassley follow me for 15 minutes, so we would \ntake approximately 30 minutes of the Senate's time at this point. I \nthink I should probably ask unanimous consent to proceed as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I come to the floor today to join my \ngood friend from Iowa, Senator Grassley, who is our ranking member on \nthe Senate Finance Committee, to raise concerns about a too-little-\ndiscussed aspect of the health care bill the Senate will soon debate. \nWhile much of the health reform debate to date has focused on the \nhealth care side of the bill and the $500 billion in higher taxes, \nfees, and fines that will be required to pay for it, very little \nattention has been paid to how these taxes and fines will be \nimplemented and administered and, most importantly, enforced. I think \nthat is a very critical discussion. We need to have that discussion, \nand it is one the American people fully need to understand as this \ndebate gets underway. This is important stuff.\n  Senator Grassley has already sounded the alarm about how the Senate \nFinance Committee bill expands the size and reach of the Internal \nRevenue Service, the IRS, further into the lives of every American. But \nlisten up: All the health care bills we have seen so far call for \nreforms to be carried out to a great extent by the Internal Revenue \nService--that is right, the IRS, the Nation's tax collector.\n  This isn't CMS, the Department of Health and Human Services; this is \nthe IRS. So the Nation's tax collector will be in charge of \nimplementing, administering, and enforcing a significant portion of \nthis bill.\n  Under the various bills, the IRS is given unprecedented authority to \nobtain information about your family's health care decisions. The IRS \nis authorized to collect new information--information that is unrelated \nto an individual or a family's tax liability--in order to carry out \nhealth care reform.\n  This information will be used to implement, administer, and enforce \nseveral controversial provisions. For example, the IRS--again, not the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services--is the government agency that \nwill determine whether everyone has insurance and will assess a tax \npenalty on anyone without insurance. The IRS will have to collect \nadditional information from individuals and families in order to make \nthis determination. We don't know how this information will be \ncollected or how it may be used.\n  The IRS would assess taxes on employers who do not provide affordable \ncoverage for their employees. Since affordability would be determined \non an individual's total income, an employer would have to collect \nincome information from all of his or her employees. This will require \nemployers to provide additional information about their employees to \nthe IRS--information I am sure that an employer would just as soon not \nask about. We don't know how an employer would use this information or \nhow it would be protected.\n  In addition, the IRS will have to work with the new health care \nexchanges to verify whether an individual is eligible for a subsidy and \nwill have to share information about taxpayers with those exchanges. \nHowever, we still don't know if the exchange will be a State agency or \na private entity, so we don't know how the IRS will collect and \nsafeguard taxpayer information.\n  Yet even as the health care bill creates new responsibilities for the \nIRS, consider that the IRS is having a lot of trouble doing its No. 1 \njob--tax administration--efficiently and effectively. Two reports were \nissued recently that I think raise questions about the IRS's ability to \ncarry out its new responsibilities in this bill, let alone its original \nresponsibilities.\n  Last week, the Government Accountability Office, or GAO, released its \nannual audit of the IRS's financial statements for 2008 and 2009.\n  In the report, the GAO found that while the IRS has made progress in \naddressing internal control deficiencies, the report also states that \ndeficiencies remain with regard to the IRS's internal control over \nunpaid tax assessments and over information security. The report states \nthat ``the serious challenges IRS faces as a result of these remaining \ndeficiencies adversely affect the IRS's ability to . . . obtain \ncurrent, complete, and accurate information it needs to make well-\ninformed decisions.''\n  Then, on Monday, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax \nAdministration found that because of the way the Making Work Pay \ncredit--the credit created in this year's stimulus bill to provide \nworkers with a one-time tax credit of up to $400--has been implemented \nand administered by the IRS, more than 15 million taxpayers may \nactually end up having to pay back some of their credit to the IRS.\n  Similar administrative problems with the home buyer tax credit have \nled to waste and abuse of taxpayer dollars.\n  The IG's audit of the IRS's administration of the credit found that \nthe IRS may have allowed thousands of taxpayers to claim millions of \ndollars in credits to which they were not entitled to despite \nrecommendations made a year ago by the IG that the IRS take steps to \nverify eligibility for the credit.\n  In its audit, the inspector general found that more than 19,000 \ntaxpayers claimed $139.4 million in credits for homes they had not yet \npurchased but would allegedly purchase. In addition, over 70,000 \ntaxpayers claimed more than $479 million in credits despite indications \nthat they were not first-time home buyers. The IG also identified 582\n\n[[Page S11483]]\n\ntaxpayers under 18 years of age who claimed almost $4 million worth of \ncredits. By the way, the youngest taxpayers receiving the credit were 4 \nyears old.\n  Mr. President, the problems the IRS has encountered in administering \nthese credits and the issues raised by the GAO about the security of \ntaxpayer information--I will repeat that: the security of taxpayer \ninformation, your taxes--raise serious questions about whether the IRS \nis up to the task of implementing and enforcing the far-reaching tax \nproposals that are called for in the health care bill.\n  Wait, there is more. We know the IRS will need additional funding and \nemployees--employees with expertise and training--if they are to \nimplement, administer, and enforce the dozen or so new tax provisions \ncalled for in the health care bill.\n  How much will that cost? That is a good question. Nobody knows. These \ncosts are not included in estimates provided by either the \nCongressional Budget Office or the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  The bill as passed by the Senate Finance Committee--I don't know what \nis in the bill that will be considered, just announced by my friends \nacross the aisle. They are doing that behind closed doors. But the bill \nas passed by the Finance Committee doesn't include any funding for the \nIRS for any administrative or personnel costs associated with this \nbill. We will see if the leader's bill that will be announced sometime \ntomorrow, which is being talked about in the hallways, contains such \nestimates.\n  Estimates of a more narrow bill by an independent group found that \nthe IRS administration alone would cost several billion dollars--never \nmind the costs for the Department of Health and Human Services or CMS \nor other new Federal offices that will be created. We can only assume \nthe cost to administer and enforce the taxes, fees, and fines in this \nbill will be significantly higher.\n  Americans need to understand what health care reform means for their \nhealth care, but they also need to know what the IRS's significant and \nintrusive new role would be in implementing and enforcing such health \ncare reform.\n  All the proposals we have seen so far expand the reach of the IRS \neven further into the lives of ordinary Americans, allowing them to \ncollect more information than ever before about you and your health \ncare choices in order to tax you based on those choices.\n  Do Americans want the IRS to collect even more information about them \nand their families than it already does? I don't think so. Do they want \nthe IRS having access to information about their health care decisions? \nAgain, I doubt it.\n  Furthermore, would the IRS be able to do the job? Will they get it \nright? Recent reports by the IRS's own IG and the GAO cast doubt on the \nagency's ability to effectively administer the wide-reaching provisions \nin the health care bill.\n  Americans should be very concerned about putting the IRS in charge of \nadministering more than $500 billion in new taxes, fees, and fines in \nthis bill and expanding its reach further into Americans' lives.\n  Americans should be concerned about this path that the Senate \nleadership and the White House is taking us down, placing this very \ncomplex health care bill in the hands of the IRS, especially when they \nhave not provided the resources the IRS will need to get the job done--\nnot to the funding.\n  Madam President, the bottom line is that Americans need to know, need \nto understand, and need to question whether they want the Internal \nRevenue Service more involved in their daily lives and their health \ncare decisions. Under the proposals we have seen, that is the case.\n  Sit up, America, and take notice. I think if we took a poll or had \nyet another townhall meeting, most Americans would say no to any \nfurther IRS involvement in their lives and no to IRS intrusion into \ntheir health care.\n  I yield the floor. I see the distinguished ranking member of the \ncommittee, a distinguished Senator who has been an expert on the IRS \nand basically bringing reform almost on an individual basis to that \nagency.\n  I yield to Senator Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank my friend, the Senator from Kansas, for his \nkind remarks. I am very happy to join him in sounding an alarm about \nthe role of the Internal Revenue Service in America's health care \nchoices.\n  The various health care bills being considered before Congress would \ntask the IRS with administering several new and very controversial \nprovisions. This would include things such as the individual mandate--\nor another way to say that is a government-run insurance mandate, a \ngovernment-required insurance mandate. It would also affect the \nemployer free rider penalty. The IRS would be involved with the premium \nsubsidy for low-income individuals. It would be involved with the small \nbusiness tax credit. The IRS would be involved in working with \nexchanges to verify income information, and it would be involved in \nfiguring out how to calculate and collect several new fees, which are \nin fact excise taxes.\n  Senator Roberts has just explained some of this. Also, during debate \nin the Finance Committee--when the Senate Finance Committee bill was up \nin that committee, some people joked that CMS stands for ``it's a \nmess.'' The same could be said of the IRS. As many of us know all too \nwell, the tax gap is a very serious problem. The hundreds of billions \nof dollars owed that the IRS isn't collecting suggests that the IRS \nisn't effective at executing its primary mission: the enforcement of \nour revenue laws.\n  The IRS is just now starting to increase its enforcement efforts, \nwhich had declined significantly after the restructuring of that agency \na decade ago. But just like many other Federal agencies, it is facing a \nhuman resource crisis because more than 50 percent of its workforce is \nexpected to retire in the near future. So it doesn't have the resources \nit needs to do its presently described job, never mind a whole new one, \nsuch as administering health care reform--or at least helping \nadminister health care reform.\n  One independent report after another highlights IRS's enforcement \nproblems. Senator Roberts mentioned the recent reports on the Making \nWork Pay credit, home buyer tax credit, and the IRS's financial \nstatements. In addition to those, we have problems with the earned-\nincome tax credit and the health coverage tax credit.\n  In February, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration \nissued a report on fraud in the earned-income tax credit. Then today, \nthe administration reports that waste of taxpayer dollars from improper \npayments has increased from $72 billion in 2008 to $98 billion in 2009. \nOver $12 billion--almost 12 percent--of the $98 billion in improper \npayments was because of the earned-income tax credit.\n  In another tax inspector general report from earlier this month on \nthe health coverage tax credit, that inspector general reviewed a valid \nsample of individuals who claimed this credit on their 2006 Federal tax \nreturn. The tax inspector general found that 72 percent did not have \nthe required documentation to get that credit. In addition, the \ninspector general states that the IRS does not effectively identify or \nprevent individuals from erroneously claiming the health credit on \ntheir Federal tax return.\n  The inspector general identified over 1,200 individuals who appeared \nto have wrongly claimed $1.8 million of these credits on their Federal \ntax returns. This report is particularly relative since the premium \nsubsidy in the Finance Committee health reform bill is modeled after \nthis credit.\n  The earned-income tax credit, the health coverage tax credit, and the \nmaking work pay tax credit are all examples of social welfare programs \nthat presently are being administered by the Internal Revenue Service, \nand this despite the fact that we have a whole separate agency--the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services--that is supposed to be \nconcerned with social welfare.\n  In a recent interview with tax analysts about current health reform \nproposals, a former IRS Assistant Commissioner had this to say about \nIRS' role in the health reform issue:\n\n       These kinds of programs require social welfare expertise. \n     IRS agents are not recruited or trained to do that. . . . The \n     IRS record is mixed and sometimes abysmal with regard to \n     effectively administering these kinds of programs.\n\n\n[[Page S11484]]\n\n\n  I couldn't have said it better myself.\n  Aside from the costs and the problems with enforcing these types of \ncredits, there are opportunity costs associated with requiring the IRS \nto administer programs outside its expertise. The Government \nAccountability Office and the tax inspector general issued reports \ndiscussing the IRS' poor performance in providing telephone customer \nservice during the 2009 filing season because of stimulus legislation. \nThat was passed in February of this year. The reports state that \ncustomer service declined significantly, despite the fact that \ncollection employees were assigned to staff the phones.\n  So honest and diligent taxpayers do not get the help they need when \nthey need it, and tax cheats and tax evaders increasingly get away with \nnot paying their fair share, and the tax gap widens.\n  From a tax administration perspective, the provisions in the various \nhealth reform bills will create infinite new problems for the Internal \nRevenue Service. The Internal Revenue Service is likely to be tasked \nwith implementing provisions for which it actually must go out and \ncollect new data--data that is unrelated to the taxpayer's tax \nliability.\n  In addition to the provisions Senator Roberts highlighted, the \nInternal Revenue Service would have to develop new processes and \nprocedures for insurance companies and employers to challenge and \nappeal the calculations of the high-cost premiums tax and the employer \nfree rider excise tax, both new provisions in the Senate Finance \nCommittee bill. Both these taxes are calculated by a third party, other \nthan the IRS or the individual taxpayer. The IRS would have to develop \na method for calculating the new excise taxes on medical devices and \npharmaceuticals, also a new provision in that bill, the basis for which \nis unprecedented.\n  In light of these issues, I think it is fair to consider a couple \nquestions.\n  Assuming that an individual mandate is constitutional, do we want the \nIRS checking up on whether everyone has health insurance?\n  Another question: Do we want to facilitate the dissemination of tax \ninformation to third parties, such as employers or an insurance \nexchange? We have always been very cautious about maintaining the \nprivacy of individual tax returns.\n  Another question: Shouldn't we be providing more resources to the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to ensure that it can receive \nand process the necessary data if this bill is going to be implemented \ninstead of having the IRS do it?\n  My Democratic colleagues in the Congress and the administration have \nmany ideas for new and complex ways to tax individuals and, of course, \ntax small businesses as well, to fund all sorts of new spending. It \nwould seem wise to make sure the IRS can enforce the tax laws before \nbeing charged with administering new social programs created because of \nhealth reform.\n  I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to consider these \nquestions as we debate the health care reform bill over the next \nseveral weeks.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that on Thursday, November 19, at 2 p.m., all postcloture time \nbe yielded back, except for 30 minutes, and that the time be equally \ndivided and controlled by Senators Leahy and Sessions or their \ndesignees; that at 2:30 p.m., the Senate proceed to vote on \nconfirmation of the nomination of Judge Hamilton; that upon \nconfirmation, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, no \nfurther motions be in order, the President be immediately notified of \nthe Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to apprise my colleagues of \nan impressive effort in Afghanistan. I recently had the opportunity to \nvisit with our military troops and civilian personnel serving in \nAfghanistan. While I was there, I had the pleasure to meet Dr. Michael \nSmith, president of the American University of Afghanistan. I was \nembarrassed to admit that until meeting Dr. Smith, I had never heard of \nthe university. Upon learning more about the university, I am \nencouraged to know that while bombs are bursting and bullets are \nflying, there is an ongoing and successful American mission to provide \neducational opportunities to the men and women of Afghanistan.\n  Today, the American University of Afghanistan has 450 students and \nwill graduate their first undergraduate class next spring. The student \nbody draws from every province and ethnic group in Afghanistan and is \nnineteen percent female and growing. While the majority of faculty \nmembers are American, 15 other countries are represented, including \nAfghanistan.\n  The university models itself after other strong international \nAmerican universities like the American University of Cairo and the \nAmerican University of Beirut. Its programs focus on business and \nentrepreneurship, information technology, and many other professional \nareas.\n  Since over 85 percent of the student body have been immigrants at \nsome point in their lives and 29 percent of the students graduated high \nschool in Pakistan, one goal of creating this university is to enable \nAfghanis the educational opportunity to earn a degree that can be \nutilized for the betterment of Afghanistan.\n  I know many of my colleagues have plans to travel to Afghanistan to \nvisit with our troops. I would encourage all of you to take some time \nto learn about this university which is one of the unsung efforts we \nhave undertaken in Afghanistan.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this mission so when the military \ndeparts Afghanistan we can leave with a smile and our heads held high \nknowing that we have not only supported the security and stabilization \nof Afghanistan but have provided a sustained educational mission as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/18/senate-section/article/S11484-3", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11484-S11485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM AND DERIVATIVES\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the journalist H.L. Mencken once observed \nthat, ``complex problems have simple, easy to understand, wrong \nanswers.'' And, though modern history has amply demonstrated the \nresistance of complex political and economic systems to the easy answer \nof centralized control, we try time and again to apply top-down \nsolutions to our multifaceted problems. This conflict is brought into \nno sharper light than by Congress' current efforts at financial \nservices reform; particularly those directed at the labyrinthine world \nof the multi-trillion dollar derivatives trade.\n  Derivatives are a vital and complex component of modern financial \nmarkets, making it imperative that reform be done right--without damage \nto the\n\n[[Page S11485]]\n\ntwin pillars of innovation and capital formation.\n  The question as to how derivatives should be regulated is not easy to \nanswer, but Congress should start with some guiding principles. First, \nderivatives regulation should seek to foster a robust, competitive, and \nliquid marketplace. Second, systemic counter-party risk exposure must \nbe reduced by incentivizing central clearing and increasing reporting \nrequirements to promote transparency. Third, regulation must preserve \nthe ability to engage in bilateral customized transactions for risk \nmanagement. Finally, we must coordinate our efforts with the \ninternational community to prevent global regulatory arbitrage and the \nflight of capital to less regulated jurisdictions.\n  Unfortunately, the regulatory reform proposals making their way \nthrough both chambers of Congress fail to take into account the \nintricacies of this dynamic financial product and expose a fundamental \nmisunderstanding of the way in which the marketplace works. Congress \nmust think through the significant, unintended consequences before we \nact to mandate that all Over-the-Counter--OTC--derivatives be centrally \ncleared and executed on exchanges or cash collateralized, as well as \nsubjecting end-users to capital charges. By de-incentivizing companies \nto use these risk management tools, such proposals will have the \nperverse effect of increasing business risk and raising costs.\n  The proposals advocated for by the U.S. Treasury and Chairman of the \nSenate Banking Committee, Senator Christopher Dodd, seem to provide too \nmany government mandates and not enough flexibility. The proposed \nregulatory structure for OTC derivatives is built on an inadequate \nfoundation lacking the staff, expertise, technology, and resources \nneeded to provide truly robust oversight. Clearing and exchange-trading \nrequirements do not accommodate the need for customized transactions. \nCapital and margin requirements threaten to lock up liquidity. Lack of \ninternational coordination guarantees a flight of capital away from our \nshores.\n  Derivatives may not be part of the Main Street vernacular, they may \nbe unfamiliar to the local car dealership, but the manufacturers that \nsupply those dealerships know them well. Derivatives provide businesses \nwith access to lower cost capital, enabling them to grow, invest, and \nretain and create new jobs. With the unemployment rate at 10.2 percent \nnationally, this is no time to increase uncertainty and business costs.\n  Congress must be mindful of the mobility of capital in the global \nmarketplace as well. Without a proper regulatory balance, capital can \nand will accept higher risk for less onerous regulation. We must \nmaintain incentives for business to participate in a large and liquid \nOTC derivative market, while promoting global coordination to minimize \nregulatory arbitrage and systemic risk.\n  Under current proposals, capital requirements that will be imposed on \nOTC dealers will pass on additional cost to end-users. Coupling these \ncapital costs with a decreasing ability to customize transactions could \nresult in sharply lower usage by end-users. Given that 94 percent of \nFortune 500 companies utilize customized OTC derivatives to manage \nmacro-economic risk, providing less certainty to corporate balance \nsheets will severely undermine confidence in the American marketplace.\n  Further, the proposal to mandate exchange trading makes little sense \nin the bespoke OTC derivatives market. The basic assumption of exchange \ntrading reflects the use of standard products. OTC derivates by their \nvery nature are not always standard. In the real world, mandating use \nof an exchange would inhibit the use of such customized derivates that \nare useful financial management tools to hedge extremely specific \nrisks. Bespoke derivatives cannot always be substituted with exchange \ntraded or standardized OTC products. Even attempting to craft a carve-\nout for such derivatives raises the concern of whether the U.S. \nSecurities and Exchange Commission and Commodities Future Trading \nCommission could agree on what should be traded.\n  Another red flag raised by the circulating proposals is the \nunintended consequence of segregating variation margin. The more \ncapital a dealer has to set aside to purchase an asset, the fewer \nassets it can purchase. Heightened capital requirements restrict a \ndealer's ability to generate returns on its capital or provide loans to \nMain Street businesses, students heading to college, or families \nseeking a mortgage. It also does not protect end users or reduce \nsystemic risk in any demonstrable way.\n  Corporate scandal and economic failure have provided such a \nregulatory catalyst many times in the past. It is alarmingly \nreminiscent of 2002, when Congress enacted Sarbanes-Oxley; introducing \na host of new compliance requirements for accounting, corporate \ngovernance, and financial disclosure. But, in the years since the \nlegislation took effect, the overhaul has come to be widely regarded as \noverly complex, unduly burdensome, and a severe disadvantage to \nAmerican businesses in the global marketplace.\n  Congress should be instructed by the lessons of the past and not add \nsuch regulations that will impede capital formation. The simple, easy, \nbut ultimately wrong answer is to issue a government mandate for every \nperceived problem. Thinking through the unintended consequences of \noverregulation and trusting market solutions is more difficult, but it \nis ultimately the only way to preserve the innovation that powers \nAmerican markets.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/18/senate-section/article/S11485-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    Staff Sergeant Justin M. Decrow\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the \nlife of SSG Justin M. Decrow. He was a member of the 16th Signal \nCompany, 62nd Expeditionary Signal Battalion. Justin was only 32 years \nold when he was killed in the tragic November 5 shooting spree at Fort \nHood, TX, that took the lives of 13 Americans and left 31 others \nwounded.\n  Those who enlist in our Armed Forces make an extraordinary sacrifice, \nagreeing to routinely face life-threatening dangers abroad as they \ncarry out missions on our behalf. The risks they endure to protect our \nfreedom are never expected to follow them from the theater of war to \nthe safety of American soil, making Justin's death all the more painful \nand troubling.\n  Today, I join Justin's family and friends in mourning his untimely \ndeath. Justin will be remembered as a loving husband, father, son and \nfriend to many. He is survived by his wife Marikay; his daugther Kylah; \nand his parents Rhonda Thompson and Daniel Decrow. Justin had returned \nover the summer from a year's deployment in South Korea before being \nstationed at Fort Hood.\n  A native of Plymouth, IN, Justin enlisted in the Army immediately \nafter graduating from high school. At the time of his passing, he was a \nresident of Evans, GA, where he lived with his high school sweetheart \nand 13-year-old daughter in a house he built just a few years ago. \nJustin was planning to become an Army contractor at nearby Fort Gordon, \nworking within his specialty of satellite communications training. At \nFord Hood, he had been training soldiers to help new veterans with \npaperwork. Justin is remembered by family and friends as a very loving \nman, who enjoyed working with his hands.\n  While we struggle to express our sorrow over the loss of Justin, we \ncan take pride in the example he set as a soldier, a husband, a father, \nand a son. Today and always, he will be remembered by family, friends \nand fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we cherish the legacy \nof his service and his life.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Justin M. Decrow in the Record \nof the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his profound \ncommitment to freedom, democracy and peace.\n  I pray that the Decrow family, and the families of all the victims of \nthis incomprehensible act, can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord \nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/18/senate-section/article/S11485-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11485-S11486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MILITARY AND VA APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, in this ever-difficult era of economic \nrecession\n\n[[Page S11486]]\n\nand troops engaged overseas, I am proud to introduce this amendment \nwith Senators Udall of New Mexico and Bingaman which addresses a dual \nfront plaguing our country's war heroes. That dual front emerges from \ntwo troubles that exist for our veterans dealing with the horrors of \nwar abroad and lack of affordable housing at home.\n  This sad duality has a dark and tragic reality. To date, one out of \nevery three homeless men sleeping somewhere in our cities and \ncommunities is a veteran. Veterans make up a significant and \ndisproportionate amount--over 20 percent--of our country's homeless \npopulation. The number of homeless Vietnam-era veterans is greater than \nthe number of service persons who died during that war. Regrettably, \nthis dark shadow cast behind our Nation's veterans is stretching \nbecause we are seeing homelessness spread to veterans returning from \nthe ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Instead of receiving the \nservices and benefits they deserve, veterans from Iraq and \nAfghanistan--as well as many American families--are at greater risk of \nhomelessness due to a number of factors, such as the economic downturn, \nthe acute shortage of affordable housing, and lingering mental health \nillnesses. Further, despite the efforts of the federal government and \nits partners at the State and local levels and their progress in \naddressing homelessness, there remain too many gaps in our safety net \nsystem to prevent homelessness.\n  For our troops and their families to whom we owe so much, who make \ngreat contributions to defend our country, and who risk their lives; is \nhomelessness an acceptable outcome for them? Clearly, the answer is no. \nThat is why I am proud to support this amendment with my colleagues \nfrom New Mexico and I value the work I have been a part of with my \nother colleagues and friends like Senators Murray, Mikulski, Reed, and \nHutchison.\n  This amendment sends a clear and strong message that we cannot allow \nour veterans to return to their communities without providing them the \nsupport they need. This is why we introduced this amendment which \ncombines the necessary support and housing services to help our \nveterans. Veterans need a comprehensive approach that begins with \nsecure and stable housing in order to provide them the opportunity to \nreintegrate into society and support their families.

Mr. President, in the last century, Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr., spoke often of ``the arc of the moral universe'' and how it \nbends toward justice. He held an optimistic but unvarnished view of our \ncountry and saw that America's greatness lives in the promise of \nexpanding equality and opportunity.\n  Sadly, for parts of our history, the halls of civil discourse were \nclosed to people of color, women, and other groups. Too many Americans \nwere denied the freedom that our founding documents guaranteed to every \nindividual, and for far too long. But here in the United States, it is \ninevitable that justice wins out over tyranny in the end.\n  Thanks to the leadership of Dr. King and countless other \ntrailblazers--of all races, backgrounds, and walks of life--today's \nAmerica is more free, more fair, and more equal than our forefathers \ncould possibly have dreamed. And today, I come to the floor in honor of \none of these real-life trailblazers.\n  Twenty-five years ago, it was almost inconceivable that a person of \ncolor could become President of the United States. But that did not \nstop the Reverend Jesse L. Jackson, Sr., from mounting a serious \ncampaign. Some applauded the effort, and some decried it as \nfoolishness. Some said that America was not ready. But Reverend Jackson \nwas undeterred. He laid righteous claim to the values that define us as \nAmericans, and he shared his vision with all those who would listen and \nsome who would not. And under his leadership, an otherwise ordinary \nPresidential campaign became a movement. People across America were \ninspired by what they saw, what they heard, and what they read. They \nturned out in droves to campaign for Reverend Jackson, to hear him \nspeak, and to offer their support.\n  Twenty-five years ago, Rev. Jesse Jackson decided to run for \nPresident. And his bold campaign changed American politics forever. As \nDr. King would say, he and his supporters put their hands on the arc of \nthe moral universe and caused it to bend just a bit further. He broke \ndown barriers, he shattered prejudice, and he paved the way for all who \ncame after. He left an indelible mark on the political and social \nlandscape in this Nation and his contributions will be felt for many \nyears to come.\n  In 2008, thanks to the leadership and vision of Jesse Jackson, Martin \nLuther King, Jr., and countless others, America did what was once \nunthinkable: we elected an African-American man named Barack Obama to \nthe highest office in our land. It was a day I never thought I would be \nfortunate enough to see. But it showed the world once again that this \nis a nation of high ideals and higher aspirations. It proved the \nenduring truth of the American dream and reinforced the true character \nof our great country.\n  This Nation owes a great deal to Reverend Jackson and many like him, \nwho continue to share their talent, their vision, and their abiding \nfaith with the American people. So today, 25 years after his historic \nrun for President, I rise to thank Jesse Jackson for all that he has \ndone and for all that he continues to do. And even as we honor his \naccomplishments, we know that we can look to the future with optimism, \nsecure in the certain knowledge that we are in control of our destiny.\n  We, the American people, have the power to determine the course of \nthis Nation, as Reverend Jackson reminded us a quarter of a century \nago. That is the legacy to which he belongs--a legacy of equality and \nopportunity, which he has left to each of us.\n  Let us honor that legacy and carry it forward, so future generations \ncan share in the ever-expanding promise of the American dream.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/18/senate-section/article/S11486-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11486-S11487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRESSIONAL AWARDS PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am very pleased to have this opportunity \nto acknowledge one of our great success stories--the Congressional \nAwards--on the occasion of their 30th anniversary. This is a great \nmilestone in the history of a program that has served to inspire and \nencourage countless young people across the country since it was first \nsigned into law in 1979.\n  Thirty years ago, Senator Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming and Congressman \nJames Howard of New Jersey joined forces to establish and promote the \nCongressional Awards and provide this great opportunity to young people \nall across the Nation. Today this program is achieving results \nthroughout the United States far beyond what anyone could have ever \nexpected. One by one, students are rolling up their sleeves and getting \nto work, establishing personal goals as well as goals for community \nservice. Their dedication has made it possible for them to make a great \ndifference in the world right where it should always start--in their \nown backyard.\n  The Congressional Awards program has deep Wyoming roots because \nMalcolm Wallop helped to provide the leadership that led to its \ncreation. It has deep roots in Wyoming because it has inspired our \nyoung people to a truly remarkable degree. The popularity of this \nprogram extends from one corner of my home State to the other and it \ncontinues to spark the imagination and encourage the enthusiastic \nparticipation of another group of participants every year.\n  Because of the great work this program makes possible, I try to \nattend as many award ceremonies as I possibly\n\n[[Page S11487]]\n\ncan. I enjoy having the opportunity to recognize the achievements of \nthose who have earned these awards almost as much as the award winners \nenjoy receiving the recognition of the Congress for their efforts. \nEvery time I take part in one of these special ceremonies, I can see \nthe excitement and sense of satisfaction that the award represents to \neach recipient because they have earned it by accomplishing what they \nset out to do.\n  The Congressional Awards are open and available to young people from \nabout age 14 to 23. They honor those who have done something to improve \nthemselves by expanding their horizons as to what they believe is \npossible for them to achieve. Working with adult mentors, they dedicate \nthemselves to achieving a set of goals in four areas--public service, \npersonal development, physical fitness, and the exploration of the \nworld around them. Because of their enthusiasm, it is no surprise that \nthey have been able to achieve such great results in their lives.\n  There are three levels of awards offered by the program--Bronze, \nSilver and Gold. The Gold Award is the most difficult of the three to \nearn because it requires the most in terms of both time and effort.\n  Over the years, the number of Wyoming Congressional Award winners at \neach level has been impressive. However, because of the good example \nMalcolm Wallop worked so hard to provide, we have had a remarkable \nnumber of Gold Medal award winners in my State. That is a remarkable \nachievement for a State with a comparatively small population. It \nunderscores the determination of Wyoming's young people to always \nfinish what they set out to do.\n  That is why our award winners have been getting noticed and the word \nhas been getting around about how much it means to each award winner to \nhave earned such a special prize. That has inspired others to try to do \nthe same and it has kept the line of program participants going strong.\n  Malcolm Wallop understood the importance of that message and the need \nfor our young people to hear it--and hear it clearly. Thanks to him and \nhis efforts, kids in Wyoming and throughout the nation understand that \nthere is something better for them to do than to complain about what's \nwrong with the world. They now know that if there is a problem in the \ncommunity or down the street you can do something about it. It's more \nthan positive thinking; it's a call to action. It's a lesson learned \nthat will then encourage our young people to apply the same \ndetermination that helped them to earn their Congressional Award to the \nother goals they have set for themselves so they can achieve the same \nkind of success in every area of their lives.\n  Although Malcolm accomplished a great deal during his three terms of \nservice in the United States Senate, I have always believed the \nCongressional Awards had to be one of his favorite achievements, \nsomething special that will continue to last as part of his Senate \nlegacy that will serve to inspire present and future generations to \ncontinue to work to make great changes in the world around them.\n  That will mean, in the years to come, when we look to the young \npeople of Wyoming, the West and the United States to take their place \nas our leaders on the local, State and national level, thanks in part \nto the experience of the Congressional Awards program, they will be \nready.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/18/senate-section/article/S11487-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    KOREA-U.S. FREE TRADE AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish to express my strong support for \nthe Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement. As you know, President \nObama is in South Korea today and tomorrow meeting with South Korean \nPresident Lee Myung-bak, and I would like to take this opportunity to \ncommunicate to the President and his administration the importance of \nexpressing support for the Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement \nduring these meetings.\n  The United States and the Republic of Korea have a long history of \ntrade. According to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, U.S. \ngoods and services traded with Korea totaled $101 billion in 2007. The \nRepublic of Korea is the seventh-largest trading partner of the United \nStates. In my home State of Georgia alone, goods and services exported \nto the Republic of Korea total more than $390 million, making the \nRepublic of Korea Georgia's 12th largest trading partner. Furthermore, \ntrade with the Republic of Korea accounted for more than $3 billion \nworth of goods passing through the Port of Savannah, GA.\n  It is imperative that the United States build on this already strong \nrelationship with the Republic of Korea by approving a Korea-United \nStates Free Trade Agreement. Approving a Korea-United States Free Trade \nAgreement will enhance both economies by growing markets for both U.S. \nand Korean goods and services, creating jobs in both countries, and \nwill strengthen an already strong relationship with one of the most \nimportant allies of the United States in the East Asian region.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to highlight a new KIA \nautomobile production facility in West Point, GA. This is a direct \ninvestment from the Republic of Korea that is having a positive impact \non my State's economy. This week, the first KIA Sorrento vehicles were \ncompleted at the West Point facility, where 1,200 jobs have already \nbeen created and an estimated 1,300 additional jobs will be created in \nthe coming years. The impact on the local economy by the West Point \nfacility is estimated to be around $6.5 billion over the next 3 years, \nwhich is already having a transformative effect on a community that was \nfacing very hard economic times before the KIA facility came along.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I would just like to emphasize how \nimportant the Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement is to the United \nStates, and in particular to my home State of Georgia. The KIA facility \nin West Point, GA, is just one example of the impact that this proposed \nfree-trade agreement could have on other communities across the United \nStates. During these difficult economic times, it is critical that the \nadministration and Congress look for ways to build the economy and \ncreate jobs, and approving the Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement \nwould do just that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/18/senate-section/article/S11487-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11487-S11488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. JAMES R. HOUSTON\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, Dr. James R. Houston of the U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers will soon retire with over 38 years of service. \nHe is a member of the Senior Executive Service, SES, and is the First \nDirector of the Corps' Engineer Research and Development Center, ERDC. \nHis accomplishments and dedication to the Corps of Engineers' \nlaboratory community and the Army are exceptional and will have a \nsignificant and long-lasting positive impact on this Nation.\n  After serving as a private in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Dr. \nHouston began his Army civilian career as a physicist studying \nexplosion-generated wave effects at the U.S. Army Engineer Waterways \nExperiment Station, WES, in Vicksburg, MS. At WES he calculated harbor \noscillations and devised a numerical model to determine the inundation \nlimits of tsunamis in the Hawaiian Islands. In 1978, he earned his \nPh.D. from the University of Florida and in 1981 received an Army R \nAchievement Award for improved methods for numerically simulating \ntsunami propagation and interaction with nearshore regions. In 1983 he \nwas promoted to chief of the research division in the Coastal \nEngineering Research Center where he researched numerical modeling of \ncoastal processes and tsunami flood level predictions.\n  In 1986 he became the SES director of the Coastal Engineering \nResearch Center, CERC, and with the combining of CERC and the \nHydraulics Laboratory in 1997, he became the director of the Coastal \nand Hydraulics Laboratory, CHL. In these assignments, he oversaw \nresearch programs in coastal and hydraulic engineering, oceanography, \ncoastal geology, dredging, and numerical modeling of hydrodynamics and \nsediment transport. Under his leadership, CHL became the largest \ncoastal and hydraulics engineering laboratory in the world.\n  In 2000 he became the first director of ERDC and in 2006 became dual-\nhatted\n\n[[Page S11488]]\n\nas the Director of Research and Development and Chief Scientist of the \nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers. In that latter capacity he advised the \nCommanding General of the Corps on matters of science and technology \nand developed research and development policy for the Corps.\n  The ERDC research that he led has made an enormous difference in the \nglobal war on terrorism, GWOT. He led ERDC to be the 2002 Army Research \nand Development Organization of the Year in recognition of successful \nmodeling of the physics of blast/structure interaction and development \nof structural-hardening technology for retrofitting buildings to \nwithstand terrorist attacks. The Pentagon wedge that was hit on \nSeptember 11 had just been structurally hardened using this technology, \nand ERDC's technology was credited with saving hundreds of lives on \nthat tragic day. As a result of his support of GWOT, the Secretary of \nthe Army awarded him the Decoration for Exceptional Civilian Service, \nand the U.S. Army Engineer Regiment awarded him both its Bronze and \nSilver deFleury medals.\n  Under his leadership, ERDC won the Army Research and Development \nOrganization of the Year five times: 2002, 2005, 2007, 2008, and 2009. \nThis is an unprecedented performance accomplishment in the history of \nthe Army's laboratory of the year competition.\n  Dr. Houston led countless water resources research efforts such as \nthat for the Los Angeles County flood-control project that produced \nsavings of over $200 million. In 2004, the ERDC won the prestigious \nWhite House Closing-the-Circle Award for research on environmental \nstewardship. Under his leadership, the ERDC developed integrated \nbiological, chemical, and ecological control technologies to combat \nnonindigenous aquatic plants, resulting in annual savings of $50 \nmillion.\n  Dr. Houston has been a champion for outreach programs to foster a \ndiverse workforce and supported educational outreach activities in \ncivil engineering, environmental quality, and computer science. He \nprovided research experience for college students from Historically \nBlack Colleges and Universities/Minority Institutions, HBCU/MI. During \nhis tenure ERDC annually led the Army in meeting its HBCU/MI \ncontracting goal.\n  He has published over 130 technical reports and papers, and he has \nreceived numerous honors and awards including Phi Beta Kappa; Phi Kappa \nPhi; SES Distinguished Presidential Rank Award; two SES Meritorious \nPresidential Rank Awards; Army R Achievement Award; Army Decoration \nfor Exceptional Civilian Service; Army Commendation Medal; two Army \nMeritorious Civilian Service Awards; Silver Order of de Fleury Medal; \nBronze Order of de Fleury Medal; Eminent Speaker for 1993 from the \nInstitution of Engineers, Australia; 1997 National Beach Advocacy \nAward; and the 2003 Morrough P. O'Brien Award from the American Shore \nand Beach Preservation Association.\n  Dr. Houston's career with the Corps of Engineers has been marked with \nunprecedented accomplishments and is a superb legacy. His exceptional \nleadership qualities and technical eminence are in the best tradition \nof the Corps. He is a consummate professional whose performance in over \n38 years of service has personified those traits of competency and \nintegrity that our Nation has come to expect of its senior civilian \nleaders. We wish him and his family all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/18/senate-section/article/S11488-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING GOODRICH AEROSTRUCTURES\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating the Goodrich Aerostructures Original Equipment \nManufacturer and the Alabama Service Center in Foley, AL, on their 25th \nanniversary. Goodrich Aerostructures became part of the Baldwin County \ncommunity in 1984, originally as Rohr Industries. Twenty-two years \nlater, Goodrich expanded significantly, and since 2005 Goodrich \nAerostructures has been the second largest employer in Foley with \napproximately 800 people manufacturing, assembling, repairing, and \nservicing aircraft engine components and structures for military and \ncommercial airplanes.\n  Since its inception, Goodrich Aerostructures has received numerous \nawards and recognition for continually providing excellent service and \noutstanding products. For the past 8 consecutive years, employees at \nGoodrich in Foley have been recognized by the Federal Aviation \nAdministration with Aviation Maintenance Technician awards. In \naddition, Goodrich Aerostructures in Foley recently reached a \nsignificant milestone by delivering its 500th CF34-10 nacelle, and the \ncompany is on contract to supply the pylons and nacelle systems for the \nAir Force's C-5 Galaxy strategic airlifter as part of the Reliability \nEnhancement and Re-Engining Program to modernize the Air Force airlift \nfleet and improve support for our military personnel around the world.\n  The men and women of Goodrich have also been recognized as good \ncorporate citizens and civic leaders in Baldwin County. The United Way \nof Baldwin County recognized Goodrich as the top contributing industry \nin the county earlier this year, and Goodrich workers actively support \neducation, arts, and civic activities in the local community, including \nsupport for the Foley Public Library, the Center for Autism for Baldwin \nCounty, and the Baldwin County Council on Aging, and sending care \npackages to employees' friends and family members that are serving our \ncountry in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  On behalf of my Senate colleagues and the State of Alabama, I thank \nthe men and women of Goodrich Aerostructures in Foley.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/18/senate-section/article/S11488-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11488-S11489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING RICKER HILL ORCHARDS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as we prepare to celebrate \nThanksgiving next week, we should be mindful of the thousands of \nAmericans who make possible the celebration as we know it today. \nFarmers of all kinds grow and harvest the sweet potatoes, turkeys, and \ncranberries that we enjoy on our dinner tables every fourth Thursday in \nNovember. In recognition of one such business, I rise today to honor a \nsmall family farm that has been harvesting delicious fruits in western \nMaine for over two centuries.\n  Located in the scenic town of Turner in Maine's foothills, Ricker \nHill Orchards primarily grows apples of all varieties, most notably the \nMcIntosh, a tradition the Ricker family started in 1803. The small \nfamily-owned farm, now in its ninth generation, has expanded over the \nyears to grow other fruits, including pears and peaches, as well as \nother items like North American ginseng. Of course with apples comes \ncider, and Ricker Hill presses its own cider on the premises. \nSimilarly, the company sells numerous apple-related products at its \ncounty store, such as apple cider donuts--a fall treat in Maine--pies, \nturnovers, dumplings, and other sweets. For those without the good \nfortune of visiting Maine during the crisp fall months, Ricker Hill has \nan online store where customers can order sweet cortland and gala \napples, refreshing cider, and other unique gifts.\n  Additionally, during the early fall months, Ricker Hill adds \ncranberries--one of only three commercially grown fruits that are \nnative to America--to its repertoire. The orchard dry harvests its \nsmall bright berries, as opposed to employing wet harvesting, allowing \nRicker Hill to sell fresh berries at market that last longer. To \nproduce the fruit, Ricker Hill must irrigate the bogs starting in the \nspring, while maintaining and repairing existing fields, and building \nnew ones, throughout the summer. Finally, the company harvests the \ncranberries in early fall, using a small lawnmower-like instrument to \ncollect the fruit.\n  To entertain the whole family, Ricker Hill has taken great strides \ntowards making a visit to their farm a day-long event. Complete with a \ncorn maze, hay barn, obstacle course, and cider making tour, the \ncompany packs a plethora of activities into its Farm Fun Day Pass. \nRicker Hill also offers tours to school groups of the farm's apple \npicking and packing operations. And something one would not expect at a \nfarm, Ricker Hill even has a challenging disc golf course that winds \nthrough the farm's acres of bogs and woods.\n  Ricker Hill Orchards excels at providing visitors with a \nquintessential\n\n[[Page S11489]]\n\nMaine fall experience. And for over 200 years, the farm has been \nproducing some of New England's freshest and most delectable fruits, a \npractice that has helped the company garner a matchless reputation. As \nThanksgiving approaches, and families across the country sit down to \nplates of cranberry sauce and apple pie, I wish everyone at Ricker Hill \nOrchards many more years of successful harvests of the ingredients that \nmake this holiday so special. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/18/senate-section/article/S11489-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/18/senate-section/article/S11489-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/18/senate-section/article/S11489-3", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  At 9:33 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 748.

Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. MERKLEY (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Wyden, and Mr. \n        Tester):\n  S. 2791. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to grant \neconomy-related contract extensions of certain timber contracts between \nthe Secretary of the Interior and timber purchasers, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues Senators Ron Wyden, Max Baucus, and Jon Tester, as I \nintroduce the Forest Harvest Opportunity Act. This legislation will \nprovide a very simple, yet critical, solution to a significant problem \ncurrently facing timber communities across the country.\n  As we all know, rural communities across the country have been hit \nparticularly hard by our current economic recession. The unemployment \nrate for rural counties is far greater than the national average; it \nsurpasses 20 percent in many of the rural communities in my own home \nstate. As my colleagues have heard me mention on numerous occasions, \nmany of our rural communities have been doubly hurt by the current \neconomic recession because they depend on harvests from federally-owned \nforest land as a major component of their economies. These communities \nhave already been struggling because timber harvests on our Federal \nland have been declining, but they are facing even worse situations \ntoday because the collapse of the housing market has caused a \nprecipitous drop in timber prices.\n  For some of our forestry companies, this creates an even worse \nsituation: the contracts they have to harvest timber on Federal land \nare now worthless. Many of these contracts were signed with the Forest \nService or the Bureau of Land Management before the recession, when \ntimber prices were still high. However, because of the decline in \ntimber prices, harvesting today would cost forest companies more than \nthe wood is worth and could cause ruinous problems for some of these \ncompanies.\n  The solution is simple common sense: allow companies to apply for \nadditional time to harvest wood they have contracted for in times of \nunique economic circumstances. This simple change would allow these \ncompanies to delay the harvest until the price of timber had returned \nto a point that enabled the forest companies to earn a profit on the \nharvest. This change is not a novel idea. In fact, the Forest Service \nhas rules in place allowing to do exactly that. Unfortunately, the \nBureau of Land Management does not have similar rules in place. So, \nbased simply on which agency a company has a contract with--and in \nOregon Forest Service and BLM lands can be side-by-side--these \ncompanies may be forced to harvest timber at a loss or walk away from a \ncontract they have won after a fair bidding process.\n  The Forest Harvest Opportunity Act provides a simple solution and \nallows these companies--and only companies who have contracts right now \nduring the current recession--to petition for and receive an extension \nso they can harvest when timber prices return to a normal rate. This \nbill is a simple solution to address an important problem. Enacting \nthis legislation would provide significant economic help for \ncommunities that are already among the hardest-hit by this economic \ndownturn. I look forward to working with my colleagues for its passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2791\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Forest Harvest Opportunity \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Economy-related contract extension.--The term \n     ``economy-related contract extension'' means the addition of \n     3 years to the expiration date of a qualifying contract for \n     the right to cut and remove timber.\n       (2) Qualifying contract.--The term ``qualifying contract'' \n     means a contract, executed on or before December 31, 2008, \n     for the sale of timber from land administered by the Bureau \n     of Land Management--\n       (A) for which there is unharvested volume remaining;\n       (B) for which, not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the timber purchaser makes a written \n     request to the Secretary for an economy-related contract \n     extension; and\n\n[[Page S11495]]\n\n       (C) that has not been terminated prior to the request for \n     an economy-related contract extension under section 3(a).\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior, acting through the Director of the Bureau of \n     Land Management.\n       (4) Timber purchaser.--The term ``timber purchaser'' means \n     the party to the qualifying contract for the sale of timber \n     from land administered by the Bureau of Land Management.\n\n     SEC. 3. ECONOMY-RELATED CONTRACT EXTENSIONS.\n\n       (a) Request.--Not later than 30 days after a timber \n     purchaser requests an economy-related contract extension of a \n     qualifying contract between the Secretary and the timber \n     purchaser, the Secretary shall modify the qualifying contract \n     to add 3 years to the contract expiration date.\n       (b) Waiver of Claims as of Extension.--The timber purchaser \n     shall waive any and all claims the timber purchaser has \n     against the United States involving the qualifying contract \n     that exist on the date that the Secretary modifies the \n     qualifying contract under subsection (a).\n       (c) Claims Prior to Date of Extension.--Nothing in this Act \n     affects any claim by the United States against any timber \n     purchaser, including claims that arose under a qualifying \n     contract before the date on which the Secretary extends the \n     contract expiration date under subsection (a).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Voinovich):\n  S. 2793. A bill to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to provide \nfor clarification on the use of funds relating to certain homeland \nsecurity grants, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Strengthening \nand Updating Resources and Equipment, SURE, Act, a bill that will \nenable our country's first responders to maintain important equipment \nto protect our communities. I thank Senator Voinovich for his support \nof this important legislation. First responders across the country \nprovide critical protection from attacks on our Nation, and we should \nensure they have the tools they need to keep our communities safe and \nprepared.\n  On September 22, the Federal Emergency Management Agency announced a \nconsiderable change in their policy regarding the use of preparedness \ngrants. The new guidelines state that recipients of Urban Area Security \nInitiative and State Homeland Security Grant Program SHSGP, funds may \nno longer use the funds for maintenance of equipment beyond the period \nof performance for the grant. This shifts the burden of maintenance \ncosts for important homeland security equipment to States and \ncommunities, many of which are already struggling in the current \neconomic downturn.\n  Much of the equipment purchased with these grants is complex and \ncostly to maintain, and disallowing the use of grants to cover \nexpensive maintenance costs means that many communities will have to \nforego the use of systems in which they have already invested precious \nresources. Also, many State and local governments may be unable to \npurchase essential equipment because they would be unable to cover the \nmaintenance costs in future years.\n  A plan to implement a statewide communications system for first \nresponders in my home state of Vermont is severely hampered by this \npolicy change. State and local officials have been developing this \nsystem, known as the Lifeline System, for years and have planned for \nimplementation by combining portions of 4 years of SHSGP grants with \nadditional law enforcement funding. Upon completion of this important \nsystem for statewide coordination, considerable funds will be required \nto ensure that the system remains effective. If Vermont is unable to \nuse preparedness grants for future maintenance, the Lifeline System may \nbecome inoperable, severely diminishing statewide coordination for \nhomeland security and emergency management. I have heard from law \nenforcement officials in Vermont like Lieutenant Michael Manning of the \nVermont State Police about how changes in these grant programs will \naffect state emergency law enforcement services.\n  The SURE Act would make changes to the Homeland Security Act of 2002 \nto clarify that the administrator of these grants may not place \nlimitations on the use of preparedness grants for maintenance costs. \nThis important clarification means that State and local law enforcement \nwill be able to apply funds they receive to sustain the vital systems \nand equipment that have been put in place to keep our communities safe.\n  Our Nation's law enforcement officers deserve our commitment to \nprovide them with the tools they need to carry out their duties. I \nsupport and respect our State and local police officers and all of our \nfirst responders, and am proud to recognize their role in upholding the \nrule of law and keeping our Nation safe and secure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2793\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Strengthening and Updating \n     Resources and Equipment Act'' or the ``SURE Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CLARIFICATION ON USE OF FUNDS RELATING TO CERTAIN \n                   HOMELAND SECURITY GRANTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 2008 of the Homeland Security Act \n     of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 609) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)(4), by inserting before the semicolon \n     at the end the following: ``, and any related maintenance \n     agreements, user fees, or sustainment costs''; and\n       (2) in subsection (b)(3), by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(C) Equipment maintenance.--With respect to the use of \n     amounts awarded to a grant recipient under section 2003 or \n     2004 for equipment purchase and maintenance costs, the \n     Administrator may not--\n       ``(i) impose a limit on the amount of any such award that \n     may be used to pay for such purchase and maintenance costs, \n     including any costs referred to in subsection (a)(4); or\n       ``(ii) impose any additional limitation, including any \n     fiscal year limitation, beyond any limitation under this \n     section, on the amount of any such award that may be used for \n     a specific type, purpose, or category of equipment purchase \n     or maintenance cost.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this \n     section and shall apply to grants made under section 2003 or \n     2004 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 604 and \n     605), in accordance with the provisions specified in section \n     2008 of such Act (6 U.S.C. 609), as amended by subsection (a) \n     of this section, on or after October 1, 2008.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. Nelson, of Nebraska, Mr. Alexander, \n        Mr. Burr, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Isakson, Mr. \n        McCain, Ms. Murkowski, and Mr. Roberts):\n  S. 2796. A bill to extend the authority of the Secretary of Education \nto purchase guaranteed student loans for an additional year, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nextend for 1 year the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of \n2008, ECASLA. Without this extension, hundreds of thousands of students \nmay not have access to student loans for the 2010-2011 academic year.\n  Since 1965, the Federal Family Education Loan, FFEL, program has \nsuccessfully helped millions of Americans realize the dream of a \ncollege education. Today, it continues to provide student loans for \nnearly 70 percent of America's college students at over 3,400 schools. \nHowever, during the credit crisis of 2008 many private, non-profit FFEL \nlenders encountered difficulty raising the necessary capital to make \nstudent loans, and others left the FFEL program. Congress responded by \npassing the bipartisan, cost-neutral Ensuring Continued Access to \nStudent Loans Act of 2008. ECASLA preserved liquidity in the student \nloan market by giving the Secretary of Education temporary authority to \npurchase student loans made under the FFEL program. It has been a \nresounding success--it has preserved liquidity in the student loan \nmarket, it has been cost neutral, in fact it has generated revenue and, \nmost importantly, it has maintained student access to FFEL loans.\n  However, while it was meant to be temporary, serious problems persist \nin the financial markets and many private, non-profit FFEL lenders are \nagain considering leaving the FFEL program when ECASLA expires on July \n1, 2010. The potential consequences could be catastrophic for America's \ncollege students, many of whom will be unable to secure student loans \nfor 2010-2011 academic year without a functioning FFEL program.\n\n[[Page S11496]]\n\n  Given this predicament, the solution is simple--extend ECASLA for an \nadditional year. Unfortunately, instead of working with Congress to \npass a clean, bipartisan, one-year extension of ECASLA, the Department \nof Education is pursuing yet another government takeover and placing \nundue pressure on FFEL-participating schools to switch to the \ngovernment-run Direct Loan, DL, program. Some schools will make this \nchoice, but most do not want to because the FFEL program provides a \nproduct and services that meet individual student needs rather than the \none-size-fits-all approach of the government-run DL program.\n  Moreover, schools begin making financial aid determinations in \nJanuary--just seven weeks from now. Given that it can take 4 months to \nmake the switch to the government-run DL program, most schools do not \nhave the time, staff, resources or capacity to make the switch while at \nthe same time attending to the financial aid needs of current and \nenrolling students. Furthermore, making the switch is not simply a \nmatter of ``flipping a switch,'' as the Department of Education \nasserts. Among other things, schools must install new computer \nsoftware, hire and train financial aid personnel, and receive \nsubstantial technical assistance from the Department of Education. \nWhile the Department has been able to successfully assist the several \nhundred schools that have made the switch over the past year, thousands \nwill need assistance over the next 7 months. The Department simply does \nnot have the resources to devote the necessary time and attention to \nall of these schools, which will frantically be trying to switch before \nECASLA expires on July 1, 2010.\n  At this point, the only responsible course of action for Congress is \nto pass a clean, one-year extension of ECASLA. This will ensure that \nstudents have access to student loans, and will give Congress the time \nneeded to have a serious and well thought discussion about the future \nof the Federal student loan program.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2796\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire through \nthe facilitation of insect and disease infestation treatment of \nNational Forest System and adjacent land, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I am introducing, along \nwith my colleague Senator Risch, the National Forest Insect and Disease \nEmergency Act of 2009.\n  This bipartisan bill will provide additional tools and resources to \nthe U.S. Forest Service to help address a serious natural disaster in \nmany western forests--the deaths of millions of acres of trees due to \ninsect infestations. This is an issue of long-standing concern in the \nWest and of the utmost importance. Since my very first days in Congress \nnearly 11 years ago, I have been fighting for Colorado's forest health. \nThis day has been a long time in coming for me, but it is by no means \nthe end of the fight. We still have a long way to go in combating this \nproblem, and it is a fight I intend to see to the end.\n  The bill that Senator Risch and I are introducing today addresses any \nand all insect and disease outbreaks in our national forests. But this \nbill is in direct response to an especially pronounced epidemic of bark \nbeetles in western States. This epidemic is creating serious concerns \nin our communities regarding our forested regions, the recreational \neconomy of these areas, and water supplies and infrastructure that \nexist on these lands.\n  In essence, this bill is about securing our communities from a \nnatural threat--a threat that is as potentially devastating and \ndisruptive as a hurricane or an earthquake. This threat is a function \nof both human actions and natural processes--especially global climate \nchange.\n  I recently had the chance to show one of our colleagues the \ndevastating impact of the bark beetle epidemic. Senator John McCain \njoined me at a hearing of the National Parks Subcommittee, which I \nchair, in August in Estes Park, CO. Senator McCain and I saw firsthand \nthe march of the bark beetle as it is making its way through Rocky \nMountain National Park. We were both struck by the extent of dead trees \ncolored rust red by this insect.\n  Bark beetles and other insects that feed on trees are a natural part \nof the forest ecology. When present at normal levels, they provide \nbenefits to the forest ecology by thinning dense tree stands, creating \nopenings for wildlife, and promoting cyclical regrowth.\n  Today, various parts of the U.S.--but especially western States--\ncontinue to experience unnaturally large-scale infestations of bark \nbeetles and other insects that have resulted from past policies and \nwarming climate conditions.\n  Recent periods of drought have weakened the trees on Forest Service \nland and caused the trees to be more susceptible to fire and insects. \nIn addition, population growth on land adjacent to Forest Service land \nhas exacerbated the threats posed by insect-killed trees by placing \nlarge numbers of citizens, homes, and businesses at greater risk of \ncatastrophic wildland fire.\n  And because hundreds of miles of power transmission lines and dozens \nof communication sites are surrounded by dead trees that will fall due \nto rotted root systems, the probability that trees will fall on power \ntransmission lines, thereby resulting in wildfires and power \ntransmission disruptions for long periods of time, has substantially \nincreased.\n  Falling dead trees are also a hazard along hundreds of miles of roads \nand trails, threatening the safety of motorists and recreationists and \ndisrupting access to, and through, Forest Service land. Hundreds of \ndeveloped recreation sites, including campgrounds, picnic areas, and \ntrailheads, contain dead trees that threaten recreationists. If these \ndead trees are not removed, these developed recreation sites will need \nto be closed to preserve public safety. We are in fact experiencing \nthese closures in Colorado.\n  Moreover, parcels of Forest Service land in many locations contain \nheadwaters of water supplies for many communities. Severe wildfires \nthat remove vegetative cover pose a threat to the quantity and quality \nof water by exposing soil to erosion, thereby causing a transfer of \nsediment to rivers, reservoirs, and water conveyance systems. In other \nwords, the fire threats posed by these dead trees can have serious \nimplications to providing water not only to local communities, but also \nto major cities downstream that rely upon rivers and streams flowing \nfrom forested mountain regions.\n  All of these concerns demand that we take action to help address \nthese threats. That is what this bipartisan bill does.\n  It does so by establishing ``insect emergency areas''--that is, areas \ndefined by the Forest Service as experiencing significant tree \nmortality that\n\n[[Page S11497]]\n\nresults in increased wildfire threats and risks to people and \ninfrastructure from falling dead trees. These areas would be in the \nStates from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific coast, States that are \nexperiencing large-scale insect outbreaks.\n  Within these areas, the Forest Service would be directed to provide \npriority treatment to reduce these threats. The Forest Service would \nalso be allowed to apply funds from the Agricultural Credit Act \nprogram, which compensates individuals for removing biomass for \nproductive uses, towards the removal of beetle-killed trees.\n  The bill also provides incentives to convert this removed vegetation \ninto biofuels.\n  It allows the Forest Service to apply the streamlined National \nEnvironmental Policy Act provisions to expedite environmental analysis \nof the treatment work that is urgently needed in these high-priority \nemergency areas.\n  In addition to this focus on emergency areas the bill authorizes an \nimportant tool to help communities respond to wildfire threats on \nnearby Forest Service land. The States of Colorado and Utah have had \nthe benefit of this tool since it was provided by Congress in 2000. \nThis tool, called the ``Good Neighbor Authority,'' allows the Forest \nService to contract with state foresters to enter Forest Service lands \nand implement treatments to reduce threats next to homes and private \nproperty whose owners have, in many cases, removed dead trees and \nperformed treatments on their own property adjacent to Forest Service \nland. This program has been very successful, and the bill we are \nintroducing today will allow all states to benefit from this authority \nand make it permanent law.\n  The bill also helps the Forest Service more effectively implement \n``stewardship contracting'' as a tool for fuels treatment work. This \ncontracting, which is distinct from traditional timber sale contracts, \nallows the Forest Service to fashion agreements to perform treatment \nfor trees--like insect-killed trees--that may not have high commercial \nvalue. This program has also been extremely successful in helping to \nreduce fire threats in areas that do not possess high commercially \nvalued timber.\n  However, the Forest Service has not had the funding it needs to use \nthis tool more extensively. As a result, the bill would make this \n``stewardship contracting'' program permanent, and it would eliminate \nthe requirement that the Forest Service set aside funds in the very \nunlikely event that it would have to cancel these contracts and pay \nback the contractors. The bill would authorize the Forest Service to \nuse other funds to cancel these contracts as well as seek \nappropriations to pay for any contract cancellations. In so doing, the \nbill will help make this tool more available and allow more funds to be \napplied to urgently needed, on-the-ground treatment work.\n  I have been working with Colorado communities, the Forest Service and \nstakeholders since 2000 on forest health issues and responding to this \nbark beetle threat. I have supported providing additional tools and \nresources to the Forest Service to respond to this threat, such as the \nHealthy Forest Restoration Act, and focusing increased funds in the \nhigh hazard wildland/urban interface near communities.\n  This bill is an effort to continue providing such tools and resources \nso that we can reduce the impacts to people and property, reduce loss \nof life fighting catastrophic wildfires, and promote a more healthy \nforest ecosystem. I am relieved that we in Colorado did not experience \na serious wildfire season this year like we have experienced in years \npast--and like we will probably face in the years ahead. But we must be \nready to respond to these fires that will inevitably come. This bill \ntakes a step in that direction. It will not solve all issues related to \nforest health or stop all fires. Fire is a necessary part of our \nforests. But the bill will help us reduce threats and promote healthy \necosystems and economies.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues from both sides of the \naisle in seeing this bill passed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na bill summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2798\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

It also describes the public \n     notification process and outlines how NEPA and any other \n     applicable laws apply. This section essentially says the \n     insect and disease emergency areas are lines on a map--\n     without effect. The analysis of effects occurs when an action \n     on the ground is proposed.\n\n[[Page S11499]]\n\n                Sec. 5 Response to Emergency Designation\n\n       (a) Priority Treatments: This section describes priorities \n     for treatment--not in order of preference. The intent is for \n     the agency to treat the identified areas before general \n     forest.\n       The section also allows for assistance to State and local \n     governments, Indian tribes and private landowners for the \n     removal of hazardous trees and restoration of the health of \n     land located in the insect and disease emergency area.\n       (b) Biomass Use: This provision states priority should be \n     given to those areas that are in the insect and disease \n     emergency areas when determining BCAP funded areas. BCAP is \n     to assist with the collection, harvest, storage, and \n     transportation of biomass material. `The Secretary shall make \n     a payment for the delivery of eligible material to a biomass \n     conversion facility to (1) a producer of an eligible crop \n     that is produced on BCAP contract acreage; or (2) a person \n     with the right to collect or harvest eligible material' The \n     Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) provides financial \n     assistance to producers or entities that deliver eligible \n     biomass material to designated biomass conversion facilities \n     for use as heat, power, biobased products or biofuels. \n     Initial assistance will be for the collection, harvest, \n     storage and transportation costs associated with the delivery \n     of eligible materials.\n       (c) Emergency Forest Restoration: This section provides \n     funding assistance through grants for people who remove \n     biomass from private property. 'The Secretary may make \n     payments to an owner of nonindustrial private forest land who \n     carries out emergency measures to restore the land after the \n     land is damaged by a natural disaster.' This section adds the \n     emergency areas described by this bill under this authority.\n       (d) Biomass: This amends the definition of the renewable \n     fuels standard. The RFS specifically excludes material from \n     NFS lands--this would include those lands in the insect and \n     disease emergency area.\n       (e) Healthy Forest Restoration: This section allows the \n     Forest Service to apply the streamlined NEPA provisions of \n     the Healthy Forest Restoration Act to hazardous fuels \n     removal, hazard tree removal and restoration of the health of \n     National Forest land in the insect and disease emergency \n     areas.\n\n\n                     Sec. 6 Good Neighbor Authority\n\n       This provision makes the Good Neighbor authority permanent \n     for all states.\n\n\n                     Sec. 7 Stewardship Contracting\n\n       This provision makes Stewardship contracting permanent. It \n     also changes the current requirement of the Federal \n     Acquisition Regulation to fund costs of cancelling a contract \n     at the time of award for a multi-year stewardship contract to \n     a requirement for payment of contract cancellation at the \n     time such cancellation may occur.\n\n\n                             Sec. 8 Effect\n\n       This section says that nothing in this act diminishes the \n     right of private property owners.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/18/senate-section/article/S11499-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 354--COMMENDING ROBERT C.

Mr. President, I thank Senator Cantwell. I appreciate \nher courtesy. I just want to share a few remarks tonight.\n  We are now postcloture on the nomination of Judge David Hamilton to \nthe circuit court of appeals. Cloture is a procedure in the Senate \ngenerally used to end a prolonged debate. The majority leader, Senator \nReid, filed cloture on Judge Hamilton, however, before there had been \neven 1 hour of debate on the nomination. The cloture motion was filed \nbefore I or any of my colleagues had time set aside and had the \nopportunity to debate this matter.\n  Judge Hamilton's judicial philosophy and record as a district judge \nwere problematic. There are important matters involved considering the \nfact that President Obama has nominated him to serve on the Court of \nAppeals for the Seventh Circuit. It is worthy of serious consideration, \nthis lifetime appointment.\n  Yesterday, 28 Senators joined me in voting against cloture. I believe \nthey voted no on cloture for a number of reasons. The first is the one \nI have just mentioned. Cloture is generally reserved to end a prolonged \ndebate, and Senator Reid filed cloture without any debate, before \ndebate had really begun.\n  The second is that Judge Hamilton's judicial philosophy is outside \nthe mainstream--I think well outside the mainstream. As I have said \nbefore, if a judge is not committed to following the law whether they \nlike it or not, then that person is not qualified to be a judge. They \nmay be a good advocate, but a judge must, by definition, be impartial.\n  I think there will be more people voting against Judge Hamilton's \nnomination than voted against cloture--the 29 who voted yesterday. I \nthink we need to spend some time talking about his record and his \njudicial philosophy.\n  I do not have anything against Judge Hamilton. I understand he may be \na fine person, and I really mean that. But there is afoot in this \ncountry a philosophy of judging, an approach to law that I think is \ndangerous and strikes at the very heart of the classical American \njudicial philosophy and legal system that has served us so well. So \nthat is what this is about. If judges have the wrong philosophy as they \napproach the bench about how they should go about deciding cases, then \nthat can disqualify them.\n  As Senators, we each have a right to express our opinion on whether \nwe believe a nominee is qualified and should be confirmed or not \nelevated to a higher court, but the American people expect we will not \nmisrepresent the facts. Let's be fair to this nominee, and let's not in \nany way misrepresent who he is and what he did and what his philosophy \nis. I intend to be fair to him. I think any nominee is entitled to \nthat. Even though I might be a critic, I should not be inaccurate in \nwhat I say.\n  In this case, I think the facts have been misrepresented by others, \nand I want to correct the record on some of the issues, where it has \nbeen suggested that I or others have been incorrect or unfair in our \ncriticism. Accuracy goes both ways. If you are for a judge and want to \nmove him forward, OK, let's be accurate. Those who are opposed to him, \nyou must be restrained and accurate also.\n  Yesterday on the floor of the Senate, the majority leader, Senator \nReid, invoked the Golden Rule. He said that when he became majority \nleader, he sought to ``treat [President Bush's] judicial nominees the \nway they would want them treated if the roles were reversed.''\n  Let's take a look at the way President Bush's judicial nominees were \ntreated by the Democratic majority. Senator Reid complained that Judge \nHamilton, the judge before us tonight--tomorrow--waited 166 days for \nthis vote. If Republicans followed Senator Reid's version of the Golden \nRule, would he have been confirmed earlier? No. Judge Hamilton would \nhave waited at least another year and a half before he received \nconsideration on the Senate floor. That is exactly how President Bush's \nnominees were treated for the first group of nominees he submitted to \nthe circuit courts.\n  Priscilla Owen, a fabulous judge at the Supreme Court of Texas, John \nRoberts, now on the Supreme Court of the United States, and Deborah \nCook all waited 2 years before receiving a confirmation vote.\n  Yesterday Senator Reid said:\n\n       It's really unfortunate we have to file cloture on a judge.\n\n  Really unfortunate that we have to file cloture on a judge? As if \nthis was something that had never been done before. Indeed, during the \nBush administration, cloture had to be filed on at least 17 different \njudicial nominees because Senator Reid was leading filibusters himself. \nThe majority leader complains he could not get a time agreement. But he \nnever offered a reasonable amount of time. I believe there were \ndiscussions about 30 hours of debate, which was rejected. Senator Reid \nsaid he was stunned that some people believed there was not enough time \nto debate the nomination when no debate had been had.\n  He accused Republicans of not entering into a time agreement. But as \nI said Monday, Senator Reid has a short memory. When Senator Reid was \nin the middle of filibustering Priscilla Owen, Senator Bennett made a \nunanimous consent request that the Senate spend 10 hours more debating \nthe nomination and then vote. Senator Reid objected. When Senator \nBennett asked how much time would be sufficient to debate the Priscilla \nOwen nomination, Senator Reid responded by saying:\n\n       [T]here is not a number of [hours] in the universe that \n     would be sufficient.\n\n  Later Senator McConnell sought a time agreement on Judge Owen. \nSenator Reid responded by saying:\n\n       We would not agree to a time agreement . . . of any \n     duration.\n\n  Yesterday Senator Reid said:\n\n       The Democratic majority in the Senate confirmed three times \n     as many nominees [under President Bush] as we have been able \n     to confirm in the same amount of time under President Obama.\n\n  Senator Reid left out the fact that Democrats filibustered more than \nthree times as many nominees under President Bush. Indeed, there were \n30 cloture votes on 17 different judicial nominations during the Bush \nadministration. There were 1,044 total votes\n\n[[Page S11510]]\n\nagainst two filibustered President Bush's nominees. The Democrats, \nunder Senator Reid's leadership, cast 99.9 percent of those votes.\n  Yesterday Senator Reid talked about the Senate and the legal \nprecedent and advocated that Republicans follow Senate precedent in \njudicial confirmations. Ironically, that is exactly what Senate \nRepublicans asked Senator Reid to do during the Bush administration. \nThere had been 214 years of precedent of not filibustering judges. Yet \nSenator Reid voted more than 20 times to filibuster President Bush's \njudges. Everyone knows that in a court of law, you follow the most \nrecent precedent, and the most recent precedent was established last \ntime in the Bush administration by the Democrats in this body.\n  Yesterday Senator Reid also said the following:\n\n       I want to reiterate that every Senator may vote for or \n     against Judge Hamilton's nomination as he or she sees fit. \n     That's what we do here, but that is not the issue before us \n     today. The question before us is whether the President of the \n     United States deserves to have his nomination reviewed by the \n     Senate as the Constitution demands he does.\n\n  The fact is that Senator Reid did not feel that way about Terrence \nBoyle who was nominated by President Bush for the Fourth Circuit Court \nof Appeals and languished for close to 8 years without ever receiving a \nconfirmation vote, even though he passed out of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee with a majority vote. He did not feel that way about \nPresident Bush's nominee, the superb legal mind of Miguel Estrada, \nunanimously voted well qualified by the American Bar Association. He \nwas filibustered through seven cloture votes and was never confirmed, a \nfabulous nominee to the court of appeals and one capable of being on \nany short list for the Supreme Court. Or what about Charles Pickering \nwho was filibustered and never confirmed; Carolyn Kuhl who was \nfilibustered and never confirmed; William Myers who was filibustered \nand never confirmed; Hanry Saad who was filibustered and never \nconfirmed; William Haynes who was filibustered and never confirmed?\n  What Senator Reid meant to say was: Do not do unto me as I have done \nunto you. You get it? Do not do unto me as I did to you.\n  I don't believe Senator Reid or President Obama would wish for us to \nreturn to the Democratic version of the Golden Rule. I don't believe we \nintend to do that. Republicans have not held a private retreat to \nfigure out how to change the ground rules and to block President \nObama's nominations. That is what the Democrats did. It was reported in \nthe New York Times. We have not taken orders from outside groups to \nblock nominees. We have not blocked nominees because we do not want \nthem to sit on a specific case, and we had some of that in the past. We \nhave not attempted to filibuster a nominee in the Judiciary Committee. \nWe let them go through. That is how President Bush's nominees were \ntreated. I am not exaggerating. I was there. Those are the facts.\n  I will express my opinion in more detail when I vote against Judge \nHamilton. I have a right to do that, as does every Member. But I do not \nhave a right to misrepresent the facts, and I try to be accurate in \nwhat I say. If I am in error, I look forward to being corrected. I hope \nmy colleagues will start making an effort to do that.\n  The way this happened was this: After President Bush was elected, the \nDemocrats met with Marcia Greenberg and Lawrence Tribe and Cass \nSunstein. They came up with a new idea. They said: We are going to \nchange the ground rules. We no longer are not going to filibuster, as \nhas been done in the history of the Senate. We are going to do anything \nwe can to block in committee and on the floor good nominees.\n  We had some fabulous nominees, such as Priscilla Owen, Bill Pryor. \nThese are brilliant lawyers, proven people. They were rated highly by \nthe American Bar Association. There was strong support in their home \nStates and communities. They were blocked for months, even years before \nthey could get a vote. Some got through, and some did not.\n  My personal view is that the President deserves deference in his \nnominees. I fully expect and hope to be able to vote for 90 percent of \nPresident Obama's nominees. I voted for well over 90 percent of \nPresident Clinton's nominees. But I am not a rubberstamp. I am not \ngoing to vote for a judge who I believe, by virtue of their stated \njudicial philosophy, thinks a judge has the right to write footnotes to \nthe Constitution, as Judge Hamilton has said, who blocks legislation \nfor 7 years and has to be finally slapped down hard by the court of \nappeals because apparently he didn't appreciate the State of Indiana's \npassage of a law on informed consent. He kept that bottled up for 7 \nyears. And how much Indiana had to spend on legal fees, and how much of \nthe will of the people was frustrated by one unelected, lifetime-\nappointed judge I do not know, but it was significant.\n\n  So those are the issues we will talk about in more detail. But I did \nwant to set the record straight that I do not like not moving forward \nwith a judge and giving them an up-or-down vote, but after the 8 years \nof President Bush and the repeated filibusters that occurred then, I \nhave to agree with a number of my colleagues that, indeed, the \nDemocrats did successfully change the standard in the Senate. We have \nto be careful about it. But they changed it to say that a filibuster is \nlegitimate if you believe, according to the Gang of 14, there are \nextraordinary circumstances.\n  To me, a person can be honest and have integrity, but if they \nbelieve, as a philosophical approach to the law, they have the ability \nto write footnotes to the Constitution, they have an ability to \nactually amend the Constitution through their decisions, when the \nConstitution itself provides only one method to amend the Constitution, \nthen that makes the person one who is not qualified to be on the bench.\n  So it is a big deal. We love the American legal system. I so truly \nadmire it. It is based on a firm commitment to the rule of law. The \noath judges take that they will impartially apply the law--not allow \ntheir personal views but impartially do it--that they will do equal \njustice to the poor and to the rich, that they will serve under the \nConstitution and laws of the United States--and not above them--that is \nthe essence of it.\n  I think a judge who cannot follow that oath they must take, one whose \nphilosophy indicates they are not committed to that oath, is not \nqualified.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this body often finds itself divided. But \ntoday we are united in our respect and affection for the senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia, Robert Byrd. I join with my colleagues in \ncongratulating him on yet another historic milestone: becoming the \nlongest serving Member of Congress.\n  But I hasten to add that to salute Senator Byrd only for his \nremarkable longevity is to really kind of miss the point. The measure \nof a Senator is not just how many years he or she serves but the \nquality and the consequences of that service. That is where Senator \nByrd has truly distinguished himself in Congress over the last 20,774 \ndays.\n  The ``Almanac of American Politics'' says, Robert Byrd ``may come \ncloser to the kind of Senator the Founding Fathers had in mind than any \nother.'' I could not agree more. He is a person of wise and mature \njudgment, a patriot with a deep love of country. He is passionately \nloyal to the Constitution, and a fierce defender of the role and \nprerogatives of Congress, the Senate in particular.\n  Senator Byrd was once asked how many Presidents he has served under. \nHe answered he had not served ``under'' any President, but he has \nserved ``with'' 11 Presidents, as a proud Member of a separate and \ncoequal branch of government.\n  During his more than 56 years in Congress, Senator Byrd has witnessed \nmany changes. Our population has grown by more than 125 million. There \nhas been an explosion of new technologies. America has grown more \nprosperous, more diverse, more powerful.\n  But across those nearly six decades of rapid change, there has been \none constant: Senator Byrd's tireless service to his country, his \npassion for bringing new opportunities to the people of West Virginia, \nand his dedication to this branch of government, the U.S. Congress, and \nespecially to this House of Congress, the U.S. Senate.\n  Senator Byrd is a person of many accomplishments and a rich legacy. \nBut,\n\n[[Page S11511]]\n\nabove all, in my brief time today I want to focus on his commitment to \nimproving K through 12 public education in the United States and \nexpanding access to higher education, especially for those of modest \nmeans.\n  As my colleagues know, Robert C. Byrd was raised in the hardscrabble \ncoal fields of West Virginia. His family was poor but rich in faith and \nvalues. And his parents nurtured in young Robert Byrd a lifelong \npassion for education and learning.\n  He was valedictorian of his high school class but too poor to go to \ncollege right away. Of course, that was in the days before Pell grants \nand loans and Byrd Scholarships. So he worked as a shipyard welder and \nlater as a butcher in a coal company town. It took him 12 years to save \nenough money to even start college.\n  He was a U.S. Senator when he later earned his law degree. No other \nMember of Congress before or since has started and completed law school \nwhile serving in the Congress.\n  But degrees do not begin to tell the story of the education of Robert \nByrd. He is the ultimate lifetime learner. It is like for the last \nseven decades he has been enrolled in the Robert C. Byrd School of \nContinuing Education.\n  Senator Byrd's erudition has borne fruit in no less than nine books \nhe has written and published over the last two decades. We all know \nthat he literally wrote the book on the U.S. Senate--a masterful four-\nvolume history of this institution that was an instant classic that \nwill bear the burdens of time. What my colleagues may not know is that \nhe also authored a highly respected history of the Roman Senate. Now, \nthere are some who think Robert Byrd served in the Roman Senate, but \nthat part of the Byrd legend just is not so.\n  I have talked at length about Senator Byrd's education because this \nexplains why he is so passionate about ensuring every American has \naccess to a quality public education--both K through 12 and higher \neducation.\n  One thing Senator Byrd and I have in common--and we always kind of \ntalk about it when we get together--is we are the only two Senators \nwhose fathers were actually coal miners. We are both the sons of coal \nminers, neither of whom had very much formal education. My father only \nwent to the 8th grade. Actually, he only went to the 6th grade, but we \nwill not get into that. But, anyway, he said he went to the 8th grade, \nbut, like I said, I will not get into that. But coming from a poor \nbackground, Senator Byrd believes, as I do, that a cardinal \nresponsibility of government is to provide a ladder of opportunity so \neveryone, no matter how humble their background, has a shot at the \nAmerican dream.\n  Obviously, the most important rungs of that ladder of opportunity \ninvolve education--beginning with quality K through 12 public schools, \nand including access to college, vocational education, and other forms \nof higher education.\n  During my 25 years in this body, no one has fought harder for public \neducation than Senator Robert Byrd. As the longtime chairman and still \nthe senior member of the Appropriations Committee, he has been the \nchampion of education at every turn--fighting to reduce class sizes, \nimproving teacher training, bringing new technologies into the \nclassroom, boosting access to higher education.\n  In 1985, he created the only national merit-based college scholarship \nprogram funded through the U.S. Department of Education. Congress later \nnamed them in his honor. Originally, the Byrd Scholarships consisted of \na 1-year $1,500 award to outstanding students. Today, Byrd Scholarships \nprovide grants of up to $6,000 over 4 years.\n  Senator Byrd is a great student of literature, and I am sure he knows \nThe Canterbury Tales--a lot of it, probably, by heart. Describing the \nClerk of Oxford, Chaucer might just as well have been describing Robert \nC. Byrd. Chaucer wrote:\n\n       Filled with moral virtue was his speech; And gladly would \n     he learn and gladly teach.\n\n  Senator Byrd is a great Senator and a great American. He has both \nwritten our Nation's history and left his mark on it. It has been an \nhonor to serve with my friend, my longtime chairman, Senator Byrd, for \nthe last 25 years.\n  Today, as he reaches yet another historic milestone that no other \nMember of Congress has ever achieved--and I daresay probably no one \never will--we honor his service. And we express our respect and our \nlove for this remarkable U.S. Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/18/senate-section/article/S11511-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATING SENATOR ROBERT C.

Mr. President, I would like to say a word about health \ncare. The Democratic leader, Senator Reid, today announced that he has \ncompleted work on a health care bill. We have been waiting for that. It \nhas been written behind closed doors in Senator Reid's office for the \nlast several weeks, so we have not known exactly what might be in it.\n  We have had two pieces of legislation from the Senate, one written by \nthe HELP Committee, upon which I serve, another one from the Finance \nCommittee. Now a bill has come from the House of Representatives. It \nhas actually been passed there. Now the Democratic majority leader will \nbe bringing forward his version of the bill. The bill seems to grow \neach time we have a new one--a little faster than the Federal debt \ngrows even. This one seems to be another 2,000-page, trillion-dollar \nbill.\n  But the point I want to make tonight is that the American people's \nresponse to this work will be what all of ours should be: We want to \nread the bill. We want to know what it costs. And we want to make sure \nwe have time to understand exactly how it affects the health of each \nAmerican.\n  This is the most personal kind of debate we could have about the \nhealth of every single American. It affects 17 percent of our economy. \nIt is a dramatic proposal, an enormous amount of money, at a time when \nour debt has reached $12 trillion. A great many Americans are concerned \nabout Washington, DC, because we do not seem to have a check and a \nbalance on the various proposals for Washington takeovers, more debt, \nmore spending, more taxes. Tonight I would like to do a simple thing, \nwhich is not to make a Republican speech but to read a letter, or parts \nof a letter, and insert it in the Record, that was written by eight \nDemocratic Senators on October 6 to Senator Reid.\n  I think their words say a great deal about this bill and about how we \nshould proceed on it. The letter is dated October 6, from eight \nDemocratic Senators. It says, in part:\n\n       Dear Leader Reid:\n       . . . .Whether or not our constituents agree with the \n     direction of the debate, many are frustrated and lacking \n     accurate information on the emerging [health care] proposals \n     in Congress. Without a doubt--\n\n  Say these eight Democratic Senators----\n\n     reforming health care in America is one of the most \n     monumental and far-reaching undertakings considered by this \n     body in decades. We believe the American public's \n     participation in this process is critical to our overall \n     success of creating a bill that lowers health care costs and \n     offers access to quality and affordable health care for all \n     Americans.\n\n  And then, if I may read a couple more paragraphs from the letter from \nthese eight Democratic Senators to the Democratic leader:\n\n       Every step of the process needs to be transparent, and \n     information regarding the bill needs to be readily available \n     to our constituents before the Senate starts to vote--\n\n  ``to vote''----\n\n     on legislation that will affect the lives of every American.\n\n  The eight Democratic Senators continue:\n\n\n[[Page S11512]]\n\n\n       The legislative text and complete budget scores from the \n     Congressional Budget Office of the health care legislation \n     considered on the Senate floor should be made available on a \n     website the public can access for at least 72 hours prior to \n     the first vote to proceed to the legislation.\n\n  Let me read that again. That is not 40 Republicans--although all 40 \nof us agree with it--this is eight Democratic Senators to the \nDemocratic leader: ``The legislative text,'' No. 1, the ``complete \nbudget scores,'' No. 2, ``from the Congressional Budget Office,'' \nposted on ``a website,'' No. 3, for ``72 hours'' before ``the first \nvote to proceed on the legislation.''\n  The distinguished Democratic leader's announcement was only made a \nfew minutes ago, but my understanding is we do not yet have a complete \nlegislative text. Hopefully, that will come tonight or in the morning.\n  Second, I understand the estimates from the Congressional Budget \nOffice are preliminary estimates. This letter says: ``complete budget \nscores.'' We know what a ``complete budget score'' is around here. It \nwas talked about in the Finance Committee debate. The Director of the \nCongressional Budget Office said a complete estimate of the health care \nbill would take about 2 weeks to do. So the question is, Do they have \nit? And then: ``72 hours'' before ``the first vote to proceed.''\n  So I think the eight Democratic Senators, along with all 40 \nRepublican Senators, have a bipartisan agreement here on how we should \nstart this debate. We want to be able to read it, we want to know what \nit costs, and we want to see how it affects every American. That means, \nNo. 1, a complete text. No holes, no ``We will get back to you later'' \na complete text. No. 2, a complete estimate. Those are these words \nhere: A complete estimate of the cost and how it affects every \nAmerican. And third, for 72 hours on the Web site so not only we in the \nSenate but our constituents, the people who expect us to weigh in on \nthis, have a chance to read it before we have our first vote, which I \ndon't think is scheduled.\n\n  There is other language here, but I ask unanimous consent that this \nletter from the eight Democratic Senators of October 6 to the Honorable \nHarry Reid be included in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the last thing I would say is this: I \nthink it is pretty obvious why we want to read the bill and know what \nit costs and understand how it affects the health care of every \nAmerican, which it will, but in case anyone is wondering why we want to \nread the bill, it is because the bills we have already seen increase \ninsurance premiums, raise taxes, and cut Medicare. That is what we have \nseen from the two Senate bills and the House bill. We on the Republican \nside think this ought to be about reducing costs, reducing premiums, \nbut the Democrats' proposals increase premiums, increase taxes, and cut \nMedicare. Not only does it cut Medicare in the bills we have seen so \nfar by $400 billion or $500 billion; it doesn't spend it on grandma, it \nspends it on somebody else, even though the Medicare Program, the \ntrustees tell us, will begin to go broke by 2015.\n  There are some other problems with the bills we have seen before, so \nwe would want to be able to ask these same questions about the new bill \nwe haven't yet seen but we are about to see.\n  On Medicare, how big are the cuts? Then we hear in this new bill \nthere are Medicare taxes, new Medicare payroll taxes. On which \nemployees or which employers? And if their taxes are raised, are they \nspent to make Medicare solvent or are they spent on a new program? It \nis inconceivable to me that we could be even thinking about having \nsavings in Medicare and spending it on something else when Medicare is \nabout to go broke.\n  Then there are some other questions. The Democratic leader said it \ndoesn't add to the debt. I hope he is right, but we have questions to \nask about that. Does his proposal include a full dealing with the issue \nof physician reimbursement? What we mean by that is when we create \nthese big government programs, then some agency in Washington tells how \nmuch we can pay doctors for different services and how much we pay \nhospitals. Right now, in the government programs we have--Medicare, for \nexample--doctors are only paid about 80 percent of what they are paid \nfor serving the roughly 200 million of us who have private plans. And \nfor those who are in Medicaid--low income; that is the largest \ngovernment program--it is about 60 percent. Doctors are paid about 60 \npercent of what they were paid if they saw private physicians. Then, as \na result, 50 percent of doctors won't see new people in that Medicaid \nProgram, which is why so many people think: I am not so sure a new \ngovernment-run program of insurance is such a good idea, because I \nmight end up in it and it might be like Medicaid and 50 percent of the \ndoctors won't see new Medicaid patients.\n  Why might you end up in a government program if you are not there \nnow? Well, in the other bills we have seen--and this would be a \nquestion we have about Senator Reid's bill--the combination of sections \nmeans that a great many employers are going to look at the bill and the \nrequirements that are placed on them and they are going to write a \nletter to their employees and say: Congratulations, there is a new \ngovernment plan. I have sent a check to the government, and instead of \nhaving employer insurance, you are in the government plan. Well, you \nmay not have been thinking that was the kind of health reform you \nwanted.\n  There is the matter of the States. I will admit that as a former \nGovernor I may be more worried about this than some people, but I see a \nformer mayor in the Presiding Officer's chair today. I won't speak for \nhim, but I know I used to sit back there in Nashville and nothing would \nmake me madder than some Member of Congress coming up with a big idea, \npass it into law, issue a press release, take credit for it, and send \nme the bill when I was Governor. So all of the other bills we have seen \nsay, It is a great idea to expand Medicaid. We are going to dump about \n14 million more Americans in this program for low-income Americans and \nwe are going to send the bill for part of it to the State.\n  Well, our Democratic Governor thinks that is a bad idea, because our \nState, which is fiscally well managed--Tennessee--and virtually every \nother State is having the worst time they have had since the Great \nDepression in managing their resources. Here they have the Medicaid \nProgram going up at 8 percent a year, and they are cutting higher \neducation and other programs. That is what is going on in the States. \nSo we will have to ask the question: How much does this new bill \ntransfer costs to the States?\n  There are a great many questions we will need to ask, and they are \nappropriate questions. The Republican leader pointed out that when we \ndid the farm bill, we talked for 4 weeks. We debated, we had \namendments, we came to a conclusion, and we had a bipartisan result. \nWhen we did No Child Left Behind, it was 7 weeks. I remember on the \nEnergy bill of 2005, which put us on a new direction, Senator Bingaman \nand Senator Domenici and others worked very hard on it, but on the \nfloor it took 8 or 9 weeks. We need to have a full discussion of \nwhatever bill finally comes to the floor, and this may be the bill. It \nis at least 2,000 pages. It is at least $1 trillion. Maybe it is a good \nbill. But the American people will have a lot of questions about \nwhether their premiums are going up instead of down, their taxes are \ngoing up instead of down; how much are the Medicare cuts--why are they \nbeing spent on somebody else instead of the people in Medicare? What \nabout these Medicare payroll taxes? What about new State taxes? Will I \nlose my insurance? These are big questions and they deserve to be \nanswered.\n  A good way to start is to take the advice of the eight Democratic \nSenators who wrote the Democratic leader and said: Before we have our \nfirst vote, Mr. Leader, No. 1, we want to see the complete text which \nwe don't yet have; we want to see a complete estimate by the \nCongressional Budget Office; and we want it to be on the Internet for \nat least 72 hours--the words were very strong--because we have a duty \nto the American people that they know how this affects them, because it \nis a very personal matter.\n  I thank the President.\n\n[[Page S11513]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 6, 2009.\n     Hon. Larry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Reid: As you know, Americans across our country \n     have been actively engaged in the debate on health care \n     reform. Whether or not our constituents agree with the \n     direction of the debate, many are frustrated and lacking \n     accurate information on the emerging proposals in Congress. \n     Without a doubt, reforming health care in America is one of \n     the most monumental and far-reaching undertakings considered \n     by this body in decades. We believe the American public's \n     participation in this process is critical to our overall \n     success of creating a bill that lowers health care costs and \n     offers access to quality and affordable health care for all \n     Americans.\n       Every step of the process needs to be transparent, and \n     information regarding the bill needs to be readily available \n     to our constituents before the Senate starts to vote on \n     legislation that will affect the lives of every American. The \n     legislative text and complete budget scores from the \n     Congressional Budget Office (CBO) of the health care \n     legislation considered on the Senate floor should be made \n     available on a website the public can access for at least 72 \n     hours prior to the first vote to proceed to the legislation. \n     Likewise, the legislative text and complete CBO scores of the \n     health care legislation as amended should be made available \n     to the public for 72 hours prior to the vote on final passage \n     of the bill in the Senate. Further, the legislative text of \n     all amendments filed and offered for debate on the Senate \n     floor should be posted on a public website prior to beginning \n     debate on the amendment on the Senate floor. Lastly, upon a \n     final agreement between the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate, a formal conference report detailing the agreement \n     and complete CBO scores of the agreement should be made \n     available to the public for 72 hours prior to the vote on \n     final passage of the conference report in the Senate.\n       By publically posting the legislation and its CBO scores 72 \n     hours before it is brought to a vote in the Senate and by \n     publishing the text of amendments before they are debated, \n     our constituents will have the opportunity to evaluate these \n     policies and communicate their concerns or their message of \n     support to their Members of Congress. As their \n     democratically-elected representatives in Washington, DC, it \n     is our duty to listen to their concerns and to provide them \n     with the chance to respond to proposals that will impact \n     their lives. At a time when trust in Congress and the U.S. \n     government is unprecedentedly low, we can begin to rebuild \n     the American people's faith in their federal government \n     through transparency and by actively inviting Americans to \n     participate in the legislative process.\n       We respectfully request that you agree to these principles \n     before moving forward with floor debate of this legislation. \n     We appreciate your serious consideration and look forward to \n     working with you on health care reform legislation in the \n     weeks ahead.\n           Sincerely,\n     Blanche L.

The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Alexander for \nhis remarks because I think I have heard it said that this new health \ncare bill, don't worry about it, it is going to be revenue neutral. But \nif you create a bill that is revenue neutral by taking hundreds of \nbillions of dollars out of Medicare, which we already know is heading \ninto default in the next 5 or 6 years, and you do it by raising taxes, \nboth of which are to fund a new program that we don't have the money \nfor, then that is not, in my mind, what the average person would say in \ncommonsense thought is revenue neutral.\n  I think that is what we are talking about. We need to be able to see \nthe details of it. I appreciate Senator Alexander for that fine summary \nof where we are. I hope our Members will take it to heart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/18/senate-section/article/S11513-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
