Mr. President, I rise to voice my strong support for a \nresolution in support of Israel that Senator McConnell and I introduced \nwith a bipartisan, overwhelming number of Senators. When we pass this \nresolution, the U.S. Senate will strengthen its historic bond with the \nState of Israel, by reaffirming Israel's inalienable right to defend \nagainst attacks from Gaza as well as our support for the Israeli-\nPalestinian peace process.\n  I spoke last week with Prime Minister Olmert and again expressed my \nunderstanding of and appreciation for the terrible situation that \nIsrael has faced. Hamas has been firing rockets and mortars into \nIsrael, killing, maiming innocent Israeli citizens for more than 8 \nyears. I ask any of my colleagues to imagine that happening here in the \nUnited States, rockets and mortars coming from Toronto and Canada into \nBuffalo, NY. How would we as a country react? We would react, and we \nwould react swiftly and quickly. Israel has been very patient.\n  Gaza was controlled by Israel since 1967. They, in an effort of \nextending an olive branch to the Palestinians, gave that territory up \nwillingly. What have they gotten in return for it? Mortars and rockets \nfired, by now into the thousands. So we would have to react\n\n[[Page S182]]\n\nas they have done. We would have to react to protect our people, and it \nwould not only be our right but an obligation to do so. That is what \nthe Israelis have done. Hamas must stop the rocket fire from Gaza into \nIsrael. That is the simple stated objective of Israel. I acknowledge \nand appreciate the calls by some or a cease-fire. Certainly we must \nencourage a peaceful resolution of the conflict. But we must be certain \nthat any cease-fire is sustainable, durable, and enforceable.\n  Our resolution reflects the will of the State of Israel and the will \nof the American people. It expresses vigorous support and unwavering \ncommitment to the welfare, security, and survival of the State of \nIsrael as a Jewish and democratic state with secure borders and \nrecognizes its right to act in self-defense and to protect its citizens \nagainst acts of terrorism. It reiterates that Hamas must end the rocket \nand mortar attacks against Israel, and it recognizes Israel's right to \nexist, renounce violence, and accept previous agreements between Israel \nand the Palestinians, which Hamas has certainly not done even a little \nbit. It encourages the President to work actively to support a durable, \nenforceable, and sustainable cease-fire in Gaza as soon as possible \nthat prevents Hamas from retaining or rebuilding the capability to \nlaunch rockets against Israel and allows for the long-term improvement \nof daily living conditions for the ordinary people of Gaza.\n  This resolution believes strongly that the lives of innocent \ncivilians must be protected and all appropriate measures should be \ntaken to diminish civilian casualties and that all involved should \ncontinue to work to address humanitarian needs in Gaza. It supports and \nencourages efforts to diminish the appeal and influence of extremists \nin the Palestinian territories and to strengthen moderate Palestinians \nwho are committed to a secure and lasting peace with Israel.\n  Finally, it reiterates strong support for U.S. Government efforts to \npromote a just resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through a \nserious and sustained peace process that leads to the creation of a \nviable and independent Palestinian state living in peace alongside a \nsecure State of Israel.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me add, this resolution in support \nof the State of Israel has strong bipartisan support. Hamas is a \nterrorist organization. It clearly started this current conflict by \nlaunching rockets on to civilian sites in Israel. The Israelis, as the \nmajority leader indicated, are responding exactly the same way we would \nif rockets were being launched into the United States from Canada or \nMexico or some similar situation. The Israelis have every right to \ndefend themselves against these acts of terrorism. I enthusiastically \nsupport the resolution, as does Senator Lugar, our ranking member on \nthe Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator John Kerry has been open and very \nforward thinking on this issue. He, along with Senator Lugar, supports \nthis resolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration \nof S. Res. 10 submitted earlier by Senators Reid and McConnell.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \nresolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 10) recognizing the right of Israel \n     to defend itself against attacks from Gaza and reaffirming \n     the United States strong support for Israel in its battle \n     with Hamas, and supporting the Israeli-Palestinian peace \n     process.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, S. Res. 10, the resolution that was adopted \ntoday reaffirming U.S. support for Israel, is factually accurate. No \none here doubts our commitment to Israel's security or Israel's right \nto defend itself from Hamas rocket attacks. But the resolution, \nunfortunately, presents an incomplete response to the situation in \nGaza. With so much at stake for the United States, for Israel and for \nthe world, we owe the American people and all concerned a clear-eyed, \nforthright and constructive discussion of such vital matters as these.\n  Hamas's unilateral decision to break the cease-fire was deplorable. \nIt is clear that rather than work for peace, Hamas used the cease-fire \nto amass more powerful and longer range weapons. Its actions should be \nuniversally condemned, and they will achieve nothing positive for the \ncause of the Palestinian people. Those who have collaborated in \nsupplying weapons that are being used to terrorize and harm innocent \ncivilians in Israel are complicit in the suffering and destruction that \nhas occurred on both sides.\n  For its part, Israel used the cease-fire to pressure Hamas through a \nblockade that, in the absence of a long-term strategy, has caused \nextreme hardship for the Palestinian people collectively in Gaza but \ndone nothing to change Hamas's militant policies. The blockade was not \ncoupled with an effective strategy to address the underlying causes of \nthe conflict.\n  In the past 14 days, according to the United Nations, 758 \nPalestinians have died, including 257 children, as a result of Israel's \nmilitary operations, and thousands more have been injured. Palestinian \nhomes, schools and other civilian infrastructure have been demolished. \nAmong Israelis, three civilians have been killed, and seven soldiers \nhave died. Israeli homes have also been badly damaged from Hamas rocket \nfire. The U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which is the principal \nhumanitarian organization functioning in Gaza, suspended its operations \nearlier today due to risks to the safety of its personnel as a result \nof Israeli attacks which killed two of its workers and injured one.\n  As has been said here repeatedly, Israel has the right to defend \nitself. And I have no doubt that the Israeli Defense Forces, using \npowerful weapons supplied by the United States, can achieve tactical \nvictories in Gaza by damaging Hamas's military capabilities. But the \nright response is one that will, over the long term, make Israel more \nsecure, and that will be achieved only when Israel is accepted by its \nneighbors. Those of us who have long worked to support Israel should \nnot lose sight of this crucial goal and this bigger picture. This \nescalation will, I fear, have the opposite effect. The widening use of \nforce has implications for Israel's long-term security that should \nconcern each of us. This approach may increase support among \nPalestinians for Hamas as well as anger and resentment toward Israel \nand the United States within Arab countries and around the world.\n  Israel seeks to deal a fatal blow to Hamas militants, to bomb them \ninto submission and moderation. If our country were attacked in a \nsimilar way by one of our neighbors we might respond the same way. But \nthere is little if any reason to believe these tactics can work. This \nlatest escalation, with bombs falling and tank artillery striking in \nheavily populated areas where civilians--more than half of whom are \nchildren--have no means of escape, obviously and tangibly is providing \nammunition to extremists, inside and outside of Gaza. And in doing so \nit increases the dangers to both soldiers and civilians--Israeli and \nPalestinian--and of miring Israel in an open-ended mission in Gaza \nresulting in far more destruction and loss of innocent life than we \nhave seen so far. Ultimately, extremism is what has hindered a \npolitical resolution that ends this conflict with two secure states \nliving side by side.\n  There are some who may argue that the collapse of the recent cease-\nfire proves that Hamas will only respond to force. Hamas has abused the \ncease-fire, but that is not the only lesson from the collapse. Any \nclear-eyed analysis will show that a cease-fire cannot succeed--indeed, \nit will be exploited by Israel's enemies--if it is treated as an end in \nitself instead of as an opportunity to materially improve the \nhumanitarian situation and to undertake serious negotiations to end the \nconflict.\n  There are broadly acknowledged immediate steps that must be taken: \nput a meaningful ceasefire in place, stop the smuggling of weapons into \nGaza, and open crossings into Gaza to facilitate the flow of licit \ngoods and services.\n  But beyond that, history has shown that absent an inclusive, \ndiplomatic process that effectively addresses the core interests of \nboth Israelis and Palestinians, the cycle of violence will\n\n[[Page S183]]\n\ncontinue. Preconditions are an obstacle to that process in the Middle \nEast as much as they were for another seemingly intractable conflict, \nin Northern Ireland.\n  Others have asked these questions, which are worth repeating: Does \nthe Gaza war improve Israel's long-term, or even short-term, security? \nWas it realistic and in Israel's long-term interests to expect Hamas to \naccept Israel in advance of negotiations, rather than push for a total \ncessation of the use of violence and blockade, followed by \nnegotiations? Was it realistic to expect the ceasefire to hold while \nGaza remained under siege, rife with hunger, illness, joblessness, and \nhopelessness, and while construction of settlements continued, and even \naccelerated, in the West Bank?\n  On January 6, Secretary of State Rice spoke to the U.N. Security \nCouncil. I do not doubt the sincerity of her concern with the \nhumanitarian situation in Gaza, or for the need for a ceasefire ``that \ncan endure and bring real security.'' We all want that. But her words \nwere noteworthy for what they said about the dismal failure of the Bush \nadministration's approach to the Middle East conflict. Eight years were \nsquandered and mishandled, and President-elect Obama faces a far more \ndifficult situation than his predecessor inherited.\n  Our credibility in the entire world has suffered immeasurably since \n9/11. In particular our image in predominantly Muslim countries has \nbeen affected by the failure to advance a credible strategy to help \nresolve the Israel-Palestinian conflict. This has pronounced and \nobvious implications for our security, for Israel's security, and for \nthe entire Middle East region.\n  At this time of great opportunity in America to change our policies \nand make a true contribution to peace in the Middle East, we should be \ncareful when we adopt resolutions on subjects as sensitive as this to \nbe cognizant of the history of the region and the complexities of the \nsituation. Above all, our goal should be to enhance our role as a force \nfor peace and our ability to advance our Nation's interests.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, \nthat there be no intervening action or debate, and that any statements \nrelated to this matter be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 10) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 10\n\n       Whereas Hamas was founded with the stated goal of \n     destroying the State of Israel;\n       Whereas Hamas has been designated by the Secretary of State \n     as a Foreign Terrorist Organization;\n       Whereas Hamas has refused to comply with the requirements \n     of the Quartet (the United States, the European Union, \n     Russia, and the United Nations) that Hamas recognize Israel's \n     right to exist, renounce violence, and agree to accept \n     previous agreements between Israel and the Palestinians;\n       Whereas, in June 2006, Hamas crossed into Israel, attacked \n     Israeli forces and kidnapped Corporal Gilad Shalit, whom they \n     continue to hold today;\n       Whereas Hamas has launched thousands of rockets and mortars \n     since Israel dismantled settlements and withdrew from Gaza in \n     2005;\n       Whereas Hamas has increased the range of its rockets, \n     reportedly with support from Iran and others, putting \n     additional large numbers of Israelis in danger of rocket \n     attacks from Gaza;\n       Whereas Hamas locates elements of its terrorist \n     infrastructure in civilian population centers, thus using \n     innocent civilians as human shields;\n       Whereas Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said in a \n     statement on December 27, 2008, that ``[w]e strongly condemn \n     the repeated rocket and mortar attacks against Israel and \n     hold Hamas responsible for breaking the ceasefire and for the \n     renewal of violence there'';\n       Whereas, on December 27, 2008, Prime Minister of Israel \n     Ehud Olmert said, ``For approximately seven years, hundreds \n     of thousands of Israeli citizens in the south have been \n     suffering from missiles being fired at them. . . . In such a \n     situation we had no alternative but to respond. We do not \n     rejoice in battle but neither will we be deterred from it. . \n     . . The operation in the Gaza Strip is designed, first and \n     foremost, to bring about an improvement in the security \n     reality for the residents of the south of the country.'';\n       Whereas, on January 2, 2009, Secretary of State Rice stated \n     that ``Hamas has held the people of Gaza hostage ever since \n     their illegal coup against the forces of President Mahmoud \n     Abbas, the legitimate President of the Palestinian people. \n     Hamas has used Gaza as a launching pad for rockets against \n     Israeli cities and has contributed deeply to a very bad daily \n     life for the Palestinian people in Gaza, and to a \n     humanitarian situation that we have all been trying to \n     address'';\n       Whereas the humanitarian situation in Gaza, including \n     shortages of food, water, electricity, and adequate medical \n     care, is becoming more acute;\n       Whereas Israel has facilitated humanitarian aid to Gaza \n     with over 500 trucks and numerous ambulances entering the \n     Gaza Strip since December 26, 2008;\n       Whereas, on January 2, 2009, Secretary of State Rice stated \n     that it was ``Hamas that rejected the Egyptian and Arab calls \n     for an extension of the tahadiya that Egypt had negotiated'' \n     and that the United States was ``working toward a cease-fire \n     that would not allow a reestablishment of the status quo ante \n     where Hamas can continue to launch rockets out of Gaza. It is \n     obvious that that cease-fire should take place as soon as \n     possible, but we need a cease-fire that is durable and \n     sustainable''; and\n       Whereas the ultimate goal of the United States is a \n     sustainable resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \n     that will allow for a viable and independent Palestinian \n     state living side by side in peace and security with the \n     State of Israel, which will not be possible as long as \n     Israeli civilians are under threat from within Gaza: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses vigorous support and unwavering commitment to \n     the welfare, security, and survival of the State of Israel as \n     a Jewish and democratic state with secure borders, and \n     recognizes its right to act in self-defense to protect its \n     citizens against acts of terrorism;\n       (2) reiterates that Hamas must end the rocket and mortar \n     attacks against Israel, recognize Israel's right to exist, \n     renounce violence, and agree to accept previous agreements \n     between Israel and the Palestinians;\n       (3) encourages the President to work actively to support a \n     durable, enforceable, and sustainable cease-fire in Gaza, as \n     soon as possible, that prevents Hamas from retaining or \n     rebuilding the capability to launch rockets and mortars \n     against Israel and allows for the long term improvement of \n     daily living conditions for the ordinary people of Gaza;\n       (4) believes strongly that the lives of innocent civilians \n     must be protected and all appropriate measures should be \n     taken to diminish civilian casualties and that all involved \n     should continue to work to address humanitarian needs in \n     Gaza;\n       (5) supports and encourages efforts to diminish the appeal \n     and influence of extremists in the Palestinian territories \n     and to strengthen moderate Palestinians who are committed to \n     a secure and lasting peace with Israel; and\n       (6) reiterates its strong support for United States \n     Government efforts to promote a just resolution of the \n     Israeli-Palestinian conflict through a serious and sustained \n     peace process that leads to the creation of a viable and \n     independent Palestinian state living in peace alongside a \n     secure State of Israel.\n\n  Mr. REID.

He died on December \n24--that was on Christmas Eve--in Baghdad, Iraq, along with two other \nsoldiers in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Stephen followed in the footsteps of his father by joining the Army \nand\n\n[[Page S184]]\n\nwent on to complete basic training in Fort Sill, OK. He was stationed \nat Fort Carson, CO, and assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 16th Field \nArtillery Regiment, 4th Infantry Division. He deployed to Iraq in 2008.\n  Stephen, or Bud, as his mom called him, or Zap, as his friends called \nhim--he had lots of names--is survived by his parents, Gary and Chris, \nand his sister, Ashley, and a very close friend, also named Chris, who \nlived with the Zapasniks since he was 15 years old, whom Stephen \nconsidered to be his brother.\n  Stephen's mother described his determination to enter the Army by \nlosing over 90 pounds to get in. He was grossly overweight, but he made \nthat sacrifice. She said she barely recognized him after basic training \nbecause he lost even more weight at that time.\n  His friends and fellow soldiers affectionately nicknamed him ``Zap,'' \ndescribing him as a jokester who would happily make fun of himself if \nanyone needed to be cheered up. Zap would create short skits and record \nthem on his camera in order to share them with anyone who would watch. \nAfter the accident, many of his fellow soldiers from his battalion got \ntogether and watched the movies he had made, staying up throughout the \nnight, telling stories about him and laughing--exactly what Zap would \nhave wanted them to do. Stephen loved video games, particularly his \nflight simulator game. He wanted to become a pilot someday.\n  His colleagues described Stephen as a fantastic shot, always a \nqualifying expert in every weapon. Chris Hamil said his brother \nvolunteered to man the machine gun on top of his humvee. As we all \nknow, and certainly the occupant of the Chair knows, that is one of the \nmost exposed positions a person can take. He was willing to do that.\n  In his tribute comments, Staff Sergeant Barry summed Stephen up by \nsaying:\n\n       Zap would give the shirt off his back or the last dollar in \n     his pocket to anyone that needed it.\n\n  A comment from a friend:\n\n       My family will be forever grateful for young men like \n     Stephen who risk themselves to provide protection and \n     security to this great country of ours . . .\n\n  A spouse stationed at Fort Carson wrote:\n\n       Zap was one of my husband's soldiers and friends. Zap left \n     an impression on our lives that we will never forget. He \n     would come to my house and have the best manners and be so \n     respectful . . . Zap always cared about others before \n     himself, even offering to babysit my three children so that \n     my husband and I could have a date right before he deployed. \n     He left an impression on our lives that will never be \n     forgotten and most of all my son loved him dearly . . . He \n     was a hero in so many ways and he was a respected soldier \n     always giving 100 percent.\n\n  His mom Chris wrote:\n\n       I am so proud of my son and what he accomplished as a \n     member of the military family. I would not take back the man \n     he had become or the hero he will always be for anything, \n     even if I could have him beside me again. He was an \n     outstanding young man and he will live forever in my heart \n     and soul.\n\n  Stephen was committed to what he felt he was called to do and fully \nunderstood the sacrifice he would be making by serving his country in \nIraq. All those guys and gals over there know the risk they are under. \nThey are willing to do that.\n  Before Stephen left for Iraq, he said:\n\n       Mom, if I ever don't come back, you know I will always be \n     with you, and I will be with Jesus, and I will be fine.\n\n  Stephen had a strong faith in God, a strong commitment to his family \nand his friends, and a calling to protect our Nation by his service in \nthe Army.\n  His mom said:\n\n       I know that he is perfectly safe and spending Christmas up \n     there with Jesus.\n\n  Keep this in mind: This happened late on Christmas Eve.\n  She also expressed Stephen's pride to serve in the Army and to serve \nour country by fighting terrorism. She told me just a few minutes ago \nwhat a man he had become, and she thanked the U.S. Army for doing for \nhim what was done for him.\n  The pride is now in Stephen, this young Oklahoman who \nenthusiastically joined the military at age 17 and was willing to lose \n90 pounds in order to serve his country. He sacrificed his life in \norder to provide us with the precious freedoms we enjoy each day. His \nlife embodies what it means to be a hero.\n  We remember you today, Stephen, your sense of humor, your commitment \nto your family and to the Lord.\n  Having just talked with his mother, she reaffirmed how strong Stephen \nwas in his love for Jesus. I think we can say today--and we understand \nthis--as fleeting as life is, this wink of time we are here--and I \ntalked with Chris about this--that this today is not saying goodbye to \nStephen, it is saying we will see you later. Thanks for your job well \ndone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/08/senate-section/article/S184-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S184-S186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ECONOMIC STIMULUS\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the issue of the \neconomy and how we address the question of economic stimulus in the \ncontext of what is a very severe slowdown, recession, and in the \ncontext of what is an extraordinary situation relative to our deficits.\n  Just yesterday, the Congressional Budget Office reported that the \ndeficit this year will be $1.2 trillion. That is a number which most of \nus cannot even fathom. To try to put it in context, that size of \ndeficit has not occurred in this country, if you calculate it as a \npercentage of GDP, since World War II. It is a deficit that is \nextraordinarily large. A deficit means we are running up debt our \nchildren are going to have to pay for. So it has a real effect on the \nnext generation and generations after that and their ability to be \nprosperous.\n  Not only does CBO tell us the deficit is going to be $1.2 trillion, \nbut they also tell us that with the stimulus package that is being \nproposed--and the package that is being talked about is in the range of \n$700 billion to $800 billion, and when you throw that spending on top \nof the deficit, we are talking about a deficit which will be closing in \non $2 trillion, which is about 11 percent of GDP. That will be almost \nfour times larger than the largest deficit we have run since World War \nII. There are a lot of things causing this, of course, and most of them \nare tied to the economic slowdown. The economic slowdown is severe, but \nas we try to mute and lessen the impact of that slowdown on working \nAmericans and on everyday Americans, we have to be careful that we \ndon't do things which aggravate significantly in the outyears this \ncountry's fiscal strength and our children's ability to have a high \nquality of life.\n  I have said on numerous occasions that I believe President-elect \nObama is on the right track relative to bringing forward a very robust \nand aggressive stimulus package. But what is key to determining whether \nthat package is a good package or a marginal package is the policy that \nunderlies it. It is not the numbers so much as it is the policy.\n  I believe there are a few signposts which we should follow as we \ndevelop such a package. The first is that we not unduly aggravate this \nlong-term debt situation which we have as a country.\n  We know we are facing a fiscal tsunami as a nation. The baby boom \ngeneration is about to be into full retirement. During the term of this \nPresidency, should the President be reelected, the baby boom generation \nwill be very close to full retirement. That will mean we will have \ndoubled the number of people in retirement in this country, and the \ncost of maintaining those retirees will put a massive burden on the \nbacks of this tax generation but especially the next generation. We are \ntalking $60 trillion of unfunded liability that is coming at us. That \nis debt coming at us. That doesn't count the debt we are putting on the \nbooks today to deal with this economic slowdown.\n  So what is very critical as we address trying to get the economy \ngoing by using a stimulus package is we have to be very careful that we \nput in place programmatic activity that doesn't add to the long-term \ndebt of the Nation, that are one-time items that will basically retract \nand no longer be part of the deficit function or add to the deficit \nfunction in the outyears.\n  The TARP program is a good example. The TARP program was a program we \nput in place to try to stabilize the financial institutions of this \ncountry, and it has. That program basically\n\n[[Page S185]]\n\nused investment versus spending relative to tax dollars. We purchased \npreferred stock in a series of financial institutions across this \ncountry. That preferred stock, the purchasing of it, has helped to \nstabilize those financial institutions and the financial system of the \nNation. The purchase of that preferred stock creates a significant jump \nin the deficit for next year. Depending on how many of the dollars we \nend up using of the TARP, it could be $400 billion or $500 billion. But \nin the outyears, we are going to get that money back because we are \nbuying assets. In fact, we may get it back with interest--or we will \nget it back with interest and make a little money for the taxpayers, \nwhich would be good. They deserve to make a little money off that \ninitiative.\n  That type of investment is a one-time event which may aggravate the \ndeficit in the short run but does not aggravate the deficit in the long \nrun. That is the type of initiative we need to look at.\n  In the area--and this is being talked about a lot--of the Federal \nGovernment going out and just spending money, not investing money that \ncomes back in assets to us, we have to take the same approach: that we \nare basically going to put the dollars of the stimulus package into \ninitiatives which will make our Nation more competitive and more \nproductive in the outyears so that we get more tax revenues, hopefully, \nbut at least have more jobs created in this country as we compete in \nthe worldwide economy. Thus, as we invest in infrastructure, which will \nbe a large part of this stimulus package, it is absolutely critical \nthat we have entry-level tests to be sure that the infrastructure we \nare investing in is infrastructure which is going to produce an outyear \nreturn to us beyond the dollars that are put into them.\n  Now, we all love things such as beautifying Main Street or putting in \nrunning tracks. These are all things people love to do, and some people \neven love to build halls of fame to this issue or that issue. But that \nis not the type of infrastructure investment which is going to help us \nbe more competitive and create more jobs, and the bottom line is to \ncreate more jobs. What we want to do is invest in what is going to \ncreate more jobs and make us more competitive in the global economy: \nroads, bridges, high-speed broadband in areas that aren't quite as \ndense population-wise to make it affordable in the commercial sense; \nIT, and especially in these quasi-public areas, such as health care, \nwhere it will give us a return on our investment; the military--and we \nhave the chairman of the Armed Services Committee sitting in the \nChair--we have to obviously retool our military. These are investments \nwhich give us a long-term return.\n  So I hope as we get to the stimulus package and we send this money \nout to the States, primarily--I suspect that is where it is going to \ngo, States and communities--there will be some entry-level tests they \nhave to meet before they can spend the money so that we get a return on \nthose dollars in the way of making our Nation more competitive and more \nproductive. I would hate to see us just give it to the States with very \nlittle limitation on how they spend it because a lot of the money will, \nunfortunately, be wasted.\n  I know in my State every community is pulling together their wish \nlists, and I have seen things like putting in alarm systems in dorms. \nYou know, maybe that is a good idea, but it is not the responsibility \nof the Federal Government to do that. Our responsibility would be to \nreplace a bridge or build a bridge that is a bottleneck from the \nstandpoint of transportation or put broadband into a region of the \nState which couldn't get it otherwise because of density issues or give \nour health communities a better way to do their IT so they are more \nefficient. So we do need these tests.\n  In addition, everything needs a hard sunset. Everything in this \nstimulus package needs a hard sunset so that when we get to the end of \nthis recession, which we are going to get to because we are inherently \na resilient nation, we don't continue these programs into the future. \nBy hard sunset my view would be that for a program to continue under \nthis it would have to have a two-thirds vote.\n  Another major initiative in the stimulus package, it appears, will be \ntax initiatives. I respect, and first off I admire, the energy and the \nfocus of the Obama team on this issue. I think he has put together an \nextraordinarily talented group of people in many areas but especially \nin the fiscal area--with Secretary-designate Gardener and Larry Summers \nand Paul Volcker--and it is my view that as we look at the tax part of \nthis component--and I understand it is going to be fairly big--it \nshould be again focused on where we create jobs because this is the \nissue: How are we going to create more jobs? It is pretty obvious that \nin our economy jobs aren't created by big business or by government. \nJobs are created by individual entrepreneurs who go out and start \nsomething small and it builds. So the majority of the tax initiatives, \nin my opinion, should be focused on job creation and assisting people \nwho are willing to take risks in the small business community.\n  There is a lot of discussion about a major employment tax credit; \nthat if you hire people, you get a credit for employment. I tend to \nthink that is probably not going to generate a whole lot of economic \nactivity. If somebody is going to hire someone, they are going to hire \nthem. And they will take advantage of it, obviously, but the odds of \npeople actually adding people because they have a credit for adding \npeople is slim, I suspect. It is not human nature to do that, even for \na tax credit. I suspect it will just be money put out the door and not \nproduce much in the way of results. We have a pretty good and pretty \nrecent example of how this works in the area of tax policy because we \ndid a stimulus package which was keyed off a tax rebate last spring, \nand $80 billion of a $160 billion package was a tax rebate and it \ngenerated virtually no greater consumption. So there are some pretty \ngood statistics which have shown consumption was not increased \nsignificantly at all by that tax rebate initiative. So a tax rebate \napproach is probably not going to get you a lot in the area of the big \nbang for the buck.\n  We want to come out of this slowdown a stronger, more productive \nnation by making capital investments and using tax policy to generate \nthose investments so we can compete better in the world economy. I \nwould hope that would be the approach that is taken.\n  There is another proposal which addresses the issue of States, and \nthis one is the most problematic of all the initiatives in the stimulus \npackage for me. There are a lot of States that have been fiscally \nresponsible and actually have surpluses, and some States have said they \ndo not even need this sort of support. There are other States with \nrevenues that have dropped precipitously because of this economic \nslowdown which they didn't have any control over, and they have a \nlegitimate claim. They are in dire straits. There are other States, \nhowever, that have simply during the recession spent a lot of money \nwhich was out of proportion with what good fiscal policy allows. So I \nwould hope that as we are talking about assisting States--and I \nunderstand it is probably going to come in through the FMAP for the \nMedicaid Programs--that we have some conditionality that says if the \nState's financial distress is caused by a drop in revenues, then we \nwill be supportive. But if the financial distress is caused by the fact \nthey have simply been excessive in their programmatic activity, beyond \nprofligate--profligate is probably too strong a term--but excessive in \ntheir programmatic activities, beyond what is reasonable in these slow \ntimes, then we should not be underwriting that sort of activity that is \ninappropriate from the standpoint of fiscal restraint. We should rather \nbe focused on assisting States that have seen a significant drop in \ntheir revenue. It is difficult to do, but I believe it can be done, and \nI believe it should be done.\n\n  It is obvious we need a robust stimulus package right now, and it is \nvery obvious we need to have it sooner rather than later. From my \nstandpoint, as a member of the Republican Party, which is in opposition \nhere arguably, I want to work with the other side of the aisle and with \nthe President-elect to accomplish it because I don't think we can \nafford partisan politics at this time. We need to govern. These issues \nare so huge and are going to have such\n\n[[Page S186]]\n\na devastating impact on our Nation if they are not aggressively and \nboldly addressed that we can't afford this to be a party-line event. We \nneed to have cooperation. We have a template for that. When we took up \nthe TARP bill, which was an extraordinary piece of legislation, it was \ndone because we recognized the crisis was upon us and action had to be \ntaken, and it was done in a totally bipartisan and, I thought, a very \neffective way, and that is a good template for moving forward.\n  So I just lay these ideas out as an approach to take, and I say, from \nmy standpoint, to the extent I can participate--and I hope I can--I am \nwilling to listen to any ideas, and I want to see us make progress. I \nwant to see it be prompt because in this area, it is absolutely \ncritical for the President-elect to succeed for the Nation's good.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to follow on the comments of my \nfriend from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg. Although he and I may \ndisagree on some political issues, and we do, the fact is, many of the \nthings he just said I agree with completely. I think there is a sense \namong Members of Congress that we are facing an extraordinary set of \ncircumstances in America today. The Presiding Officer, from the State \nof Michigan, probably has endured more economic bad news than almost \nany of us. If I am not mistaken, one out of every eight people in his \nState is currently on food stamps, and it is an indication of how his \neconomy is struggling.\n  With regard to the economies of some of the other States, when you \nlook across the United States, the headlines are sobering. We have been \ntold repeatedly about the loss of jobs. Look at some of the most recent \nheadlines: DHL cuts 9,500 U.S. jobs; Chrysler to lay off 2,400 in \nFenton, MO; AT announcing job cuts; Sprint losing jobs; Stanley \nWorks, GM, Office Depot--the list goes on and on.\n  The fact is, yesterday 22,000 Americans lost their jobs. If the \nlatest projections are true, 22,000 more Americans will lose their jobs \ntoday, and 22,000 more Americans will lose their jobs tomorrow. That is \nthe state of the economy. Instead of creating employment, we are losing \njobs at a pace which sobers all of us.\n  As a student of history, I understand the Great Depression that \nFranklin Roosevelt inherited as he became President in March of 1933 \nwas much deeper and dangerous and wider in scope. But when you look at \nwhat we face today, that is the only historical analogy we can point to \nin recent memory that even is close to what we are facing.\n  Over 9,000 American families lost their homes to foreclosure \nyesterday, more than 9,000 families will lose their homes today, and \nanother 9,000 the day after and every day that succeeds. The reason, of \ncourse, is that we have so many bad mortgages--the subprime mortgages. \nMany people were misled into signing up for mortgages they couldn't \nafford, and now, as the terms reset and come due, families can't keep \nup with them and are losing homes.\n  It is not just a problem for that person who lives down the street, \nthe family who had to move out; it is your problem too. In my hometown \nof Springfield, IL, a small Midwestern town, with relatively stable \nreal estate values, my home is diminished in value because of the \nforeclosures that are occurring in our community and the general state \nof the economy so even families dutifully making their mortgage \npayments are falling behind because their core assets, such as the \nvalue of their home, are diminishing.\n  Every day this economic crisis deepens and claims more victims. \nFamilies who have worked so hard for so many years are finding it \ndifficult to maintain even the most basic standards of the middle \nclass. This is the worst economic time our Nation has seen since the \nGreat Depression 75 years ago. We can observe it, lament it, give our \nspeeches about it or we can do something. This morning, President-elect \nBarack Obama, my former Illinois Senate colleague, gave a speech at \nGeorge Mason University, right outside Washington, DC, in Fairfax, VA. \nHe talked about what we are facing and what we need to do about it. He \nsaid:\n\n       . . . equally certain are the consequences of doing little \n     or nothing at all, for that will lead to an even greater \n     deficit of jobs, incomes, and confidence in the economy.\n\n  President-elect Obama said:\n\n       That is why we need to act boldly and act now to reverse \n     these cycles. That's why we need to put money in the pockets \n     of the American people, create new jobs, and invest in our \n     future. That's why we need to restart the flow of credit and \n     restore the rules of the road that will ensure a crisis like \n     this never happens again.\n\n  That work begins with a plan, a plan that he says he is confident \n``will save or create at least 3 million jobs over the next few \nyears.'' He talks about the priorities we need to invest in, such as \nenergy and education, health care and new infrastructure, that are \nnecessary to keep us strong and competitive in the 21st century.\n  Yesterday, the designate for the new Secretary of Energy, Dr. Steven \nChu, came to my office. He is a man who is widely respected for his \nacademic expertise and knowledge of energy issues. He finds it a little \nchallenging and daunting, as he thinks about facing Members of Congress \nand the massive level of employment of personnel at his Department, but \nhe talked in terms of energy, and he said it is ironic we have reached \na point in history that the United States is not on the cutting edge of \ndeveloping new forms of energy technology. The windmills we are \nconstructing across America are, by and large, built or designed in \nEurope. Nuclear energy we have not touched for some 20 years in this \ncountry and have ceded the research to other countries.\n  There are areas where we need to invest in America. As President-\nelect Obama said this morning at George Mason University, this energy \ninvestment is important for our future to move toward energy \nindependence.\n  President-elect Obama in a few days will take the oath of office not \nfar from here and then will count on Congress to move quickly to pass \nthe American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan. He is urging we do it \nboldly and swiftly and that we bring transparency and openness to the \nprocess so the American people see their money is being well spent on \ninvestments in America's future--investments when it comes to education \nand energy and health care; investments that will bring down the cost \nof health care for many American families who are struggling today, not \nto mention those who have no health protection whatsoever.\n  He also calls on us to stabilize and repair our financial system on \nwhich we all depend. I think we know what we are talking about. When a \nman named Bernard Madoff can, over the span of 10 or 20 years, lure \ninvestors into what has turned out to be a Ponzi scheme, causing many \nof them to lose millions of dollars, and his wrongdoing goes unnoticed \nby major regulatory agencies such as the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, it is clear more has to be done.\n  When the ratings agencies, major ratings agencies that set the \nstandards for whether a company is doing well basically ignore their \nresponsibility and fail to make accurate reports, everyone loses as a \nresult of it.\n  President-elect Obama said in closing today:\n\n       It is time to set a new course for this economy, and that \n     change must begin now. We should have an open and honest \n     discussion about this recovery plan in the days ahead, but I \n     urge Congress to move as quickly as possible on behalf of the \n     American people. For every day we wait or point fingers or \n     drag our feet, more Americans will lose their jobs. More \n     families will lose their savings. More dreams will be \n     deferred and denied. And our Nation will sink deeper into a \n     crisis that, at some point, we may not be able to reverse.\n\n  I hope what I am about to say is a reminder to all of us of the \nresponsibility\n\n[[Page S187]]\n\nwe face in this new session. We are all concerned about the size of the \neconomic stimulus plan. Eight years ago, the Federal Government was \nactually running a budget surplus. Today we estimate a budget deficit, \nby the end of the year, of $1 trillion. That deficit is a reflection of \npoor choices that have been made at many levels of Government, but we \ncannot let the bad choices in the past prevent us from making the wise \nchoices we have to make now to end this economic crisis.\n  It is interesting that economists from all across the political \nspectrum have come to the same conclusion about what America needs. \nNobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman, who is put in the category \nof liberal or Democrat, said recently:\n\n       It is much better, in a depressed economy, to err on the \n     side of too much stimulus than on the side of too little.\n\n  He publicly wondered whether three-quarters of a trillion dollars is \nenough. Martin Feldstein, President Reagan's chief economic adviser, \nsaid:\n\n       Without action, the economy will continue to decline \n     rapidly.\n\n  Mark Zandi, who advised Senator McCain during his campaign, said:\n\n       My advice is, err on the side of too big a package rather \n     than too little.\n\n  All the great minds, economic thinkers, are coming to the same \nconclusion: We need to act, act decisively, and act boldly. But we need \nto act responsibly too. We do not have a day to waste, but we do not \nhave a taxpayer dollar to waste either. We have to make sure the \ndollars are well spent, not in the creation of Government agencies but \nin the creation of good-paying jobs right here in America; not in \ninvestments in bureaucracy but investments in our economy that will \nhelp our Nation grow in the years to come.\n  We need to include smart spending and targeted tax cuts for the \nmiddle class so they can cope with the challenges, the economic \nchallenges they face. We have to make sure the money that is spent by \nCongress is spent responsibly so we do not end up with embarrassing \nearmark projects that have not been subjected to public scrutiny and \nreview in advance. We need to make sure programs are authorized and \nfunds are pumped quickly into the economy but in an efficient way.\n  We need to invest in jobs for American workers. States have \nidentified almost $18 billion in road and bridge projects ready to \nlaunch within 90 days. Every $1 billion of Federal funds can create up \nto 35,000 private sector, good-paying American jobs and generate $6.2 \nbillion in economic activity.\n  There is a lot of work to do. Our States are struggling. They don't \nhave the money to keep the safety net Americans will need as the \neconomy weakens. They cannot help colleges and universities that need a \nhelping hand. Nineteen States are considering cutbacks in basic health \ncare; 18 States are cutting services for the elderly; 20 States are \ncutting or proposing to cut K through 12 and early childhood education. \nThe list goes on and on.\n  I see my colleague from Montana, and I will be happy to take the \nchair so he can continue his remarks, if necessary, but the last point \nI will make is that the mortgage foreclosure crisis is at the core of \nour problems in America. We cannot come to grips with a rebirth of the \nAmerican economy without dealing with the mortgage foreclosure crisis. \nIt is a crisis that, as I mentioned earlier, hurts the families losing \ntheir homes and those living in the neighborhoods and towns around \nthem. We are all in this together. What we need to do is work with \nmajor financial institutions to renegotiate these mortgages so people \nwho still have a job and can make a reasonable mortgage payment can \nstay in their homes.\n\n  I got off the phone with one of the major bankers in the city of \nChicago, a friend of mine. He said: We get it. We are going to have to \ndo things much more boldly to deal with mortgage foreclosure. The \nprograms we put together, the voluntary programs, have not worked, they \nhave not touched enough people. More and more homes are facing \nforeclosure, more people are heading to bankruptcy, and that has to \ncome to an end. The housing industry, much like the automobile \nindustry, is one of the staples of our economy and we have to deal with \nputting it back on track.\n  Last month, Credit Suisse estimated 8.1 million homes were likely to \nbe lost to foreclosure by 2012. If the economy continues to worsen, \nthey believe foreclosures will exceed 10 million homes.\n  We are going to have to come up with the money to turn this economy \naround. It will mean more debt in the short term but, if the economy \nstarts moving forward again, it, frankly, is the only thing that we can \nlook to in the long term for America's future. I urge my colleagues in \nthe Senate, Democrats and Republicans, to try to find a common ground \nwhere we can work together.\n  Just a day or two ago, President-elect Obama came up to meet with \nDemocrats and Republicans, House and Senate leaders, just a few steps \nfrom this Senate floor. There was a conversation about ideas. I know \nhim pretty well, having served with him, and I have been his friend for \na number of years. I know he was genuine and sincere when he turned to \none of the Republican leaders and said: If you have a better idea, I \nwant to hear it. I want an opportunity to bring in all ideas, \nDemocratic and Republican, so we can come up with the best package to \nserve the American people. It is not about one political party taking \ncredit. Let's take credit as a Congress and as an administration in \nturning this economy around.\n  We are going to have that chance, to stabilize our economy and to \nrebuild it in the future. I look forward to working on a bipartisan \nbasis to achieve that.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I join the Democratic whip in his \ncomments. I think it is critically important that we work together in \nthese economic times to solve the problems this country faces. We don't \nhave problems as Democrats or Republicans with the economy, we all have \nproblems with the economy, and I think the American people are looking \nforward to us working together for solutions to our economic mess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/08/senate-section/article/S187-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ORDER FOR RECESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, as we begin this new year and this new \nCongress, I would like to ask the Senate to stop and reflect on the \nservice of the men and women of our military. Every day, hundreds of \nthousands of men and women in all branches of our military are \nperforming jobs that place them in harm's way and at the tip of the \nspear.\n  In particular, I would like to thank the 229 men and women of the \nMontana National Guard who have deployed or will be deploying this \nmonth.\n  Just in the past week, 46 airmen from the Montana Air National Guard \nsecurity forces left the sub-zero temperatures in Montana for training \nat Fort Bliss, TX. From there, they will head to Kyrgyzstan.\n  Another 120 soldiers of the Montana National Guard's 639th \nQuartermaster Battalion left Helena for Fort Lewis, WA before they \nleave for Iraq.\n  And later this month, 63 soldiers from our 189th Aviation Battalion \nwill go to Fort Sill to prepare for a tour in Iraq.\n  We feel a great deal of pride when sending our strongest and most \ndedicated Montanans overseas. We feel a great deal of hope too.\n  Leaving Montana to answer the call of duty isn't just another \nassignment. It is a symbol of commitment and courage. We will always \nappreciate their service, their hard work, and their willingness to \nprotect Montana and America.\n  They say Montana is just a small town with a lot of long streets, and \nthat means that when 229 guardsmen deploy overseas, it impacts a great \ndeal of the State.\n  Businesses lose talented members of their workforce. Cities and towns \nlose cops, firefighters, doctors and other professionals in the \ncommunity.\n  And most important of all, families have an empty seat at the dinner \ntable. Family schedules get changed. Mothers and fathers become single \nparents for a little while.\n  Americans will never forget the sacrifices National Guard families \nmake at home.\n\n[[Page S188]]\n\n  Sharla and I join all Montanans in sending our thoughts and prayers \nto these men and women as they complete their mission.\n  As Montana's only member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, I look \nforward to working to serve them as honored veterans when they all come \nhome.\n  I yield the floor.

Mr. President, a few days ago, we all counted down the \nfinal seconds of 2008. In Israel they had something else to count all \nthrough last year. From January until December of 2008, a terrorist \ngroup launched more than 3,262 rockets and mortar shells into Israeli \ncities. These were deliberate acts of violence, provocation, and \nmurder. The group responsible was Hamas. Hamas is a terrorist \norganization founded on one principal goal: destroying the state of \nIsrael. Its charter says there is no value to international \nconferences, political initiatives, or dialogue. It says there is only \none approach to the political situation in the Middle East, and that is \njihad.\n  So it was no surprise when the terrorist group Hamas staged an \nillegal coup against the forces of President Mahmoud Abbas, the \nlegitimate President of the Palestinian people. It was no surprise that \nHamas rejected Egyptian and Arabian calls for an extension of the \ncease-fire Egypt had negotiated.\n  It was no surprise that when Israel voluntarily and unilaterally \ndismantled settlements and withdrew from Gaza in 2005 that Hamas saw \nthis not as an opportunity to build peace but to instigate war, to \ncontinue to terrorize and kill Israelis in their places of worship, \ntheir schools, and their homes.\n  Since that year, Hamas terrorists have used Gaza to fire more than \n6,300 mortars and rockets into Israel, reaching major cities, and \npushing ever closer to the capital.\n  No country would be expected to sit on its hands and simply allow its \ncitizens to endure these kinds of vicious attacks without taking action \nto stop the responsible party. If I am sitting in New Jersey, and \nrockets are landing around my house, near my children, and near our \nschools, my No. 1 goal, my immediate goal, is to stop the rockets. So \nin December of 2008, Israel sent its military to Gaza to achieve a \ndirect goal: stop the rockets.\n  And now we all hope strongly that this goal can be achieved as \nquickly as possible. But we recognize it must be pursued if Israel is \nto have the sovereign right to protect itself and its citizens. \nIsrael's acts to stop the Hamas rocket attacks are a response to the \ndaily risk of death faced by the 900,000 Israeli citizens who live \nwithin rocket range. These innocent civilians have been forced to live \nconstantly under the threat of mass casualties. No nation--no nation--\nshould have to wait for the death toll to rise enough before it can \nact. No nation needs to wait until enough schoolchildren have fallen \nvictim to a rocket attack before it stops rockets from falling on its \ncities. The launching of rockets and mortar fire is an invasion of \nIsrael's sovereign territory. It is no different from dropping bombs \nout of airplanes. It is no different from any other act of war. There \nis no question that Israel has a right and an obligation to defend its \npeople.\n  We mourn the loss of all innocent life, and the death of Palestinian \ncivilians as a result of this conflict is tragic. There are a great \nmany Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank who completely reject the \nHamas ideology. They want to live in peace and build the Palestinian \nstate for themselves and for their children. They are, however, Hamas \nhostages. Hamas has hijacked Gaza, not to build a state in which you \ncan live in peace and prosperity but to use it as a base to launch \nattacks against innocent civilians in Israel.\n  Let us remember it was Hamas that chose to end the cease-fire, Hamas \nthat chose to fire a continuous barrage of rockets. To date, it is \nHamas that deliberately uses civilians as human shields and launches \nits attacks from heavily populated civilian areas, putting them at \nrisk. It is Hamas that has spent its money on rockets rather than on \nfood for the hungry. It is Hamas that would rather focus on the \nrhetoric that calls for the destruction of the State of Israel than on \nrelief for its own people.\n  Israel and the United States have proven their commitment to helping \ninnocent civilians in Gaza. In stark contrast to the terrorist group of \nHamas, Israel has taken significant steps to prevent civilian \ncasualties. They give warnings of impending attacks, they drop \nleaflets, and make phone calls to targeted areas to warn the citizens \nthey are in danger, even if that means losing the element of surprise \nand putting the lives of their own soldiers at risk.\n  Israel and the United States have actively provided humanitarian \nassistance to Gaza. Since December 26, 10,000 tons of humanitarian aid \nhave been delivered to Gaza in coordination with Israel, the \nPalestinian Authority, international organizations, and various other \ndonors.\n  The United States Government, through the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development, is continuing to deliver humanitarian \nsupplies to the people of Gaza. The United States has provided medical \nand food supplies to health care facilities. We support the UN, the \nInternational Committee of the Red Cross, and other nongovernmental \norganizations as they continue their relief efforts.\n  We all want peace in Gaza and hope it can come very soon. But peace \ncannot be achieved so long as Hamas continues its missile attacks. If a \njust and lasting cease-fire is to occur, it is incumbent upon Hamas to \nimmediately and permanently halt all attacks against the Israeli \npeople.\n  I rise today to express unwavering commitment to the welfare, \nsecurity, and survival of the state of Israel as a Jewish and \ndemocratic state. That is what the resolution before us affirms. As the \nresolution states, the ultimate goal of the United States is a \n``sustainable resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, that will \nallow for a viable and independent Palestinian state, living side by \nside in peace and security with the State of Israel.'' This will not be \npossible as long as Israeli civilians are under threat from rockets. As \nthis resolution correctly lays out, Hamas must end the rocket and \nmortar attacks against Israel, recognize Israel's right to exist, \nrenounce violence, and agree to accept previous agreements between \nIsrael and the Palestinians.\n  Today, the Senate must stand in support of the state of Israel, stand \nin support of its right to defend itself against terrorists, stand in \nsupport of its right to exist. Having said all of this, of course, we \nurge Israel as it defends its sovereignty and its people to use every \noption it can to limit the loss of innocent lives. So let us vote for a \nresolution that demonstrates our commitment to one of the strongest \nallies the United States of America has in the world, and let us do all \nwe can to make it a peaceful 2009.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester.)

Mr. President, I would like to speak to two subjects. The \nfirst deals with a resolution the Senate unanimously adopted this \nmorning.\n\n[[Page S189]]\n\n  Mr. President, today the Senate approved a resolution recognizing the \nright of Israel to defend itself against terrorist attacks from Gaza \nand reaffirming the United States' strong support for Israel in its \nbattle with Hamas.\n  The first thing the resolution does is remind people why the State of \nIsrael had to act.\n  Israel has had to endure more than 6,300 rocket and mortar attacks on \nits citizens since it fully withdrew from Gaza in 2005. In fact, the \ntown of Sderot, which is about 3 miles from the border of Gaza, has \nbeen suffering for over 8 years from these attacks.\n  Is there any doubt that if the United States were suffering an attack \nfrom just across the border similar to what Israel is facing, that we \nwouldn't react to stop that from happening? I think there is no \nquestion that we would act to stop this terrorism, and this resolution \nexpresses the United States' support of Israel's right to defend \nitself.\n  The second point the resolution makes is that there is no equivalency \nbetween the terrorist actions of Hamas and the defensive actions of \nIsrael. Israel conducts its military operations to spare innocent life. \nIt has specifically targeted Hamas command centers, security \ninstallations, rocket-launching sites, weapons stockpiles, and weapons \nsmuggling tunnels. It has tried very hard to avoid civilian casualties. \nHamas, on the other hand, deliberately and maliciously fires rockets \ninto civilian areas from civilian areas, thereby making it more \ndifficult for Israel to target the terrorists and increasing the \nlikelihood of civilian casualties when Israel does take action.\n  Finally, this resolution speaks to calls for a cease-fire. Many \nvoices in the international community have been heard pleading for an \nimmediate cease-fire, although I think it is instructive that one never \nhears those voices condemning rocket attacks by Hamas terrorists.\n  I believe the path to a halt in the violence is clear. A cease-fire \nis appropriate if, and when, it is durable and sustainable. A \nprecipitous cease-fire, on the other hand, that would allow Hamas to \nrearm and rebuild its support in Gaza is not acceptable. Hamas cannot \nbe given a cease-fire that only serves to provide it breathing room to \nregroup and then start firing its rockets and missiles again.\n  By adopting this resolution, we have said to the Israeli people: ``We \nstand with you, and we support you in defending yourselves against \nterrorists.''\n  In short, the resolution expresses strong support for the defense of \nIsrael by its military action today in the Gaza Strip, the fact that it \nhas been repeatedly attacked by Hamas terrorists from the Gaza Strip, \nand finally decided that the only way to stop those attacks on its \ncitizens was to go into Gaza and try to remove the weapons and the \nlaunching sites and to try to arrest the terrorists who were involved \nin the launching of those rockets.\n  This resolution expresses strong support for Israel. It reminds us \nall why Israel was forced to act. It makes the point that there is no \nequivalency between the action of the Israelis and the terrorist action \nof Hamas, which deliberately seeks to harm civilians. Finally, it \nspeaks to the question of a cease-fire, noting that the position of the \nUnited States is correctly that a cease-fire could only be supported if \nit is durable and sustainable; in other words, it ensures that the \nconditions that created the controversy today are not simply repeated \nanother 6 months from now when the Hamas terrorists have had an \nopportunity to rearm.\n  I am pleased the Senate has spoken in such a timely fashion on this \nimportant issue. I commend my colleagues for supporting the resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/08/senate-section/article/S189-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S189-S190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ECONOMIC STIMULUS\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the president-elect spoke to the stimulus \npackage today. The Finance Committee had an informal meeting today to \ndiscuss the proposition. Its outlines are still quite vague. There is \nno specificity to what precisely will go into the stimulus package, but \nthere are some general concepts emerging.\n  So what I wanted to do today, very briefly, is to outline what I \nthink would be some sensible tests to evaluate what is being proposed, \nand what it may reveal is that some ideas would not meet these tests \nand should not be part of a stimulus package. Others would meet the \ntests and would help to resolve the economic crisis that faces America \ntoday.\n  I think the context we put this in is one in which we have already \nhad some bailouts, and Americans are a little suspicious that some of \nthe money we have committed to these bailouts is going to help--the \n$200 billion bailout to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the $150 billion \nbailout of AIG, the insurance company, the $700 billion Troubled Asset \nRelief Program, the recent $17.4 billion auto bailout, and, by the way, \nthe announcement yesterday was that for the first time in the history \nof the world the budget deficit of a country--namely, the United States \nof America--will top $1 trillion. That is over 8 percent of our gross \ndomestic product.\n  A friend of mine reminded me today--I think it is an interesting bit \nof trivia--$1 trillion is more money than all the cash in circulation \nin the world today of the United States of America. All the dollar \nbills, the ten-dollar bills, the hundred-dollar bills, and all of the \nquarters, nickles, and all of the other cash of the United States does \nnot equal $1 trillion, and that is how much the deficit is going to be \nfor just this current year. That is a lot of money.\n  In that context, we have to be very careful about how we spend \nanother $1 trillion or thereabouts to stimulate the economy. The money \ncomes from somewhere, and it either comes from taxpayers directly in \nthe form of increased taxes or it is borrowed and the taxpayers \neventually have to pay that back with interest. The interest cost, by \nthe way, is expected to be well over $300 billion. So, as a result, we \nhave to be very careful that we do more good than harm by taking this \nmoney away from American taxpayers. The first test obviously is, will \nit work? Will it stimulate economic growth? That is the test that Larry \nSummers, an adviser to the President-elect, has stated. In fact, he \nsaid, and I am paraphrasing, that investments will be chosen \nstrategically on the basis of which will do the most to spur the \neconomy. So if we have tried something before, and it has not worked, \nit is a good sign that probably we should not do that.\n  The reason I say that is we had a stimulus already: the so-called tax \nrebate. We spent $150 billion on it. The facts are now in. It did not \nwork; it did not stimulate the economy. In fact, only about 12 percent \nof the money turns out to have been spent. The lesson to be learned in \na situation like this is, if you have tried something before and it has \nnot worked, then do not repeat it because it is throwing good money \nafter bad.\n  The reason it did not work is because when people get a one-time \nwindfall, they tend to save it or to pay bills with it. They spend it \nif they believe that it is a permanent part of their income forever, \nmore so if it is going to relate to their taxes, we need to ensure that \nthey know that they are going to have permanent tax relief. If it is \nsimply something they believe they are going to have for a year or two, \nchances are they are not going to spend it. It is not going to do any \ngood.\n  Another test is, would Government action be better in the private \nsector or the Government sector? We know in America it is small \nbusiness and some big business. It is our free enterprise system that \ncreates jobs, that creates economic growth. The Government cannot \ncreate economic growth.\n  In fact, when the Government gets involved, there is more potential \nto do harm than good. We can tax them, we can regulate them. Usually, \nit does not do them any good. Sometimes you can do things to help \nbusiness. Usually, you do it in a way that helps with their tax burden. \nThere are some good ideas that I have heard discussed that would, by \nmaking it more tax friendly to invest in certain kinds of equipment, \nfor example, or to hire more people, if we knew that would stimulate an \neconomic activity, that those kind of activities would be very useful.\n  But frequently when we spend Government money, in this case, for \nexample, potentially creating 600,000 new Government jobs, remember we \nare taking that money out of the private sector, and it is likely to do \nless good in the public sector than it would if we left it in the \nprivate sector.\n  In fact, a couple of economists with whom we spoke yesterday noted \nthat\n\n[[Page S190]]\n\neven in a recession business gets a 4 to 5 percent return on its \ninvestment. The real test should be, if the money is spent in the \nGovernment sector, will we get at least that return on the investment \nthat we are making? If we do not, we should leave that money in the \nprivate sector so the private sector can get that return on that \ninvestment and therefore generate more economic activity in our private \nenterprise system.\n  Another question is whether the new Government spending replaces \nState and local spending. My understanding is there is a big chunk of \nmoney to go to State and local governments. Now they have gotten \nthemselves into a pickle because a lot of them have big budget deficits \nthis year. They are going to constrict what they spend money on as well \nor they are going to have to raise taxes or fees or find some other way \nto balance their budgets.\n  But they obviously would like for the Federal Government to bail them \nout. Well, obviously before the Federal Government considers doing \nthat, the first question is, Are you going to correct what has created \nthe deficiency in the first place or are we simply going to save your \nbacon then you do not have to do anything to change your ways. Are you \ngoing to reduce your spending? For example, are you going to spend the \nmoney anyway?\n  People are talking about shovel-ready projects. There are a lot of \nshovel-ready projects at the State level for roads or highways or \nwhatever, and they are called shovel-ready because the State is \nprepared to do them. Well, if the State is going to do them anyway, \nthen clearly the Federal Government paying for it is not going to \ncreate any new jobs. It is not going to stimulate economic growth in \nany way, even though it might produce a new bridge or a new highway \nthat is useful to the people in that State. So since our goal is to \nstimulate new economic activity, we must ask whether the spending will \nreally create new economic activity or merely replace something at the \nState level that would occur anyway.\n\n  The penultimate question is, Is it worth doing? We have to ask the \ntaxpayers from whom we are getting money whether an investment is worth \nundertaking at all. For example, one of the things that would be on an \ninfrastructure to-do list was a mob museum in Las Vegas; there was a \nsnowmaking venture in Minnesota. Are these the kind of investments that \nAmerican taxpayers believe are warranted under any circumstances?\n  There are a lot of investments the Federal Government can make that \nare worthwhile. For example, clearly we have used a lot of military \nequipment that needs to be replaced. There are good jobs throughout \nthis country producing military equipment. We need to add personnel to \nour military. I think there is a general consensus to do that. That \nwill cost money. That will obviously create jobs.\n  So those are activities that are needed, are worthwhile, are job \ncreating, and clearly would help our country, potentially being much \nmore worthwhile than, like I say, a mob museum or some kind of \nsnowmaking equipment.\n  Then, finally, I think there is one final test that we might talk \nabout. In view of the huge deficit we have, should we make the deficit \nworse? This is a cost-benefit analysis. This is clearly going to be \nadded to the deficit. So the question is, How much more deficit can we \npile on without having adverse consequences in the immediate and long-\nterm? We might stimulate the economy over the next 3 or 4 months, but \nif we are creating a huge hole to dig out of 3 or 4 years from now, we \nhave to ask, Is it really going to be worth it.\n  So when we evaluate the different proposals, we have to ask whether \nit is going to be worth it to have this large a deficit, twice the $1.2 \ntrillion of this coming year. One thought in this regard is this: When \nwe lower tax rates, we know it helps people. It helps small business \ncreate jobs. That is what you do in a recession. You try to help people \nby letting them keep more of their money so they can spend it and help \nget us out of the recession.\n  Permanent tax cuts are the way to do that. The permanent tax cut \nobviously may or may not reduce revenue to the Treasury. The right kind \nof tax cuts can actually produce more revenue to the Treasury, but \nincreased spending, there is no way around it, loses money to the \nTreasury. It puts you in a deeper hole. So as between the potential \nrelief from taxes, leaving more money in the private sector, which is \neventually going to create the jobs to get us out of the recession, or \nhaving the Government spend more money and creating a larger deficit \nthat way, it is a test that I think we need to be very clear about, \nfrom my mind.\n  While I am willing to help do things to stimulate economic activity \nin the short term, I am not willing to ignore long-term consequences of \na deficit the size that would be created by the kind of spending we are \ntalking about.\n  If we apply the right kind of tests--and they are sensible. They are \nnot Republican or Democratic tests; they are obviously tests that any \nprudent person would ask before spending this kind of money--I think \nthat will help us better evaluate the kind of economic stimulus package \nwe can actually support in the Senate. It will be the kind of analysis \nour taxpaying constituents expect of us when, in view of all of the \nother things that have been done to bail out various aspects of our \neconomy, with the kind of trillion-dollar-plus deficit we are looking \nat, they want us to engage in, they want us to be prudent.\n  They have had their fill of wasteful Washington spending. They want \nus to be very careful about what we do with their money in the future. \nI hope as we engage this debate in the future--we will have plenty of \ntime to talk about it, debate it, think about it, to analyze it and I \nam not suggesting we try to slow-walk it, but in trying to move quickly \nwe nevertheless take the time to perform the kind of analysis I have \ntalked about.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a long-time, \ngood friend and a great Georgian, Griffin Bell, who passed away on \nMonday of this week. Judge Griffin Bell was a native of America's \nGeorgia. He was a distinguished lawyer in our State since 1947, when he \npassed the Georgia bar after completing just four quarters of study in \nhis beloved Mercer Law School in Macon, GA. Upon graduation the \nfollowing year, he entered private practice in Savannah. Appointed by \nPresident John Kennedy to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, Attorney \nGeneral of the United States under President Jimmy Carter, and as an \nattorney for President George H.W. Bush, Judge Bell has left an \nextraordinary legacy of courage, integrity, wisdom, and, yes, humor to \nour Nation and to my State.\n  In one of the press reports this week, upon Judge Bell's death at the \nage of 90, one of his law partners, Richard Schneider at the \ndistinguished Atlanta firm of King & Spalding, where Judge Bell \npracticed before and after his service on the Federal bench and as \nAttorney General, said:\n\n       No novelist, not even Dickens or John Irving, could have \n     created a more memorable character than Judge Bell. He took \n     the role of being a lawyer and transformed it into a legend. \n     It is remarkable that every man and woman who spent even a \n     brief period with Judge Bell would cling to him and claim him \n     as their hero forever. That is how legends are made and \n     legends last forever. That will be the case with the great \n     Griffin Bell.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article from the Newnan Times-\nHerald, in which the Schneider comments appear, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Newnan Times-Herald]\n\n           Heaven Is Greater With the Arrival of Griffin Bell\n\n       Georgia is saying goodbye to one of our state's most \n     distinguished citizens. Griffin B. Bell, lawyer, judge, U.S. \n     attorney general and confidante to presidents, governors and \n     many others, died Monday. A public graveside service will be \n     11 a.m. today in Americus, where he was born. A public \n     memorial\n\n[[Page S191]]\n\n     service will be 11 a.m. Friday at Second Ponce de Leon \n     Baptist Church in Atlanta.\n       When we think of Griffin Bell, some of the words that come \n     to mind are distinguished, integrity, professionalism, charm, \n     statesman, enduring. In reading some of the news accounts \n     reacting to his death, we heard words that help define this \n     Georgia giant.\n       Said his grandson Griffin Bell III: ``He was ready to go. \n     We are just blessed to have him so long. He's a great man, a \n     great grandfather. We're going to miss him--everything was \n     checked off his list. . . . He was still running the show \n     until very recently . . . If he had another six months, he'd \n     still knock off four or five major projects.''\n       Arlington Christian School\n       Said law partner Bob Steed: ``If he took a position, he'd \n     take it strongly and defend it. But if someone improved it, \n     he was willing to give way. His ego didn't get involved with \n     his choices. . . . He was sharp to the very end. He told his \n     son that there must be a committee in heaven in charge of \n     dying, because it was taking so long.''\n       Former Mercer University Chancellor R. Kirby Godsey said, \n     ``Griffin Bell was more than an outstanding statesman or a \n     great American; he stood as a first citizen of the world \n     whose voice and insights will shape human history for decades \n     to come.''\n       ``No novelist--not even Dickens or John Irving--could have \n     created a more memorable character than Judge Bell,'' said \n     law partner Richard N. Schneider. He took the role of being a \n     lawyer and transformed it into legend. . . . It is remarkable \n     that every man and woman who spent even a brief period with \n     Judge Bell would cling to him and claim him as their hero \n     forever. That's how legends are made, and legends last \n     forever--and that will be the case with the great Griffin \n     Bell.''\n       And finally, from former prosecutor and now CNN personality \n     Nancy Grace:\n       ``I have known many, many judges during my legal career. \n     Judge Bell, without a doubt, was the most honorable of them \n     all . . . He will be missed sorely, but, as of this moment, \n     heaven has become even greater.''\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. In two short weeks President-elect Obama will be \ninaugurated as the 44th President of the United States. I am proud of \nthis moment for him and for our Nation. The new President will have my \nprayers and support. I believe it is appropriate to link in some small \nway the President-elect's great and historic victory to the courage and \nintegrity of Judge Bell. In the 1950s and 1960s across the South and \nacross our Nation as a whole, the country worked to implement the \nlandmark case of Brown v. Board of Education. While serving as chief of \nstaff to Georgia Governor Ernest Vandiver, Judge Bell provided counsel \nto the Sibley Commission. This blue-ribbon panel held hearings \nthroughout Georgia for the purpose of educating citizens on the \ninevitability of public school desegregation. In my view, his efforts \non this commission were an important step down the path Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr. and others traveled that enabled Atlanta to become the \ncity and community that it is today, for Georgia to truly become the \nempire State of the South, and for our Nation to elect our new \nPresident.\n  After cochairing President Kennedy's successful Georgia campaign \nduring his 1960 Presidential election, the President nominated Judge \nBell to a position on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. To quote from \nhis excellent biography provided by King & Spalding:\n\n       Judge Bell was unquestionably one of the court's strongest \n     civil rights enforcers. He fervently believed in the rule of \n     law and had little patience for segregationist-minded \n     government officials seeking to evade or defy court orders to \n     deny African Americans their civil rights. In United States v \n     Barnett . . . Judge Bell voted with the majority of the court \n     in ordering the University of Mississippi to admit James \n     Meredith as a student and enjoined the governor from \n     interfering with his admission.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the firm's biography of Judge Bell be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Bell, Griffin (1918--)\n\n       The shadow of Griffin Bell looms large across the landscape \n     of jurisprudence in the United States. Over the course of his \n     distinguished fifty-five-year legal career, Bell has compiled \n     an impressive list of achievements, serving as the managing \n     partner of Atlanta's premier law firm, the chief of staff to \n     the governor of Georgia, the U.S. attorney general, legal \n     adviser to three U.S. presidents, the ``lawyer of last resort \n     for some of the nation's largest corporations,'' and, for \n     over fourteen years, an influential federal appellate judge.\n       Griffin Boyette Bell was born on 31 October 1918 in \n     Americus, Georgia, to Adlai Cleveland Bell, a cotton farmer, \n     and Thelma Leola Pilcher Bell. A. C. Bell laid the foundation \n     for his son's future career in law and politics at an early \n     age, taking the youngster to numerous campaign rallies and \n     trials at the local courthouse. Fortunately, the boy's \n     intellect was more than sufficient to meet his father's \n     ambitions for him. He was extremely intelligent, graduating \n     from Americus High School at the age of fifteen. Bell then \n     attended Georgia Southwestern College and worked as a \n     Firestone salesman before being drafted by the army in 1941. \n     After completing Officer Candidate School, he served as a \n     company commander for more than 500 soldiers during World War \n     II, eventually attaining the rank of major. Bell credits his \n     time in the army as the most valuable management experience \n     he could have received for a career in the law. It was also \n     during this time period that he met his bride-to-be, Mary \n     Powell. The Bells were married for almost sixty years before \n     Mary's passing in the fall of 2000. Their marriage produced \n     one son, Griffin Jr., and two grandchildren, Griffin III and \n     Katherine. Judge Bell is now married to Nancy Kinnebrew Bell.\n       In 1946, after receiving an honorable discharge, Griffin \n     Bell took advantage of the G.I. Bill by enrolling at Mercer \n     University's law school in Macon, Georgia. In addition to his \n     legal studies, Bell clerked for the law firm of Anderson, \n     Anderson and Walker and served as the first city attorney of \n     Warner Robbins, Georgia. In 1947, after just four quarters of \n     study, he passed the Georgia bar on his first attempt. One \n     year later, he graduated from Mercer with honors. Since that \n     time, Bell has received the Order of the Coif from Vanderbilt \n     University's law school and honorary degrees from several \n     other colleges and universities.\n       Griffin Bell began his legal career with Lawton and \n     Cunningham, a historic Savannah law firm that once ``sued the \n     federal government to recover the value of the cotton that \n     Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman had burned on his `march to the \n     sea' '' (Murphy 1999, 29). In 1952, he left Savannah to \n     become a named partner of Matthews, Owens and Maddox, a law \n     firm located in Rome, Georgia. But he only stayed in Rome for \n     a ``spell,'' leaving just one year later to join the \n     prestigious Atlanta law firm of King and Spalding (formerly \n     known as Spalding, Sibley, Troutman and Kelly). Upon arriving \n     at King and Spalding, he immediately ``began to lead the firm \n     toward a more involved role in government affairs'' (Murphy \n     1999, 40). In 1958, after just five years, he became the \n     firm's managing partner and one year later was named chief of \n     staff to S. Ernest Vandiver, the newly elected governor of \n     Georgia. As chief of staff, Bell was the architect of the \n     Sibley Commission, a blue ribbon panel designed to conduct \n     hearings throughout the state ``for the purpose of educating \n     segregationists on the inevitability of public school \n     desegregation'' (Patterson 1977). The commission is \n     universally credited with being the vehicle that saved \n     Georgia's public school system.\n       In 1960, Bell was asked to cochair Sen. John F. Kennedy's \n     presidential campaign in Georgia. He agreed to do so ``before \n     it was by any means certain a Catholic and a `liberal' on \n     civil rights could carry that state'' (Patterson 1977). In \n     one of their first meetings, Kennedy asked Bell whether he \n     would be embarrassed to campaign on behalf of a Catholic. \n     Bell replied, ``Not at all. But I am embarrassed for our \n     country that you would think to ask me that question'' \n     (Murphy 1999, 71). In the end, Kennedy won the election and \n     carried Georgia by a larger margin than in any other state. \n     Afterward, Robert Kennedy, the president's brother and new \n     U.S. attorney general, contacted Bell to inquire as to \n     whether he was interested in a position or appointment with \n     the federal government. Bell told him it was his \n     understanding that two judgeships might open up on the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, at that time \n     the nation's largest federal appellate court, and that he \n     would certainly be interested in being considered for one of \n     them. President Kennedy gladly obliged, nominating the forty-\n     two-year-old Bell for a judgeship on the Fifth Circuit on 6 \n     October 1961. But instead of waiting for the Senate to \n     confirm the nomination, Kennedy decided to make Bell a recess \n     appointment because of ``the circuit's mounting caseload \n     problems'' (Barrow and Walker 1998, 29). The U.S. Senate \n     confirmed Bell's nomination by an overwhelming margin the \n     following spring.\n       Griffin Bell brought a forceful personality to the Fifth \n     Circuit. A cross between Mark Twain and John Marshall, Bell \n     was plain spoken, witty, charming, politically savvy, and \n     extremely intelligent. He joined the court during one of the \n     most turbulent times in our nation's history. The country was \n     in the midst of a social revolution, and the Fifth Circuit--\n     with jurisdiction over the Deep South states of Alabama, \n     Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas--was the \n     primary battleground in the struggle for civil rights. As \n     tensions rose to a boiling point, the Fifth Circuit was \n     called upon to dispense justice and maintain societal order. \n     Never one to sit on the sidelines, Bell wasted little time \n     entering into the fray and quickly became one of the court's \n     most respected and influential jurists. As a judge, he \n     unequivocally enforced the civil rights of black Americans, \n     served as a bridge between the activist judges of the court \n     and states' rights advocates, masterfully accommodated the \n     competing interests of warring civil rights litigants to \n     achieve commonsense solutions in the most complex of cases, \n     and was a leader in the fight to preserve neighborhood \n     schools on a nonracial basis.\n       Judge Bell was unquestionably one of the court's strongest \n     civil rights enforcers. He\n\n[[Page S192]]\n\n     fervently believed in the rule of law and had little patience \n     for segregationist-minded government officials seeking to \n     evade or defy court orders or deny blacks their civil rights. \n     In United States v. Barnett (1963-1965), Bell voted with the \n     majority of the court in ordering the University of \n     Mississippi to admit James Meredith as a student, \n     enjoining the governor of the state from interfering with \n     his admission, and holding the governor in civil contempt \n     for attempting to do so. In Evers v. Jackson Municipal \n     Separate School District (1964), he reversed a district \n     court's dismissal of complaints seeking desegregation of \n     the public school systems of Jackson, Biloxi, and Leake \n     County, Mississippi, eloquently noting that schools are \n     not truly desegregated until ``inhibitions, legal and \n     otherwise, serving to enforce segregation have been \n     removed . . . [and black children] are `afforded a \n     reasonable and conscious opportunity to apply for \n     admission to any schools for which they are eligible \n     without regard to their race or color, and to have that \n     choice fairly considered by the enrolling authorities.' '' \n     In United States v. Lynd (1965), he authored an opinion \n     holding a state court clerk in civil contempt for \n     willfully disregarding a court order allowing blacks to \n     register to vote. In Turner v. Goolsby (1965-1966), Bell \n     crafted an innovative desegregation order placing the \n     school system of Taliaferro County, Georgia, into a \n     receivership after local officials closed down the \n     county's only white school and secretly arranged for those \n     children to attend schools in adjoining counties.\n       One of Judge Bell's most important enforcement decisions \n     was United States v. Hinds County School Board (1969), a case \n     involving the development and implementation of desegregation \n     plans in thirty-three Mississippi school districts. This case \n     came about after the Supreme Court reversed and remanded a \n     Fifth Circuit order giving the state additional time to \n     desegregate, holding ``the continued operation of segregated \n     schools under a standard of allowing `all deliberate speed' \n     for desegregation is no longer constitutionally permissible'' \n     (Alexander v. Holmes County Bd. of Educ. 1969). In an \n     extraordinary move, the Court ordered the Fifth Circuit \n     immediately to fashion and implement desegregation plans for \n     each school district, even though the school year was already \n     well under way. Chief Judge John R. Brown wasted little time \n     in assigning Bell the difficult task of handling the case. \n     Brown's reasons for doing so were obvious to the other \n     members of the court. By that time, Bell had proven himself \n     to be a brilliant tactician and a deft negotiator. As the \n     ``man in the middle,'' he was adroit ``in the use of \n     compromise'' and ``had the ability to bring together opposing \n     sides, to find a common ground, and reconcile differences'' \n     (Barrow and Walker 1998, 28). A judge who frequently hunted \n     with Bell claimed that he was so persuasive ``[he could] talk \n     the birds out of the trees to sit on his shoulder'' (28). His \n     colleagues had no doubt that he could handle this complex and \n     unwieldy case. Bell did not disappoint. He began by summoning \n     all of the school superintendents to New Orleans for a \n     meeting. According to one witness, ``He read the riot act to \n     them--He told them they were desegregating next month whether \n     they liked it or not'' (Strasser 1977). After flashing the \n     ``big stick,'' Bell turned on his trademark charm. He spent \n     several weeks conferring with civil rights lawyers, school \n     board attorneys, and local officials about the details of the \n     respective desegregation plans and the manner in which they \n     would be implemented. This innovative approach ``drew praise \n     from all sides'' and helped safeguard ``the public's \n     perception of judicial even-handedness'' (Bass 1998a, 1505). \n     More important, the Hinds decision marked a turning point for \n     the Fifth Circuit's desegregation jurisprudence. In the past, \n     if a circuit panel found fault with a district court's \n     desegregation order, it would simply reverse and remand the \n     case with instructions to develop a new plan. In the \n     meantime, schools would remain segregated. After Hinds, \n     however, the status quo during desegregation litigation was a \n     desegregated school system.\n       Judge Bell was the Fifth Circuit's leading critic of using \n     busing as a means of disestablishing the ``separate but \n     equal'' school systems of the past. Although Bell strongly \n     believed in both the legal and moral correctness of Brown v. \n     Board of Education (1954), that black children have a \n     fundamental constitutional right to attend school with white \n     children and receive the same quality of education, he did \n     not favor integration--that is, busing children several hours \n     across town to achieve ``a racial ratio [in each school] that \n     reflected the total school population in the geographic \n     entity'' (Murphy 1999, 129). In his opinion, busing had \n     nothing to do with equal protection and everything to do with \n     social engineering. Bell interpreted Brown as giving black \n     students ``freedom of choice to go to schools, primarily in \n     their own neighborhoods'' (129). In this respect, he favored \n     a strict neighborhood-school policy, with a majority-to-\n     minority transfer policy that allowed students to transfer \n     to a school outside of their neighborhood so long as the \n     transfer did not have the effect of increasing the \n     majority of the students' race at that school. If \n     segregated schools still existed after the implementation \n     of this policy, Bell advocated pairing nearby schools \n     together as a means of further ``disestablishing the dual \n     school system'' (101). Although Bell's argument did not, \n     initially, carry the day, his valiant fight to preserve \n     neighborhood schools remains praiseworthy. Many historians \n     lavish praise on the activist members of the Fifth Circuit \n     for requiring busing, but the real-world consequences of \n     their actions have been devastating for public schools. \n     Bell believes that the decline of public education in the \n     United States is inextricably linked to the judiciary's \n     decision to impose ``forced integration and mandatory \n     busing'' on the schools: ``Anybody with one eye and half \n     sense should have known that busing would ruin them. The \n     neighborhood strengths were lost'' (132).\n       In addition to his formal participation on the bench, Bell \n     also distinguished himself as an expert in the area of \n     judicial administration, establishing ``many of the Fifth \n     Circuit's innovative screening and expediting processes'' \n     (U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary 1977, 6). He held \n     several leadership roles in this area, serving as the \n     chairman of the Federal Judicial Center's Committee on \n     Innovation and Development (1968-1970), as a director of the \n     Federal Judicial Center (1973), and as chairman of the \n     American Bar Association's Commission on Standards of \n     Judicial Administration (1976). He also took time from his \n     judicial duties to serve as chairman of the Atlanta \n     Commission on Crime and Juvenile Delinquency (1965-1966).\n       During his fourteen-plus years on the Fifth Circuit, Judge \n     Bell participated in over 3,000 cases and authored more than \n     1,000 opinions. His reputation as jurist was such that four \n     separate presidents (Kennedy, Nixon, Carter, and Reagan) had \n     Bell on their short list of potential Supreme Court nominees. \n     But as the fall of 1975 approached, Bell was restless. The \n     intellectually challenging civil rights cases had come and \n     gone, and he now spent the majority of his time dealing with \n     ``a heavy load of criminal and habeas corpus matters,'' work \n     that he considered boring and dreary (Field Van Tassel 1993, \n     354). Around that same time, lawyers from King and Spalding \n     paid him a visit and asked him whether he would consider \n     leaving the bench and rejoining the firm. The offer was \n     tempting. Bell loved practicing law, and he missed working \n     with clients. After a few months, he informed his fellow \n     judges that he had decided to resign. They were taken aback \n     by his announcement. It was highly unusual for a federal \n     appellate judge to relinquish a lifetime appointment, and \n     Bell was, at that time, only the fourth judge to ever resign \n     from the Fifth Circuit. Although his colleagues were \n     disappointed by the decision, they were nothing but \n     complimentary of his service to the court. Judge Bryan \n     Simpson summed up their collective sentiment nicely, noting \n     that Bell ``was a tower of strength, and I think his strength \n     has been that he's been a balance wheel. He always took the \n     center ground, and he can draw people from either side when \n     we get in these real tough fights'' (Murphy 1999, 140).\n       When Griffin Bell decided to step down from the bench, he \n     thought his career as full-time public servant was over. But \n     eleven short months later, everything changed. A childhood \n     acquaintance, Jimmy Earl Carter, had been elected the thirty-\n     ninth president of the United States and selected Bell to be \n     his U.S. attorney general. Although he had no desire to \n     return to government service, Bell's patriotism was such that \n     he could not refuse a president's request to serve his \n     country. His selection, however, created a firestorm of \n     controversy, and several members from Bell's own party led \n     the charge to derail his nomination. After being subjected to \n     one of the most contentious Senate confirmation fights in \n     modern history, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted ten to \n     three, with one senator voting present, to recommend his \n     confirmation to the full Senate. On 25 January 1977, the U.S. \n     Senate voted seventy-five to twenty-one to confirm him. Later \n     that day, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger swore in Bell as the \n     nation's seventy-second U.S. attorney general.\n       Griffin Bell has been called one of the greatest attorney \n     generals of the twentieth century. Under his leadership, the \n     Department of Justice had an active legislative agenda on \n     issues such as judicial administration, criminal justice \n     reform, and intelligence reform. Bell also helped reshape \n     the federal judiciary by overseeing the selection of 152 \n     new judges and in the process appointed more blacks, \n     women, and Hispanics to the bench than any other \n     administration had up to that point. His primary \n     achievement, however, was ``rebuilding the Justice \n     Department as a neutral zone in government [and] . . . \n     restoring the integrity of the FBI and our foreign \n     intelligence agencies in the wake of Watergate'' (Barry \n     2000). At the time of Bell's resignation, in August 1979, \n     Chief Justice Burger remarked that ``[n]o finer man has \n     ever occupied the great office of attorney general of the \n     United States or discharge[d] his duties with greater \n     distinction'' (Murphy 1999, 302).\n       In the years following his return to King and Spalding, \n     Griffin Bell has established himself as one of the country's \n     premier lawyers and most prolific rainmakers, bringing \n     numerous and profitable clients to the firm. Although he \n     handles a variety of complex legal matters, he is nationally \n     recognized for his expertise in conducting internal \n     investigations of high-profile corporate crime (for example, \n     E. F. Hutton check-kiting scandal; Exxon Valdez oil spill; \n     Dow Corning breast implant controversy). He has also received \n     a great deal of media attention for his pro bono \n     representation of Eugene Hasenfus, an American mercenary shot \n     down in Nicaragua while delivering arms to the Contras; \n     serving as Pres. George H. W. Bush's private attorney during \n     the Iran-Contra investigation;\n\n[[Page S193]]\n\n     and guiding the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games \n     through a congressional investigation into actions taken by \n     committee members during the bidding process.\n       In addition to his private practice, Judge Bell has \n     continued to serve his country in a variety of leadership \n     roles. In 1980, he led the U.S. delegation to the Conference \n     on Security and Cooperation in Europe. He has also served as \n     cochairman of the Attorney General's National Task Force on \n     Violent Crime (1981); a member of the Secretary of State's \n     Advisory Committee on South Africa (1985 to 1987); a \n     director, and then chairman, of the Ethics Resource Center \n     (1986 to 1991); a member of the Board of Trustees of the \n     Foundation for the Commemoration of the United States \n     Constitution (1986-1989); vice chairman of President Bush's \n     Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform (1989); a member of \n     the Webster Commission, which, in March 2002, issued its \n     report on Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) security \n     programs and Russian spy Robert Hanssen; and a member of the \n     ad hoc advisory committee established by Secretary of Defense \n     Donald Rumsfeld for the purpose of developing rules to govern \n     military tribunals (2002). During the Clinton impeachment \n     process, he was one of nineteen legal scholars asked to \n     testify before the House Judiciary Committee on the \n     historical origins of impeachment. In 1984, Bell received the \n     Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation Award for excellence in \n     law, and he was recently named one of the 100 Georgians of \n     the century.\n       Judge Bell's political clout remains considerable. In \n     recent years, this onetime Democrat has taken to endorsing \n     Republican presidential candidates. He lent his support to \n     Vice Pres. George H. W. Bush in 1992, Sen. Robert Dole in \n     1996, and Gov. George W. Bush in 2000. During the \n     presidential election controversy of 2000, Bell visited the \n     recount site and served as one of the Bush team's key \n     advisers. He also filed an amicus brief on behalf of the \n     American Center for Law and Justice in Bush v. Gore (2000). \n     After the election, Bell served as a member of president-\n     elect Bush's transition advisory team for the Department of \n     Justice. Although these actions have no doubt raised eyebrows \n     in the Democratic Party, Bell insists that he is not a \n     Republican: ``I haven't switched parties, I consider myself \n     to be an independent'' (``Griffin Bell, Carter's Attorney \n     General'' 1996).\n       Griffin Bell's life is an American success story. Born into \n     humble circumstances, he reached the heights of his \n     profession through a combination of talent, ambition, and an \n     indefatigable work ethic. More important, when positions of \n     power provided him with an opportunity to make a difference, \n     he consistently rose to the occasion. As a judge, his \n     ``intelligence and even-handedness in administering justice \n     guided the South and the nation through some of its most \n     perilous times'' (Barry 2000). With all of his achievements, \n     this is Bell's greatest legacy: his commitment to the rule of \n     law and the equal rights of all citizens.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. There were many more important decisions in which he \nwas involved, and I was privileged to study and learn from them while \nattending law school at the University of Tennessee.\n  Judge Bell was nominated by President Carter and confirmed by the \nSenate on January 25, 1977, as the Nation's 72nd Attorney General. His \nforce of character and common sense revived a Justice Department that \nsuffered from the Watergate era. According to Terry Adamson, a law \nclerk for the judge when he was on the Fifth Circuit, a principal \nassistant for Judge Bell at the Justice Department and a long-time \nfriend of his, he said in an article that also appeared this week in \nthe Atlanta Journal Constitution:\n\n       Bell recently told NPR reporter Nina Totenberg that his \n     effort to bring about transparency during his service at the \n     department was the core of restoring public confidence.\n\n  Certainly, it was.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Adamson's article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             [Jan. 7, 2009]\n\n           Hardworking Bell Leaves a Legacy To Be Appreciated\n\n                           (By Terry Adamson)\n\n       Judge Griffin Bell and I were breakfasting in the White \n     House mess in 1991 with my wife, who was then on President \n     George H.W. Bush's senior staff. The president heard Bell was \n     there and sent a message to visit in the Oval Office. It was \n     a visit among friends, and Bush and his wife, Barbara, at \n     Bell's invitation, were soon at Sea Island where they had not \n     visited since their honeymoon. Rounds of golf were played, a \n     return engagement for Bell followed at Camp David that \n     included golf with Bush and Arnold Palmer, and Bush soon had \n     Bell as his personal lawyer. For Griffin Bell, who died \n     Monday at age 90, that was normal.\n       During his terminal illness, Bell's doctors told him to \n     establish a goal each day. He accomplished many during the \n     last six months, invigorated by the outpouring of visits and \n     calls of his lifetime of friends, and at peace after a \n     satisfying and long life. His mind stayed clear and vigorous \n     to the end. Former Atlanta Constitution editor Eugene \n     Patterson was one of those who told Bell in a call a few \n     weeks ago how ``the courage'' displayed by Bell and Gov. \n     Ernest Vandiver to bring Georgia within the legal \n     requirements of integration and save public education in \n     Georgia ``set my own bearing.''\n       Bell was a new 43-year-old judge for just a few months on \n     the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals when he drew the case that \n     ended the discriminatory county unit system and changed \n     Georgia elections. He was soon embroiled in Mississippi Gov. \n     Ross Barnett's defiance of court orders to admit James \n     Meredith to the University of Mississippi. The Georgia and \n     Mississippi cases were two among about 3,000 cases in which \n     he participated and more than 500 opinions that he wrote. \n     These cases reflected his frequent and significant role \n     during his nearly 15 years as a judge in which he synthesized \n     the court's center, advancing civil rights. President John F. \n     Kennedy went on television in the midst of the Barnett \n     controversy to cite Bell and other southern judges as \n     courageous heroes.\n       In 1977, Bell and President Jimmy Carter had a mission to \n     refurbish the Justice Department and FBI after the severe \n     tarnish of Watergate. He started and ended by boosting the \n     professionalism of the careerists in the department. When he \n     left, the esprit of the body of the men and women at Justice \n     was at an all-time high.\n       As a critical ingredient of this mission, Bell earned the \n     respect of a cynical post-Watergate press corps. Seemingly \n     small things were part of his plan, such as posting on the \n     press room bulletin board his own daily logs showing his \n     every meeting and telephone call with anyone outside the \n     Justice Department from the day before. He enforced rules \n     such as restricting White House contacts to only the highest \n     levels of the department to minimize even the appearance of \n     political pressures on lesser officials. Bell recently told \n     NPR reporter Nina Totenberg that this transparency was the \n     core of restoring public confidence.\n       While rigorous about his national security responsibilities \n     and proud of the first modern successful prosecutions of \n     spies, Bell also persuaded the intelligence community and the \n     Congress to trust the judiciary to oversee domestic \n     surveillance by authoring and passing the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act. He recruited and persuaded \n     William Webster to resign a lifetime appellate judgeship to \n     become head of the FBI.\n       Bell implemented Carter's campaign pledge to give \n     meaningful roles to minorities and women. African-Americans \n     as solicitor general and the head of the civil rights \n     division were among his first two recruits. At the beginning \n     of the Carter presidency, there were few minorities and no \n     women judges on the federal appeals courts, and few on the \n     trial courts. It was one of the highest priorities of Carter \n     and Bell, and for the first time in history, significant \n     percentages of women and minorities became federal trial and \n     appellate judges.\n       As I watched Bell operate over the years, I was amazed not \n     only with the depth of his mind, but his laudable ability to \n     absorb and process the energy and knowledge of the law \n     clerks, aides, or fellow lawyers around him in order to \n     improve his own. The daily breakfast with other Justice \n     officials in the Martha Mitchell dining room was nothing but \n     fodder for his intellect.\n       Initially labeled by some critics as a ``crony'' of Carter, \n     21 senators voted against Bell's confirmation as attorney \n     general. All of these opponents later publicly voiced their \n     support for him. Bob Dole wrote in the Washington Post that \n     his vote against Bell was one of his two worst votes in \n     Congress. The leader of that initial opposition, Sen. Charles \n     McMathias, a liberal Republican from Maryland, also recanted \n     ``the error of his opposition'' as he hosted Bell at his \n     Maryland farm before they together commemorated John \n     Marshall, the first chief justice, at a nearby rural burial \n     site.\n       Bell was a people's person of the first order, who valued \n     his own common origins. Secretaries around the Justice \n     Department would be surprised when this attorney general \n     would wander into their far-flung offices, alone and \n     unannounced. It took no more than five minutes before Bell \n     had established a common acquaintance. On the day a massive \n     snowstorm engulfed and closed Washington, the Washington Post \n     called the offices of the Cabinet to see who was working. He \n     and I were the only ones there that morning, and I was off \n     making coffee, when the phone rang. He answered in his \n     recognizable and unassuming drawl. That was the lead of the \n     Washington Post story about who was working in Washington.\n       Bell's most mentioned trait was his rich humor and wit. \n     Former Atlanta Constitution editor Reg Murphy wrote an \n     engaging biography laden with samplings of this wit: \n     ``Uncommon Sense: The Achievement of Griffin Bell.'' Bell \n     introduced a widely rumored aphrodisiac, rooster pepper \n     sausage, to Washington, headlined in a front-page story by \n     reporter Phil Gailey, ``Rooster Pepper has White House \n     Links.''\n       Bell gave a still remembered acceptance speech in 1979 as \n     ``a candidate for President of the United States'' at the \n     Alfalfa Club, an annual banquet and mock political event in \n     Washington usually attended by the current president, the \n     Cabinet, military, judicial, political and business leaders. \n     He began in his\n\n[[Page S194]]\n\n     distinctive Georgia drawl, ``I would like to advise that \n     arrangements have been made for simultaneous translation.''\n       He continued (paraphrasing Churchill's great statement), \n     ``Our motto will be to wage obfuscation. We will wage \n     obfuscation on the beaches and on the landing fields and in \n     the political arena of America. And when all else fails and \n     we can no longer obfuscate, we will tell the truth to the \n     extent we know it.''\n       We celebrate with deep affection the life of this rare man.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. When leaving the Fifth Circuit, Judge Bell returned to \nKing and Spalding and distinguished himself as one of the country's \npremier lawyers.\n  In closing, as I have paid tribute to his distinguished career, I \nwish to take a moment to pay tribute to this wonderful gentleman and \nfriend. As a lawyer, I learned so much from him about the practice of \nlaw. As a Congressman and Senator, I learned so much about politics and \npublic service.\n  As a friend, I enjoyed our visits and conversations. His keen sense \nof humor has been compared to Mark Twain. As my good friend, Bob \nSteed--Georgia's very own ``Mark Twain''; a real humorist, columnist, \nand long-time law partner of Judge Bell--said this week of his wisdom \nand wit:\n\n       If he took a position, he'd take it strongly and defend it. \n     But if someone improved it, he was willing to give way. His \n     ego didn't get involved with choices . . . He was sharp to \n     the very end. He told his son that there must be a committee \n     in heaven in charge of dying, because it was taking so long.\n\n  That was Judge Bell.\n  Griffin Bell changed the course of the history of our country. As a \njudge on the Fifth Circuit, his decisions regarding integration of \nschool systems in Georgia and across the South were a model for \nintegration throughout the Nation. In his role as Attorney General, he \ndid much to restore the public's trust in the Department of Justice. He \nwas a close personal friend of mine, and this is not only a national \nloss but a personal one as well.\n  Mr. President, I have before me a commencement speech that he gave at \nMercer University Law School in 2002. I ask unanimous consent that it \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dr. Godsey, Congressman Chambliss, members of the faculty, \n     families of graduates, graduates and friends:\n       I congratulate each one of you graduates on having \n     completed law school. Through much study and great effort, \n     you are about to become lawyers. You are about to become \n     members of a privileged class of Americans because as \n     lawyers, you are agreeing to serve your fellow Americans in \n     resolving those kinds of disputes which arise in a free \n     country.\n       We have many rights and many responsibilities, and lawyers \n     are necessary to resolve the conflicts which arise from time \n     to time with respect to those rights and responsibilities.\n       In 1835, a young Frenchman by the name of Alexis de \n     Tocqueville came to this country to study our prison system. \n     He stayed for two years and ended up writing Democracy in \n     America, an epic study of our democratic system. He reached \n     many conclusions, and two apply to you.\n       First, he said that almost every problem that arises in a \n     democracy will eventually be resolved in the court system. \n     This was true then and it is true now.\n       Second, he said that there was no aristocracy in America, \n     but that the nearest approach to aristocracy was in the \n     lawyer class. His thought was that lawyers occupy an unusual \n     and favored position in our system.\n       So now that you are about to become aristocrats, I want to \n     give you a short lecture on behavior. We have an ample supply \n     of lawyers in our country, and some of the lawyers overlook \n     the obligation to serve others. They also distort the \n     privilege of practicing law by converting it into a mere \n     occupation. I was taught in law school that a lawyer had \n     ethical obligations well above the morals of the marketplace.\n       We are privileged to represent others in resolving their \n     problems, but we have to do so with the public interest in \n     mind. We can advise and counsel and defend clients, but we \n     cannot advise or facilitate activities which violate the law. \n     We live in a very complex world where the channels of \n     commerce depend on tax laws, which are often unfathomable. \n     There is a fine line between tax avoiders and tax evaders. \n     Accounting standards can be evaded with the result that the \n     public loses confidence in our business corporations and in \n     the integrity of the marketplace. Lawyers are the watchmen on \n     the wall in the sense that they should say no to clients who \n     engage in such activities.\n       One of the first duties of a lawyer is to remain detached \n     in any representation to the end that you do not facilitate \n     the breaking of the law. Always err on the side of doing \n     right. You and only you are responsible for your ethics.\n       You should attach yourself to a mentor at the earliest \n     possible time. Those of you who will be trial lawyers--and \n     that will probably be about half of you--will not have the \n     privilege of being trained as barristers, as would be the \n     case in England, where you would have your training at an Inn \n     of Court. Inns of Court do not teach law, but they teach \n     lawyers how to conduct themselves and how to behave \n     themselves. Once they are certified by their mentors, as \n     knowing how to conduct themselves, they become barristers. If \n     you attach yourself to a mentor who has integrity--and I can \n     assure you that the older lawyers are always glad to help \n     young lawyers--you will absorb those qualities of conduct \n     that will make you into respected lawyers.\n       The rules of conduct that you should follow in your \n     practice can be simply stated.\n       1. To a client a lawyer owes undivided allegiance and the \n     utmost application of your learning, skill and industry as \n     well as the employment of all appropriate legal means within \n     the law to protect and enforce the interests of the clients. \n     You should not be deterred by any fear of judicial disfavor \n     or public unpopularity. Nor should you be influenced by self \n     interest.\n       2. To opposing counsel a lawyer owes a duty of courtesy, \n     candor in the pursuit of truth and cooperation in all \n     respects--not inconsistent with the clients' interests. You \n     also must scrupulously observe all mutual understandings. \n     Your word is your bond.\n       3. To the courts you owe respect, diligence, candor and \n     punctuality. You should also work to ensure the independence \n     of the judiciary and protect the courts against unjust and \n     improper criticism. In return, you should expect from the \n     judge and the courts that you be treated with respect and \n     that your dignity and independence as an officer of the court \n     be maintained. I have always thought it a mark of great \n     distinction that a lawyer in court can make a statement, as \n     they say, ``in his or her place'' to the court, without the \n     necessity of being put under oath. This is a mark of our \n     professionalism.\n       4. In the administration of justice, you must abide by the \n     rules and conform to the highest principles of professional \n     rectitude, irrespective of the desires of the clients or \n     others.\n       5. To the public you owe the duty of making certain that \n     the system for administering justice is fair and efficient, \n     and you should do what you can to improve the system.\n       6. To the public you also owe the duty of seeing to it that \n     counsel is made available to those who cannot afford counsel \n     either on a pro bono basis or for such fees as can be \n     afforded.\n       7. Finally, to our country you owe the duty of leadership. \n     You are in the class ``to whom much is given, much is \n     expected.''\n       You should arrange your affairs as lawyers so as to have \n     time to be thorough and diligent. The bane of many lawyers \n     may be having too much practice. You do not serve any client \n     well when you lack the time to be thorough and prompt. You \n     are not required to take every matter that is presented to \n     you, but having assumed a representation, it becomes your \n     duty to finish the representation. Sometimes you will make a \n     bad bargain, but as professionals, you are still obligated to \n     carry out the representation.\n       Someone asked one of my friends when we were in law school \n     why so many of us veterans were going to law school just \n     after World War II. My friend replied that we were hoping to \n     gain a part of the American dream. In most instances, my \n     generation has found the American dream. We have had good, \n     rewarding lives and we have taken great pride in our \n     profession.\n       I am proud to be a lawyer. I am proud of the fact that my \n     son is a lawyer, and I am proud of the fact that my grandson, \n     a member of this class, is about to become a lawyer. Being a \n     lawyer is an honorable profession, and our obligation is to \n     maintain it with honor.\n       I feel certain that all of you will have that attitude \n     toward being lawyers, and I wish you well as you go forth now \n     into the practice. I hope that each one of you will find the \n     American dream.\n       Thank you.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I remember the day very well when Judge Bell gave that \ncommencement speech at Mercer Law School because that day his grandson \nGriffin, III graduated from Mercer Law School, and my son Bo graduated \nfrom Mercer that same day. I was privileged not only to be there to see \nmy son graduate from law school but also to share the dais with Judge \nBell and to introduce Judge Bell to make that commencement address.\n  He was a great American. He was a great Georgian. He was a terrific \nlawyer with unparalleled credentials, unparalleled integrity, and \nsomeone who is going to be missed by our State and by our country.\n  (Ms. KLOBUCHAR assumed the chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/08/senate-section/article/S194-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S194-S195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ISRAEL\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I also wish to discuss the security \nin\n\n[[Page S195]]\n\nthe Middle East and to offer my support for Israel. Israel is an \nimportant foundation of stability and democracy in the Middle East. The \nresolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is important not only to \nthe peace and security of the Middle East but also to the rest of the \nworld.\n  The United States and Israel share common principles and a strong \ncommitment to eradicate terrorism and to secure a better future for the \nworld. Israel has been a steadfast ally of the United States and, I \nassure you, the United States will stand ready to assist our friends, \nthe Israelis, to promote peace, defeat terrorism, and prevent hostile \ncountries that sponsor terrorism from obtaining nuclear weapons.\n  With hopes for peace and a two-state solution, Israel evacuated all \nof its citizens and soldiers from Gaza in 2005, including the uprooting \nof homes, schools, and places of worship. Unfortunately and \nregrettably, following these actions, the Palestinians failed to \ndevelop fully the Gaza Strip and voted into power Hamas, a terrorist \norganization supported by Iran and whose true objective is to eradicate \nthe state of Israel.\n  Following years where terror groups in Gaza launched rockets at \nIsrael, targeting the Israeli civilian population, it became clear that \nit was time for action. After Hamas failed to renew its self-imposed \ncease-fire--one it, frankly, never enforced fully--Israel was forced to \ntake appropriate action to protect her citizens. To that end, Israel \nhas responded appropriately.\n  The United States-Israel alliance remains more critical than ever as \nIsrael defends her people and works to end the threat posed from \nterrorist groups on its borders. The United States and Israel face an \nunprecedented array of shared threats--from Iran developing a nuclear \nprogram with unclear intentions and a clear track record of deceit, to \nthe expanding military capabilities of terrorist groups such as Hamas \nand Hezbollah, which are supported by Iran--and security and stability \nin the Middle East, especially for our ally Israel, has never been more \nprecarious.\n  I do hope this conflict will soon come to a peaceful conclusion. \nNevertheless--and let me be clear--Israel has every right to defend its \ncitizens while taking precautions, to the extent possible, to spare the \ncivilian population in Gaza and reduce collateral damage.\n  I urge the people of Gaza to reject Hamas and surrender the \nterrorists' rockets in the most expedient manner to facilitate ending \nthis necessary action by Israel. Israel remains committed to peace \ntalks with the Palestinian Authority, despite Hamas's constant \nbombardment of Israel and its ineffective control over the Gaza Strip.\n  In order to improve the prospects for successful and lasting peace \nbetween the Israelis and the Palestinians, it is necessary for all \nPalestinians to work toward a solution. This cannot be done while Hamas \nis allowed to rain terror into southern Israel. I encourage the \nPalestinian Authority in the West Bank to form a legitimate and \nauthoritative body which can speak for all of Palestine, effectuate \nchange, and exercise control over terrorists who reside in their \nterritory. I commend President Abbas for taking part in the \ninternational discussions about the situation in Gaza.\n  I support the necessary requirements of any cease-fire which \nSecretary Rice discussed before the United Nations. Hamas must end the \nrocket, mortar, and other attacks on Israel, and Israel can then cease \nits military offensive and reopen Gaza's border crossings so that \nPalestinians can benefit from humanitarian goods and basic supplies. \nMost importantly, the smuggling of weapons into Gaza through hundreds \nof illegal tunnels must end. The Arab states in the region, especially \nEgypt, should be a part of this process, and I encourage the \nPalestinians to seek their guidance and support, and in return for them \nto offer guidance and political and financial support.\n  Madam President, with that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Finally, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/08/senate-section/article/S195-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S195-S196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, today Senator Daschle has come \nbefore the HELP Committee for his confirmation hearing as our Secretary \ndesignate of Health and Human Services. I know that all of our \ncolleagues and friends in the Senate found it moving and wonderful to \nsee the distinguished chairman of that committee, Senator Kennedy, back \nin his chair leading that hearing. We are all delighted to see him back \nat work in the Senate, and we are delighted to see Senator Daschle back \nwith us in this exciting new capacity.\n  We know every American deserves health care that he or she can \nafford. Senator Daschle knows that to do that we need basic systemic \nreform that will improve the way health care is delivered in this \ncountry. Senator Daschle has already brought forward ideas, such as the \ncreation of a Federal health board, that have contributed enormously to \nthe health care reform debate, and I hope very much he will pursue \nthose ideas further at HHS. His nomination and President-elect Obama's \ncreation of a new White House Office of Health Care Reform emphasize \ntheir serious commitment to solving this bedeviling problem. Senator \nDaschle will bring distinguished, thoughtful leadership to the crisis \nin our Nation's health care system.\n  Health care reform is the signal challenge facing our families, our \neconomy, and our Government. I wish to take a few minutes today to \nspeak about this great challenge and the urgent need for action.\n  We all know the system is broken. The evidence lies all around us--in \nmy State of Rhode Island and across the country. When a lost job is \nfrightening not just because it means lost income but because it means \nlost health care, our health care system is broken. When sudden illness \nstrikes and insurance will not cover the costs, our health care system \nis broken. When families wait to see a doctor until it is too late \nbecause they have no health insurance to pay for the visit, our health \ncare system is broken.\n  We see the evidence of the broken system and the staggering costs of \nhealth care in this country. The United States spends 16 percent of our \nGDP on health care. That is about twice what our major industrialized \ncompetitor nations spend. The annual cost of the system exceeds $2 \ntrillion, and it is expected soon to double. Family health emergencies \nhave been the most common cause of personal bankruptcy, and businesses, \nlarge and small, struggle under the weight of ever-increasing health \ninsurance costs. There is more health care than steel in Ford's cars \nand more health care than coffee beans in Starbucks coffee.\n  Yet for all that money, what do we get? We still leave 46 million \nAmericans uninsured; 46 million wrenching stories of health care \nforegone, of personal misfortune, even lives lost. That doesn't even \ninclude the experiences of our Nation's underinsured or small business \nowners struggling to provide health insurance or the many Americans who \nreceive poor quality health care.\n  President-elect Obama is committed to reforming this broken system, \nand he has taken swift action to engage the American people in a \nnational conversation about what is wrong and what we can do to fix it. \nLast month, he and Secretary-designate Daschle asked people to hold \nmeetings in their communities to discuss health care reform and to \nshare their ideas.\n  In the end, there is no better way to understand the deep failures of \nour health care system and the very real pain, frustration, anxiety, \nand anger it causes than to talk to the people who have experienced it \nfirsthand. Over the past few years--at community dinners that I have \naround our State, in my office, as I travel around--many Rhode \nIslanders have reached out to me to share their stories and to urge \nthat we work urgently to repair this broken system. I wish to take a \nmoment to share a few of those stories.\n\n[[Page S196]]\n\n  A mother in Narragansett, RI, shared a story about her 20-year-old \nson who suffers from severe bipolar disorder and relies on therapy and \nexpensive medications to remain a valued and productive member of his \ncommunity. He is too old to be covered under her family health \ninsurance plan, and his preexisting condition makes buying insurance on \nthe individual market impossible--prohibitively expensive. So what did \nthey do? This mother and her family came up with a surprising solution. \nThey enrolled her son at the Community College of Rhode Island so he \ncould participate in the student health insurance plan. He takes the \nabsolute minimum course load in order to continue to work, but he \nremains a student because it is less expensive to pay for college \ntuition than it is to pay for individual health insurance. Any parent \nwith a child in college knows what a burden this Rhode Island family is \nbearing to ensure that their son gets the basic treatment he needs to \nstay healthy.\n  I also heard from the proud owner of a small bookkeeping and tax \npreparation business in Warwick, RI. She has worked tirelessly to raise \nfive sons, go back to college, and finally she has become her own boss. \nYet despite all her effort and all her success, she wrote me to plead \nfor reform. She wrote this:\n\n       I spend over 50 percent of my income just to have health \n     insurance for my husband and myself. The premiums are over \n     $1,000 per month, even with very high deductibles. My \n     employees need health insurance also, but I am unable to \n     provide them with any benefits because of the poor economic \n     conditions.\n\n  Her employees are like family to her, as with so many small \nbusinesses, and it breaks her heart that they are uninsured. Yet she \nsays she simply will not be able to keep her doors open if she tried to \ncontribute toward their benefits.\n  In the midst of this economic downturn, and particularly in Rhode \nIsland where the unemployment rate is one of the highest in the Nation, \nthis story shows all too clearly how closely linked are the tasks of \nreforming our health care system and strengthening our economy.\n  Our health care system manages to fail even those who believe \nthemselves to be covered. A woman who lives in Woonsocket and who has \nhealth insurance and was always careful to pay her bills on time, \nassumed she would be covered in the event of an emergency. Why not? She \nwas current. She paid her premiums. She had insurance. But not too long \nago, she suddenly had to have her appendix removed. Despite having \nhealth insurance, she left that hospital with a $10,000 bill. She is \ncurrently working for a temp service and she has no idea how she can \npay off this debt. She had recently bought her own home, a longtime \ndream and an accomplishment in which she took great pride. Now, because \nof the fine print of that health insurance policy, she risks losing the \nhome she worked so long to afford. As this Rhode Islander learned in \nthe hardest way possible, health insurance often ends up ensuring very \nlittle.\n  It is on behalf of these Rhode Islanders and so many others that I \nurge my colleagues to come together to support health care reform that \nwill lower costs and improve the quality of care for all Americans. We \nmust improve the way we deliver health care by promoting quality, \nimplementing health information technology, and investing in preventing \ndisease. We must, and will, protect existing coverage when it is good, \nwe must improve it when it is not, and we must guarantee health care \nfor the 46 million Americans, 9 million of whom are children who have \nno health insurance at all.\n  We see ourselves now in darkening and tumultuous economic times. Yet \nlooking beyond the immediate economic perils we face, there is a $35 \ntrillion unfunded liability for Medicare that is bearing down on us. It \nis bearing down on us because our population is aging, because people \nget sicker as they age, and that makes them more expensive. Unless we \nfigure out a way in this Chamber to stop time, unless we figure out a \nway in this Chamber to reverse the aging process, unless we figure out \na way in this Chamber to make elders have healthier lives and bodies \nthan younger people, this is inevitable. It is coming at us, and we \nhave to prepare. In order to prepare, we have to reform the health care \ndelivery system. We are committed, as Democrats, to making sure every \nAmerican has health insurance coverage, but it is not enough just to \nbring everyone into the boat. If you had a boat in the ocean and people \nswimming around it and to save them you needed to bring them into the \nboat, you would do that. But if the boat itself was sinking, if the \nboat itself was on fire, just bringing everybody into the boat is not \nan adequate discharge of your duties. It is also important that you \nrepair the boat, that you get it steaming forward, that you make sure \nit is safe for the people whom you bring into it.\n\n  That means reforming our health information technology infrastructure \nso every American can count on an electronic health record, so when you \ngo to see your doctor, you don't have to fill out that clipboard one \ntime after another, when at the same time you can sign on to Amazon and \nnot only do they know who you are, they know what you have bought and \nthey have suggestions for you based on your buying habits. There is no \nexcuse for our health care system being back in the 1950s as the rest \nof the economy moves forward into the 21st century. It requires \nimproving the quality of health care and it requires investing in \nprevention.\n  We dramatically underinvest in prevention and quality. There are \nmarket failures that cause those things to happen. They are repairable. \nIn addition to the cost savings, it is estimated that 100,000 Americans \ndie every year--100,000 Americans die every year--because of avoidable \nmedical errors. It is simply not tolerable to allow that to continue, \nparticularly when it is a win-win situation, where improved quality of \ncare means lower costs.\n  Finally, the third leg of the reform, in addition to helping \ninfrastructure technology and quality and prevention reform, is that we \nhave to reform how we pay for health care to align the price signal \nthat we send by those payments with what we want from health care. \nUntil we do that, we will be constantly struggling uphill against our \nown financial message.\n  This is all doable. This is all so doable, but it will take time. \nThese are complex matters. We will have to make adjustments. The \nadjustments will take time. It is a dynamic environment which will have \nto make course corrections along the way. That means we need to start \nnow. We do not have the luxury of time on our side. If we do not get \nstarted on a thorough-going health care delivery system reform now, \nthen the alternative will be times that are even darker and more \ntumultuous than we find ourselves in right now.\n  I see the very distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee on the \nfloor, a man who is an eloquent voice on the dark and tumultuous times \nand the risks we face from the current fiscal situation, so I will \ngladly yield at this point, and I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/08/senate-section/article/S196-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S196-S197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               CBO REPORT\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, first of all, I wish to thank Senator \nWhitehouse for his contributions to this Chamber. He has been an \noutstanding Member. He serves on the Budget Committee with me. He has \ndeveloped a special expertise on health care which is so badly needed.\n  I wish to comment very briefly on the CBO report we received today in \nthe Budget Committee hearing on the fiscal outlook. It is truly jaw-\ndropping. There is a $1.2 trillion deficit for this year, before any \neconomic recovery package is passed. Add to the debt even higher: $1.6 \ntrillion will be added to the debt of the country, and, again, that is \nbefore any cost of an economic recovery plan.\n  If one factors in an economic recovery plan, we could be looking at \nan increase in the debt of $2 trillion this year alone. To put that in \ncontext, we have a gross debt of the United States of $10.6 trillion \nroughly today.\n  So I think it is imperative that while we put together an economic \nrecovery plan, which we must, we also are cognizant of the very serious \nlong-term fiscal condition we face as a nation.\n  There is a front-page story in the New York Times today indicating \nthat the Chinese, the biggest financers of our debt, have a reduced \nappetite for\n\n[[Page S197]]\n\nAmerican dollar-denominated debt because they have their own economic \nissues, their own need for the use of capital at home. This could have \nenormous consequences for us going forward in terms of interest rates \nand what it will take to attract foreign capital to float this economic \nboat.\n  One final point. Last year, of the new debt financing for this \ncountry, 68 percent of it came from abroad. Madam President, 68 percent \nof our new debt financing came from abroad. The fact that the Chinese, \nwho have been the most significant contributors to financing that debt, \nare expressing a reluctance to take on more of our debt, do more of our \ndebt financing, should send a warning signal to all of us as we fashion \nlong-term fiscal and economic policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I wish to ask, through the Chair, a \nquestion of the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee with \nrespect to the $10 trillion debt the country is now carrying.\n  At the time the current administration that is leaving office came \ninto office 8 years ago, my understanding is the situation in America \nwas rather different. It is my understanding that at that time we were \nactually looking at surpluses in our country, and the $10 trillion \ndeficit is largely the responsibility of the policies that have been \nfollowed over the past 8 years.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is exactly right. The debt of the country at \nthe beginning of the last administration was about $5 trillion. They \nhave approximately doubled the debt of the country on their watch, \ndramatically more than doubled foreign holdings of U.S. debt. So the \ncurrent administration, the outgoing administration, has left the \nincoming administration in a very deep hole, not to mention the \neconomic difficulties and the extreme need for an economic recovery \nplan to give lift to this economy.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. So through the good times, we could have been laying \nmoney aside so that when this situation came, we would be in a strong \neconomic condition. Instead, by squandering all those years, we have \nput the incoming administration in a very challenging position.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, not only the incoming administration, the whole \ncountry because our ability to cope with an economic downturn, the \nflexibility is substantially limited by what has already been done to \ndramatically increase the debt, as the Senator described, in good \neconomic times. Unfortunately, that is the reality we now confront.\n  Today's news by the Congressional Budget Office of not only the $1.2 \ntrillion deficit this year but massive deficits as far as the eye can \nsee should sober us all.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the very distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee for being willing to engage in this colloquy with me.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island and look forward to \nworking with him on the Budget Committee as we attempt to come up with \na plan to deal with these multiple challenges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/08/senate-section/article/S197-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, first of all, I appreciate your coming \nfrom your meeting to preside. As we begin the new Congress and a new \nadministration, we begin a new chapter on energy and environmental \npolicy, and it is a time that environmental activists, the United \nNations, and many of my Democratic colleagues have been salivating for \nfor years. The stars are all aligned. Democrats control both sides of \nPennsylvania Avenue, and the Supreme Court has spoken now that carbon \ndioxide is a pollutant under the Clear Air Act, even though it was a 5-\nto-4 decision. It is kind of interesting how something can be a \npollutant with a 5-to-4 decision.\n  It is believed the stage has been set for a home run on mandatory \nKyoto-like climate controls and the dawn of a new bustling green energy \neconomy. However, before many of my colleagues rush to leap before they \nlook, I wish to remind them of some very unfortunate developments that \nmay complicate their early action on items on their wish lists. I ask \nmy colleagues to at least consider some of the facts I will be \nrevealing over the next series of speeches and to keep an open mind \nbefore rushing to sweeping action after waiting for so many years.\n  The scale and pace of the climate proposals and the regulatory \nactions we have debated in the past, including the recently failed \nLieberman-Warner bill and the ones we will likely be debating this \nCongress, leave little room for error in this fragile, recession-ridden \neconomy, and the inflated promises of a sweeping green jobs revolution \nneed an honest and frank reality. The proponents of mandatory global \nwarming controls need to be honest with the American people. The \npurpose of these programs is to ration fossil-based energy by making it \nmore expensive and therefore less appealing for public consumption. It \nis a regressive tax that imposes a greater burden relative to resources \non the poor than it does on the rich. Let me say that again. The \npurpose of these programs is to ration the fossil fuel-based energy by \nmaking it more expensive to all Americans and therefore less appealing \nfor public consumption. But it is a regressive tax, and we have talked \nabout this before. It is one that punishes those whose resources have \nto be used for such purposes as being able to operate their vehicles \nand heat their homes.\n  Advocates may argue that the redistribution of wealth toward the \nincome consumers will offset the balance of revenue or taxes being \ntaken in, but we learned firsthand during the Lieberman-Warner debate \nthat this simply is not true. I don't like the argument that we have \nequal distribution of wealth efforts that are going to take a \nregressive nature out of the punitive values of this type of program. \nTo me, there is something un-American about that. But while the bill's \nsponsors try to convince us there is actually tax relief in the bill, \nwe learn that families--now I am talking about the Lieberman-Warner \nbill, and this was only about 8 months ago, the Lieberman-Warner bill--\nwe learn that families with workers will still have to pay $6.7 \ntrillion into the system in the form of higher energy costs to get back \nan estimated $802 billion in tax relief. That is a return of $1 out of \nevery $8.40 paid. It is time that proponents of climate policies be \nhonest. It is expensive, and it is going to cost taxpayers a lot of \nmoney.\n  You know, it doesn't really matter which form we use. We have gone \nthrough, first of all, the Kyoto Treaty. We came this close to passing \nthe Kyoto Treaty, and it wasn't until the Wharton School of Economics \ncame along with the econometrics survey and they determined it would \ncost some $300 billion a year to join onto and actually try to achieve \nthe emission requirements of Kyoto. Then along came the McCain-\nLieberman bill and then after that the Warner- Lieberman bill. And cap \nand trade is going to be about the same amount. They may massage it a \nlittle bit, but we are still talking in the neighborhood of $300 \nbillion a year. That equates to over $2,000 for each taxpaying family \nin America. So it is huge.\n  In the coming weeks, I will go into more detail about other false \npromises proponents of mandatory global warming policies are \nadvocating. Among them are a reality check on green projects--the \nnumber of new green jobs from a climate regime are overstated compared \nto the number of manufacturing jobs lost, and we know from the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers how many jobs would have been lost with \nany of these schemes in the past; a review of the weaknesses of offset \npolicies--companies have bought offsets which are not real; and a \nreview of the attempts to estimate the cost of inaction. Many advocates \nare claiming it\n\n[[Page S198]]\n\nis more expensive to do nothing than the cost of a cap and trade, but \nthey are untested and nontransparent economic modeling.\n  All these issues will play a vital role in the debate on both energy \nand global warming policy, which have become unavoidably intertwined. \nYou can't really talk about one without the other. You can't talk about \nwhat you are going to do on greenhouse gases or CO2 or cap \nand trade without affecting our overall energy policy.\n  When there are sensible proposals debated in Congress that can \nachieve double benefits of reducing emissions and making America's \nenergy supply more stable, diverse, and affordable, then we will look \nforward to working on a bipartisan basis to achieving these goals. \nIncreasing our domestic energy production and lowering our dependence \non foreign oil are two issues that are critically important to myself \nand my State of Oklahoma, and of course this will include renewables \nand new green jobs.\n  However, we need to be smart and realistic about these policies. \nUnfortunately, I fear that the scale and pace many of my colleagues \nwill be advocating with mandatory climate policies are unrealistic, \nextraordinarily narrowly expensive, and ill-advised. What is the driver \nfor these unrealistic proposals that seem to make unnecessarily abrupt \nand painful increases in our energy costs in the near term? It is all \nrooted in global warming science.\n  I have given over 12 speeches, averaging over an hour apiece, on the \nscience of global warming over the past few years. Today, I wish to \nupdate my colleagues on some of the latest science that has not yet \nbeen reported in the mainstream media. I will simply be a disseminator \nof this information and not a commentator. I have to say that because I \nam not a scientist, nor is anyone else that I know of in this body a \nscientist. So the statements I will make will be quoting people who are \nqualified and are scientists, and this is what my role will be.\n  Before I do that, I ask all my colleagues to think about the issue. \nScience should not be reviewed through any one frame. It is not \npartisan, it is not regional; however, the political process has \nlargely engulfed science behind climate change. As I have documented in \nspeeches before, the politicizing of the global warming science has \nbecome one of the most unfortunate developments in the last 8 years. \nAnytime one questions a hypothesis or a conclusion that does not fall \nin line with ``the sky is falling'' doom and gloom scenario of global \nwarming alarmists, it is ridiculed, written off, denigrated, and not \nreported by the mainstream media. Yet anytime a more severe \ninterpretation or alarming statistic is related, it is headline \ngrabbing in the news. Objective, transparent, and verifiable science \ngets lost in the public dialog.\n  Funding has a way of influencing this debate. The other day there was \nan article in the Bloomberg News--and I say this for those individuals \nwho might be feeling sorry for Al Gore--it was reported that his net \nworth in 2000 was between $1 million and $2 million and it is now in \nexcess of $100 million today, so he will be all right.\n  When the stakes of the policy outcomes with cap and trade and other \nmandatory climate proposals are this high for the American people, I \nhope the Senate this year will embrace my calls for objectivity and \ntransparency in science and modeling. As policymakers, it is our duty \nto make sure models developed by agencies and used in policy are useful \nfor their intended purpose, articulate major assumptions \nand uncertainties, and separate scientific conclusions from policy \njudgments.\n\n  However, with global warming science this has not been the case. With \nmany left-of-center scientists, the environmental activists now realize \nthe so-called consensus on manmade global warming is not holding up.\n  The leftwing blog Huffington Post--this is a left-leaning \norganization--surprised a lot of people by featuring an article on \nJanuary 3, 2008, by Harold Ambler demanding an apology from Gore for \npromoting unfounded global warming fears. The Huffington Post--again, \nleft leaning--article accused Gore of telling the biggest whopper ever \nsold to the American public in the history of mankind because he \nclaimed the science was settled on global warming. The Huffington Post \narticle, entitled ``Mr. Gore: Apology Accepted,'' adds, ``It is Mr. \nGore and his brethren who are flat-Earthers, not the skeptics.'' Again, \nit is not myself, not Jim Inhofe saying this about Gore; it is the \nleftwing blog, the Huffington Post, saying these things.\n  The Huffington Post article continues:\n\n       Let us neither cripple our own economy by mislabeling \n     carbon dioxide a pollutant nor discourage development in the \n     Third World, where suffering continues unabated day after \n     day.\n\n  Another left-of-center atmospheric scientist who has descended on the \nmanmade climate fears is the U.K.'s Richard Courtney, a U.N.--and let's \nkeep in mind where all this started. A lot of people forget this was \nstarted by the United Nations--the United Nations Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change. They came out and said: Oh, it is manmade \ngases, anthropogenic gases, CO2, methane that are causing \nclimate change. And this person used to be on that panel. He was an \nexpert reviewer in the U.K.-based climate and atmospheric science, a \nconsultant, and a self-described Socialist who also happens to reject \nmanmade climate fears.\n  Joining Courtney are many of the other progressive environmental \nscientists. Former Green Peace member and Finnish scientist Dr. Jarl \nAhlbeck, a lecturer of environmental technology and a chemical engineer \nat the University of Finland who has authored 200 scientific \npublications, is also skeptical of manmade climate doom. Ahlbeck wrote \nin 2008:\n\n       Contrary to common belief, there has been no or little \n     global warming since 1995, and this is shown by two \n     completely independent data sets. But so far, real \n     measurements give no ground for concern about catastrophic \n     future warming.\n\n  This is kind of interesting because what he is saying--and this is a \nguy who started out with the United Nations in the beginning, with the \nIPCC--is that right now we are actually in a cooling period. I think no \none debates that now. We have had the most severe weather, and I will \nhave another talk I will try to get in next week about what is \nhappening around the country right now. It isn't global warming, it is \nglobal cooling. People forget God is still up there and we go through \nthese cycles. I can remember the middle 1970s when they were saying \nthere is another ice age coming and we are all going to die. Those same \npeople--and there was an article in Time magazine at that time--are the \nones now saying we are going to die, but it is for a different reason, \nit is global warming.\n  Lifelong liberal Democrat Dr. Martin Hertzberg, a retired Navy \nmeteorologist with a Ph.D. in physical chemistry, also declared his \ndissent of warming fears in 2008. He said:\n\n       As a scientist and life-long liberal Democrat, I find the \n     constant regurgitation of the anecdotal, fear mongering \n     claptrap about human-caused global warming to be a disservice \n     to science.\n\n  Finally, CNN--not a bastion of conservatism--had yet another of its \nmeteorologists dissent from warming fears. Meteorologist Chad Myers, a \nmeteorologist for 22 years, certified by the American Meteorological \nSociety, spoke out against anthropogenic climate claims on CNN in \nDecember.\n\n       You know, to think that we could affect weather all that \n     much is pretty arrogant. Mother Nature is so big, the world \n     is so big, the oceans are so big--I think we are going to die \n     from the lack of fresh water or we are going to die from some \n     type of ocean acidification before we die from global \n     warming, for sure.\n\n  Myers joins fellow CNN meteorologist--by the way, CNN has been very \nbiased all this time. I think we know that, as has the Weather Channel, \nbecause there is a lot of money in perpetuating this myth. Myers was \njoined by his fellow CNN meteorologist, Rob Marciano, who compared \nGore's film to fiction in 2007, and CNN anchor Lou Dobbs just said of a \nglobal warming fear promotion on January 5 of this year, ``It's almost \na religion without any question.''\n  Recently, I released a new report on climate scientists which \ndocuments many of the studies ignored by the mainstream media.\n  Here it is right here. This is one that is actually too large to put \ninto the Congressional Record. In here, in the report, are 650 \nscientists who have challenged manmade global warming\n\n[[Page S199]]\n\nclaims made by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange. We talked about that. I have been detailing these science \nissues for a number of years.\n  In a July 28, 2003, floor speech in this Chamber I said: The issue of \nglobal warming ``is far from settled, and indeed is seriously \ndisputed.'' The science continues to evolve.\n  I explained that ``anyone who pays even cursory attention to the \nissue understands that scientists vigorously disagree over whether \nhuman activities are responsible for global warming, or whether those \nactivities will precipitate natural disasters.''\n  I noted--and this is what I said in 2003:\n\n       Not only is there a debate, but (at least in certain \n     corridors) the debate is shifting away from those who \n     subscribe to global warming alarmism.\n\n  That was in 2005. After that speech, I led the charge against the \nMcCain-Lieberman global warming cap-and-trade bill--that would be in \n2003, then again in 2005--both times easily defeating the bills. At the \ntime it was a lonely battle. Only a few people came down to help me on \nthe floor. I remember so well in 2005 when I was alone down here on the \nfloor of the Senate for 5 consecutive days that we had it on the floor, \nabout 10 hours a day. Very few people came down and were willing to \njoin me on the Senate floor.\n  That has changed. If you fastforward from 2005 to 2008, we had the \nWarner-Lieberman bill on the floor. At that time I had over 25 Senators \ncome down and join me. You are seeing people who no longer fear the \nmoney generated by the moveon.orgs, the Hollywood elitists, those \nindividuals who have millions of dollars to put into campaigns, to \nthrow into the system. We are getting a lot of encouragement. Things \nhave changed. In fact, at the end of the bill that we had that is \nreferred to sometimes as either the Lieberman-Warner bill or the Boxer \nclimate tax bill, they are only able to get about 37 people from their \nown party, from this side of the aisle over here, who would support it. \nThat is a major change from the past.\n  After this election that number has only gone up from 37 to 39. You \nare not getting close to the 60 votes necessary to try to inflict this \neconomic damage on the United States.\n  The Republicans were prepared to debate the bill--this is the Warner-\nLieberman bill--and were ready to offer amendments, but the Democrats \ndidn't want to debate, much less vote, on our amendments that were \naimed at protecting American families and workers from the devastating \neconomic impacts of the bill. When faced with the inconvenient truth of \nthe bill's impact on skyrocketing gas prices, it was Democratic \nSenators who wanted to see the bill die a quick death.\n  By the way, we had a list of some 10 Democratic Senators who, in a \nvery responsible way, said we will go ahead and vote on some of these \namendments, but when it comes to final passage, we are not going to \nvote on it.\n  After the bill failed, the Wall Street Journal aptly noted that \nenvironmentalists are stunned that their global warming agenda is in \ncollapse. The paper added:\n\n       The green groups now look as politically intimidating as \n     the skinny kid on the beach who has sand kicked in his face.\n\n  The paper quoted a political analyst who noted that ``this issue is \nstarting to feel like the Hillary health care plan again.''\n  Despite the claims that we must act now to prevent climate crisis, \nthe climate tax bill would not have resulted in any action whatsoever. \nThe bill, often touted as an insurance policy against global warming, \nwould instead have been all economic pain and no climate gain. This is \nbecause without a global treaty, the binding commitments by both the \ndeveloping and developed countries is not going to work.\n  Let's say we believed that manmade, anthropogenic gases were the \nmajor cause of climate change and the debate was over if we do \nsomething just unilaterally in the United States of America. All that \nwould do is cause a flight of our manufacturing jobs overseas to \ncountries such as India and China and Mexico--places where they do not \nhave any kind of a restriction on the greenhouse gases. So it would \nhave a net increase, if we were to pass one of these. Yet we are the \nones who would be saddled with a $300 billion-a-year tax bill.\n  Americans are suspicious of the need for solutions to global warming. \nThe Gallup Poll released on Earth Day 2008 revealed the American \npublic's concern about manmade global warming has remained unchanged \nsince 1989. According to Gallup, and this is a quote from the report, \nthey said:\n\n       Despite the enormous attention paid to global warming over \n     the past several years, the average American is in some ways \n     no more worried about it than they were in years past.\n\n  In other words, after all the money, all the hype, all the biased \nmedia over the past few years, people have not moved in that direction. \nThey know better. They know when they have been duped.\n  What perhaps is the most striking is that, aside from the economics \nof global warming solutions, the science has continued to move in the \ndirection I predicted in 2003. In 2007 I released a Senate minority \nreport detailing over 400 scientists disputing manmade global warming \nclaims. In the inconvenient real world climate study, developments are \nrefuting global warming fears. That was 2007, just a year ago.\n  In 2008, in the tail end of 2008, for the benefit of public \ndissemination we have updated our report, and the so-called consensus \non global warming is even more in dispute. That is the report I have \nright here. Over 650 dissenting scientists from around the globe \nchallenge manmade global warming claims made by the United Nations \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and by former Vice President \nAl Gore. Our new 233-page U.S. Senate minority report features the \nskeptical voices of over 650 prominent international scientists, \nincluding many current and former U.N. IPCC scientists who have now \nturned against the U.N. IPCC.\n  This updated report includes an additional 250--and growing, I might \nadd; it has grown since then--scientists and climate researchers since \nthe initial release in December of 2007. The over 650 dissenting \nscientists are more than 12 times the number of the U.N. scientists--\nonly 52 of them--who authored the media-hyped IPCC 2007 Summary for \nPolicymakers.\n  This is very significant. I know it is kind of heavy lifting to \nunderstand this, but the U.N. IPCC, that started this whole thing, they \nhave this analysis that is made and updated, but you never get the full \nreport by any of the scientists. It is merely the summary for \npolicymakers. That is us. That is for the politicians out there. So \nthey only have 52 scientists who signed this report. We are talking \nabout 650 scientists versus 52.\n\n  The chorus of skeptical scientific voices grew louder in 2008 as a \nsteady stream of peer-reviewed studies, analyses, real-world data, and \ninconvenient developments challenged the U.N.'s and former Vice \nPresident Al Gore's claims that the ``science is settled,'' and there \nis a ``consensus.'' Despite what is now being portrayed in the media on \na range of issues, 2008 proved to be devastating for the promoters of \nmanmade climate fears.\n  In addition, the following developments further secured 2008 as the \nyear the ``consensus collapsed.'' Russian scientists ``rejected the \nvery idea that carbon dioxide may be responsible for global warming.\n  Frankly, they laugh. I have had meetings with them. They laugh at it. \nIn Milan, when they had one of the big United Nations meetings where \nthey tried to coerce countries into supporting this, the Russians at \nthat time were in a position, since they have these vast areas that are \ntotally undeveloped--I remember flying across Siberia a few years ago. \nI am a pilot and flew an airplane across the world, and I remember \nflying across Siberia and looking down and seeing time zone after time \nzone where you don't see any people, nothing but natural resources. Yet \nall of those would go in the formula, so they would be great big \nrecipients if they are able to get some kind of international treaty.\n  In addition to that, the American Physical Society editor conceded \nthat ``a considerable presence'' of scientific skeptics exists. An \ninternational team of scientists countered the U.N. IPCC, declaring, \n``Nature, not human activity, rules the climate.''\n  India issued a report challenging global warming fears. A team of \ninternational scientists demanded the U.N.\n\n[[Page S200]]\n\nIPCC ``be called to account and cease its deceptive practices,'' and a \ncanvass of more than 51,000 Canadian scientists revealed that 68 \npercent disagree that global warming science is ``settled.''\n  We are not talking about politicians, people, Senators like me and \nothers in this room. We are talking about real scientists who are out \nthere. We are talking about 68 percent of the scientists in Canada now \nhave come to recognize this. That was not true 5 years ago. Most were \non the other side of this issue, but they have now looked at it and \nrealize they have been duped. This new report is the latest evidence of \nthe growing groundswell of scientific opposition challenging \nsignificant aspects of the claims of the United Nations IPCC and Al \nGore. Scientific meetings are now being dominated by a growing number \nof skeptical scientists. The prestigious International Geological \nCongress, dubbed the geologist's equivalent of the Olympic Games, and \nheld in very high esteem, was held in Norway in August 2008, just a few \nmonths ago, and prominently featured the voices of scientists skeptical \nof manmade global warming fears. The conference was reportedly \noverwhelmed with skeptical scientists, with ``two-thirds of the \npresenters and question-askers who were hostile to, even dismissive of, \nthe United Nations IPCC.''\n  Even the mainstream media in 2008 began to take notice of the \nexpanding number of scientists serving as ``consensus busters.'' A \nNovember 25, 2008, article in Politico--everyone in Washington reads \nthat--noted that a ``growing accumulation'' of science is challenging \nwarming fears, and added that the ``science behind global warming may \nstill be too shaky to warrant cap-and-trade legislation.'' Canada's \nNational Post noted on October 20, 2008, that ``the number of climate \nchange skeptics is growing rapidly.'' New York Times environmental \nreporter Andrew Revkin noted on March 6, 2008, ``As we all know, \nclimate science is not a numbers game (there are heaps of signed \nstatements by folks with advanced degrees on all sides of this \nissue).'' I agree with him, and it's a shame that we have had to resort \nto a numbers game. It should be focused on objective, transparent and \npeer reviewed science, and debate should not be quarantined. In 2007, \nWashington Post staff writer Juliet Eilperin conceded the obvious, \nwriting that climate skeptics ``appear to be expanding rather than \nshrinking.''\n  Skeptical scientists are gaining recognition despite what many say is \na bias against them in parts of the scientific community and are facing \nsignificant funding disadvantages. Dr. William M. Briggs, a climate \nstatistician who serves on the American Meteorological Society's \nProbability and Statistics Committee, explained that his colleagues \ndescribed ``absolute horror stories of what happened to them when they \ntried getting papers published that explored non-`consensus' views.'' \nIn a March 4, 2008, report Briggs described the behavior as ``really \noutrageous and unethical . . . on the parts of some editors. I was \nshocked.''\n  Again, this is not me saying this; there are scientists. Here are \nsome of the highlights of my 2008 Senate minority report featuring over \n650 international scientists dissenting from man-made climate claims.\n  Incidentally, this report I have--it was my intention to make this \nreport of these 650 scientists a part of the Record. However, very \nwisely this body has said we do not want the expense. Something like \nthis would be so overwhelming that some Senators who are conservatives \nwould rather not do it. The report is here. It is a matter of public \nrecord. You can get a lot of this on my Web site, ewo.senate.com.\n  Nobel Prize Winner for Physics, Ivar Giaever, stated:\n\n       I am a skeptic . . . Global warming has become a new \n     religion.\n\n  Atmospheric Scientist Dr. Joanne Simpson, the first woman in the \nworld to receive a Ph.D. in meteorology, and formerly of NASA, who has \nauthored more than 190 studies and has been called ``among the most \npreeminent scientists of the last 100 years,'' stated:\n\n       Since I am no longer affiliated with any organization nor \n     receiving any funding, I can speak quite frankly. . . . As a \n     scientist I remain skeptical . . . The main basis of the \n     claim that man's release of greenhouse gases is the cause of \n     the warming is based almost entirely upon climate models.\n       We all know the frailty of models concerning the air-\n     surface system.\n\n  Here, no one can argue with Dr. Simpson.\n  The United Nations IPCC Japanese scientist Dr. Kiminori Itoh, an \naward-winning Ph.D. environmental physical chemist, stated--this is \nfrom all over the world now, this is in Japan.\n\n       Warming fears are the worst scientific scandal in the \n     history. . . . When people come to know what the truth is, \n     they will feel deceived by science and scientists.\n\n  Indian geologist Dr. Arun Ahluwalia of Punjab University, and a board \nmember of the U.N.-supported International Year of the Planet, stated:\n\n       The IPCC has actually become a closed circuit; it does not \n     listen to others. It does not have open minds. I am really \n     amazed that the Nobel Peace Price has been given on \n     scientifically incorrect conclusions by people who are not \n     geologists.\n\n  Solar physicist Dr. Pal Brekke, senior advisor to the Norwegian Space \nCenter in Oslo, has published more than 40 peer-reviewed scientific \narticles on the Sun and solar interaction with the Earth. Brekke \nstated:\n\n       Anyone who claims that the debate is over and the \n     conclusions are firm has a fundamentally unscientific \n     approach to one of the most momentous issues of our time.\n\n  These are all top scientists. No one can discredit these people. You \nmight wonder, why is it that so many people want us to believe that \nmaybe bad old man is responsible for those horrible things that are \ngoing to happen, that are not going to happen? There are a lot of \nreasons for that. A lot of money behind this comes from organizations \nsuch as those we find in some of the Hollywood groups, moveon.org, \nGeorge Soros, and different foundations such as the Hines Foundation \nthat do want to stop the progress in this country.\n  But, anyway, back to some of these scientists. Victor Manuel Velasco \nHerrera, a researcher at the Institute of Geophysics of the National \nAutonomous University of Mexico--I am covering all of these countries \nnow. These are the top scientists in these countries--states:\n\n       Models and forecasts of the UN IPCC are incorrect because \n     they only are based on mathematical models and presented \n     results and scenarios that do not include, for example, solar \n     activity.\n\n  Surprise, surprise. The Sun warms things.\n  U.S. Government atmospheric scientist Stanley Goldenberg of the \nHurricane Research Division of NOAA stated:\n\n       It is a blatant lie put forth in the media that makes it \n     seem that there is only a fringe of scientists who do not buy \n     into anthropogenic global warming.\n\n  Geoffrey G. Duffy, a professor in the Department of Chemical and \nMaterials Engineering of the University of Auckland in New Zealand, \nstated:\n\n       Even doubling or tripling the amount of carbon dioxide will \n     virtually have little impact, as water vapor and water \n     condensed on particles as clouds dominate the worldwide scene \n     and always will.\n\n  This has always happened. We have gone through these stages. I do not \nwant to make this part without documentation, but when we went through \none of the other warming periods in this country, it was back before \nthey had the combustion engine, back before CO2 was even \naround yet. Here we are today with all of these people, the names are \nthe top scientists in the world who are making these statements. A lot \nof them used to be on the other side of this issue. That was back when \nthey were being threatened with withdrawal of various funding for the \nprojects they had, and now they are back on the other side.\n  Andrei Kapitsa, a Russian geographer and Antarctic ice core \nresearcher, stated:\n\n       The Kyoto theorists have put the cart before the horse. It \n     is global warming that triggers higher levels of carbon \n     dioxide in the atmosphere, not the other way around . . . A \n     large number of critical documents submitted at the 1995 \n     United Nations conference in Madrid vanished without a trace. \n     As a result, the discussion was one-sided and heavily biased, \n     and the U.N. declared global warming to be a scientific fact.\n\n  Prominent Hungarian physicist and environmental researcher Dr. Miklos \nZagoni reversed his view. He was on the other side of this issue, on \nmanmade warming. He is now a skeptic. Zagoni, once Hungary's most \noutspoken supporter of the Kyoto Protocol, stated that:\n\n       Nature's regulatory instrument is water vapor: more carbon \n     dioxide leads to less\n\n[[Page S201]]\n\n     moisture in the air, keeping the overall greenhouse gases \n     content in accord with the necessary balance conditions.\n\n  Again, that is a very prominent scientist, perhaps considered the \nmost prominent scientist in Hungary.\n  Geologist Dr. David Gee, the chairman of the science committee of the \n2008 International Geological Congress, who has authored 130-plus peer-\nreviewed papers, who is currently at Uppsala University in Sweden, \nstated:\n\n       For how many years must the planet cool before we begin to \n     understand that the planet is not warming? For how many years \n     must cooling go on?\n\n  Meteorologist Hajo Smit of Holland, who reversed his belief--he was \nanother one on the other side of this issue, another one of the many \nscientists who reversed his belief on manmade warming to become a \nskeptic--is a former member of the Dutch U.N. IPCC committee. He \nstated:\n\n       Gore prompted me to start delving into the science again \n     and I quickly found myself solidly in the skeptic camp . . . \n     Climate models can at best be useful for explaining climate \n     changes after the fact.\n\n  South African nuclear physicist and chemical engineer Dr. Philip \nLloyd was also one of them who was very prominent in the United Nations \nIPCC in years past. He was the co-coordinating lead author who has \nauthored over 150 refereed publications, and he stated:\n\n       The quality of CO2 we produce is insignificant \n     in terms of natural circulation between air, water and soil . \n     . . I am doing a detailed assessment of the U.N. IPCC reports \n     and the Summaries for Policymakers, identifying the way in \n     which the Summaries have distorted the science.\n\n  I am actually getting that report. As we have said, we have been \nlooking at these reports for policymakers for a long time. And those \npeople on the other side would have you believe that is the National \nAcademy of Sciences, that is the United Nations. It is not scientists. \nThis is a summary for policymakers. These are politicians who have an \nagenda.\n  Atmospheric physicist James A. Peden, formerly of the Space Research \nand Coordination Center in Pittsburgh, stated:\n\n       Many scientists are now searching for a way to back out \n     quietly (from promoting warming fears), without having their \n     professional careers ruined.\n\n  This is the intimidation I was talking about.\n  Geophysicist Dr. Phil Chapman, an astronautical engineer and former \nNASA astronaut, who served as staff physicist at MIT, stated:\n\n       All those urging action to curb global warming need to take \n     off the blinkers and give some thought to what we should do \n     if we are facing global cooling instead.\n\n  Which, incidentally, happens to be going on right now. Environmental \nscientist Professor Delgado Domingos of Portugal, the founder of the \nNumerical Weather Forecast Group, who has more than 150 published \narticles--these guys are smart guys. This is not politicians talking, \nthese are the incontrovertible scientists who cannot be challenged--\nstated:\n\n       Creating an ideology pegged to carbon dioxide is dangerous \n     nonsense . . . The present alarm on climate change is an \n     instrument of social control, a pretext for major business \n     and political battle. It became an ideology, which is \n     concerning.\n\n  Dr. Takeda Kunihiko, vice chancellor of the Institute of Science and \nTechnology Research at Chubu University in Japan, stated:\n\n       CO2 emissions make absolutely no difference one \n     way or another . . . Every scientist knows this, but it \n     doesn't pay to say so . . . Global warming, as a political \n     vehicle, keeps Europeans in the driver's seat and developing \n     nations walking barefoot.\n\n  Award-winning paleontologist Dr. Eduardo Tonni of the Committee for \nScientific Research in Buenos Aires and the head of the Paleontology \nDepartment at the University of La Plata said:\n\n       The global warming scaremongering has its justifications in \n     the fact that it is something that generates funds.\n\n  There we go again. All of these different groups and these \nfoundations who will fund people who will agree to support their \npolitical positions.\n  Atmospheric scientist Dr. Art Douglas, former chair of the \nAtmospheric Sciences Department at Creighton University in Omaha, NE, \nand author of numerous peer-reviewed publications, stated:\n\n       Whatever the weather, it's not being caused by global \n     warming. If anything, the climate may be starting into a \n     cooling period.\n\n  And this is, by the way, something that nobody questions now; we are \ngoing well into a cooling period.\n  Chemist Dr. Patrick Frank, who has authored more than 50 peer-\nreviewed articles, stated:\n\n       But there is no falsifiable scientific basis whatever to \n     assert this warming is caused by human-produced greenhouse \n     gasses, because current physical theory is too grossly \n     inadequate to establish any cause at all.\n\n  Award-winning NASA astronaut and moonwalker Jack Schmitt, who flew on \nthe Apollo 17 mission and formerly of the Norwegian Geological Survey, \nand for the U.S. Geological Survey, stated:\n\n       The global warming scare is being used as a political tool \n     to increase government control over American lives, incomes \n     and decisionmaking. It has no place in the Society's \n     activities.\n\n  By the way, I would have to add to that, another one of the \nmotivations in the United Nations is they are always critical of us \nwhen we threaten to withhold some of the funding, when they are \nadvocating policies that are contrary to our policies in the United \nStates. They would love nothing more than to have some type of a \nfunding mechanism where they did not have to be accountable to the \nUnited States or any other nation.\n  Climatologist Dr. Richard Keen, of the Department of Atmospheric and \nOceanic Sciences at the University of Colorado, stated:\n\n       Earth has cooled since 1998 in defiance of the predictions \n     by the U.N. IPCC . . . The global temperature for 2007 was \n     the coldest in a decade and the coldest of the millennium . . \n     . which is why global warming is now called climate change.\n\n  This is kind of interesting. Next week I am going to put together \nwhat has been happening recently in this cooling period, the fact that \nwe have had records that are set all around the United States and all \naround the world, and that is exactly what Dr. Richard Keen is talking \nabout now. We are in a cooling period. It has to drive these global \nwarming people nuts to have to recognize that.\n  Dr. G. LeBlanc Smith, a retired principal research scientist with \nAustralia's CSIRO, stated:\n\n       I have yet to see credible proof of carbon dioxide driving \n     climate change, let alone manmade CO2 driving it. \n     The atmosphere hot-spot is missing and the ice core data \n     refute this. When will we collectively awake from this \n     deceptive delusion?\n\n  That is G. LeBlanc Smith of Australia, one of the top scientists in \nAustralia.\n  The distinguished scientists featured in this new report are experts \nin diverse fields, including climatology, geology, biology, glaciology, \nbiogeography, meteorology, oceanography, economics, chemistry, \nmathematics, environmental sciences, astrophysics, engineering physics, \nand paleoclimatology.\n  Some of those profiled have won Nobel Prizes for their outstanding \ncontribution to their field of expertise and many shared a portion of \nthe U.N. IPCC Nobel Peace Price with Al Gore.\n  The notion of hundreds or thousands of U.N. scientists agreeing to a \nscientific statement does not hold up to scrutiny--just not true.\n  Recent research by Australian climate data analyst John McLean \nrevealed that the IPCC's peer-review process for the Summary for \nPolicymakers leaves much to be desired. The 52 scientists who \nparticipated in the 2007 IPCC Summary for Policymakers had to adhere to \nthe wishes of the United Nations political leaders and delegates in a \nprocess described as more closely resembling a political party's \nconvention platform battle, not a scientific process.\n  Only 52 scientists wrote the media-hyped U.N. summary for \npolicymakers, and it was actually published by the politicians and not \nthe scientists. One former U.N. IPCC scientist bluntly told EPW, our \ncommittee, how the United Nations' IPCC summary for policymakers \ndistorted the scientists' work. He said:\n\n       I have found examples of a Summary saying precisely the \n     opposite of what the scientists said.\n\n  This was from South African nuclear physicist and chemical engineer \nDr. Philip Lloyd, a U.N. IPCC co-coordinating lead author who has \nauthored over 150 referred publications. A 2008 international report of \nthe U.N. found\n\n[[Page S202]]\n\nits climate agency ``rife with bad practices.'' Others like to note \nthat the National Academy of Sciences and the American Meteorological \nSociety have issued statements endorsing the so-called consensus view \nthat man is driving global warming. But both the NAS and the AMS never \nallowed member scientists to directly vote on these climate statements. \nEssentially only two dozen or so members of the governing bodies of \nthese institutions produced a consensus statement. This report gives a \nvoice to the rank-and-file scientists who were shut out of the process. \nSo they are very thankful.\n  Many of these scientists are glad that we have this report so that \nthey now have access to the truth and they can come out from hiding.\n  The more than 650 scientists expressing skepticism comes after the \nU.N. IPCC Chairman Pachauri implied that there were only about a dozen \nskeptical scientists left in the world. Former Vice President Gore has \nclaimed that scientists skeptical of climate change are akin to flat \nEarth society members and similar in number to those who believe that \nthe moon landing was actually staged in a movie lot in Arizona. It is a \nshame that proponents have now been reduced to name calling. That is \nwhat we are getting now, name calling and insults. When you lose your \nlogic, this is what happens. They start the name calling and insults \nbecause they don't have logic.\n  Examples of consensus claims made by promoters of manmade climate \nfears: The U.N. special climate envoy Dr. Gro Harmel Brundtland, on May \n10, 2007, declared that the debate is over and added that ``it's \ncompletely immoral, even, to question the U.N.'s scientific \nconsensus.''\n  The U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change Executive Secretary \nsaid it was criminally irresponsible to ignore the urgency of global \nwarming. This was on November 12, 2007.\n  ABC News global warming reporter Bill Blakemore reported on August \n30, 2006:\n\n       After extensive searches, ABC News has found no such \n     [scientific] debate on global warming.\n\n  While the dissenting scientists contained in the report hold a \ndiverse range of views, they generally rally around four key points. \nNo. 1, the Earth is currently well within national climate variability. \nWe are talking about 650 of the top scientists in the world. No. 2, \nalmost all climate fear is generated by unproven computer model \npredictions. No. 3, an abundance of peer-reviewed studies continues to \ndebunk rising CO2 fears. No. 4, consensus has been \nmanufactured for political and not scientific purposes. Those four \nthings, all of these 650 top scientists in the world agree to.\n  Since I released the report on December 11, other scientists have \ncontacted us to be included.\n  On December 22, 11 more scientists were added, including \nmeteorologists from Germany, the Netherlands, and CNN. Even CNN, very \nmuch on the other side of this issue, two more of their meteorologists \nhave come over and become skeptics, as well as professors from MIT, the \nUniversity of Arizona, and other institutions. One prominent scientist \nadded was award-winning Princeton University physicist Will Happer, who \nwas reportedly fired by former Vice President Al Gore in 1993 for \nfailing to adhere to Gore's scientific views. Happer has now declared \nmanmade global warming fears as mistaken. Happer is a professor in the \nDepartment of Physics at Princeton University and former director of \nenergy research at the Department of Energy who has published over 200 \nscientific papers and is a fellow of the American Physical Society, the \nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Scientists, and the \nNational Academy of Sciences. Happer does not mince words when it comes \nto warming fears. He said:\n\n       I am convinced that the current alarm over carbon dioxide \n     is mistaken . . . Fears about man-made global warming are \n     unwarranted and are not based on good science.\n\n  As we face a new administration and a U.N. eager to draw the U.S. \ninto its climate policy, let's not forget that this aspect of the \ndebate is still alive and well and only growing. We should not become \nweary of calling into question policy choices when they are driven by \nstill evolving scientific assessment, especially when the stakes are so \nhigh and the costs are so extraordinary. Let us hope this \nadministration and our news media recognize this new reality as we move \nforward into this new Congress.\n  On a personal note, it has been a lonely fight. For the last 6 years \nI have been talking about the Hollywood and media-driven fear that \ntries to convince us that those who are fueling this machine called \nAmerica are somehow evil and fully responsible for global warming. This \nis absurd. We all know better. It does take power to run this machine \nwe call America. In the past, the only argument that defeated all the \ncap-and-trade schemes was the economic argument. I think you can argue \neach one differently, saying no, this wouldn't cost the same as \nadhering to emissions required by Kyoto back in the Kyoto treaty days. \nBut any time you get into a cap and trade of CO2, it is \ngoing to cost about $300 billion annually in taxes. I was critical of \nmy colleagues, the 75 Senators who voted to give an unelected \nbureaucrat, Secretary Paulson, $700 billion to do with as he wished \nwith no oversight. I was critical of that. Of course, that is a one-\nshot deal. This was every year, a $300 billion annual tax increase. It \nwas too much, even if the science was fully settled.\n  Now the science is shifting dramatically to the other side. So I \nbelieve we need to be looking, even if we use their own figures of $6.7 \ntrillion as the cost of the life of a similar bill to the Lieberman-\nWarner bill.\n  I conclude by repeating something I have said many times: Even if you \nbelieve this, if you believe that manmade gas is a major cause of \nclimate change, what good would it do for us unilaterally in the United \nStates to impose a financial hardship, $300 billion a year, on people \nin the United States, when all that would do logically is cause our \nmanufacturing base to further erode and to go to countries such as \nChina and India and Mexico, other countries that have no emission \nrestrictions at all. It would be a $300 billion tax on us every year, \nand it would have the effect of increasing the net amount of emissions \nworldwide.\n  Last year I didn't say very much about the science. In fact, when we \nhad the Lieberman-Warner bill up, I made the statement: Let's assume, \nfor debate of this bill, that the science is all there and that it is \nsettled. Then I pursued the economic argument. The other side didn't \nlike it because they wanted to debate the science. I said: Let's assume \nyou are right. You are not, but let's assume you are. This is something \nthat we could not afford, the cost. Sometimes we throw around big \nfigures. I often have said about the $700 billion bailout that I \nopposed and that 75 Senators voted for, if you stopped and realized the \nnumber of taxpayers or families who file a tax return and do the math, \nthis comes to $5,000 a family. If you look at this, this would be over \n$2,000 a family every year. We want to be sure we are right if we do \nsomething. Let's go forward. Let's look at it, but let's pay attention \nmore than anything else at this time not just to the economics but the \nfact that without doubt, the science is shifting. This report, 650 of \nthe top scientists and growing every day, is conclusive in my mind that \nmany of those individuals who were on the other side of this issue are \nnow standing up to the intimidation and have become skeptics.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse).

Mr. President, I rise to discuss the urgent need to \naddress our Nation's economic challenges and to suggest that a major \npart of our approach should be to invest in clean alternative energy \nand energy efficiency.\n  Before I get into my remarks, it has been a very exciting few days \nfor me. Since being sworn in as the junior Senator from New Hampshire, \nand as this is my first speech on the Senate floor, I want to begin by \nthanking Majority Leader Reid, Minority Leader McConnell, our senior \nSenator from New\n\n[[Page S203]]\n\nHampshire Judd Gregg, and the entire Senate leadership for their warm \nwelcome and support.\n  On November 4, voters in my State of New Hampshire went to the polls \nand demanded a new direction, just as voters did across the country. I \nam eager to work with my fellow Senators and with our next President, \nBarack Obama, to fulfill that promise of change. The challenges before \nus are great. For 11 months in a row, the number of jobs in our Nation \nhas declined. More and more families across the country are losing \ntheir homes to foreclosure, and too many Americans watched their \nretirement savings evaporate last year.\n  It is no exaggeration to say that this 111th Congress and President-\nelect Obama will face some of the most difficult challenges in our \ncountry's history. These problems were created over many years, and \nthey will not be solved quickly. But Americans have always united to \nmeet great challenges, and I have no doubt that we will do so once \nmore.\n  Our first task is to get our economy back on track by putting middle-\nclass families first again and creating good jobs. As the recession \ncontinues, it has become clear that a bold economic recovery package is \nnecessary. This package must focus investment in areas of the economy \nthat will provide the recovery we need and lay the foundation for long-\nterm economic growth.\n  Investing in our Nation's infrastructure will both create needed jobs \nin the short term and foster economic development in the long term. \nThere are critical capital projects throughout the State of New \nHampshire and the country--projects such as repairing and upgrading our \nroads and bridges, modernizing our public schools and higher education \nfacilities, and replacing outdated water treatment plants, and other \nmunicipal projects. These investments will create jobs and lay the \ngroundwork for sustained economic growth.\n  We also need a bold investment in energy efficiency and clean \nalternative energy. These investments in new energy will create \nmillions of 21st century green-collar jobs, begin to reverse global \nwarming, and start on the path to energy independence.\n  New Hampshire small businesses already are leaders in the new energy \neconomy, making everything from wood pellets to ethanol, from forest \nbyproducts to solar panels and biofuels. We have seen firsthand how \ninvestment in clean energy creates good jobs up and down the economic \nladder--advanced manufacturing jobs, highly skilled construction jobs, \njobs installing solar panels and energy-efficiency systems, jobs \nselling and delivering new fuels. These are good jobs. They are jobs \nthat cannot be outsourced overseas. I am honored I will be joining the \nSenate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to work on these very \nissues as we develop a real energy policy for the future of this \ncountry.\n  These investments are necessary to get our economy moving again. But \nas we must invest, we also must develop a comprehensive plan to address \nthe Nation's ballooning budget deficit and the enormous national debt \nwe have inherited. Our Nation's financial strength tomorrow depends on \nour careful planning and prudent investments today.\n  In November, Americans cried out for a new way of doing business in \nWashington. I applaud President-elect Obama for leading the way with \nthe most open and transparent transition process in our Nation's \nhistory and believe we must continue that transparency. We must \nrecommit to accountability and oversight, and we must end the partisan \ngridlock that has stymied progress for too long. I am committed to \nworking across the aisle to make Washington work again for middle-class \nAmerican families.\n  Tuesday, when I took the oath of office as a Senator, I made a \ncommitment to embrace the opportunities that lie ahead and to help lead \nour Nation in a new direction. I am eager to begin.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, could I ask my friend from New Hampshire to \nwithhold her request?\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I say yes to the majority leader. I did not see the \nmajority leader on the floor. I apologize for that. I withdraw my \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wanted to be here to listen to Jeanne \nShaheen give her maiden speech. Of course, it brings back a flood of \nmemories of my maiden speech. I was so fortunate, I tell everyone, on \nthat initial speech. I had served a couple terms in the House, and I \nhad been trying to get something called the Taxpayers' Bill of Rights \npassed. The subcommittee chair in the House made fun of my legislation. \nI did not get anywhere with that. But I believed in it, so I marched \nover here--and I had the last seat way back in the corner over there--\nand I gave my first speech, and it was on the Taxpayers' Bill of \nRights.\n  Fortunately, I say to the Presiding Officer, David Pryor--Mark \nPryor's father--was presiding. He was a member of the Finance Committee \nand the chairman of the subcommittee that had jurisdiction over the \nIRS. Charles Grassley was listening to my speech. There were not many \nmore people than there are right now on the floor. But David Pryor sent \nme a note saying: I like this. Let me help you. And Chuck Grassley \ncommunicated with me saying he would help.\n  That was a fortunate day in my life because even though I took credit \nfor the Taxpayers' Bill of Rights passing, it would never have happened \nif not for David Pryor. He worked the last night of this session--I was \nin Nevada--he was on that Finance Committee, and they were trying to \ncomplete the conference. Anyway, he got it done.\n  These maiden speeches are meaningful because you will never forget \nthe speech you have given.\n  Now, for Jeanne Shaheen, I have had such admiration for her for such \na long time. We all watched as she presided over the State of New \nHampshire as Governor. She did a remarkably good job. When I learned \nshe wanted to run for the Senate, I was excited because this great \nstatesperson, with this engaging smile and her ability to work hard, \nwhich everyone knows about, is going to leave her in good standing here \nin the Senate.\n  I say to my friend from New Hampshire, the junior Senator from New \nHampshire, I appreciate the Senator running for the Senate. The people \nof the State of New Hampshire are going to reap benefits from that \ndecision for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/08/senate-section/article/S203-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S203-S204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR ROBERT BYRD\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join Senators on both sides of the \naisle in paying tribute to our dear colleague and dear friend from West \nVirginia on this historic occasion of his 50th anniversary in the \nSenate. On January 7, 1959, Robert C. Byrd was sworn in as a Senator \nfor the people of his beloved West Virginia, and in the years since \nthen, he is become truly one of the greatest Senators ever to serve in \nthis Chamber.\n  I have served with Bob for 46 of those years. I have immense respect \nfor him, and I am proud to say that we have become close friends. I \nlove Robert C. Byrd.\n  It wasn't always this way. There was a time that Senator Byrd and I \nwere rivals, each with eyes on the position of majority whip. I was \nelected to that position after the 1968 election, but as I have often \nsaid, Bob taught me how to count votes in 1970 when he defeated me for \nreelection. It turned out to be a blessing for both of us.\n  Bob would go on to become one of the finest majority leaders in the \nhistory of the Senate, and the defeat freed me to concentrate on my \nlegislative passions of health care, education, labor, and civil \nrights. In a very real sense Bob liberated me, and as our leader in \nmany of those years he was especially helpful in accomplishing my \ngoals.\n  The Bob Byrd I have come to know is a patriot, a passionate defender \nof the Constitution and the special role of the Senate, and an eloquent \nhistorian of the Senate, who has brilliantly served the people of his \nState.\n  I have so many wonderful memories of our relationship, but there are \ntwo recent ones I want to mention here.\n\n[[Page S204]]\n\n  The first has to do with the Iraq war. When President Bush set us on \nthis course, few had the courage and strength to question, let alone \noppose, this rush to war, but Bob Byrd stood strong against it. Facing \nenormous pressure, he led the opposition. He was in the minority--a \nlonely minority--but he was unbowed. He was right, and I am sure that \nhistory will judge his courageous leadership well.\n  The second memory is of a campaign trip I took to West Virginia in \nthe fall of 2004 to support our candidate John Kerry. We crisscrossed \nthe State from Charleston to Mingo County, and what I saw everywhere \nwas the extraordinary love and affection the people of West Virginia \nhave for Bob and that he has for them. It was an amazing and touching \nthing to sense the deep bond between this great man and the people he \nhas so ably represented in Washington for so long. It is an experience \nI will never forget.\n  Now, as we reflect on his unparalleled career in the Senate on this \nspecial 50th anniversary, I congratulate our friend. I thank him for \nall he has done so well for so many for so long. On this golden \nanniversary of his arrival in the Senate, I think of the famous lines \nof A. E. Housman about the ``golden friends'' the poet had. Bob Byrd is \nour golden friend, and we are all deeply honored to have the privilege \nof serving with him.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to add my congratulations to \nSenator Robert C. Byrd for his historic achievement today. Senator Byrd \narrived in the Senate 50 years ago. For decades, he has defended the \nConstitution and the principles upon which it stands. Senator Byrd is \ntruly a statesman, a patriot, a proud son of West Virginia, and an \nimportant voice in the history of this country.\n  The people of West Virginia definitely know that they have a champion \nwho will stand up for them. Senator Byrd has never forgotten the hard \nlife that he had as a boy growing up in poverty in the southern West \nVirginia coalfields. He has always remained true to his faith and his \nfamily and has worked to build a better future for West Virginia and \nthe Nation.\n  In the history of our great Nation, Senator Byrd has served longer \nthan all but one Member of Congress and has been a committed public \nservant. Senator Byrd first came to Washington in 1953 as a Congressman \nand served three terms in the House before being elected to the Senate. \nSenator Byrd quickly learned the rules and procedures that make the \nSenate run. He used these to his advantage while serving as the Senate \nmajority leader and in other key leadership positions. On June 11, \n2006, Senator Byrd became the longest serving U.S. Senator in history, \nand in November 2006, he was elected to an unprecedented ninth full \nterm.\n  During his tenure, his colleagues have elected him to more leadership \npositions than any other Senator in history. This includes Senate \nmajority whip, chairman of the Democratic Conference, Senate minority \nleader, and Senate majority leader. Currently, Byrd is the President \npro tempore. Throughout his career, Senator Byrd has cast more than \n18,100 roll call votes in five decades of service in the Senate.\n  Senator Byrd is also the longest serving member of the esteemed \nAppropriations Committee. He has served as its chairman or ranking \nmember since 1989. After many distinguished years of service, he has \nstepped down from his leadership position but will remain an important \nvoice on this committee. I have enjoyed serving with him on the \nAppropriations Committee and have learned a tremendous amount under his \nleadership.\n  There are other sides to Senator Byrd that have contributed to his \nlife's accomplishments, his achievements as a musician and author. \nSenator Byrd learned to play the fiddle at a young age and carried it \nwith him everywhere he went. His skill with the instrument led to \nperformances at the Kennedy Center and on a national television \nappearance on ``Hee Haw.'' He even recorded his own album, ``Mountain \nFiddler.'' He is also the author of a magisterial four volume set about \nthis body entitled ``The Senate, 1789-1989'' and other works.\n  No tribute to Senator Byrd would be complete without mentioning his \nlife's love, Erma Ora James. For nearly 69 years, the Byrds were \ninseparable, traveling throughout their native West Virginia and \ncrossing the globe together. Sadly, Mrs. Byrd passed away on March 25, \n2006, but Senator Byrd speaks lovingly of her and their life together \neach day.\n  The times have changed considerably since Senator Byrd was first \nelected to the West Virginia House of Delegates and eventually the U.S. \nSenate. We have seen a man walk on the Moon. We have mapped the human \ngenome, and we have seen unbelievable technological advances that have \nchanged the way we live, work and communicate. But through it all, the \none constant is Senator Byrd's steadfast championing of our \nConstitution and the people of West Virginia. I join my colleagues in \noffering my hardy congratulations to him on this important day.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today marks the 50th anniversary of \nSenator Robert Byrd's service to this most American of institutions: \nthe United States Senate.\n  ``Service to the Senate''--I have chosen these words intentionally, \nand with care. To serve in this hallowed chamber is to meld service to \nhome and community with service to the Nation as a whole. It is a \ndistinction that we are all privileged to share.\n  But through his five decades in this Chamber, Robert Byrd's service \nhas transcended the ordinary to rise to the absolute allegiance our \ncountry has only rarely received over her long history.\n  Senator Byrd was born and raised in humble circumstances. The loss of \nhis mother at the age of 1 left him a virtual orphan, and he grew up in \nWest Virginia's coal country. The Great Depression postponed the young \nRobert Byrd's education, but it did nothing to hold back his lively and \nagile mind or his passion to seize on America's promise of equal \nopportunity. In 1946, he entered West Virginia's House of Delegates, \nand sought progressively higher offices. Finally, in 1958, he arrived \nin the Senate and found his ``home.''\n  It is said that education opens doors, but in Senator Byrd's case, we \nlearn that the doors it opens may not be the ones that we expect. For \nhim, he was already a Member of the House of Representatives when he \nbegan work to earn his J.D. Ten years of night school finally earned \nhim the degree as a sitting Senator.\n  So what doors did his studies open? After all, he was already one of \nthe Nation's highest officials.\n  Education, a love of history, the discipline of rigorous study, the \nindependence of thought. If you think about it, these are the very \nqualities that our American democracy most depends on. And by \ncultivating them, Senator Byrd grew in his capacity to serve his home, \nserve his Nation, and to serve the Senate.\n  Mr. Byrd served as the Senate majority leader from 1977 to 1981, and \nmany believe it is in recognition of that time that I continue to call \nhim ``Mr. Leader.'' But I would like to take this opportunity to set \nthe record straight.\n  Mr. Leader. My dear friend. Protocol dictates that anyone who served \nas majority leader should retain the title for life. Even in the \nabsence of protocol, however, my heart would demand that I rise and \nsalute you as leader of this institution. Congratulations on this \nmilestone, Mr. Leader. We have worked together for many years, and it \nwill be a distinct honor to continue working with you on the \nAppropriations Committee and in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/08/senate-section/article/S204-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S204-S205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  WORKING FAMILY CHILD ASSISTANCE ACT\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, yesterday, I joined Senator Lincoln to \nintroduce legislation to make permanent the tremendous change Congress \nenacted last October to enhance the refundable child tax credit. To \nassist working families, Congress reduced the amount of earnings a \nfamily must have to qualify for the refundable child tax credit to \n$8,500 for 2008 from the $12,050 that prevailed prior to passage of the \nAct. Unfortunately, because Congress did not make the incentive \npermanent, families will have to earn at least $12,550--$4,050 more--\nthis year to take advantage of the incentive.\n  At a time in which the economy is in recession and many have to work \ntwo or even three jobs to put food on the table, it would be \nunconscionable to\n\n[[Page S205]]\n\nmake families toil even harder to provide their children with life's \nnecessities. That is why I am so proud to introduce the Working Family \nChild Assistance Act to permanently set the amount of earnings \nnecessary to qualify for the refundable child tax credit at $8,500.\n  Last October's change to boost the refundable child tax credit took a \nsignificant time to materialize, and although the road was long, it was \na worthwhile journey. Indeed, our work began in 2001 when I pushed to \nmake the child tax credit refundable for workers making around the \nminimum wage. As enacted in 2001, a portion of a taxpayer's child tax \ncredit would be refundable--up to 10 percent of earnings above $10,000.\n  Not resting on our victory in 2001, in 2004, Congress passed the \nWorking Families Tax Relief Act of 2004, which increased from 10 \npercent to 15 percent the portion of the child tax credit that is \nrefundable. Although the legislation increased the amount of the \nrefundable child credit, it failed to increase the number of families \neligible for the benefit. The reason was that it did not reduce the \namount of earnings a family must have to qualify for the incentive. \nWorse still, the earnings threshold rose each year because it was \nadjusted for inflation. The consequences were serious for low-income \nAmericans living paycheck-to-paycheck because it meant that tens of \nthousands of low-income families were left completely ineligible for a \ncredit they should receive.\n  To ensure that low-income families could get the benefits that they \nso rightly deserve, I worked with my colleagues to introduce \nlegislation in both 2005 and 2007 to reduce the earnings threshold for \nthe refundable child tax credit to $10,000 and to de-index that amount \nfor inflation. As I mentioned, we were more successful than that last \nyear when Congress lowered the earnings threshold for 2008 to $8,500.\n  Unfortunately, we cannot rest on our laurels and must get right back \nto work. This year, because the incentive we passed last October was \neffective for just 2008, only taxpayers earning over $12,550 are \neligible to receive the refundable portion of the child tax credit. \nLow-income families earning less than that amount are shut out of the \nchild tax credit completely.\n  As an example of how crucial it is to enact our legislation to \npermanently set the threshold for the refundable credit at $8,500, \nlet's look at the following example. A single mother who earns the \ncurrent minimum wage of $6.55 per hour and works a 40 hour week for all \n52 weeks of the year would earn $13,264. Accordingly, under the law \neffective for 2009, her refundable child tax credit would be $161. In \ncontrast, if the earnings threshold were set at $8,500, her refundable \nchild tax credit would jump to $715. Thus, if Congress does not change \nthe law, that mother will have 554 fewer dollars in her pocket this \nyear than she did last year. Put another way, she won't have the money \nthat is so necessary for her to clothe her child and put gas in the \ncar. What is even more regrettable is that the $554 amount will only \ngrow next year because the $12,550 she needed to earn this year is \nadjusted for inflation and will increase.\n  Let's do the right thing and make permanent the sensible change \nCongress made last year to set the earnings threshold for the \nrefundable child tax credit at $8,500. Our families and our country are \nbetter off when Government lets people keep more of what they earn, \nparticularly the most vulnerable among us. Parents deserve their per-\nchild tax credit, and this bill rewards families for work.\n  In conclusion, I would note that President-elect Obama was a stalwart \nsupporter of our efforts as a Member of the Senate, and I hope that he \nwill work with Congress so we can help an additional 1 million \nchildren, whose parents and guardians struggle every day to take care \nof them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/08/senate-section/article/S205-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S205-S207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record:\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Thank you for asking about our story and giving us an \n     opportunity to help. Me and my wife are students at BYU-Idaho \n     and have one child on the way. The situation that we are in \n     requires us to drive to school and work. We use about 2 tanks \n     of gas a month and that is just business travel and does not \n     include any enjoyment travel such as going to see family \n     which has been very limited lately. My job consists of \n     working at a Thai restaurant as a waiter for only 10 hours a \n     week because with my heavy school load; that is all I can do. \n     My wife does not work and is 37 weeks pregnant and attending \n     school. Luckily we have received government financial aid for \n     school, which consists of Pell grants. This money helps but \n     we find that instead of using that money the government gave \n     us for education, we are using it to pay for gas. We are \n     grateful for the aid the government is giving us but sorry \n     that it is not used for what they meant it for but instead \n     find ourselves using it to pay the oil companies. To try to \n     limit the use of such fund we tend to stay home more and \n     visit family less but even with that sacrifice we still see \n     the money slowly seeping out due to gas prices.\n       Thank you for your efforts,\n     Blake.\n                                  ____\n\n       Our government's inaction in this energy crisis is in my \n     view the greatest act of treason by a group of Americans in \n     recent memory. Inaction and pointing fingers at each other is \n     unacceptable behavior by a government who is ``supposed'' to \n     be looking after the best interests of the American people. \n     We have every ability to provide for our energy needs with \n     our own resources while we work to conserve and provide the \n     energy responsibly in our environment. The fact that our \n     government is allowing the American people to be held hostage \n     by the world on this issue is tragic and has enhanced my view \n     that the corruption is not with our industries but with those \n     that we are electing.\n     Jay.\n                                  ____\n\n       Trucks move the nation and the price of diesel is hurting \n     everyone.\n     Marge.\n                                  ____\n\n       I see my married children struggle to buy gas for their \n     cars--money that should go to food, medical, and housing \n     costs.\n       Two years ago, in my construction business, it would not \n     have mattered whether a job was 3 miles away or 30 miles \n     away, but now I cannot bid a job without adding extra for \n     fuel for added distance. All of our construction materials \n     are going up also. How long will the economy stand this?\n       It is frustrating to see the congress do nothing to help \n     relieve the pressure of this on the nation. Raising taxes \n     will not help. Just doing something about the \n     environmentalists will help. Stop the government controls and \n     get drilling for oil and build some refineries.\n       Thank you for what you do, Senator Crapo. I know that you \n     are for drilling because I watch your voting record. I also \n     listen to you on ``Probing America''. The United States needs \n     more people like you.\n     Allan, Shelley.\n                                  ____\n\n       Living in Southeast Idaho with its wide open spaces can be \n     both a blessing and a curse. As an educator and a proud \n     parent, I am deeply concerned about the rising energy costs. \n     I work fifteen miles from where I live. That translates to \n     thirty miles round-trip. I choose to work in a rural school \n     district and am proud to do so as I believe every district \n     deserves quality teachers. As you are well aware, educators \n     are already some of the poorest paid in this great state. I \n     fear that I may not be able to afford to keep my job, but I \n     can also not afford to lose it. One thing I am sure of and \n     that is that Washington does not know about the special needs \n     of our state as far as transportation is concerned. I am glad \n     that you can present our situation to them.\n     Stephanie.\n                                  ____\n\n       Our business is ATV Alternatives, LLC in Caldwell. Our \n     product is a fantastic utility vehicle imported to the USA \n     from abroad that gets nearly 40 MPG and is increasingly \n     popular to businesses (especially dairies, farms, ranches, \n     recreational users) who see value in using a smaller vehicle \n     that can carry a variety of things along with a second \n     passenger in an enclosed cab. It gets 2-4 times better \n     mileage than other products\n\n[[Page S206]]\n\n     being used (pickups being underutilized 10 MPG, ATVs getting \n     15-20 MPG, UTVs getting 20-25 MPG, or tractors getting 4-12 \n     gallons per hour.\n       Increasing prices for fuel is increasing demand but \n     commuting to the office, delivering vehicles, and overall \n     shipping costs (especially over the ocean, on rails and by \n     truckers) have dramatically gone up as well. Further, \n     increasing international competition for the same used \n     ``Kei'' class Mini Trucks along with the drastic decline of \n     the U.S. Dollar versus the Japanese Yen have also \n     dramatically increased product costs (upwards of 75-100% \n     increase versus 2006). The margin is now too thin to really \n     let this business generate the income we need it to . . . it \n     looks like a great little business needs a buyer; know \n     anybody interested in a great opportunity that can easily and \n     synergistically combine with another Farm Equipment, Vehicle, \n     or Recreational Vehicle dealership?

Gas prices \n     are really hurting our family. Last November (2007), we were \n     lucky to have twin boys born to us three months and a week \n     early. The doctors gave them a 50% chance of living. They \n     were in the hospital for three months and a little bit. We \n     have insurance but with doctors asking for money and \n     continuous doctors' appointments, my little paycheck is \n     having a very rough time trying to afford rising gas prices, \n     doctor bills, house mortgage, car payment, and student loans. \n     I bring home about $1,250 a paycheck. I have one house with a \n     mortgage of $1,260 a month, one car with payments at $244 a \n     month; we do not have internet, cable, magazine \n     subscriptions, cell phones, or any of the other extras that \n     this wonderful life can afford. If you really start adding \n     the number together, I do not really make that much. And the \n     gas prices are really hurting me and my family, not to \n     mention all the other young families around me. Some people \n     in life are just starting out, they do not have the high \n     paying job, let us think twice before we raise the price of \n     gas. We do not want to be the cause kids not being able to go \n     to the doctor's office because we cannot afford to drive \n     there.\n     Ancle, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       Recent gasoline price increases have induced my wife and I \n     to spend more time on our bicycles. I am feeling better, \n     she's lookin' good, and we have each lost 10 pounds. High \n     pump prices have motivated a healthy self examination of our \n     lifestyle.\n       Metaphorically speaking, the nation could benefit from the \n     loss of a few pounds. The current gas crunch will be good for \n     the nation insofar as it motivates instrospection and \n     reasoned change in our national energy habits.\n       I fear, however, that the nation will choose political \n     expedience instead of the changes that will assure our \n     country's long term health. Rather than wean ourselves from \n     petroleum, we will be tempted to increase domestic oil \n     production. Such an increase, however, would be gobbled up by \n     the global market, and do little to ameliorate conditions at \n     home. To be sure, domestic petroleum development might be a \n     part of a comprehensive energy policy, but relying on \n     domestic production as the centerpiece of the nation's energy \n     plan would be foolish.\n       High gasoline prices are due as much to a weak dollar as to \n     increased global competition for the world's petroleum. Our \n     nation's industrial and technological base is rapidly \n     eroding, both in real terms and relative to the rest of the \n     world. As a consequence, we have less to offer in exchange \n     for the petroleum and other products we import.\n       The nation's 20th century rise to power coincided closely \n     with its ability to dominate the world's energy market. We \n     exported the lion's share of the world's petroleum and, \n     importantly, we manufactured the automobiles and machines \n     that used it. For the United States, both literally and \n     figuratively, energy has been the source of power.\n       Today's high petroleum prices signal a window of \n     opportunity for the United States. As the world's largest \n     energy consumer, we are in a unique position to define the \n     alternative energy technology that the entire world will use \n     for decades. We can, as a nation, choose to regain our \n     preeminence as the world's largest energy supplier by \n     developing and manufacturing the energy production, \n     distribution, and storage systems that the world will use. \n     This will decrease our dependence on foreign petroleum, \n     revitalize our industrial base, and rid us of the trade \n     deficit that is sapping our buying power.\n     Michael, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       One good step toward actually doing something about \n     gasoline prices would be to realize that the oil ``prices'' \n     quoted daily in the media do not represent the oil companies' \n     costs for their raw material. They are taken from the \n     commodities futures trading markets, and have no bearing upon \n     what it costs an oil company to pump oil out of the ground. \n     The oil companies do and will use the futures markets as \n     cover for increasing their prices, but the fact is that when \n     the price in the commodities market goes up that does not \n     mean the gasoline producers' costs go up too. It is obvious \n     to any thinking person that, in fact, the oil companies do \n     not get their crude oil through the futures markets.\n       If Congress wants to do something worthwhile, it could \n     require that oil futures trading be confined to buyers who \n     will take actual physical delivery of the oil ``purchased.'' \n     As it is, quoted oil futures prices are merely analogs for \n     the general value of the dollar, not for the true cost of oil \n     or the decent price of retail gasoline.\n     James.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senior citizens can either buy gas or groceries but not \n     both so the groceries win out of course and we stay at home. \n     Do something!\n     Annetta.\n                                  ____\n\n       I wish to respond to your email concerning current energy \n     prices. The current energy prices have had a profound effect \n     upon my retirement. In May, we turned off our propane powered \n     furnace for the summer and fall. The price of propane has \n     increased from $1.09 per gallon four years ago to $2.59 per \n     gallon a month ago. Also, we turned off the pilot light to \n     our gas fireplace.\n       Our family is spread from Oregon to Georgia. The current \n     price of gas has resulted in our inability to afford trips to \n     visit our children and grandchildren. Our children cannot \n     afford to visit us. We now make sure that trips to town are \n     fewer and with more errands accomplished per trip.\n       Our government needs to (1) open all areas to oil drilling, \n     (2) Increase development of solar power technology to include \n     vast solar collection arrays in the unused desert areas, (3) \n     consider nuclear energy power development, (4) do not overtax \n     our energy companies, (5) develop policies that will curtail \n     energy speculators from driving up prices and (6) provide \n     incentives for non oil based powered automobile production.\n     James, Bonners Ferry.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thanks for your concern in this matter. I am a soon-to-be \n     67 year old, retired, on a fixed income. My wife and I live \n     approximately 20 miles NW of Couer d'Alene. I am thankful for \n     our wood stove as it allows us to keep our heating costs \n     reasonable. Not so when it comes to gasoline. The prices in \n     Rathdrum are near $4 per gallon, and it looks like prices \n     will continue to rise. We do need four wheel drive vehicles \n     around here. My truck is indispensable in so many things I \n     do, including a logging ministry that a friend and I are \n     engaged in. Yes, we cut trees and give the proceeds away. \n     Keeping nothing for ourselves. With our grandchildren on the \n     coast, the cost of traveling is now being considered more and \n     more. Where does it end?\n       What I have been asking for years is why, when we have been \n     blessed with oil and natural gas reserves that will provide \n     this economic engine to our country, are we still choosing to \n     allow our energy policy to be dictated by people who want to \n     prohibit our energy independence and prosperity. It makes no \n     sense. As is being reported regularly, food costs are rising \n     at an alarming rate due to the cost of transportation. I \n     challenge you and others who we elected to represent us, to \n     begin setting the stage for oil exploration/drilling, and to \n     promote the use of nuclear energy, among other sensible \n     items.\n       I hope this is not in the ``for what is it worth'' \n     category, but that you are indeed deeply concerned about this \n     self-imposed dilemma. And a self-imposed, and totally \n     solvable problem it is.\n     John.\n                                  ____\n\n       With my household, it has been a bit hard. When I first \n     bought my Dodge neon, I was putting about $15 in my tank \n     every two weeks. But that was back in 2004 when my husband \n     and I could buy a house for close to nothing. Now I easily \n     spend $40 every two weeks and that is if I do not drive \n     anywhere but school and back. Then add on our house bills \n     which is $1,000 with utilities, then food which is $200 a \n     month, phone is $50 a month, the internet which I need for \n     school is also $50 a month, and my husband only makes $700 \n     every two weeks. My husband was also asked to step down by \n     Micron and they docked his pay. I am 26 years old and cannot \n     seem to find a job so I went back to school to enter the \n     medical field. So that leaves the only one working is my \n     husband and he has to work 12-hour shifts three to four \n     nights a week. Now he is forced to work almost five nights or \n     six nights a week just to pay for food, bills, and maybe \n     Oreo's if we are lucky for luxury. Plus we have to pay for my \n     school bills, which means sometimes our phone is shut off or \n     we miss a house payment. I was a stay-at-home mom but now I \n     am forced back into the working world. And all I can do at \n     the end of the day is cry alone at night and hope we can get \n     through the next week. We have thought about moving but that \n     would mean renting and they will not allow our dogs to go \n     into the rentals. And I am not about to give up my dogs. The \n     only thing keeping me going half the time is I will be \n     graduating next year with an associates degree in medical \n     specialist. And that will hopefully help me to find a job to \n     help my family out.\n     Danielle.\n                                  ____\n\n       High energy prices are taking a toll on not just me, but my \n     community. Because of the rise in gas prices, I can no longer \n     afford in\n\n[[Page S207]]\n\n     my budget to do something that I love to do--volunteer. I \n     have volunteered with Family Services Alliance of Southeast \n     Idaho for a year, but as the price of gas got over 3$ a \n     gallon, I had to stop. One part of the job is to be able to \n     drive to homes of victims of domestic violence when the \n     police ask for an advocate. The best way to help a victim of \n     sexual assault or domestic violence is to empower them by \n     showing them that they are not just victims, they are \n     survivors. But to do this, you need to go where they are and \n     intervene immediately. It requires taking a car. While it \n     pains me to have to cut this out of my activities, I have \n     already cut back in other ways and it was a hard decision to \n     make.\n     Diana, Pocatello.\n                                  ____\n\n       I have been a small business owner, (one that pays taxes \n     and one of the thousands of small businesses that support \n     this country) for over thirty-five years. I am amazed and \n     deeply troubled by the political chaos in our country and the \n     energy crisis that is bankrupting this country. Our raw \n     materials have raised three or four fold over the last few \n     years and the energy situation is driving many small \n     businesses out of business. I see the effects trickling down \n     to food and other essentials. Many families are in deep \n     trouble and I see it becoming drastic if something is not \n     done in a short period of time. I do not mean in a few years. \n     If Congress does not take steps immediately to put a stop to \n     this runaway disaster, America will never recover and we will \n     never have a quality of life again in America.\n       I hate to seem gloomy but I see business and families \n     everyday that are panicked. When we let OPEC and other \n     foreign governments support the so-called ``Greenies'' and \n     other environmental groups in America to the extent that we \n     cannot take care of our own needs here at home, then we of \n     all people are to be pitied. America is rich with raw \n     materials and coal and oil. It is completely insane to let \n     governments that hate us hold us hostage. My fourteen-year-\n     old grandson has more sense than that. Oil companies are \n     getting filthy rich while the American People are suffering. \n     If there is going to be anything left for our children and \n     grandchildren, then we better quit worrying about the owl or \n     the snail and start worrying about our children and \n     grandchildren. I do not know one American that I associate \n     with that does not care about the environment and wildlife \n     etc. But it is ridiculous for us to govern ourselves into \n     non-existence.\n       I urge you to take a stand against this corruption and turn \n     us back to common sense.

Mr. President, I commend Debra Brown Steinberg, \nan extraordinary woman who I have had the honor of working with for the \nlast few years.\n  Debra has been a tireless fighter for the families of 9/11 victims. \nWhile continuing to work fulltime as a partner at the law firm of \nCadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP, Debra spearheaded her firm's pro \nbono efforts to assist the families left behind.\n  The cases she handled were complicated, involving myriad issues. Many \nfamilies faced social service, financial and immigration complications. \nRather than addressing simply the legal aspects of each case, Debra \nworked to connect organizations, agencies, and policies to tackle cases \nin their entirety.\n  In May of 2002, New York State passed the September 11 Victims and \nFamilies Relief Act, large portions of which Debra helped draft. She \nalso contributed to the Federal September 11th Family Humanitarian \nRelief and Patriotism Act, which was introduced by Senator Lautenberg \nin the 110th Congress.\n  Debra's outstanding work has already been recognized by numerous \ncurrent and former Members of Congress, Presidential candidates, \nauthors, activists, religious leaders, the New York State Bar \nAssociation, and many distinguished publications. She has received the \nEllis Island Medal of Freedom and commendations from the New York City \nFire Department and Chief of Police. No one, however, can better speak \nto Debra's service than the families themselves.

Mr. President, all of us in Massachusetts who \nknew her or knew of her were saddened to learn of the death of Stella \nMay Brown Weaco at Massachusetts General Hospital on New Year's Eve.\n  Stella was born in Mississippi, but she called Boston her home for \nthe last 26 years of her life and she became a legend in our city. She \nlived on the streets, but her plight never deterred her gentle spirit. \nShe found a home and a family in the volunteers and the fellow guests \nat the Women's Lunch Place, the famed daytime shelter in the city for \npoor and homeless women. She went there every day after the shelter \nopened in 1982, and she became a familiar face and beloved friend to \nmany other members of the community.\n  Stella had an amazingly positive impact on every person she met. She \nis very fondly remembered as very grateful, very amicable, and very \nkind. Year after year, the Women's Lunch Place tried to persuade her to \naccept housing, but her indomitable spirit led her to decline such \nassistance. Finally, when the pressures of daily living on the streets \nbecame unbearable even for Stella, she graciously accepted the help of \nthose around her and spent the last 2 years on her life in the Pine \nStreet Inn.\n  Even then, Stella unfailingly came back to the Women's Lunch Place as \noften as she could, to seek out the familiar faces and friendships she \ncherished so much there. Sadly, Stella passed away on New Year's Eve, \nin the company of those who loved her for the joy she had given to \ntheir lives. In many ways, Stella exemplified the power and the spirit \nof giving and the extraordinary importance of human kindness. She'll be \ndeeply missed, but the impact she had on all who knew her is \nimmeasurable, and the lessons she taught will never be forgotten.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the obituary of Stella written by Women's \nLunch Place Executive Director Sharon Reilly and an eloquent column \nabout Stella by Rachelle Cohen in the Boston Herald may be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The information follows:\n\n               Stella Taught Us All About Grace, Dignity\n\n                   (By Rachelle Cohen, Jan. 5, 2009)\n\n       We lost Stella on New Year's Eve.\n       Even as the city prepared to usher out this year that \n     nearly everyone agrees they couldn't wait to see end, this \n     woman who had little and complained little died in the \n     company of those who cared about her and for her.\n       For at least a quarter of a century Stella lived on the \n     streets. And we only know that much because she was there \n     when the Women's Lunch Place, a daytime shelter for poor and \n     homeless women, first opened its doors 26 years ago.\n       For all those years she'd come for breakfast, a shower, to \n     do her laundry, maybe take a nap and stay through lunch. For \n     all those Thanksgivings and Christmases she had found a warm, \n     accepting place.\n       She was there when I reported for my first stint as a \n     volunteer, by then Stella was an undemanding kind of queen \n     bee--occupying her favorite spot against the wall in the \n     dining room. She was engaging and gracious, accepting a \n     pancake with butter and syrup as if it were a special gift.\n       Stella became the ultimate challenge for Lunch Place staff \n     over the years. The confusion that reigned in her head--which \n     often\n\n[[Page S208]]\n\n     made her insist she was descended from royalty or needed to \n     return to her real home in Jerusalem--also made her refuse \n     any kind of housing.\n       For more than two decades this tugging and pulling \n     continued. As one former staffer put it, ``she broke your \n     heart'' when she left the shelter at its 2:30 p.m. closing \n     time, heading out into bruising heat in the summer, into the \n     cold and the snow on wintry days. Housing--temporary or \n     permanent--wasn't for her, nor was the medication that might \n     have allowed her to see the world differently.\n       But her decades on the streets began to take their toll on \n     Stella. And, frankly she was no match for the Lunch Place \n     staffers who were tireless in their devotion and relentless \n     in their efforts to make whatever time remained for Stella \n     safe and comfortable.\n       So for the last two years of her life Stella had a roof \n     over her head and a place to call home.\n       And at the end of her days she had what so many others with \n     so much more in material wealth would envy. She had at her \n     bedside people who loved her. They loved her--we all loved \n     her--for the simplest of reasons. She returned our affection \n     and our kindness ten-fold. She taught us that grace and \n     dignity aren't a function of wealth or power. And at the \n     beginning of a new year she reminded us--even in death--that \n     being poor or homeless or mentally ill doesn't rob you of \n     that grace or that dignity. That comes from within. Stella \n     taught us that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/08/senate-section/article/S208-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/08/senate-section/article/S208-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/08/senate-section/article/S208-3", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:38 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Zapata, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 35.

A bill to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets \nAct of 1968 to enhance the COPS ON THE BEAT grant program, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Feinstein, Leahy, \nReid, and others to introduce the COPS Improvement Act of 2009. This \nlegislation would reauthorize one of the Department of Justice's most \nsuccessful efforts to fight crime, the Community Oriented Policing \nServices, COPS, program.\n  The success story of the COPS program has been told many times, but \nit is worth repeating. The goal in 1994 was to put an additional \n100,000 cops on the beat. Over the next 5 years, from 1995\n\n[[Page S213]]\n\nto 1999, the COPS Universal Hiring Program distributed nearly $1 \nbillion in grants to State and local law enforcement agencies to hire \nadditional law enforcement officers, allowing us to achieve our goal of \n100,000 new officers.\n  Common sense told the American people that having more police walking \nthe beat would lead to less crime, and our experience with the COPS \nprogram proved that to be true. This unprecedented effort to put more \npolice officers in our communities coincided with significant \nreductions in crime during the 1990s. As the number of police rose, we \nsaw 8 consecutive years of reductions in crime. Few programs can claim \nsuch a clear record of success.\n  Unfortunately, the success of the COPS program led some to declare \nvictory. Beginning in 2001, funding for the COPS program came under \nattack. President Bush proposed cuts to the COPS program in each of his \nbudget requests, and his proposed cuts to State and local law \nenforcement programs has totaled well over $1 billion in recent years. \nDespite bipartisan efforts in Congress to prevent those cuts, State and \nlocal law enforcement funding has consistently declined. Ultimately, \nthe administration succeeded in eliminating the COPS Hiring Program in \n2005.\n  These cuts have been felt by the people who work every day to keep \nour communities safe, and the consequences have been real. Cities \nacross the country have seen the size of their police force reduced. \nNew York has lost thousands of police officers in recent years. Other \ncities have hundreds of vacancies on their forces. Years of decreases \nin funding have led to fewer cops on the beat and, unfortunately, \nincreases in violent crime.\n  Therefore, in order to restore the safety of our neighborhoods and \ncommunities, it is imperative that we commit ourselves to restoring \nfunding for the COPS program. The COPS Improvement Act of 2009 would \nauthorize $1.15 billion per year over 6 years for the COPS program. It \nwould allocate $600 million per year to hire officers to engage in \ncommunity policing and as school resource officers. It also authorizes \n$350 million per year for technology grants.\n  The legislation would also provide some relief to local prosecutors, \nwho have also seen their ranks reduced by the cuts in funding. \nSpecifically, it includes $200 million per year to help local district \nattorneys hire community prosecutors.\n  To be sure, some will argue that more than $1 billion is too large a \nprice tag. It is hard to put a price tag on the security of our \ncommunities. Investing money in such a successful program with such an \nimportant goal is certainly worth the cost. We must also remember that \npreventing crime from occurring saves taxpayers from the costs \nassociated with victim assistance and incarceration. For that reason, a \nrecent report by the Brookings Institution found ``COPS . . . to be one \nof the most cost-effective options available for fighting crime.''\n  It is also worth noting the assistance the COPS program can provide \nto our economy. Few government programs can claim such a direct \nconnection to job creation. The COPS Hiring Program actually puts more \npeople in this country to work. In addition to reducing crime, this \ninvestment can serve as a direct injection of money into the American \neconomy.\n  It is difficult to overstate the importance of passing the COPS \nImprovement Act. Because of the success of the program and the need for \na renewed commitment to it, the bill has long had the support of every \nmajor law enforcement group in the Nation, including the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, the National Association of Police \nOrganizations, the National Sheriffs Association, the International \nBrotherhood of Police Organizations, the National Organization of Black \nLaw Enforcement Officials, the International Union of Police \nAssociations, and the Fraternal Order of Police. These law enforcement \nofficers put their lives on the line every day to make our communities \na safe place to live, and they deserve our full support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 167\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Kohl, \nLeahy, and others in introducing the COPS Improvement Act of 2009. I am \nhonored to join them in introducing this important bill on an issue \nthat has been so forcefully championed by Senator Biden for so many \nyears.\n  It is my sincere hope that we are entering the dawn of a new age in \nour approach to State and local law enforcement funding. For the last 8 \nyears, the Bush administration has steadily and drastically reduced the \namount of funding and programming that the Federal Government provides \nto State and local law enforcement. This has been a huge mistake, with \na corresponding spike in the rise of violent crime in our country.\n  The need for additional funding for state and local law enforcement \nthrough the COPS program is clear. Over the last 5 years, our country \nhas experienced an alarming increase in violent crime. In 2007, the \nPolice Executive Research Forum reported that from 2004 to 2006, \nhomicides increased overall by 10 percent, aggravated assaults with \nguns rose 10 percent, and robberies rose 12 percent.\n  This survey mirrors the FBI's own statistics, which showed that \nviolent crime rose by 1.8 percent between 2003 to 2007. And this surge \nin the violent crime rate isn't just limited to big cities. In February \n2008, in testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, Attorney \nGeneral Mukasey acknowledged that violent crime was increasing across \nall of our communities.\n  Let me put these numbers in human terms. The International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police equates the rise of 2.5 percent to \n31,479 more victims of violent crimes in 2005. The 3.7 increase for all \nof 2006 means about 47,000 more Americans were victims of murder, \nrobbery, assault, rape, or other violent crimes.\n  Unfortunately, despite these disturbing numbers and the Justice \nDepartment's own acknowledgement that violent crime is increasing, over \nthe last 8 years the Bush administration continually proposed drastic \ncuts in the Federal assistance traditionally available to state and \nlocal law enforcement.\n  President Bush's proposed fiscal year 2009 budget slashed funding for \nState and local law enforcement at unprecedented rates. After \nrepeatedly proposing to eliminate COPS hiring grants, President Bush \nfinally zeroed out the entire COPS program for fiscal year 2009, \nreplacing it with a mere $4 million for a new community policing grant. \nThis is simply not acceptable and our communities are suffering because \nof it.\n  During the 1990s and earlier years in this decade, the federal \ngovernment vigorously funded grant programs for state and local law \nenforcement, including the COPS Program. We saw real results--violent \ncrime went down year after year. It is no surprise that with the recent \ncuts, violent crime rates have ticked back up.\n  This trend has to stop, and it is my hope that Congress and the \nincoming Obama administration will move to correct the huge damage that \nhas been inflicted on state and local law enforcement in the last eight \nyears. The bill Senator Kohl and I introduce today will go a long way \nto do that.\n  We know what works and we can see the results of ignoring and \nunderfunding proven programs. We also know that crime often rises in \ntimes of economic trouble. Now is not the time to continue the \nrollbacks in state and law enforcement funding initiated by the Bush \nadministration.\n  This bill will serve a dual purpose--creating thousands of jobs in \nthe current economic downturn and providing state and local law \nenforcement with the resources they need to successfully fight crime.\n  Specifically, the bill would authorize $1.15 billion per year for the \nnext 6 years to fund the following:\n\n[[Page S215]]\n\n  Police Hiring Grants: The bill authorizes $600 million per year to \nhire up to 50,000 officers to work in community policing efforts, and \nschool resource officers to fight school violence. These funds will \ncreate jobs in a worsening economy, and can be used to retain officers, \npay overtime costs, and reimburse officers for training costs.\n  Law Enforcement Technology Grants: The bill authorizes $350 million \nper year for police departments to obtain new technology and equipment \nto analyze real-time crime data and incident reports to anticipate \ncrime trends, map crime ``hot-spots'', examine DNA evidence, and \npurchasing badly needed technology upgrades for police on the street.\n  Community Prosecutor Grants: The bill authorizes $200 million per \nyear to help local district attorneys hire and train more prosecutors.\n  Troops-to-Cops Program: The bill authorizes a troops-to-cops program \nto encourage local police agencies to hire former military personnel \nwho are honorably discharged from military service or who are displaced \nby base closings to allow them to continue working and engaging in \npublic service.\n  The COPS Program is a time-tested program that has proven its \neffectiveness for years. It is one of the cornerstones in the State and \nlocal law enforcement efforts that have removed thousands of pounds of \ndrugs and millions of dollars worth of drug proceeds from communities \nacross the country.\n  Money from the COPS Program provides law enforcement with the \nofficers, prosecutors and technology that they need to keep our \ncommunities safe. All we have to do is look at the rising rates of \nviolent crime that correspond to the staggering funding cuts to \nunderstand how important these programs are for our country.\n  We must provide the necessary tools and funds to State and local law \nenforcement and act decisively to combat the nation's growing gang \nproblem and violent crime. Enacting the COPS Improvement Act of 2009 \nwill be a step in the right direction. I hope my colleagues will join \nSenator Kohl and I in supporting this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n       By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Kyl, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. \n        Hutchison, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Crapo, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mr. Specter, Ms. Cantwell, and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 168. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nprovide for compensation to States incarcerating undocumented aliens \ncharged with a felony or 2 or more misdemeanors; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today the Senate Judiciary Committee \nheld a hearing entitled ``Helping State and Local Law Enforcement \nDuring an Economic Downturn.'' Today Senator Kyl and I are introducing \na bill that will do just that. The SCAAP Reimbursement Protection Act \nof 2009 will help to alleviate the costs of illegal immigration to \nState and local governments by broadening the State Criminal Alien \nAssistance Program, SCAAP, to ensure that States and localities are \neligible for reimbursement of the costs associated with incarcerating \ncriminal aliens.\n  We are joined today by Senators Boxer, Hutchinson, Schumer, Cornyn, \nDurbin, Crapo, Bingaman, Specter, Cantwell, and McCain.\n  The burden of incarcerating criminal aliens weighs heavily on States, \nespecially during this time of economic uncertainty. California is home \nto approximately 32 percent of the Nation's illegal immigrants and \nspent over $950 million in 2008 alone to house these criminal aliens.\n  Understanding the expenses that States and localities bear, Congress \nenacted SCAAP in 1994 to help reimburse States and localities for the \ncosts of incarcerating criminal aliens. Prior to 2003, the Department \nof Justice interpreted the SCAAP statute to include reimbursement to \nStates and localities that are incurring costs of incarcerating \nundocumented criminal aliens who have been accused or convicted of \nState and local offenses and have been incarcerated for a minimum of 72 \nhours. After 2003, DOJ limited reimbursement to the amount States and \nlocalities spend incarcerating convicted criminal aliens for at least 4 \nconsecutive days.\n  Reimbursing States and localities only for the costs when a criminal \nalien is convicted and incarcerated for 4 consecutive days \nsignificantly undermines the goal of SCAAP that States and localities \nshould not bear the burden of a broken Federal immigration system. The \nactual costs of this failed Federal system begin when these aliens are \ncharged with a crime, transported, and incarcerated for any length of \ntime.\n  This narrow interpretation is even more devastating because SCAAP is \nconsistently under-funded. The President has zeroed out SCAAP funding \nin his budget proposals for the past 7 years. Through bipartisan \nsupport, Congress was only able to partially fund the program.\n  As a result, SCAAP only reimburses States for a fraction of the costs \nof incarcerating criminal aliens. In 2008, the California State \ngovernment will receive approximately $118 million in SCAAP funding. \nHowever, it is estimated to cost the State approximately $960 million \neach year for the incarceration of criminal aliens in California--$842 \nmillion above the reimbursement amount. The State of California is \ntherefore only being reimbursed for approximately 12 percent of its \nactual costs to incarcerate illegal criminal aliens.\n  This cut has had a domino effect on public safety funding. For every \ndollar less that SCAAP reimburses States, a dollar less is available \nfor critical public safety services. For example, after the SCAAP \nfunding cuts in 2003, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department \nimplemented an ``early release'' policy for prisoners convicted of \nmisdemeanors.\n  I believe it is the Federal Government's responsibility to control \nillegal immigration. The funding cuts imposed by the Bush \nadministration have let our local public safety services down, and have \nmade our communities less safe.\n  The SCAAP Reimbursement Protection Act of 2009 is good federal policy \nto fix a failed Federal one--so that States are reimbursed for the full \ncosts of incarcerating aliens who are either charged with or convicted \nof a felony or two misdemeanors.\n  This policy has the support of the National Sheriffs' Association, \nCalifornia State Association of Counties, the U.S./Mexico Border \nCounties Coalition, the Virginia Sheriffs' Association, the Los Angeles \nCounty Sheriff Lee Baca, and the Sheriffs' Association of Texas, who \nhave all endorsed the bill I am reintroducing today.\n  Our colleagues in the House unanimously passed this companion bill \nlast Congress and I urge my colleagues in this chamber to join me in \nsupporting this much needed amendment to the SCAAP statute.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 168\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``SCAAP Reimbursement \n     Protection Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ASSISTANCE FOR STATES INCARCERATING UNDOCUMENTED \n                   ALIENS CHARGED WITH CERTAIN CRIMES.\n\n       Section 241(i)(3)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     (8 U.S.C. 1231(i)(3)(A)) is amended by inserting ``charged \n     with or'' before ``convicted''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Reed, Ms. \n        Collins, and Mr. Nelson of Florida):\n  S. 171. A bill to develop and maintain an integrated system of \ncoastal and ocean observations for the Nation's coasts, oceans, and \nGreat Lakes, to improve warnings of tsunami, hurricanes, El Nino \nevents, and other natural hazards, to enhance homeland security, to \nsupport maritime operations, to improve management of coastal and \nmarine resources, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Coastal and \nOcean Observation System Act of 2009 and the NOAA Undersea Research \nProgram Act of 2009. These bills will greatly enhance our nation's \nexisting ocean\n\n[[Page S216]]\n\nobservation and research capabilities and drastically improve our \nunderstanding of the marine environment.\n  Oceans cover nearly three quarters of the Earth's surface, and have \ngreat influence over our lives. They shape our weather and climate \nsystems, provide highways for international and domestic commerce, \nsustain rich living and non-living resources on which many of our \nlivelihoods are based, and provide our nation over 95,000 miles of \nshoreline which is the backbone of tourist and recreational activities \nin many of our coastal states. Despite the constant, intricate \ninteraction between our lives on land and the natural systems of the \nocean, we know woefully little about the physical properties of the \noverwhelming majority of our planet. What lies over the horizon \nremains, by most accounts, a mystery.\n  Yet, the effects of those mysterious systems can be devastating. In \nrecent years, hurricanes, tsunamis, and other natural disasters have \ndevastated regions of our nation, and other parts of the world. Today, \nwe have the technology to monitor a wide range of ocean-based threats, \nfrom destructive storms to quieter dangers such as harmful algal blooms \nand man-made pollution. The purpose of the Coastal Ocean Observing \nSystem Act is to put that technology to work predicting these threats \nmore accurately and, when possible, mitigating their impacts.\n  This bipartisan, science-based bill would authorize the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, to coordinate an \ninteragency network of ocean observing and communication systems around \nour nation's coastlines. This system would collect instantaneous data \nand information on ocean conditions--such as temperature, wave height, \nwind speed, currents, dissolved oxygen, salinity, contaminants, and \nother variables-- that are essential to marine science and resource \nmanagement and can be used to improve maritime transportation, safety, \nand commerce. Such data would improve both short-term forecasting that \ncan mitigate impacts of major disasters, and prediction and scientific \nanalysis of long-term ocean and climate trends.\n  My home State of Maine currently participates in an innovative \npartnership known as the Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing System, or \nGoMOOS. Launched in 2001, GoMOOS takes ocean and surface condition \nmeasurements on a hourly basis through a network of linked buoys. These \ndata are subsequently made available via the GoMOOS website to \nscientists, students, vessel captains, fishermen, and anyone else with \nan interest in our oceans. The vast geographic range and frequency of \nmeasurements has led to unprecedented developments in scientific \nanalysis of ocean conditions in the Gulf of Maine. It has also \ncontributed invaluable information to our region's assessments of \nfisheries, weather conditions, and predictions of other ocean \nphenomena.\n\n  Unfortunately, due to recent budget cuts within NOAA, in 2008 GoMOOS \nwas forced to remove several buoys from the water, compromising the \nintegrity of the system and reducing the quality of data available to \nsystem users. The funding levels authorized in this bill will ensure \nthat this system, which has been shown to return $6 to the regional \neconomy for every dollar invested, will continue to grow and provide \nits vital services to our maritime community.\n  Of course, the need to access this type of information is not limited \nto the Gulf of Maine. In June 2006, the Joint Ocean Commission \nInitiative, made up of members from the Pew Ocean Commission and the \nU.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, presented to Congress a list of the \n``top ten'' actions Congress should take to strengthen our ocean policy \nregime. One of those priorities was ``enact legislation to authorize \nand fund the Integrated Ocean Observing System.'' Ocean and coastal \nobservations are a cornerstone of sound marine science, management, and \ncommerce. This bill will save lives by allowing seafarers to better \nmonitor ocean conditions and providing timelier and more accurate \npredictions of potentially catastrophic weather and seismic phenomena. \nIt will save taxpayers' dollars by reducing the emergency spending that \ncomes in the wake of unanticipated storms, and it will enhance the \nappreciation and understanding of our oceans and coastal regions to \nbenefit all Americans.\n  I am very proud to introduce this bill, and I would like to thank my \ncosponsors, Senators Cantwell, Inouye, Rockefeller, Landrieu, Kerry, \nBoxer, Reed, Collins, and Bill Nelson for contributing to this \nlegislation and supporting this national initiative. Of course, our \ncurrent and expanding ocean observation and communication system would \nnot be possible without the work of dedicated professionals in the \nocean and coastal science, management, and research communities--they \nhave taken the initiative to develop the grassroots regional \nobservation systems as well as contribute to this legislation. Thanks \nto their ongoing efforts, ocean observations will continue to provide a \ntremendous service to the American public.\n  While my ocean observing legislation will greatly enhance our ability \nto analyze and disseminate oceanographic and meteorological data, we \nalso face a shortfall in our Nation's ability to explore vast regions \nof our undersea territory. Nearly 3 years ago the U.S. Commission on \nOcean Policy released its long-awaited report, which noted that \napproximately 95 percent of the ocean's floor remains uncharted \nterritory. If past experience is any indication, fascinating \ndiscoveries await us in these vast unexplored areas. These regions are \nsure to include species of marine life that are currently unknown to \nscience, archaeological and historical artifacts that can shed new \nlight on our past, and marine resources that may support our ongoing \nquest for a sustainable future.\n  In 2004 the U.S. Ocean Policy Commissioners called for enhanced, \ncomprehensive national programs in ocean exploration, undersea \nresearch, and ocean and coastal mapping. The vision of the \nCommissioners, one that I share, is for well-funded and \ninterdisciplinary programs. Such programs are being led by NOAA, with \nsignificant input from partners in other agencies, academia, and \nindustry, but currently they lack formal Congressional authorization. \nThis legislation would establish those programs, and provide a strong \nfoundation upon which we can continue to expand the quest for knowledge \nto areas of the planet that have literally never been seen by human \neyes. I look forward to seeing these efforts enhanced under this \nlegislation.\n  I am proud to introduce this legislation today as well, and I thank \nmy cosponsors on this bill, Senators Inouye, and Rockefeller for their \nsupport. I would also like to acknowledge my support for three other \noceans bills being introduced by my colleagues simultaneously with \nthese two bills: the Federal Ocean Acidification Research and \nMonitoring Act, the Coastal and Estuarine Lands Protection Act, and the \nOcean and Coastal Mapping and Integration Act. All will be integral to \nenhancing our nation's coasts and oceans and I am pleased to support my \ncolleagues' efforts by offering my cosponsorship of these three pieces \nof legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 171\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Coastal and Ocean \n     Observation System Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The United States Commission on Ocean Policy recommends \n     a national commitment to a sustained and integrated coastal \n     and ocean observing system and to coordinated research \n     programs which would provide vital information to assist the \n     Nation and the world in understanding, monitoring, and \n     predicting changes to the ocean and coastal resources and the \n     global climate system, enhancing homeland security, improving \n     weather and climate forecasts, strengthening management and \n     sustainable use of coastal and ocean resources, improving the \n     safety and efficiency of maritime operations, and mitigating \n     the impacts of marine hazards.\n       (2) The continuing and potentially devastating threat posed \n     by tsunami, hurricanes, storm surges, and other marine \n     hazards requires immediate implementation of strengthened \n     observation and communications, and data management systems \n     to provide timely detection, assessment, and warnings and to \n     support response strategies for\n\n[[Page S217]]\n\n     the millions of people living in coastal regions of the \n     United States and throughout the world.\n       (3) Safeguarding homeland security, conducting search and \n     rescue operations, responding to natural and manmade coastal \n     hazards (such as oil spills and harmful algal blooms), and \n     managing fisheries and other coastal activities each require \n     improved understanding and monitoring of the Nation's waters, \n     coastlines, ecosystems, and resources, including the ability \n     to provide rapid response teams with real-time environmental \n     conditions necessary for their work.\n       (4) The 95,000-mile coastline of the United States, \n     including the Great Lakes, is vital to the Nation's \n     prosperity, contributing over $117 billion to the national \n     economy in 2000, supporting jobs for more than 200 million \n     Americans, handling $700 billion in waterborne commerce, and \n     supporting commercial and sport fisheries valued at more than \n     $50 billion annually.\n       (5) Ensuring the effective implementation of National and \n     State programs to protect unique coastal and ocean habitats, \n     such as wetlands and coral reefs, and living marine resources \n     requires a sustained program of research and monitoring to \n     understand these natural systems and detect changes that \n     could jeopardize their long term viability.\n       (6) Many elements of a coastal and ocean observing system \n     are in place, but require national investment, consolidation, \n     completion, and integration among international, Federal, \n     regional, State, and local elements.\n       (7) In 2003, the United States led more than 50 nations in \n     affirming the vital importance of timely, reliable, long-term \n     global observations as a basis for sound decision-making, \n     recognizing the contribution of observation systems to meet \n     national, regional, and global needs, and calling for \n     strengthened cooperation and coordination in establishing a \n     Global Earth Observation System of Systems, of which an \n     integrated coastal and ocean

A bill to evaluate certain skills certification programs, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I introduce a straight-forward \nbill that is a first step toward helping American workers and \nbusinesses. This bill is part of my E-4 Initiative, which focuses on \nissues affecting the economy, energy, education and employment. The \nSkills Standards Certification Evaluation Act will require the \nSecretaries of Labor, Education and Commerce to evaluate skills \nstandards certification programs that have been developed with federal \nfunding.\n  Skills Standards Certifications have emerged over the past two \ndecades in response to job growth in high-technology and varied \nindustries. The training or classes usually take weeks or months, \nrather than years. Often, they are developed in response to the needs \nof one industry or even one company, though the skills are often \napplicable more widely.\n  As the President-elect and Congress work to save and create jobs \nthrough additional funding for infrastructure, green jobs, and similar \nprograms, among other things, it is even more critical that employers \nbe able to find qualified workers for a variety of positions. Workers \nwho can easily demonstrate their skills quickly and easily will be able \nto benefit from such investments early on.\n  Over the past two decades, the Federal Government has taken \nconflicting approaches to skills standards certifications. That is why, \nas part of the Skills Standards Certification Evaluation Act, I require \na recommendation from the Secretaries of Labor and Commerce on how \nCongress ought to move forward with funding for these certification \nprograms. Both the national, top-down, and a local, bottom-up approach \nhave been tried, and a thorough evaluation will make clear how we can \nmove forward to get the most out of the funding the Federal Government \nprovides.\n  These certifications have a tremendous benefit for workers. First, \nbecause the training is often condensed into a few weeks with a \nflexible schedule, it allows people to complete certifications without \nleaving a current job and without the financial cost of attending a \nfull-time program that lasts a year or more. In addition, these \nprograms allow workers to clearly demonstrate a certain set of skills, \nand may open more doors for higher-paying employment. Because these \nprograms can be completed without leaving work, they also allow workers \nto advance within a career or company to more skilled positions and \nbetter wages and benefits.\n  For employers, Skills Standards Certifications can simplify the \nsearch for employees. I have heard from numerous Wisconsin employers, \nespecially small businesses with limited resources, that it is hard to \nfind employees with the skills they need, or who will be dedicated and \nloyal. Skills Standards Certifications clearly show the qualification \nof an individual, of course, but also tell the employer that he or she \nis dedicated enough to invest in the course to earn the certificate. \nVery few people will spend the time and money to enroll in such a \nprogram if they don't intend to use the certificate.\n  Lastly, these programs can help state and local governments quantify \ntheir skilled workforce, which can be invaluable when marketing the \narea to businesses and investment.\n  This bill is a small first step in what I hope can be a continuing \neffort to help hard-working Americans obtain and use high-demand work \nskills.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 176. A bill to improve the job access and reverse commute program, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I reintroduce a piece of my E4 \ninitiative, so named because it is a collection of proposals that \naddress issues important to the economy, education, employment and \nenergy. This piece of the E4 legislation focuses on the important \nsupporting role that transportation can play in economic development by \ncreating an environment where employers and those seeking employment or \nbetter employment are connected together. Having such a system to \novercome transportation hurdles can benefit both employers and \nemployees, as well as the local economy and is all the more important \nin these difficult economic times.\n  In more general terms, investing in our infrastructure like roads, \nbridges and transit systems can have direct job creation impacts. This \nis one reason I have fought hard with the rest of the delegation for a \nfair rate of return for Wisconsin from the highway bill. It is also why \nin a letter I sent to President-elect Obama and Senate leaders I \nincluded highway and transit projects as part of a variety of ready-to-\ngo infrastructure projects that should be included in the forthcoming \neconomic recovery program.\n  In addition to supporting transportation-related jobs, linking \nworkers and businesses that need them can also be an important part of \na more comprehensive job creation strategy. This can mean supporting a \nrobust public transportation system or more specific programs designed \nto link low-income individuals with jobs. I have consistently done the \nformer by supporting\n\n[[Page S221]]\n\npublic transportation during consideration of the highway bill and \nAmtrak reauthorizations. But my specific proposal today focuses on the \nlatter and improving the Job Access and Reverse Commute, JARC, program \nthat links low-income workers with employers.\n  I have heard good things about the JARC program and was glad that it \nwas shifted away from earmarks and was made available as a combination \nformula and competitively awarded program in the last highway bill. The \nprimary program goal is to locally assess the transportation needs of \nlow-income workers and then plan and fund programs to help alleviate \ntransportation-related barriers to employment or better employment. \nWhile initially this may have been viewed as a way to support reverse \ncommute projects whereby transit routes were established to allow city \ncenter residents to access jobs in the suburbs, the program actually \ndoes much more than just this and provides reliable transportation to \nlow-income urban, rural and suburban workers.\n  In Wisconsin, the Federal JARC program is jointly administered by the \nState departments of transportation and workforce development as the \nWisconsin Employment Transportation Assistance Program, WETAP. \nAccording to the Wisconsin Department of Transportation, transportation \nbarriers can include a lack of a dependable vehicle or bus service in \nthe area, an absence of local jobs, or childcare transportation \nproblems. The State agencies in Wisconsin have found several different \ntypes of projects to be effective depending on the local circumstances. \nThese projects have included the traditional public transit projects \nsuch as extending bus lines or supporting van-pooling, along with other \nprograms such as providing cars or car repairs to low-income \nindividuals. Wisconsin has even found that assisting with indirect \nbarriers such as transportation of children to and from childcare \nfacilities is critical in allowing some individuals to improve their \njob prospects.\n  A recent University of Illinois Chicago, UIC, study found that the \nsocietal benefits from this program are $1.65 per dollar spent and \nestimates lifetime benefits to low income participants of $15 per \ndollar spent due to their ability to find and retain better paying \njobs. While the goals of the Job Access and Reverse Commute program are \nimportant and the program has been found to be fairly effective, there \nare some details that have prevented the program from reaching its full \npotential. Working closely with transportation officials in Wisconsin \nand partially based on recommendations from the UIC study, I've come up \nwith some specific ideas to improve the program.\n  With a proven effective program and continuing unmet needs by \nemployers and low-income individuals seeking employment, JARC could use \na boost in funding. So that is why my proposal ramps up funding by $100 \nmillion over 5 years from the current funding of $165 million to $265 \nmillion in fiscal year 2014.\n  My proposal would also allow the Federal share of projects to \nincrease to 80 percent from the current 50 percent level for operating \nexpenses. The 50 percent local and State match wasn't feasible for far \ntoo many local governments in Wisconsin and as a result Wisconsin has \nnot been able to spend all its Federal funds. The higher Federal cost \nshare will better balance the need to leverage Federal funds, while \nensuring that these critical funds are fully utilized--millions of \ndollars in an account does nothing to link people to jobs.\n  Besides the challenge in coming up with a 50 percent local cost \nshare, the other main issue that has kept JARC from being as effective \nas it could be is the paperwork and reporting burden required by the \nprogram, especially for the small nonprofit groups that often have \nnever dealt with Federal grant requirements before. My proposal directs \nthe Federal Transit Agency, FTA, to examine the current reporting \nrequirements to see if there are ways to streamline the amount of \npaperwork required while still ensuring that the program goals are met.\n  My bill also includes a pilot program funded at $10 million a year \nfor 5 years in order to test a few areas that seem very promising, but \nshould be evaluated more fully before broader implementation. The first \nportion of the pilot program builds off the regulatory streamlining \nevaluation and allows the FTA to test streamlined reporting \nrequirements to help get the balance between oversight and \nadministrative burden right.\n  The second part of the pilot program focuses on improving education- \nand employment-related transportation for teens and young adults. \nEnabling students and young people to reliably get between their high \nschools or neighborhoods and technical colleges, job training centers \nor apprenticeships can have a lifelong positive impact.\n  The third section of the pilot program would allow experimentation \nwith combining different transit programs and integrating JARC projects \nacross local political boundaries to provide a more comprehensive local \ntransportation system. Instead of having one transit program to assist \nthe disabled, one targeted toward the elderly and another focused on \njobs, this pilot program would encourage funding combined applications \nto meet these needs together with one comprehensive project. There is \neven the potential for the Department of Transportation to further \ncoordinate with other departments such as Health and Human Services for \nhealthcare-related transportation. Similarly, the needs of employers \nfor employees do not recognize local political boundaries, so \nencouraging greater collaboration between local entities to make a more \nrobust interconnected system should ultimately provide more efficient \nand effective service.\n  While the FTA already provides some technical assistance for the JARC \nprogram, my proposal provides a small boost in funding and some \nadditional areas of emphasis. For example, after hearing about the \nstruggles that some small nonprofits have with the reporting \nrequirements, in addition to looking for ways to streamline the \nrequirements, my proposal would direct the FTA to also provide some \ntechnical assistance especially targeted to this need.\n  The final element of my proposal is the offset. The new spending \nauthorized in the proposal is fully offset by rescinding highway and \nbridge earmarks that have not had funds spent from them despite being \nauthorized over a decade ago as part of the TEA-21 highway bill. \nHelping connect workers and employers is a much better use of these \nfunds than letting them sit unused in some obscure DOT account.\n  Providing reliable transportation to low-income individuals only goes \nso far--it is the companies and innovators creating the jobs and the \nindividuals seeking to better their lot through education or more \nchallenging employment, that are doing the heavy lifting. That being \nsaid, transportation can clearly be a challenge for companies and \nworkers and in the case of the JARC program can play an important \nsupporting role.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 177. A bill to amend the Small Business Act to extend the Small \nBusiness Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer \nprograms, to increase the allocation of Federal agency grants for these \nprograms, to add water, energy, transportation, and domestic security \nrelated research to the list of topics deserving special consideration, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, we are all aware of the serious \nchallenges our economy faces in the short term and the urgency of our \nneed to promote job creation and economic development. I am committed \nto engaging in this broad effort with my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle. But it is essential that our efforts not just be short term \nfixes--they must not only aim to create jobs and investment \nopportunities in the short term, they must be part of strategic efforts \nto strengthen our Nation's innovation capabilities and sustain long \nterm economic development in a changing and competitive global \nenvironment. There is no better way to do this than by stimulating and \nsupporting small business innovation, especially in areas of national \npriority. As part of this effort, today I am introducing the \nStrengthening Our Economy Through Small Business Innovation Act of \n2009.\n  Job growth, innovation and economic development are driven by our \nsmall\n\n[[Page S222]]\n\nbusinesses. Small businesses also tend to be based in our cities and \ncommunities and so they are major contributors to our local economies. \nHalf of our county's payroll jobs and most of our new job opportunities \nare provided by small businesses. Small businesses are proven \ninnovators and drive commercialization of cutting edge technologies. \nNot only are small businesses our major source of employment, they \nemploy about one third of our country's scientists and engineers and \ngenerate more patents on a per capita basis than large businesses and \nuniversities. They also are effective partners with universities to \nenhance product creation, develop university income and attract \nuniversity graduates and faculty through increased innovative job \nopportunities.\n  Over the last 25 years, through the Small Business Innovation and \nResearch program, SBIR, and, more recently, the Small Business \nTechnology Transfer program, STTR, up to 2.5 percent and 0.3 percent, \nrespectively, of Federal R funds from 11 Federal agencies have been \nspecifically allocated to our Nation's small businesses to fund \ninnovation. These small business allocations are not sufficient. We \nmust diversify and strengthen innovation capabilities and our economic \nbase, and to accomplish this we must extend and increase R \nallocations to our Nation's innovative small businesses.\n  My bill does 3 things. First, it extends the SBIR and STTR programs \nfor a further 14 years so that small businesses, as well as \nuniversities and non-profit research organizations that collaborate \nwith small businesses, can continue to leverage Federal research and \ndevelopment funding.\n  Second, it significantly increases the allocation of funds and the \nawards from large Federal research and development budgets to small \nbusinesses through the SBIR and STTR programs. It would increase the \nSBIR allocation from its current 2.5 percent to 10 percent and the STTR \nallocation from 0.3 percent to 1.0 percent over a 3-year period. It \nwould increase SBIR phase I awards from $100,000 to $300,000 and phase \nII awards from $750,000 to $2.2 million. Third, it identifies specific \nfunding priorities for energy innovation; safe and secure water; \ndomestic security; and transportation.\n  The SBIR program is tested, successful and worthy of extension. In \nits comprehensive study of the SBIR program, the National Research \nCouncil found that the program ``is sound in concept and effective in \npractice''; was ``stimulating technological innovation''; ``linking \nuniversities to the public and private markets''; ``increasing private \nsector commercialization of innovations'' at an ``impressive'' rate; \nand ``providing widely distributed support for innovation activity.'' \nThe study concluded that:\n\n     [T]he program is proving effective in meeting Congressional \n     objectives. It is increasing innovation, encouraging \n     participation by small companies in R, providing support \n     for small firms owned by minorities and women, and resolving \n     research questions for mission agencies in a cost effective \n     manner. Should the Congress wish to provide additional funds \n     for the program in support of these objectives, those funds \n     could be employed effectively by the nation's SBIR.\n\n  The NRC's study also found that universities and other non-profit \nresearch institutions would benefit significantly from the increase in \nboth the SBIR and the STTR programs. In particular, the STTR allocation \nincrease will directly benefit universities and efforts to bring \nuniversity-based research into the commercial marketplace, as a \npartnership with a non-profit research institution, such as a \nuniversity, is a requirement of all STTR award recipients. Many of the \nsmall businesses that receive SBIR funding are rooted in the university \ninfrastructure so investigators and graduates from universities will \nhave opportunities to be part of commercial developments. More than \ntwo-thirds of SBIR companies report that at least one founder was \npreviously an academic. About one-third of SBIR company founders were \nmost recently employed as academics before founding the company. Over a \nthird of SBIR projects cite direct university involvement with 27 \npercent of projects having university faculty as contractors on the \nproject, 17 percent using universities themselves as subcontractors, \nand 15 percent employing graduate students.\n  In its report accompanying reauthorization legislation, the Senate \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship Committee recently concluded that:\n\n     increases in the SBIR allocation will invest money in \n     research, contracting, internships, and other collaborative \n     activities done with universities, with the contracting and \n     patenting activities with SBIR companies being a sizable \n     source of revenue for universities as well. The university-\n     industry partnerships that SBIR creates are crucial in that \n     they provide an applied research and commercialization focus \n     that otherwise likely would not be present in university \n     research. More specifically, the partnerships are important \n     in exposing faculty and the next generation of scientists and \n     engineers to commercial research and development. SBIR \n     businesses provide graduate and undergraduate students with \n     hands-on experience and job opportunities that universities \n     would be unable to provide alone.\n\n  Our country not only faces immediate economic and employment \nchallenges, it faces major challenges in transportation, energy, \ndomestic security and water quality and safety. Targeted research and \ndevelopment will be critical. Congress, with non-partisan expert \nguidance, has a role to play in guiding our national research and \ndevelopment priorities and, in this case, stimulating small business \ninnovation and job creation in specific areas of critical national \nneed. The National Academies of Science and other independent \ngovernment research organizations provide us with carefully researched \nand considered recommendations on how we can address these priorities, \nso my bill draws on their recommendations to develop innovative energy \ntechnologies; enhance water quality and security; strengthen domestic \nsecurity; and address transportation priorities. This is not only a \ngood investment in short term job creation; it is an imperative \ninvestment in our Nation's long term innovation prospects and economic \ndevelopment.\n  The costs of my bill would be fully offset by cancellation of the \nairborne laser program. CBO estimates that cancelling that program will \nproduce savings of over $2.6 billion.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 178. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 to authorize a connecting education and emerging professions \ndemonstration grant program; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as the 111th Congress begins, I am \nreintroducing a number of different bills designed to fuel job creation \nand spur economic development. My initiative, dubbed E4 because of its \nfocus on economy, employment, education, and energy, seeks to respond \nto economic and job development needs both in my State of Wisconsin and \naround the country. These challenging economic times call for a \ncomprehensive set of solutions including providing new job training \nopportunities for workers, fostering innovation among small businesses, \nprotecting the existing family-supporting jobs in our nation, and \nboosting educational opportunities for young Americans. Today I am \nintroducing the Connecting Education and Emerging Professions Act of \n2009, which provides competitive grants to States and local school \ndistricts to promote better collaboration between high schools and \nlocal businesses and workforce development groups. This E4 education \ninitiative is designed to help prepare America's students for future \nsuccess in the workforce and post-secondary education as well as \nenhance America's competitiveness in the global economy as we prepare \nto enter the second decade of the twenty-first century.\n  Helping to ensure that all American students have access to a high-\nquality education is critical to boosting America's competitiveness and \nhelping to ensure that our country is better equipped to respond to the \neconomic challenges currently before us. Investment in our young people \nnow will pay off in the future when these individuals are better \nprepared to compete for the highly skilled jobs of tomorrow. If the \nUnited States is to remain competitive on an international stage and \ncontinue to lead the world in innovation and development, we need to \nmake certain that our young people are well prepared to meet current \nand future economic challenges.\n  Improving educational opportunities in the United States is going to \nrequire\n\n[[Page S223]]\n\na comprehensive set of policy strategies and I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues in Congress this year as we get to work on a variety \nof education issues including expanding access to education from pre-K \nthrough college. We also face the monumental task of reauthorizing and \nreforming the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, ESEA, better \nknown as No Child Left Behind, NCLB. As we consider the ESEA \nreauthorization, we should make substantial changes to the testing \nmandates that were imposed through NCLB and provide support to states \nthat develop smarter accountability systems with enhanced assessments \nthat measure higher-order thinking skills among students. We also need \nto look at ways to strengthen and reform our Nation's public secondary \nschools as part of the ESEA reauthorization. The legislation I am \nintroducing today is designed to help support innovative changes that \nare taking place in some of our Nation's high schools and help even \nmore States and local communities make improvements to their local high \nschools.\n  My CEEP bill seeks to address a couple of interrelated issues related \nto secondary education. The first issue is the alarmingly high dropout \nrate in our nation's high schools. While numbers vary slightly, a \ngrowing body of research indicates that the United States has a \ngraduation rate of approximately 70 percent and that about one-third of \nour country's high school students will not graduate on time. \nGraduation rates for minority and low-income students are even lower, \nin many cases, alarmingly lower. In addition, many of our nation's \nurban school districts report very high dropout rates, including the \nMilwaukee Public School District. According to the Cities in Crisis \nreport released in 2008 by the Editorial Projects in Education Research \nCenter, the Milwaukee Public Schools has a graduation rate of 46.1 \npercent. Unfortunately, there are at least a dozen large urban \ndistricts that have even lower graduation rates than Milwaukee.\n  One of our top education priorities as a Nation must be to address \nthe low graduation rates nationwide in urban, suburban, and rural \nschool districts. We must also work to close the huge opportunity gap \nthat is created by the large disparity in graduation rates between our \nminority and non-minority students as well as between low-income and \nmore affluent students. Solving this problem will require a broad, \ncomprehensive solution involving the federal, state and local \ngovernments. It is my hope that when Congress finally reauthorizes the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, we pay particular attention to \nthe needs of our nation's high schools and our students.\n  While many factors contribute to high dropout rates, disengagement \nfrom classroom instruction can contribute to a student's decision to \ndrop out. Some students feel that high school is not relevant to their \nlives and do not see how completing high school will translate into \nfuture career and academic success. In this increasingly competitive \ntwenty-first century where postsecondary education is now required for \nmany entry-level jobs, it is up to us to show our nation's students why \nit is so important that they graduate from high school.\n  Another issue that this bill seeks to address is the growing sense \namong employers and postsecondary institutions that our nation's high \nschool students who do graduate are unprepared for success either in \nthe workforce or in college. Employers in various economic sectors, \nincluding technology, manufacturing, health care, construction, and \nothers, report difficulty in identifying qualified candidates for \nskilled positions. Recent surveys also indicate that many employers are \ndissatisfied with the overall preparation of secondary school \ngraduates. In order for companies in the United States to be \ncompetitive in a global economy, we must have a highly skilled \nworkforce. Adequate preparation at the high school level can help \nprepare students for entry into our rapidly changing global economy \nwhere new emerging industries are cropping up in Wisconsin and around \nthe country.\n\n  To address these two interrelated issues, my bill would provide 5-\nyear competitive education grants to states and school districts to \nfoster collaboration and discussions between schools, businesses, and \nothers about the emerging industry workforce needs and how to prepare \nour high school students to meet those needs, both academically and \npractically. States and local school districts must use this money to \nform partnerships with local or regional businesses, postsecondary \ninstitutions, workforce development boards, labor organizations, \nnonprofit organizations and others.\n  These partnerships will have the responsibility of surveying local, \nregional, and statewide emerging industries and deciding what are the \nacademic and work-based skills that our high school students need in \norder to be successful in these emerging industries. The partnerships \nwill then work together to develop new and engaging curriculums and \nprograms designed to teach the academic and work-based skills that are \nnecessary to succeed in these new emerging industries. Once the \npartnership has designed a curriculum or program and received approval \nfrom the Federal Department of Education, the partnership will work to \nimplement the program in qualifying schools.\n  During the implementation phase, the partnership will come together \nto implement hands-on learning and work opportunities for students \nincluding internships, apprenticeships, job shadowing, and other career \nand technical education programs. These hands-on learning and work \nopportunities will be based on the emerging industry pathways \ncurriculum or program that the eligible partnership has designed and \nwill offer students practical academic experiences and skill-building \nlessons that they can use in the workplace or in postsecondary \neducation.\n  This legislation seeks to help schools, businesses, colleges, and the \nstudents who would be served by this legislation talk with each other \nto build new programs that would help boost student engagement in \nlearning and student attendance and graduation rates while also \npreparing students for success in the workforce or in college after \nthey graduate. There are a number of successful local and state \nprograms around Wisconsin that this legislation would help support and \nthat served as valuable examples as I developed this legislation.\n  Wisconsin's Department of Public Instruction, Department of Workforce \nDevelopment, and various local school districts have all been working \nto boost Wisconsin's career and technical education offerings and gear \nthese offerings towards emerging industries. My bill seeks to help \nWisconsin and other states build on these efforts and engage in \nadditional conversations with interested stakeholders to design new \ncurriculums and programs to prepare students for emerging industries.\n  I look forward to moving this legislation forward this year as the \nnew Congress begins to debate how best to boost educational \nopportunities for all of our Nation's children. We have a significant \nachievement gap and graduation gap in urban, rural, and suburban \nschools throughout the country and it is imperative that we work \ntogether to promote innovative ideas that will close these gaps. Some \nof our Nation's schools are experiencing high dropout rates in part \nbecause students aren't connecting with what they are being taught. At \nthe same time, we're seeing an emergence of new industries, like those \naiming to capitalize on alternative energies and energy efficiency, \nthat need employers with skills and training in their field. If we help \nschools connect their students with businesses, workforce development \nboards, and colleges that offer career and academic opportunities in \nthese new and exciting fields, we can help to lower the alarming \ndropout rates while helping these emerging industries thrive.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 178\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve quality in health care by providing \nincentives for adoption of modern information technology, to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I am very pleased to introduce the Health Information \nTechnology Act with my friend and colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe. \nAs co-chairs of the Senate Health Care Quality Improvement and \nInformation Technology Caucus, we have seen first-hand the \ntransformative power information technology has on the delivery of \nhealth care.\n  Our legislation is a substantial down-payment in building up our \nNation's health information network and an important step in reforming \nhealth care. In doing so, we will reduce costs for our businesses, \nimprove the quality of care for patients, and ensure health providers \nhave access to the most accurate information. And I am very excited \nthat President-elect Obama identified health IT as an important part of \ninvesting in our Nation's economy.\n  The result of using 19th century technology in a 21st century health \ncare system is higher costs, increased errors, and decreased quality of \ncare. Too often, care is duplicated or the best and most appropriate \ncare isn't given. Our health care professionals can't possibly provide \nthe best care if they don't have complete and accurate information \nabout the patient sitting in front of them.\n  Many studies have found that as much as $300 billion is spent each \nyear on health care that does not improve patient outcomes on treatment \nthat is unnecessary, inappropriate, inefficient, or ineffective. For \nexample, in last year's series of health reform hearings in the Senate \nFinance Committee, we heard testimony from Elizabeth McGlynn of the \nRAND Corporation that we only receive 55 percent of recommended \npreventive care services, 54 percent of recommended care for acute \nhealth problems, and 56 percent of the care that doctors agree is \nnecessary for people with chronic conditions when we seek medical \ntreatment.\n  It's long past time that we fully utilize technology to make health \ncare accessible and affordable for every family and business. However, \nmost of our Nation's health care providers don't have access to capital \nin order to purchase information technology and service updates. Too \nmany providers, especially our safety-net providers, are having a hard \nenough time just keeping up with their daily costs, much less to invest \nin something new.\n  A March 2001 Institute of Medicine study concluded that in order to \nimprove quality, there must be a national commitment to building an \ninformation infrastructure. An October 2003 Government Accountability \nOffice report found that the benefits of an electronic healthcare \ninformation system included improved quality of care, reduced costs \nassociated with medication errors, more accurate and complete medical \ndocumentation, more accurate capture of codes and charges, and improved \ncommunication among providers enabling them to respond more quickly to \npatients' needs.\n  By providing the most appropriate care at the most appropriate time \nin a safe, secure way, we can reap huge savings. A January 2005 Report \nby the Center for Information Technology Leadership found that moving \nto standardized health information exchange and interoperability would \nsave nearly $80 billion annually in the United States.\n  The benefits of adoption and use of health care information \ntechnologies, systems and services will be widespread: employers will \nrealize cost savings, clinicians will gain new electronic support tools \nand patient information to help guide medical decisions, and patients \nwill benefit from a more efficient health care system and from a safer \nhealth care system with fewer unnecessary treatments and more attention \nto preventive care.\n       We know that adoption of health information technology can \n     play a critical role in improving patient outcomes and at the \n     same time greatly reduce costs. But it can't happen without \n     the federal government playing a role. The members of the \n     Health Information Technology Leadership Panel concurred that \n     without federal leadership, neither their individual \n     companies nor the industrial sector as a whole can achieve \n     the breadth of HIT adoption that would be required to realize \n     the needed transformation of health care.\n  Our country must have a national commitment to building an \ninformation infrastructure, and the Federal Government needs to step up \nto the plate and provide much-needed funds to get the ball rolling. \nWithout health IT, we are not going to be able to accomplish other \nreforms necessary to improve our health care system. That is\n\n[[Page S227]]\n\nwhy I am fighting for funding similar to the legislation we are \nintroducing today, will be included in the economic recovery act we \nwill soon be debated.\n  The sooner we get them into our hospitals, physician offices, nursing \nhomes, community health centers, community mental health centers, and \nother health care providers, the sooner our patients, providers, and \npocketbooks will see the rewards.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I join my colleague, Senator Stabenow \nof Michigan, to introduce the Health Information Technology Act of 2009 \nto improve the quality of health care through the implementation of \ninformation technology, IT, in hospitals, health centers and physician \npractices throughout the country. Our legislation will help us address \ntwo critical issues.\n  The first is the serious patient safety problem facing our Nation. \nIndeed, if most Americans were told today that 98,000 lives were lost \nneedlessly last year--and a cure was available--they would undoubtedly \ncall for action. Yet the Institute of Medicine, IOM, has reported that \nmedical errors inflict that terrible toll every year, even though the \ntechnology is at our disposal to dramatically reduce those deaths.\n  A second major problem is the escalating cost of health care. Health \nspending now comprises over 16 percent of GNP--$2.2 trillion last \nyear--and the price of a health plan has grown so high that 70 million \nAmericans today are either underinsured or lack any coverage \nwhatsoever. That group expands as unemployment rates increase and \nindividuals and families lose health insurance tied to employment. A \nrecent Urban Institute study found that for each 1 percentage point \nincrease in unemployment 1 million Americans are added to the rolls of \nthe uninsured. However, simply expanding government subsidies or \nentitlements alone is not the answer, because on our current \ntrajectory, escalating costs will erode our ability to maintain such \nsupports. It is clear that some fundamental changes must be made in \nhealth care to combat rising health care costs.\n  Bold changes and innovations are necessary to address both medical \nerrors and escalating costs. One of those changes must be the \napplication of modern data technology. Most of us have been told at one \ntime or another, ``we're waiting to get the test results mailed'' or \n``we're still waiting for your chart.'' Consider the savings we realize \nwhen a physician can locate information efficiently so that tests don't \nhave to be repeated and data isn't delayed. A patient obtains faster, \nhigher quality care when multiple practitioners can review diagnostic \ntest results right at their desktops. The fact is the health care \nindustry is one of the last sectors where information flows so slowly. \nIndeed, it is often easier to track the service history on one's \nautomobile than to see your own health history. In an age where \nmillions of Americans share family pictures over the Internet in \nseconds, isn't it long past time that a physician should be able to \nretrieve an x-ray just as easily?\n  Today, the technological tools are at hand to dramatically reduce \nmedical errors and save lives. Many of us have heard about how drug \ninteractions can be avoided by software systems which check a patient's \nprescriptions for hazards, and there are so many other applications \nwhich can also improve health. For example, by reviewing and analyzing \ninformation, a health provider can help a patient better manage chronic \ndiseases such as diabetes and heart disease to reduce avoidable adverse \noutcomes. The unfortunate reality is that the cost of new systems and a \nlack of standards have prevented us from reaping the benefits of new \ntechnologies.\n  While the current economic crisis has surely put a focus on \naddressing the inefficiencies and high costs of health care, I have \nlong shared a determination to modernize health information with my \ncolleagues. In 2003, I joined with Senator Bob Graham to introduce the \n``Medication Errors Reduction Act of 2003'' to make grants of up to \n$750,000 available to hospitals and nursing facilities to aid in \nimplementation of health IT infrastructure. In 2005, Senator Stabenow \nand I offered our bill to create a $4 billion competitive grant program \nand tax incentives to enable hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, \ncommunity health centers and physicians to invest in health IT.\n  The President-elect shares our recognition of the critical role which \ninformation technology must play in transforming health care. In his \ncampaign, he acknowledged the critical need to make technology \nimplementation a priority.\n  A lack of standards to ensure interoperability has been a factor in \nslowing IT adoption by many health care providers. One must know that a \nsystem purchased will be compatible with others, and that--no matter \nwhat may happen in the future to a vendor--the investment one makes in \nbuilding an electronic medical record won't be wasted. In other words, \nyour system must be able to communicate with other systems, and your \ninvestment in building electronic medical records must be preserved. \nWhen a patient moves, their electronic ``chart'' should be able to move \nright along with them to prevent disruption in the continuity of their \ncare--in other words ``we must have interoperability.''\n  Yet standards alone are not sufficient, as there are fiscal hurdles \nto implementing health IT. Today, many providers are struggling to \nadopt new technology, and for those who serve beneficiaries of \nMedicare, Medicaid and SCHIP, it can be exceedingly difficult. Our \nphysicians, for example, have seen recent Medicare payment updates \nwhich have not even kept pace with inflation--even as we expect them to \nmake a major investment in health IT.\n  We must also recognize there is a misalignment of fiscal incentives \nfor health IT. The benefits to patients are evident--in fewer delays, \nin better outcomes, in lives saved. Modern information technology \nreduces costs as well, but primarily to those who pay for services--not \nfor the healthcare providers who must bear the burden of \nimplementation. Indeed, it has been estimated that 89 percent of cost \nsavings accrue to those who pay for services. It should be obvious then \nthat the federal government would invest in health IT to both improve \nhealth outcomes and to reduce its expenditures on Medicare, Medicaid \nand SCHIP.\n  That is precisely the type of investment the Health Information \nTechnology Act of 2009 would achieve. Because as we look to the many \nstudies and reports on health IT, it is clear that annual cost savings \ncan actually exceed the price of implementation. With that kind of \nreturn, it is indisputable that the federal government must employ \nhealth IT to see not only the savings in lives, but also better \nmanagement of our health care spending.\n  Our legislation spurs adoption by providing grants to physicians, \nhospitals, long term care facilities and both federally-qualified \nhealth centers and community mental health centers. These grants are \ntargeted to help provide the health IT resources providers need to \nserve our federal beneficiaries. In fact, the size of an allowable \ngrant for each provider is keyed to the proportion of the patient care \nwhich they deliver to federal beneficiaries. This will help providers \ndeliver better care to those on Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP while we \nalso see costs reduced in those programs. That is simple common sense.\n  The legislation supports reasonable expenditures for a variety of \ncosts required to implement health care information technology. These \ninclude such components as computer hardware and software in \ncombination with installation and training. In addition for a system to \nbe suitable for support under this legislation, we require that it must \nmeet the HHS Secretary's interoperability standards.\n  Our new legislation even provides an alternative to those for-profit \nproviders who do not wish to apply for a grant. Under this bill, such \nproviders will be able to expense the cost of a qualified system. We \nwill thus assure that every type of provider has a meaningful \nopportunity to invest in moving their health care practice into the new \nmillennium. With the development of a 21st century health technology \nsystem, we will ensure that providers have the appropriate tools to \neffectively provide the best quality health care at reasonable cost.\n  As the current Congress struggles with matters related to the ailing \neconomy, many Americans are finding it exceedingly difficult to access \nhealth care which they find to be both expensive and inefficient. While \nit is clear\n\n[[Page S228]]\n\nthat health IT alone will not reduce all excessive costs or address \nevery inefficiency, one must understand that the only way to achieve \neither goal is to have access to the type of coordinated information \nthat a fully integrated health care system would provide. In fact, the \ninformation we will obtain through health IT is essential to achieve \nsuch goals as improving quality and reforming provider payment. This is \nthe foundation for our work on health reform.\n  When the Medicare and Medicaid programs began, we could have only \ndreamed about computerized clinical information systems. Today, we have \nthis technology at our disposal, and I strongly believe that we cannot \nafford to delay implementation. In fact, as we face challenges in the \nfinancing of these vital federal programs, this is exactly the sort of \ninitiative which will enable us to achieve the fundamental improvements \nto make our health entitlements more fiscally secure.\n  I hope my colleagues will join us in support of this legislation so \nwe may soon achieve the goals of improving patient safety and reducing \nour escalating health care costs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Leahy, \n        Mr. Reid, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Reed, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Brown, Mr. Byrd, Mr. \n        Inouye, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Kohl, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Akaka, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Dorgan, Mrs. Boxer, \n        Mr. Feingold, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Johnson, Ms. Landrieu, \n        Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Carper, Ms. Stabenow, Ms. \n        Cantwell, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Salazar, \n        Mr. Menendez, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Webb, Mr. Casey, Ms. Klobuchar, \n        Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Tester, Mr. Udall of \n        Colorado, Mr. Udall of New Mexico, Mr. Warner, Mrs. Shaheen, \n        Mr. Merkley, Mrs. Hagan, Mr. Begich, and Mr. Pryor):\n  S. 181. A bill to amend title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and \nthe Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, and to modify the \noperation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973, to clarify that a discriminatory \ncompensation decision or other practice that is unlawful under such \nActs occurs each time compensation is paid pursuant to the \ndiscriminatory compensation decision or other practice, and for other \npurposes; read the first time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I'm proud to join Senator Mikulski in \nintroducing this legislation. Equal pay for equal work is a fundamental \ncivil right. Over the past 4 decades, America has made enormous \nprogress toward ensuring that all its people have an equal chance to \nenjoy the benefits of this great Nation. Bipartisan civil rights bills \nhave been enacted to expand and strengthen the law to ensure fair pay \nfor all workers. Despite these advances, civil rights is still \nAmerica's unfinished business. It is therefore fitting that we open the \n111th Congress with introduction of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.\n  This bill will restore the basic right of all workers, regardless of \ntheir race, sex, religion, national origin, age, or disability, to be \npaid fairly, free from discrimination. It will restore workers' rights \nto challenge ongoing discrimination and hold unscrupulous employers \naccountable.\n  This legislation is needed because the Supreme Court turned back our \nNation's progress on equal pay with its Ledbetter decision, which \nundermined a core protection of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of \n1964 and overturned decades of precedent that had established a fair, \nworkable rule for challenging pay discrimination claims.\n  This needed bill will restore the long-standing rule that each \ndiscriminatory paycheck is a separate wrong that may be challenged by \nworkers within the required period after receiving the check. In the \nLedbetter case, a jury had found that Lilly Ledbetter was paid less \nthan her male coworkers because she was a woman. The jury awarded back \npay to Ms. Ledbetter, but the Supreme Court reversed that award, \nholding that she had waited too long and should have filed her lawsuit \nwithin a short time after Goodyear first began discriminating against \nher. Never mind that the company discriminated against her for decades, \nand that the discrimination continued with each new paycheck she \nreceived.\n  Far too often, workers like Lilly Ledbetter put in a fair day's work, \nbut go home with less than a fair day's pay. Women, African-American, \nand Latino workers all earn a fraction of what white male workers make. \nMany qualified older workers and workers with disabilities also are \npaid less than their coworkers for reasons unrelated to their \nperformance on the job.\n  It's more important than ever that we attack the problem of pay \ndiscrimination and correct the injustice caused by the Ledbetter \ndecision. In the current economic crisis, millions of American workers \nare struggling to make ends meet. Pay discrimination makes that \nstruggle harder, and workers can't afford to lose more economic ground. \nTo protect these workers, we must move quickly to pass the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act.\n  I urge my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats alike, to do so, and \nto send a strong signal that this new Congress is dedicated to standing \nup for fairness and equality in the workplace. The Lilly Ledbetters of \nour Nation deserve no less.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Mikulski, \nKennedy, Snowe and others in introducing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \nRestoration Act of 2009. This legislation is long overdue and I am \npleased that the majority leader will try again to move this \nlegislation in the opening days of this new Congress. The Supreme \nCourt's divided decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire struck a severe \nblow to the rights of working families across our country. More than 40 \nyears ago, Congress acted to protect women and others against \ndiscrimination in the workplace. In the 21st century, equal pay for \nequal work should be a given in this country. Unfortunately, the \nreality is still far from this basic principle. American women still \nearn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by a male counterpart. That \ndecreases to 62 cents on the dollar for African-American women and just \n53 cents on the dollar for Hispanic-American women.\n  For nearly 20 years, Ms. Ledbetter was a manager at a Goodyear \nfactory in Gadsden, Alabama. After decades of service, she learned \nthrough an anonymous note that her employer had been discriminating \nagainst her for years. She was the only woman among 16 employees at her \nmanagement level, yet Ms. Ledbetter was paid between 15 and 40 percent \nless than all of her male colleagues, including several who had \nsignificantly less seniority. After filing a complaint with the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission, a Federal jury found that Ms. \nLedbetter was owed almost $225,000 in back pay. However, 5 members of \nthe Supreme Court overturned her jury verdict because she had filed her \nlawsuit more than 180 days after her employer's original discriminatory \nact.\n  I was honored to invite Ms. Ledbetter to testify at a Judiciary \nCommittee hearing I chaired in September to examine how the Supreme \nCourt's recent decisions have affected the lives of ordinary Americans. \nMs. Ledbetter's case is but one example of how the Supreme Court has \ndramatically misinterpreted the intent of Congress and offered a \nliability shield to corporate wrong-doers.\n  This decision is yet another example of the Supreme Court's \nincreasing willingness to overturn juries who hear the factual evidence \nand decide cases. A recent study revealed that in employment \ndiscrimination cases, Federal courts of appeal are 5 times more likely \nto overturn an employee's favorable trial verdict against an employer \nthan they are to overturn a verdict in favor of the corporation. That \nis a startling disparity for those of us who expect employees and \nemployers to be treated fairly by the judges sitting on our appellate \ncourts.\n  In the 110th Congress, the House passed the bipartisan Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act by a vote of 225-199. In the Senate, despite the \nsupport of 57 Senators who urged its consideration, the majority of \nRepublican Senators objected to even proceeding to consideration of \nthis bipartisan measure. One\n\n[[Page S229]]\n\nRepublican Senator who supported the filibuster introduced an \nalternative bill, claiming to offer a solution for victims of pay \ndiscrimination. In reality, that partisan alternative proposal would \nfail to correct the injustice created by the Ledbetter decision. At the \nJudiciary Committee hearing in September, Ms. Ledbetter confirmed that \nthe alternative bill would not have remedied her case, but instead \nwould have imposed additional burdens and increased the costs of her \nlitigation.\n  Congress passed Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to protect \nemployees against discrimination with respect to compensation because \nof an individual's race, color, religion, sex or national origin--\nhowever the Supreme Court's cramped interpretation of this important \nlaw contradicts Congress's intent to ensure equal pay for equal work.\n  This Supreme Court decision goes against both the spirit and clear \nintent of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, and sends the message to \nemployers that wage discrimination cannot be punished as long as it is \nkept under wraps. At a time when one-third of private sector employers \nhave rules prohibiting employees from discussing their pay with each \nother, the Court's decision ignores a reality of the workplace--pay \ndiscrimination is often intentionally concealed by employers.\n  Equal pay is not just a women's issue, it is a family issue. With a \nrecord 70.2 million women in the workforce, wage discrimination \ncontinues to hurt the majority of American families. As a working \nmother, the discrimination inflicted on Ms. Ledbetter affected her \nentire family and continues to affect her retirement benefits. As the \neconomy continues to worsen, many Americans are struggling to put food \non the table and money in their retirement funds. It is regrettable \nthat recent decisions handed down by the Supreme Court and Federal \nappellate courts have contributed to the financial struggles of so many \nwomen and their families. In the next weeks, I hope we can act to \noverturn the wrongly-decided Ledbetter decision to prevent the \ndevastating consequences of pay discrimination.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of Colorado (for himself and Mr. Salazar:\n  S. 187. A bill to provide for the construction of the Arkansas Valley \nConduit in the State of Colorado; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I am introducing four \nbills, S. 187, S. 188, S. 189, S. 190, that will preserve and protect \nmajestic public landscapes in Colorado and help provide needed water \nsupplies to communities and farmers on Colorado's productive Eastern \nPlains. These bills were introduced in the last session of Congress, \nwhere they each had hearings and one passed the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. I hope that we can work together to move these bills \nin this Congress and see them signed into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of all four bills be included \nin the Record and be printed alongside these remarks.\n  The first bill is the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act of 2009. This bill \nwill help protect the water supply for the Arkansas River Valley's \ncommunities and its productive agricultural lands by advancing the \nconstruction of the long-planned Arkansas Valley Conduit. The bill will \nrestructure the cost-share provisions of the project and is similar to \nlegislation introduced in the last Congress by Senators Wayne Allard \nand Ken Salazar and introduced yesterday in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives by Reps. John Salazar and Betsy Markey. \n  The Arkansas Valley Conduit, a proposed 130-mile water delivery \nsystem from the Pueblo Dam to communities throughout the Arkansas River \nValley, was originally authorized in 1962 as part of the Fryingpan-\nArkansas, Fry-Ark, project. Unfortunately, the authorization did not \ninclude a Federal-local cost-share provision necessary to cover the \nestimated $300 million in construction costs, and local communities--\nespecially those in southern Colorado--do not have the resources to \nshoulder all of the costs. The project has thus remained unfinished for \nover 4 years.\n  The bill will provide for a 65-35 Federal-local cost-share for \ncompletion of the project, with revenues from so-called ``excess-\ncapacity'' contracts for water storage in other Fry-Ark project \nfacilities being used to fund the majority of the local contribution. \nThis approach is the result of close collaboration between community \nstakeholders and the Colorado congressional delegation and will ensure \ncommunities in the Arkansas River Valley can finance their portion of \nthe project without incurring unbearable financial burdens.\n  Moreover, the bill will allow the Bureau of Reclamation to move \nforward with the construction of the Conduit. The depressed economic \nstatus of southeastern Colorado made it a difficult financial \nundertaking for the region, a challenge that continues today. This bill \nwill help see this facility become a reality and thereby help the \nfarming and ranching communities in the valley continue to produce \nneeded food and fiber for the state and Nation.\n  The second bill I am introducing today is the Colorado Northern Front \nRange Mountain Backdrop Protection Study Act. I introduced similar \nbills in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 107th, 108th, 109th \nand 110th Congresses. In previous Congresses, the bill passed the House \nand the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee but did not \nreceive final action.\n  The bill is intended to help local communities identify ways to \nprotect the Front Range Mountain Backdrop in the northern Denver-metro \narea and the region just west of Rocky Flats. The Arapaho-Roosevelt \nNational Forest includes much of the land in this backdrop area, but \nthere are other lands involved as well.\n  Rising dramatically from the Great Plains, the Front Range of the \nRocky Mountains provides a scenic mountain backdrop to many communities \nin the Denver metropolitan area and elsewhere in Colorado. The portion \nof the range within and adjacent to the Arapaho-Roosevelt National \nForest also includes a diverse array of wildlife habitats and provides \nmany opportunities for outdoor recreation. The open-space character of \nthis mountain backdrop is an important aesthetic and economic asset for \nadjoining communities, making them attractive locations for homes and \nbusinesses. But rapid population growth in the northern Front Range \narea of Colorado is increasing recreational use of the Arapaho-\nRoosevelt National Forest and is also increasing pressure for \ndevelopment of other lands within and adjacent to that national forest.\n  We can see the effects of rapid population growth throughout Colorado \nand especially along the Front Range. Homes and shopping centers are \nsprawling through valleys and along highways that feed into the Front \nRange. This development then spreads out along the ridges and \nmountaintops that make up the backdrop. We are in danger of losing to \ndevelopment many of the qualities that have helped attract new \nresidents to Colorado. So, it is important to better understand what \nsteps might be taken to avoid or lessen that risk--and this bill is \ndesigned to help us do just that.\n  Already, local governments and other entities have provided important \nprotection for portions of this mountain backdrop, especially in the \nnorthern Denver-metro area. However, some portions of the backdrop in \nthis part of Colorado remain unprotected and are at risk of losing \ntheir open-space qualities. This bill acknowledges the good work of the \nlocal communities in preserving open space along the backdrop and aims \nto assist further efforts along the same lines.\n  The bill directs the U.S. Forest Service to study the ownership \npatterns of the lands comprising the Front Range mountain backdrop, \nidentify areas that are at risk, and recommend to Congress how these \nlands might be protected and how the Federal Government could help \nlocal communities and residents to achieve that goal. Importantly, I \nnote that the bill does not interfere with the power of local \nauthorities regarding land use planning or infringe on private property \nrights. Instead, it will bring the land protection experience of the \nForest Service\n\n[[Page S230]]\n\nto the table to assist local efforts to protect areas that comprise the \nbackdrop. The bill envisions that to the extent the Forest Service \nshould be involved with Federal lands, it will work in collaboration \nwith local communities, the state and private parties.\n\n  I strongly believe it is in the national interest for the Federal \nGovernment to assist local communities to identify ways to protect the \nmounatin backdrop in this part of Colorado. The backdrop beckoned \nsettlers westward and presented an imposing impediment to their forward \nprogress that suggested similar challenges ahead. This first exposure \nto the harshness and humbling majesty of the Rocky Mountain West helped \ndefine a region. The pioneers' independent spirit and respect for \nnature still lives with us to this day. We need to work to preserve it \nby protecting the mountain backdrop as a cultural and natural heritage \nfor ourselves and generations to come.\n  The third bill I am introducing today--the National Trails System \nWilling Seller Act--will allow people who want to sell land for \ninclusion in certain units of the National Trails System to do so. \nCurrent law prohibits people who own land associated with several units \nof the trail system from selling those lands to the Federal Government \nfor inclusion in those units. This bill will allow such sales to \nhappen.\n  This legislation is identical to bills introduced in previous \nCongresses by my former Republican colleagues from Colorado, \nRepresentatives Beauprez and McInnis. The Trail System units covered by \nthe bill are the Oregon National Historic Trail, the Mormon Pioneer \nNational Historic Trail, the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail, \nthe Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail, the Iditarod National \nHistoric Trail, the North County National Scenic Trail, the Ice Age \nNational Scenic Trail, the Potomac Heritage National Scenic Trail, and \nthe Nez Perce National Historic Trail.\n  Our national trails are a national treasure, and we should allow \npeople who own land along these trails to sell that land to the Federal \nGovernment to be part of our public lands legacy. But it is important \nto make clear that these land sales are from willing sellers, which is \nwhat this bill will do. This bill makes a small but important \nadjustment to current law, and I think it deserves the support of all \nMembers of the Senate.\n  The final bill I am introducing today is the Rocky Mountain National \nPark Wilderness and Indian Peaks Wilderness Expansion Act, which will \ndesignate nearly 250,000 acres of Rocky Mountain National Park as \nwilderness. I introduced this bill in the 110th Congress as a member of \nthe House of Representatives. It was cosponsored in the Senate by my \ncolleague Senator Ken Salazar, and eventually by the Colorado \nCongressional delegation. Over a period of months, we worked together \nto develop this bipartisan legislation that will provide important \nprotection and management direction for some truly remarkable country. \nThis is a public lands policy goal that goes back to the 1960s, and is \nlong overdue.\n  This bill is consistent with the Colorado Congressional delegation's \nefforts in the last Congress to strike a balance in protecting the park \nand the water users who rely on the Grand River Ditch. This carefully \nnegotiated language met the needs of those users, but questions have \nbeen raised about the particular way that liability and water use \nissues were addressed in the delegation bill. Specifically, there have \nbeen questions about how these provisions work in the context of the \nPark Resources Protection Act. While I am confident that my bill \naddresses these liability concerns, I appreciate the recent efforts by \nSenator Salazar to offer a slightly different approach that provides a \npath to a widely-shared goal that has broad support in Colorado.\n  The wilderness designation in this bill for the park will cover some \n94 percent of the park, including Longs Peaks and other major mountains \nalong the Great Continental Divide, glacial cirques and snow fields, \nbroad expanses of alpine tundra and wet meadows, old-growth forests, \nand hundreds of lakes and streams, all untrammeled by human structures \nor passage. Indeed, examples of all the natural ecosystems that make up \nthe splendor of the park are included in the wilderness that will be \ndesignated by this bill. At the same time, the wilderness boundaries \nhave been drawn so as to allow continued access for use of existing \nroadways, buildings and developed areas, privately owned land, and \nareas where additional facilities and roadwork will improve park \nmanagement and visitor services. In addition, specific provisions are \nincluded to ensure that there will be no adverse effects on continued \nuse of existing water facilities.\n  The lands designated as wilderness will become part of the National \nWilderness Preservation System that was established by the Wilderness \nAct and will be managed in accordance with that Act and the provisions \nof the bill. The bill's provisions amplify this by specifying that--no \nnew reclamation projects will be allowed in the wilderness area; \nnothing in the bill will create a ``buffer zone'' around the wilderness \nand non-wilderness activities visible or audible from within the \nwilderness will not be prohibited; the National Park Service can act to \ncontrol fire, insects, and diseases, including use of mechanical tools \nwithin the wilderness; and nothing in the bill will reduce or restrict \nthe current authority of the National Park Service to manage the Park's \nlands and resources.\n  The bill is similar to measures previously introduced by my \npredecessor in the House of Representatives, Representative David \nSkaggs, as well as other bills introduced before that, and legislation \nI introduced in the 107th, 108th, and 109th Congresses. However, it \ndoes include a number of adjustments and refinements that reflect \ndiscussion within the Colorado delegation in Congress and with \ninterested parties in Colorado.\n  Like H.R. 2334 of the 110th Congress, the new bill includes \nwilderness designation of more than 700 acres in the Twin Sisters area \nsouth of Estes Park. These lands were acquired by the United States and \nmade part of the park after submission to Congress of the original \nwilderness recommendation for the park in the 1970s, and so were \nnot included in that recommendation. They are lands of a wilderness \ncharacter, and their designation will not conflict with any current \nuses. On the west side, the town of Grand Lake and Grand County \nrequested that about 650 acres inward from the park boundary around the \ntown be omitted from the wilderness designation in order to allow the \npark to respond to potential forest fire threats. As was the case \npreviously, this bill accommodates that request.\n\n  Also like that previous measure, the bill responds to the request of \nthe Town of Grand Lake, Grand County and the Headwaters Trails \nAlliance, a group composed of local communities in Grand County that \nseeks to establish opportunities for mountain biking, and the \nInternational Mountain Bicycling Association to omit from wilderness \ndesignation an area along the western park boundary, running south \nalong Lake Granby from the town to the park's southern boundary. This \nwill allow the National Park Service to retain the option of \nauthorizing construction of a possible future mountain bike route \nwithin this part of the park. Similarly, the bill expands the Indian \nPeaks Wilderness Area by 1,000 acres in the area south of the park and \nnorth of Lake Granby. The lands involved are currently managed as part \nof the Arapaho National Recreation Area, which is accordingly reduced \nby about 1,000 acres.\n  As did the previous bill, this bill includes a section that \nauthorizes the National Park Service to lease an 11-acre property, the \nLeiffer tract, that was donated to the National Park Service in 1977. \nLocated outside the park's boundaries, it has two buildings, including \na house that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The \nPark Service would like to have the option of leasing it, but current \nlaw allows leasing only for ``property administered . . . as part of \nthe National Park System,'' and this property does not qualify. The \nbill allows the Park Service to lease the property as if it were \nlocated inside or contiguous to the park.\n  Also like previous measures, the bill addresses the question of \npossible impacts on water rights--something that can be a primary point \nof contention in Congressional debates over designating wilderness \nareas. It reflects the legal\n\n[[Page S231]]\n\nreality that it has long been recognized under the laws of the United \nStates and Colorado, including a decision of the Colorado Supreme \nCourt, that Rocky Mountain National Park already has extensive Federal \nreserved water rights arising from the creation of the national park \nitself. And it reflects the geographic reality that the park sits \nastride the continental divide, meaning there is no higher land around \nfrom which streams flow into the park, and thus there is no possibility \nof any diversion of water occurring upstream from the park. In \nrecognition of these legal and practical realities, the bill includes a \nfinding that because the park already has these extensive reserved \nrights to water, there is no need for any additional reservation or \nappropriation of such right, and an explicit disclaimer that the bill \neffects any such reservation.\n  As I mentioned, there are also provisions in this bill that deal with \nthe Grand River Ditch, created before Rocky Mountain National Park was \nestablished and partly located within the park. The owners of the ditch \nare currently working to conclude an agreement with the National Park \nService with respect to operation and maintenance of the portion of the \nditch within the park, and the bill provides that after conclusion of \nthis agreement the strict liability standard of the Park Resources \nProtection Act which now applies to any damage to park resources will \nnot apply so long as the ditch is operated and maintained in accordance \nwith the agreement. The owners of the ditch remain liable for damage to \npark resources caused by negligence or intentional acts, and the bill \nspecifies that it will not limit or otherwise affect the liability of \nany individual or entity for damages to, loss of, or injury to any park \nresource resulting from any cause of event occurring before the bill's \nenactment. In addition, the bill specifies that its enactment will not \nrestrict or otherwise affect any activity relating to the monitoring, \noperation, maintenance, repair, replacement, or use of the ditch that \nwas authorized or approved by the National Park Service as of the date \nof the bill's enactment. The bill also provides that use of water \ntransported by the ditch for a main purpose or main purposes other than \nirrigation will not terminate or adversely affect the ditch's right-of-\nway.\n  The matters dealt with in this bill have a long history. The \nwilderness designations are based on National Park Service \nrecommendations presented to Congress by President Richard Nixon. That \nthey have not been acted on before this reflects the difficult history \nof wilderness legislation. One Colorado statewide wilderness bill was \nenacted in 1980, but it took more than a decade before the Colorado \ndelegation and the Congress were finally able, in 1993, to pass a \nsecond statewide national forest wilderness bill. Since then, action \nhas been completed on bills designating wilderness in the Spanish Peaks \narea of the San Isabel National Forest as well as in the Black Canyon \nof the Gunnison National Park, the Gunnison Gorge, the Black Ridge \nportion of the Colorado Canyons National Conservation Area, and the \nJames Peak area of the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forests.\n  We now need to continue making progress by providing wilderness \ndesignations for other deserving lands in Colorado, including lands \nthat are managed by the Bureau of Land Management. And the time is ripe \nfor finally resolving the status of the lands within Rocky Mountain \nNational Park that are dealt with in this bill.\n  Lands covered by the bill are currently being managed to protect \ntheir wilderness character. Formal wilderness designation will no \nlonger leave this question to the discretion of the Park Service, but \nwill make it clear that within the designated areas, there will never \nbe roads, visitor facilities, or other manmade features that interfere \nwith the spectacular natural beauty and wildness of the mountains. This \nis especially important for a park like Rocky Mountain, which is \nrelatively small by western standards. As nearby land development and \nalteration has accelerated in recent years, the pristine nature of the \npark's backcountry becomes an increasingly rare feature of Colorado's \nlandscape. Further, the park's popularity demands definitive and \npermanent protection for wild areas against possible pressures for \ndevelopment within the park. While only about one tenth the size of \nYellowstone National Park, Rocky Mountain National Park sees nearly the \nsame number of visitors each year. At the same time, designating these \ncarefully selected portions of Rocky Mountain as wilderness will make \nother areas, now restricted under interim wilderness protection \nmanagement, available for overdue improvements to park roads and \nvisitor facilities.\n  In summary, the Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness and Indian \nPeaks Wilderness Expansion Act will protect some of our Nation's finest \nwild lands. It will protect existing rights. It will not limit any \nexisting opportunity for new water development. It is bipartisan and \nwill affirm the commitment of all Coloradans to preserving the features \nthat make our State such a remarkable place to live. So, I think it \ndeserves prompt enactment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of each bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bills was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 187\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 4. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States to abolish the electoral college and \nto provide for the direct popular election of the President and Vice \nPresident of the United States; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, earlier today, the Congress met \nin a joint session, as it does every 4 years in early January, to \nconduct the official count of the electoral ballots from the States. \nMost Americans pay no attention to this ritual, believing that \npresidential elections in this country get decided on Election Day. But \nit is the votes of the Electoral College, presented by each State to \nthe Congress, that determine who our next President and Vice President \nare going to be. We are the beacon of democracy in the world, and yet, \nvoters in this country do not have the opportunity to elect their \nleaders directly.\n  Today, I am introducing a constitutional amendment to abolish the \nElectoral College to allow direct election of the President by popular \nvote. If the principle of one person, one vote is to mean anything, it \nis that the candidate who wins a majority of the votes wins the \nPresidency, and votes for every candidate from every State should \ncount.\n  On only a few occasions in our history, the candidate who lost the \npopular vote won the Electoral College and became president. In 2000, \nGeorge W. Bush actually lost the nationwide popular election to Al Gore \nby nearly 544,000 votes, yet won the presidency in a Supreme Court \nshowdown over Florida's Electoral College votes that hinged on far \nfewer disputed State ballots. That dispute undermined Americans' \nconfidence in our democracy and should not be allowed to happen again.\n  In addition, the Electoral College skews the way candidates for \npresident campaign, causing them to focus only on contested \n``battleground States''. As the Miami Herald recognized in an editorial \npublished the day after the 2008 election, the Electoral College is a \n``horse-and-buggy-era political contraption,'' which effectively shuts \nout the majority of Americans--those who don't live in one of the key \nbattleground States--from any meaningful participation in the selection \nof our President.\n  A recently released study by FairVote, the Center for Voting and \nDemocracy, documents just how lopsided the Electoral College has made \npresidential elections: more than 98 percent of all campaign events and \nmore than 98 percent of all campaign spending occurred in 15 large and \nsmall battleground States representing 36.6 percent of the Nation's \neligible voter population. Of the 300 campaign events by the major \npresidential candidates held between September 5 and November 4, 2008, \nfully 57 percent of these events took place in four States--Ohio, \nFlorida, Pennsylvania, and Virginia--representing just 17 percent of \nthe Nation's eligible voters. Voter turnout was 67 percent in the 15 \nbattleground States and only 61 percent in the remaining 35 States.\n  The simple and straightforward constitutional amendment simply \nprovides for the direct election of the President and Vice President, \nbased on the national popular vote from the 50 States, the U.S. \nterritories, and the District of Columbia.\n  The proposed amendment also confirms--consistent with the vision of \nthe Framers--that it is within Congress's power to set the time, place \nand manner--as well as other key criteria--for holding Federal \nelections. Unlike some proposed constitutional amendments that have \nbeen introduced in the past, my proposal does not delve into additional \ndetail by specifying the qualifications for voters or by imposing a \nmajority requirement for an election, leaving those issues for the \nCongress to address through the legislative process. Rather, the \namendment keeps the focus where it belongs--on enshrining in our \nConstitution the principle of one person, one vote, in the election of \nour President.\n  I first introduced this constitutional amendment during the previous \nCongress, as part of a broader package of reforms that also included \nmeasures to make it easier to vote, for example, by encouraging early \nvoting or no-fault absentee voting; to ensure that there is a \nverifiable paper ballot so that every vote cast gets counted; and to \nallow voters, not party bosses, to select presidential candidates. I \nplan to file these other election reforms early in this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 4\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That the \n     following article is proposed as an amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States, which shall be\n\n[[Page S235]]\n\n     valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution \n     when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the \n     several States within seven years after the date of its \n     submission by the Congress:\n\n                              ``Article--\n\n       ``Section 1.

Res. 10\n\n       Whereas Hamas was founded with the stated goal of \n     destroying the State of Israel;\n       Whereas Hamas has been designated by the Secretary of State \n     as a Foreign Terrorist Organization;\n       Whereas Hamas has refused to comply with the requirements \n     of the Quartet (the United States, the European Union, \n     Russia, and the United Nations) that Hamas recognize Israel's \n     right to exist, renounce violence, and agree to accept \n     previous agreements between Israel and the Palestinians;\n       Whereas, in June 2006, Hamas crossed into Israel, attacked \n     Israeli forces and kidnapped Corporal Gilad Shalit, whom they \n     continue to hold today;\n       Whereas Hamas has launched thousands of rockets and mortars \n     since Israel dismantled settlements and withdrew from Gaza in \n     2005;\n       Whereas Hamas has increased the range of its rockets, \n     reportedly with support from Iran and others, putting \n     additional large numbers of Israelis in danger of rocket \n     attacks from Gaza;\n       Whereas Hamas locates elements of its terrorist \n     infrastructure in civilian population centers, thus using \n     innocent civilians as human shields;\n       Whereas Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said in a \n     statement on December 27, 2008, that ``[w]e strongly condemn \n     the repeated rocket and mortar attacks against Israel and \n     hold Hamas responsible for breaking the ceasefire and for the \n     renewal of violence there'';\n       Whereas, on December 27, 2008, Prime Minister of Israel \n     Ehud Olmert said, ``For approximately seven years, hundreds \n     of thousands of Israeli citizens in the south have been \n     suffering from missiles being fired at them. . . . In such a \n     situation we had no alternative but to respond. We do not \n     rejoice in battle but neither will we be deterred from it. . \n     . . The operation in the Gaza Strip is designed, first and \n     foremost, to bring about an improvement in the security \n     reality for the residents of the south of the country.'';\n       Whereas, on January 2, 2009, Secretary of State Rice stated \n     that ``Hamas has held the people of Gaza hostage ever since \n     their illegal coup against the forces of President Mahmoud \n     Abbas, the legitimate President of the Palestinian people. \n     Hamas has used Gaza as a launching pad for rockets against \n     Israeli cities and has contributed deeply to a very bad daily \n     life for the Palestinian people in Gaza, and to a \n     humanitarian situation that we have all been trying to \n     address'';\n       Whereas the humanitarian situation in Gaza, including \n     shortages of food, water, electricity, and adequate medical \n     care, is becoming more acute;\n       Whereas Israel has facilitated humanitarian aid to Gaza \n     with over 500 trucks and numerous ambulances entering the \n     Gaza Strip since December 26, 2008;\n       Whereas, on January 2, 2009, Secretary of State Rice stated \n     that it was ``Hamas that rejected the Egyptian and Arab calls \n     for an extension of the tahadiya that Egypt had negotiated'' \n     and that the United States was ``working toward a cease-fire \n     that would not allow a reestablishment of the status quo ante \n     where Hamas can continue to launch rockets out of Gaza. It is \n     obvious that that cease-fire should take place as soon as \n     possible, but we need a cease-fire that is durable and \n     sustainable''; and\n       Whereas the ultimate goal of the United States is a \n     sustainable resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \n     that will allow for a viable and independent Palestinian \n     state living side by side in peace and security with the \n     State of Israel, which will not be possible as long as \n     Israeli civilians are under threat from within Gaza: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses vigorous support and unwavering commitment to \n     the welfare, security, and survival of the State of Israel as \n     a Jewish and democratic state with secure borders, and \n     recognizes its right to act in self-defense to protect its \n     citizens against acts of terrorism;\n       (2) reiterates that Hamas must end the rocket and mortar \n     attacks against Israel, recognize Israel's right to exist, \n     renounce violence, and agree to accept previous agreements \n     between Israel and the Palestinians;\n       (3) encourages the President to work actively to support a \n     durable, enforceable, and sustainable cease-fire in Gaza, as \n     soon as possible, that prevents Hamas from retaining or \n     rebuilding the capability to launch rockets and mortars \n     against Israel and allows for the long term improvement of \n     daily living conditions for the ordinary people of Gaza;\n       (4) believes strongly that the lives of innocent civilians \n     must be protected and all appropriate measures should be \n     taken to diminish civilian casualties and that all involved \n     should continue to work to address humanitarian needs in \n     Gaza;\n       (5) supports and encourages efforts to diminish the appeal \n     and influence of extremists in the Palestinian territories \n     and to strengthen moderate Palestinians who are committed to \n     a secure and lasting peace with Israel; and\n       (6) reiterates its strong support for United States \n     Government efforts to promote a just resolution of the \n     Israeli-Palestinian conflict through a serious and sustained \n     peace process that leads to the creation of a viable and \n     independent Palestinian state living in peace alongside a \n     secure State of Israel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/08/senate-section/article/S235-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 11--TO AUTHORIZE PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS TO THE \n                DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE INSPECTOR GENERAL\n\n  Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. McConnell) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.
