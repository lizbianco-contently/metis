Mr. President, I think nearly every one of us has gone to \nthe doctor and taken home advice to help us get better or to live \nhealthier. Maybe at one point in our lives, we were told, for example, \nto exercise more. Maybe we were told to cut something out of our diet, \nlose some weight, add something to it, gain some weight, change your \ndiet in some way.\n  Maybe we were prescribed medication for a short while or for a long \nwhile. People within the sound of my voice in this Senate Chamber all \nhave been to doctors, and many are taking medicine now. It is not \nalways easy to hear the advice doctors give or to follow the advice \nthey give. It is never easy to change your lifestyle, even if you know \nyou will be better in the long run.\n  But you also know the risk of not following your doctor's orders and \nthe consequences of not taking your medicine. The costs of doing \nnothing are far greater. You know that if you do not do something this \ntime, the news after your next checkup may even be worse; it will take \neven more drastic steps or more difficult changes to get healthy again.\n  Well, America has had its checkup, and the prognosis is not \npromising. Our health care system is sick. It is not healthy. Our \ndoctor's orders are very clear: If we do not start taking better care \nof ourselves, it is only going to get worse. This is the message \nAmerica has.\n  The costs of health care today are staggering. Families in every part \nof Nevada and in every State feel this every day. But the costs could \nget much higher. If we do not act, they will get worse, much worse, \nmuch higher.\n  If we do not act, they will get higher.\n  The average American family today pays twice as much for its health \ncare then it did a decade ago. If we do not act, less than a decade \nfrom now those costs will double again. Families are not making more \nmoney, but they are paying more trying to get healthy and to stay \nhealthy. If we do not act, less than a decade from now you will spend \nalmost half your family's income on health care. No one can be expected \nto afford that. No one should have to afford that.\n\n[[Page S7444]]\n\n  After a while, the trillions of dollars millions of families spend \nstart to add up. Our country spends on health care twice as much per \nperson than any other developed nation on the planet. Health care costs \nconsume almost 20 cents of every dollar we spend. That is of every \ndollar spent in America. If we do not act, in a generation it will \nconsume more than one-third of every dollar.\n  You may be fortunate enough to afford health care this year, but if \nwe do not act, you may not be able to say the same next year. If we do \nnot act, your children will likely not be able to say the same when \nthey grow up.\n  Last Thursday, I was in an event with Senator Murray, where she got \nnotice from the State of Washington that 135,000 people who are \nbeneficiaries of a health insurance plan in her State got a notice that \nthe average rate of increase to the 135,000 recipients of health care \nin that plan will have an increase on an average of 17.5 percent.\n  Staggering. We have all read the charts and seen the numbers repeated \nby those who oppose fixing our broken health care system. There are \ncharts and there are conversations all toward maintaining the status \nquo, keeping things the way they are. But it is as if they have not \nbothered to do the math on the costs of doing nothing.\n  Health care reform is economic reform. That is why we want to lower \nskyrocketing costs and bring stability and security back to health \ncare. That is why we are committed to passing a plan that protects what \nworks and fixes what does not. I am encouraged by the cooperation and \ncommitment of several Republican Senators willing to work with us to \nget that done and to get it done before it is too late.\n  I appreciate the tireless work of our Finance and HELP Committees, \nDemocrats and Republicans, as they write a prescription for America \nthat will work. I had a call last night about 10 from Chris Dodd, \nindicating the progress that has been made in the HELP Committee.\n\n  Republicans have offered hundreds of amendments--hundreds of \namendments--and they are working their way through those. Those \nRepublican amendments sometimes improve the legislation. For example, \nSenator Dodd said he was very pleased they were able to work something \nout on bio-generics--that is a prescription physicians get--and there \nis some real activity out there as to how that is going to be treated.\n  An amendment offered by Senator Hatch was adopted by the committee. I \nappreciate the work of our Finance and HELP Committees as they write a \nprescription for America that will work.\n  I still aim to bring the bill to the floor this month, but it appears \nsomewhat to ignore the doctor's orders. I wish I could say they do so \nat their own peril. Yet if a handful of Senators stand in the way of \nthe change we so drastically need, urgently need, they will endanger \nnot just them but all of us. They will endanger families of every \nbackground, businesses of every size, and our Nation's collective \nfuture.\n  We have already seen what happens when we do nothing. Over the past 8 \nyears of inaction, the cost of health care rose to record levels, and \nthe number of Americans who cannot afford insurance did the same. \nSenator Patty Murray's story is certainly relevant. For the 135,000 \npeople in the State of Washington, a 17.5-percent increase, on average, \nof their policies, is what they have to pay.\n  For the millions of families who file for foreclosure because they \ncannot afford both their house and health care, not acting is not an \noption. For the millions of Americans who file for bankruptcy because \ntheir medical bills grow higher and higher and higher, not acting is \nnot an option. For the millions of Americans who have skipped a \ndoctor's visit or treatments they need to stay healthy or who never \nfill a prescription their doctor gives them because health care is \nsimply too expensive, not acting is not an option.\n  Our health care system is not healthy. Americans' physical health and \nAmerica's fiscal health are at stake, and not acting is not an option.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/14/senate-section/article/S7444-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as both parties work together on \nreforming health care, Americans have been clear about what they want \nto see in a result. Americans want health care that is more affordable \nand accessible, but they also want to preserve the choice and quality \nthat our current system provides.\n  We also know what Americans do not want. They do not want a \ngovernment plan that forces them off their current insurance; denies, \ndelays, and rations care; or costs trillions of dollars, only to leave \nmillions of Americans with worse health care than they currently have.\n  And Americans certainly do not want us to throw together some \npatchwork plan that nobody has had a chance to look at, and then rush \nit out the door the way the stimulus bill was, just so politicians in \nWashington can say they accomplished something.\n  Americans are increasingly concerned about some of the proposals \ncoming out of Washington, and they are concerned about the cost, about \nwho gets stuck with the bill.\n  And they are concerned for good reason.\n  All the cost estimates we have seen for Democrat reform proposals \nhave been staggering, and most of them only hint at what the true cost \nof these changes might be.\n  Moreover, some estimates claim to cover a 10-year period but actually \nonly cover a 6 year period.\n  We also know from hard experience with programs like Medicare and \nMedicaid that government-run health plans are likely to cost far more \nin the long run than original estimates suggest.\n  And we have seen that with the current administration initial \nestimates and assurances are not always on target. Earlier this year, \nthe Administration predicted the stimulus bill would keep unemployment \nbelow 8 percent. It is now approaching 10 percent.\n  So Americans are increasingly concerned about cost. This is why the \nadvocates of government-run health care are scrambling for a way to pay \nfor it. But in their rush to find the money, they have come up with \nsome terrible ideas, such as forcing small business owners and seniors \nto pick up the tab through higher taxes and cuts to Medicare.\n  Let me repeat that: the advocates for government-run health care now \nwant small business owners and seniors to pay for their plan through \nhigher taxes and cuts to Medicare. This is exactly the wrong approach. \nRaiding one insolvent government-run program to create another is not \nreform. It is using old ideas to solve a problem that calls for fresh \nthinking. Medicare should be strengthened for future generations, not \nused as a piggy bank to fund more government programs.\n  As for tax hikes on small business owners, this is the last thing we \nshould be doing to the people who have created approximately two-thirds \nof America's jobs over the past decade at a time when the unemployment \nrate is approaching 10 percent. According to the President of the \nNational Federation of Independent Business, some proposals currently \nbeing considered in Congress could kill more than 1.5 million jobs. And \nthere is strong evidence that low-wage workers, minorities, and women \nwould be hardest hit. In the middle of a recession, we should be \nlooking for ways to create jobs, not destroy them. We should be looking \nfor ways to help workers, not hurt them.\n  Americans want health care reform. But they do not want so-called \nreforms that could costs trillions of dollars, that could increase \ninsurance premiums, or that could cause millions to end up with worse \ncare than they now have. And they certainly do not want a slapped-\ntogether plan that's paid for on the backs of seniors and small \nbusiness owners.\n  Instead, Americans want us to work together on proposals that are \nlikely to garner strong bipartisan support. I have listed many of these \nproposals repeatedly over the past several weeks, such as reforming \nmedical malpractice laws to get rid of junk lawsuits and bring down \ncosts, and encouraging wellness and prevention programs such as those \nthat help people quit smoking and overcome obesity, programs that have \nalready been shown to cut costs.\n\n[[Page S7445]]\n\nThese are some of the commonsense ideas Americans are looking for on \nhealth care reform.\n  Health care reform will not be easy. But it does not have to bury our \nchildren and grandchildren deeper in debt when so far this year we're \nalready spending an average of $500 million a day in interest on the \nnational debt. The proposal I have mentioned should be easy for \neveryone to agree on. They would lead to measurable results. And they \nwould not force anyone to lose the care they have, see cuts to \nMedicare, or foist higher taxes on small businesses.\n  Americans are concerned about the cost of reform. We should work hard \nto assure them that we are too.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an amendment \nthat I have filed to the National Defense Authorization Act of 2010. \nThis amendment is to ensure that comprehensive suicide prevention \nservices will be offered to our National Guard and Reservists as part \nof the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program.\n  Sadly, too often we hear about the death of an armed services member \nfrom an unnecessary and preventable suicide. Suicide has become an \nincreasingly severe problem across the Armed Forces. For the first time \nin history, the number of battlefield suicides in early 2009 was higher \nthan the number of combat deaths. I am pleased that the Defense \nAuthorization Act we are considering supports increased efforts to \nprevent suicide among active duty personnel. However, there is \ncurrently no requirement that all National Guard members and \ncommunities have access to a comprehensive suicide prevention program.\n  Even in the wake of suicides, Guard members are often called back to \nactive duty and redeployed into dangerous and intense combat \nsituations. Suicide devastates not only military families but also \nmilitary communities and fellow soldiers. Currently, while active duty \nsoldiers receive suicide prevention training programs, there are no \nestablished programs to train National Guardsmen and Reservists to \nprevent suicides when they return to their communities from deployment. \nAnd the families of Guardsmen and Reservists do not receive training \nunder Yellow Ribbon to recognize the warning signs of suicide.\n  In Afghanistan and Iraq, we increasingly rely on our National Guard \nand Reservists. We see that first-hand in New Hampshire: Recently, more \nthan 1,100 members of the 197th Fires Brigade, which includes units \nfrom Berlin, Franklin and Manchester, NH, received notice that they can \nexpect to be deployed to the Middle East. Fortunately, when these \nsoldiers return home from battle, they and their communities will have \ncomprehensive suicide prevention training available to them. That is \nthanks to the initiative of New Hampshire's National Guard's pilot \nProgram, the Connect Program, that has gone beyond the Yellow Ribbon \nProgram.\n  To date, the Connect Program, which is administered by the National \nAlliance on Mental Illness in New Hampshire, has provided hundreds of \nofficers, Chaplains and other Guardsmen with an interactive, community-\nbased suicide prevention training. Through Connect, a Guard member who \nreturns home from duty learns how to recognize the warning signs of \nsuicidal behavior, how to respond to someone who shows those signs, and \nwhere to point that person to the services he or she needs.\n  But the program doesn't end with the Guard member. It also provides \nthis training to the Guard member's community. The Guard member's \ncommanding officers are trained to recognize suicidal tendencies in the \nsoldiers who they command. Guard families, who often have no experience \nwith mental illness and suicide, are also provided with that training. \nThis is especially critical because, unlike active duty personnel, \nGuard members don't see their fellow soldiers every day when they come \nback from being deployed. Instead, they go back to their families and \ncivilian communities, which simply aren't capable of recognizing the \nwarning signs of suicidal behavior. The Connect Program fills a crucial \ngap because it uses interactive training to emphasize that mental \nhealth is a community responsibility.\n  The Connect Program also ensures that community members know how to \ncope with and respond to a suicide in the Guard community. People who \nknow someone who has died by suicide are statistically at increased \nrisk of taking their own life. The program helps communities reduce \nthat risk and promote healing in response to a suicide, which is an \nessential element of any suicide prevention program. Thanks to their \neffective work in response to suicides, Connect has been designated as \na National Best Practice Program in Suicide Prevention and its work \nwith the National Guard was recently recognized as a model program by \nthe Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration in the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, HHS.\n  But not all State National Guards offer such comprehensive suicide \nprevention programs after deployment. In the Army National Guard alone, \nthere have been 29 confirmed suicides this year among Army Guardsmen \nwho were not on active duty. I rise today because we need to extend \nthese critical services across the country before even more soldiers \nfall through the cracks.\n  The Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program has been a tremendously \nimportant and successful effort to transition our Guard members back to \ncivilian life. However, these Guard and Reservist suicides have made \nclear that Yellow Ribbon is simply incomplete without an established, \nnationally implemented program that trains Guard members, communities \nand families to recognize the warning signs of suicide after deployment \nand to cope with the loss of a loved one.\n  Fortunately for us in New Hampshire, our National Guard identified \nthat need early and went above and beyond Yellow Ribbon, creating a \npilot program to ensure that the New Hampshire Guard community has the \ntools they need to prevent suicides when soldiers return from battle. \nStudies of the Connect Program have shown that people who receive this \ntraining feel particularly well-prepared to not only recognize the \nwarning signs of suicide, but also to respond to suicides in their \ncommunities.\n  But others across the country may not be so fortunate. That is why \nthis amendment would require the Office for Reintegration Programs to \nestablish a program to provide these members, their families, and their \ncommunities with training in suicide prevention and community healing \nin response to suicide.

Mr. President, the President has expressed several \ntimes his concern about our Nation's debt. We Republicans have a great \nconcern about the amount of debt being stacked up in this country.\n  President Obama's proposals will, over the next 10 years, add three \ntimes as much to the national debt, almost, as was spent during World \nWar II, according to the Washington Post. The President has had a \nsummit on entitlement spending, which is the principal cause of the \ndebt. He has said we need to pay for programs as we go. If we spend a \ndollar, we should save a dollar or tax a dollar. More recently he has \nsaid that health care legislation has to be paid for.\n  Well, Mr. President, we are rushing down a road to pass a bill \nwithout knowing what it costs. I just left the work we are doing in the \nHELP Committee. The Finance Committee is working hard. We had a \nbipartisan breakfast of nearly 20 Senators this morning discussing how \nwe could have a bipartisan result in health care this year.\n  But we cannot do it unless we know how much it costs. It affects 16 \npercent of our entire national budget. We do not have a bill yet. The \nHELP Committee may have one by the end of the week, in which \nRepublicans have had almost no input. The Finance Committee is trying \nto develop a bipartisan bill, but they are not going to begin writing a \nbill until next week. Then it will take several weeks to know what it \ncosts. We need to know, not just so we do not add to the debt, but so \nwe can understand what the various options are and how much they cost.\n  We are talking about Medicare cuts and spending Grandma's Medicare \nmoney on somebody else. How much does that cost? We are talking about \ntaxes on employers. How much does that cost? We are talking about \nadding to the debt. By exactly how much? We are talking about a surtax \non incomes. We are talking about extensive increases in State costs in \nMedicaid.\n  So we want a health care bill. But we want something Americans can \nafford, and after we are through fixing health care, we want to make \nsure they have a government they can afford. We agree with the \nPresident. We cannot responsibly pass a bill on this floor until we \nknow what it costs.\n  So why the rush? Let's do it right. We are talking about one of the \nmost important pieces of legislation ever, and we are talking about \ntrillions of dollars.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/14/senate-section/article/S7446-3", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7446-S7448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              CLEAN ENERGY\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I delivered an address yesterday at the \nNational Press Club about the Republican plan for clean energy. We call \nit a low-cost clean energy plan. It begins with the idea of building \n100 new nuclear power plants in the next 20 years; electrifying half \nour cars and trucks in the next 20 years; exploring for natural gas, \nwhich is low carbon, and oil offshore--if we are going to continue to \nuse oil, it might as well be our own--and then, finally, doubling our \nresearch and development budget, as President Obama has proposed, so we \ncan have ``mini Manhattan Projects'' in renewable energy to try to \nreduce renewable energy technologies' costs and make them more reliable \nso they can contribute to our energy needs.\n  I would like to make a few remarks today on our low-cost plan for \nclean, renewable energy and compare it with what is coming over from \nthe House, which is a high-cost plan.\n  Our country is at a critical point. The recession is the most severe \nin decades. Unemployment is nearing 10 percent. We have too much \nnational debt. A gathering storm threatens the technological edge that \nhas given Americans--only about 5 percent of the world's people--a \nremarkable standard of living that comes from producing 25 percent of \nthe world's wealth. We remember last year's high oil prices. We know we \nare relying too much on other countries for energy. There is the \nunfinished job of cleaning our air, and, for many, the global warming \nof our planet is an urgent concern.\n  It is against this backdrop that for the first time ever legislation \ndealing broadly with climate change and energy is coming out of the \nHouse. We are working on the same subjects in the Senate. The decisions \nwe make will affect our well-being for years to come.\n  The House has chosen the high-cost solution to clean energy and \nclimate change. Its economy-wide cap-and-trade and renewable energy \nmandate is\n\n[[Page S7447]]\n\na job-killing, $100 billion-a-year national energy tax that will add a \nnew utility bill to every American family budget.\n  Republican Senators offer a different approach, a low-cost plan for \nclean energy based upon four steps: 100 new nuclear plants in 20 years, \nelectric cars for conservation, offshore exploration for natural gas \nand oil, and doubling energy research and development to make renewable \nenergy cost competitive. The Republican plan will lower utility bills \nand create jobs and should put the United States within the goals of \nthe Kyoto protocol on global warming by 2030. Our plan should not add \nto the Federal budget since ratepayers will pay for building the new \nnuclear plants. Federal loan financing for the first nuclear plants is \ndesigned not to cost the taxpayers money, and nuclear plants insure one \nanother. Offshore exploration should produce revenues through royalties \nto pay for programs to encourage electric cars and trucks; and doubling \nenergy research and development should cost about $8 billion more per \nyear, which is consistent with the President's budget proposals for \n2009 and 2010.\n  So in furtherance of that Republican plan, I have offered my own \nblueprint as one Senator about how to build 100 nuclear power plants in \nthe next 20 years, and I am looking for support on the Republican side \nand on the Democratic side, in and out of Congress. For those who are \nwatching and listening, I would like to have your comments and \nsuggestions at www.alexander.senate\n.gov.\n  This is a good time to stop and ask: Just what are we trying to \naccomplish with energy and climate change legislation? What kind of \nAmerica do we want to create during the next 20 years?\n  Well, first, we should want to see an America running on energy that \nis clean, cheap, reliable, and abundant. In order to produce nearly 25 \npercent of the world's wealth, we consume about 25 percent of the \nworld's energy. We should want an America in which we create hundreds \nof thousands of green jobs, but not at the expense of destroying tens \nof millions of red, white, and blue jobs. In other words, it doesn't \nmake any sense to put people to work in the renewable energy sector if \nwe are throwing them out of work in manufacturing and high tech. That \nis what will happen if these new technologies raise the price of \nelectricity and send manufacturing and other energy-intensive \nindustries overseas, searching for cheap energy. We want clean, new, \nenergy-efficient cars, but we want them built in Michigan and Ohio and \nTennessee and not in Japan and Mexico.\n  We should want an America capable of producing enough of our own \nenergy so we can't be held hostage by some other country.\n  We should want an America in which we are the unquestioned leader in \ncutting-edge, job-creating scientific research.\n  We should want an America producing less carbon. I don't think we \nought to be throwing 29 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the \nenvironment every year, so that means less reliance on fossil fuels.\n  We want an America with cleaner air where smog and soot in Los \nAngeles and in the Great Smoky Mountains are a thing of the past and \nwhere our children are less likely to suffer asthma attacks brought on \nby breathing pollutants.\n  Finally, we should want an America in which we are not creating \n``energy sprawl'' by occupying vast tracts of farmlands, deserts, and \nmountaintops with energy installations that ruin the scenic landscapes. \nThe great American outdoors is a revered part of the American \ncharacter. We have spent a century preserving it. There is no need to \ndestroy the environment in the name of saving the environment.\n  None of these goals are met by the House-passed Waxman-Markey bill. \nWhat started out as an effort to address global warming by reducing \ncarbon emissions has ended up as a contraption of taxes and mandates \nthat will impose a huge and unnecessary burden on the economy. \nRenewable energies such as wind and solar and biomass are intriguing \nand promising as a supplement to America's energy requirements. Yet the \nWaxman-Markey bill proves once again that one of the government's \nbiggest mistakes can be taking a good idea and expanding it until it \ndoesn't work anymore.\n  Trying to expand these forms of renewable energy to the point where \nthey become our prime source of energy has huge costs and obvious \nflaws. What is worse, it creates what some conservationists call ``the \nrenewable energy sprawl,'' where we are asked to sacrifice the American \nlandscape and overwhelm fragile ecosystems with thousands of massive \nenergy machines in an effort to take care of our energy needs.\n  For example, one big solar power plant in the western desert where \nthey line up mirrors to focus the Sun's rays and which spreads across \nmore than 30 square miles--that is more than 5 miles on each side--\nproduces just the same 1,000 megawatts you can get from a single coal \nor nuclear plant that sits on 1 square mile. And to generate the same \n1,000 megawatts with wind, you need 270 square miles of 50-story \nturbines. Generating 20 percent of our Nation's electricity from wind \nwould cover an area the size of West Virginia.\n  To those of us in the Southeast where the wind blows less than 20 \npercent of the time, they say ``use biomass,'' which is burning wood \nproducts, sort of a controlled bonfire. That is a good idea. It might \nreduce forest fires and conserve resources, but let's not expect too \nmuch. We would need a forest a lot larger than the Great Smoky \nMountains National Park to feed a 1,000-megawatt biomass plant on a \nsustained basis. And think of all of the energy used and the carbon \nproduced by the hundreds of trucks it will take every day to haul the \nstuff to that one plant.\n  Already we are beginning to see the problems. Boone Pickens, who said \nthat wind turbines are ``too ugly,'' in his words, to put on his own \nranch, last week postponed what was to be America's largest wind farm \nbecause of the difficulty of building transmission lines from West \nTexas to population centers. And the Sacramento Municipal Utility \nDistrict pulled out of another huge project to bring wind energy in \nfrom the Sierra Nevada for the same reason. According to the Wall \nStreet Journal, California officials are worried that the State's \nrenewable mandates have created ``a high risk to the state economy . . \n. and that the state may be short on power by 2011 if problems continue \nto pile up.''\n  Add to that a point that many forget: Wind and solar energy is only \navailable about a third of the time because today it can't be stored--\nyou use it or you lose it. Solar's great advantage is that the Sun \nshines during peak usage hours, while the wind often blows at night \nwhen there is plenty of unused electricity. But with either, if you \nwant to be sure your lights turn on or that your factory opens its \ndoors when you go to work, you still need other power plants to back it \nup.\n  Is this really the picture of America we want to see 20 years from \nnow? There is a much better option. We should take another long, hard \nlook at nuclear power. It is already our best source for large amounts \nof cheap, reliable, clean energy. It provides only 20 percent of our \nNation's electricity but 70 percent of our carbon-free, pollution-free \nelectricity. It is already far and away our best defense against global \nwarming. So why not build 100 new nuclear plants in the next 20 years? \nAmerican utilities built 100 reactors between 1970 and 1990 with their \nown (ratepayers') money. Why can't we do that again? Other countries \nare already forging ahead of us. France gets 80 percent of its \nelectricity from 50 reactors, and it has among the cheapest electricity \nrates and the lowest carbon emissions in Europe. Japan is building \nreactors from start to finish in 4 years. China is planning 60 new \nreactors. Russia is selling its nuclear technology all over the world. \nWe are helping India get ready to build nuclear plants. President Obama \nhas even said Iran has the right to use nuclear power for energy. Yet \nwe haven't built a new nuclear plant in 30 years, and we invented the \ntechnology. Why don't we get back in the game?\n\n  There seem to be a couple of main things holding us back: first, a \nfailure to appreciate just how different nuclear is from other \ntechnologies, how its tremendous energy density translates into a \nvanishingly small environmental footprint, and second, an exaggerated \nfear of nuclear technology.\n  Many have forgotten that nuclear power plants were the result of \nPresident Eisenhower's ``Atoms For Peace''\n\n[[Page S7448]]\n\nprogram. The idea was to take perhaps the greatest invention of the \nlast century and use it to provide low-cost energy to reduce poverty \naround the world.\n  There is also a misconception that nuclear plants are uninsurable and \ncan't exist without a big Federal subsidy. There is a Federal insurance \nprogram for nuclear plants called Price-Anderson, but it has never paid \na dime of insurance. Today, the way it works is every one of the 104 \nnuclear plants in the country can be assessed $100 million in damages \nfor an accident at another reactor. So that is another factor adding to \nsafety consciousness.\n  Most reactors have revenue of $2 million a day, which pays for the $5 \nbillion construction loans and still makes possible low rates for \nconsumers. For example, when the Tennessee Valley Authority restarted \nits Brown's Ferry Unit 1 reactor 2 years ago, TVA thought it would take \n10 years to pay off the $1.8 billion construction debt. It took 3 \nyears. When oil prices were skyrocketing, Connecticut proposed putting \na windfall profits tax on the state's two reactors because they were \nmaking so much money.\n  Nuclear power is the obvious first step to a policy of clean and low-\ncost energy. One hundred new plants in 20 years would double U.S. \nnuclear production, making it about 40 percent of all electricity \nproduction. Add 10 percent for Sun and wind and other renewable \nsources. Add another 10 percent for hydroelectric, maybe 5 percent for \nnatural gas, and we begin to have a cheap, as well as a clean, energy \npolicy.\n  Step two is to electrify half our cars and trucks. According to \nestimates by Brookings Institution scholars, there is so much unused \nelectricity at night that we can also do this in 20 years without \nbuilding one new power plant if we plug in vehicles while we sleep. \nThis is the fastest way to reduce dependence on foreign oil, keep fuel \nprices low, and reduce the one-third of carbon that comes from gasoline \nengines.\n  Step three is to explore offshore for natural gas--it is low carbon--\nand oil--using less, but using our own.\n  The final step is to double funding for energy research and \ndevelopment and launch mini Manhattan Projects such as the one we had \nin World War II, this time to meet seven grand energy challenges: \nimproving batteries for plug-in vehicles; making solar power cost-\ncompetitive with fossil fuels; making carbon capture a reality for \ncoal-burning plants; safely recycling used nuclear fuel; making \nadvanced biofuels--crops we don't eat--cost-competitive with gasoline; \nmaking more buildings green buildings; and providing energy from \nfusion.\n  We can't wait any longer to start building our future of clean, \nreliable, and affordable energy. The time has come for action. We must \nopen our minds to the possibilities and potential of nuclear power. We \nhave a clear choice between a high-cost clean energy plan coming from \nthe House--one that is filled with taxes and mandates and a new utility \nbill for every American family, one that will drive jobs overseas \nsearching for cheap energy--or we can enact our own cheap and clean \nenergy policy and lower utility bills and keep jobs here and produce \nfood here at a price that is low so Americans can afford to buy it.\n  This is the sensible way to go: nuclear power, electric cars, \nexploration offshore, and doubling research and development. This \npolicy of cheap and clean energy will help family budgets and create \njobs. It will also prove to be the fastest way to increase American \nenergy independence, clean our air, and reduce global warming.\n  I hope those listening will let me know their thoughts about our \nblueprint for 100 nuclear power plants in the next 20 years.

Madam President, yesterday was not a great day for our \nNation. For the first time in our history, the deficit of this Nation \npassed $1 trillion--$1 trillion. That is a number I do not think \nanybody ever expected to see as a deficit for our country.\n  To try to put it in perspective, as a percentage of our GDP, that is \nabout 13 percent. We have not had that size deficit since we were in \nWorld War II. The implications of that deficit are staggering for us as \na nation but, more importantly, it represents a clear and present \ndanger to our children and our children's children and to this Nation's \nfiscal solvency.\n  Remember, we are not through the fiscal year yet. It is estimated \nthat this deficit will continue up for the rest of the year. It is \nestimated that $1.8 trillion will be the deficit we will be facing in \n2010, and over $1 trillion the next year. These are numbers which are \nso huge they are incomprehensible--incomprehensible to myself and to \nmost Americans. But they translate into a very significant problem, \nwhich is that we will be passing on to our children, as a result of all \nthis debt, a nation which they cannot afford.\n  What is the cause of this debt? What is causing this massive \nexpansion in deficits? Primarily it is spending. It is not that we are \na nation that is undertaxed. It is that we are a nation that is simply \nspending too much.\n  My colleague on the other side of the aisle, the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, Mr. Conrad, is fond of saying the debt is the threat. \nHe is absolutely right because that is the threat to this Nation.\n  It is important to put in context, though, that this is not a \nmomentary event. We are not running up these deficits just today. But \nas we look into the outyears under the Obama budget, the deficits go up \nastronomically for as far as the eye can see, leading to debt which is \nunsustainable.\n  Over the next 10 years, the average deficit of this Nation will be $1 \ntrillion. Again, let's try to put that in context. That is about 4 to 5 \npercent of our gross national product every year.\n  If you were in Europe and you wanted to get into the European Union, \nwhich is a legitimate group of industrialized nations, they have rules \nfor how fiscally solvent you must be as a nation. One of their rules \nsays your deficit cannot exceed 3 percent of your gross national \nproduct. Yet under President Obama and his proposed budget, our deficit \nwill average 4.5 percent to 5 percent of our gross national product for \nthe next 10 years, over $1 trillion a year.\n  To what does this lead? It leads to massive expansion of debt, as \nthis chart shows, a debt which will be 85 percent of our GDP. What does \nthat mean, 85 percent of our GDP? The public debt of a nation is the \ndebt held by other people, specifically Americans and other countries, \nprimarily, in our case, China. They are the biggest holder of our debt. \nHistorically, whether a country or individuals are willing to buy the \ndebt of a nation depends on whether that nation is seen as being able \nto pay off that debt, that there is a reasonable likelihood of that, or \nwhether the Nation has the strength to pay off that debt.\n  There are rules of thumb here too. Again, in order to get into the \nEuropean Union, you have to have a ratio of less than 60 percent public \ndebt to your nation's debt, to your nation's GNP, gross national \nproduct.\n  Yesterday, under this proposal, under this administration, as we are \nseeing in action as we passed the $1 trillion debt line yesterday, that \npublic debt goes well past 65 percent very quickly within the next 2 \nyears, and then it continues to head up to 80 percent. In other words, \nour public debt will be so high we would be considered so irresponsible \nas a nation fiscally that the European nations, which are \nindustrialized countries, under their rules would not be able to allow \nus into the European Union. Not that we wish to seek entry, but clearly \nthat is a standard at which we should look.\n  If you look at it historically, our public debt--and what most \neconomists agree is reasonable--has been between 30 and 40 percent of \ngross national product. That is a manageable public debt. But when you \ndouble that debt as a percent of GDP, you are putting us on a path, a \nspiraling path downward into fiscal insolvency and a nation which \ncannot sustain its own debt.\n  To try to address this in another way, President Obama's proposals \nfor spending will more than double the debt in the next 5 years and \ntriple it in the next 10 years. In fact, if you take\n\n[[Page S7449]]\n\nall the debt that has been run up in our Nation from the beginning when \nGeorge Washington was President through George W. Bush's term in \noffice, take all that debt, President Obama has proposed and is \nspending--this government is spending--at a rate that will double that \ndebt in just 5 years. It is an inexcusable action to pass this much \ndebt on to our children.\n  This chart, called the ``Wall of Debt,'' puts it in numerical terms. \nWe can see how it goes up and up and up and up. By the end of this \nbudget, the debt will have increased three times--three times from \nabout $6 billion to $16 billion, about $5.5 to $16 trillion--excuse me, \ntrillion dollars. It is hard to use the term ``trillion.''\n  This is intolerable.\n  How do we address this situation? We need to control spending, and we \nneed, to the extent we raise taxes, use those taxes to reduce our debt, \nnot expand the size of government. Yet what are the proposals we are \nseeing coming from this administration and Members on the other side of \nthe aisle?\n  We have seen a House of Representatives proposal in the area of \nenergy called the cap-and-trade bill, which should be more accurately \ndescribed as the cap-and-tax bill because it creates a national sales \ntax of inordinate size. We have never seen anything of this size \nbefore. Every time you hit your light switch, you are going to end up \npaying a new tax under this bill for the purpose of addressing climate \nchange and energy policy. Yet it does not really accomplish any of \nthat.\n  The primary polluter in America today is the automobile. All that the \nnew tax that is being put in place from the House bill does is increase \nthe cost or increase the tax on gasoline. It does not reduce the \nmileage. It does not reduce the pollution. It just increases the tax.\n  As Senator Alexander spoke prior to my speaking, in the area of \nenergy production, electrical production, cap and trade simply becomes \na windfall, a pure and simple corporate welfare program for a lot of \nlarge, major electrical producers. They get this asset, a certificate \nto sell, which we have seen generate huge amounts of income to them, in \nexchange for theoretically reducing the amount of emissions that go \ninto the atmosphere.\n  If you wanted to address this issue, you don't do it with a massive \nnew tax on American workers, which is then basically given back to the \nindustry which uses it, which gets an advantage from it. Rather, you \nshould use the ideas Senator Alexander has talked about and we have \nbeen talking about on this side. Build 100 nuclear powerplants in the \nnext 20 years, move the automobile fleet to at least half electrical by \nthe year 2020 so that you have actually brought online nonpolluting \nelectrical power and you have put in place automobiles which do not \npollute also.\n  That is not the proposal. The proposal is this massive new tax, not \nused to reduce the debt or the deficit but basically used in many areas \nto expand the government with lots of new programs but also to \nunderwrite a huge corporate welfare program.\n  Then the other proposal we have from the administration that is major \npublic policy is the issue of health care. Again, proposals are about \nexpanding dramatically the size of government. In fact, the bill being \nworked on in the HELP Committee, by its own scoring, is at least $1 \ntrillion unfunded. That adds to the debt. That is going to go on top of \nthis debt.\n  To the extent there are new taxes being talked about--and there are a \nlot of them, especially in the House of Representatives--those taxes \nare not being used to reduce the debt. They are being used to grow the \nsize of government, to increase the government. As a result, the debt \ndoes not go down; the government's size goes up when we should be \nfocusing on this debt issue.\n\n  It is unconscionable that we as one generation would be running up \nthese types of deficits and passing this type of debt on to our \nchildren. There may be an excuse for it during a period of recession--\n--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, there may be an excuse for it during a \nrecession--and we are in a recession, a severe one--but there is no \nexcuse for it as we move out of this recession, and we are moving out \nof this recession. There is no excuse for having deficits that are $1 \ntrillion for the next 10 years. There is no excuse for running deficits \nof 4 to 5 percent of GDP for the next $1 trillion. There is absolutely \nno excuse for putting a debt on our children's backs that is 80 percent \nof the GDP of this country because what we are doing is passing on to \nour children a nation with fiscal policies that are unsustainable and \nwhich will basically give them less of a lifestyle than we received \nfrom our parents. No generation should do that to another generation. \nYet there are no policy proposals coming forward from this \nadministration which would turn this debt line down. None. Instead, \ntheir policy proposals increase the size of government and increase the \ntax burdens of Americans without reducing our debt by any significance. \nIt is an unfortunate situation and a difficult situation and one which \nwe better start addressing for the sake of this country and for our \nchildren's future.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 1390, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1390) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2010 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Levin/McCain amendment No. 1469, to strike $1,750 million \n     in procurement, Air Force funding for F-22A aircraft \n     procurement, and to restore operation and maintenance, \n     military personnel, and other funding in divisions A and B \n     that was reduced in order to authorize such appropriation.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the Levin-McCain amendment which is \nbefore the Senate would strike $1.75 billion in funding for the F-22 \naircraft that is in the committee bill that was adopted on a very close \nvote, and we would also restore some very serious reductions that had \nto be adopted in order to pay for that increase.\n  I come to this debate as somebody who supported the F-22 program \nuntil the numbers were achieved that were needed by the Air Force. This \ndebate is not about whether we are going to have the capability of the \nF-22, it is a debate about how many F-22 aircraft we should have and at \nwhat cost. And we are talking here about whether we should accept the \nrecommendations of two Commanders in Chief, two Secretaries of Defense, \ntwo Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff that 187 F-22s is what we need and all we can afford and all we \nshould buy.\n  Madam President, yesterday we put in the Record two letters, one from \nthe\n\n[[Page S7450]]\n\nPresident of the United States saying he would veto a bill--not \nconsider a veto but actually veto a bill--that has more than 187 F-22s \nthat are to be provided. We also put a letter from the Secretary of \nDefense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Record \nyesterday going through all the reasons they strongly oppose any \nadditional F-22s and oppose the committee language which costs $1.75 \nbillion, taking it away from some very important programs.\n  Today, I wish to read briefly and then put in the Record a letter \nthat came from the Secretary of the Air Force yesterday afternoon and \nfrom the Chief of Staff of the Air Force opposing the additional F-22s \nthat are in the committee bill. This letter reads in part:\n\n       As we prepared the fiscal year 2010 funding submission, and \n     mindful that the final lot of aircraft is scheduled for \n     completion over the next year, we methodically reviewed this \n     issue from multiple perspectives. These included: emerging \n     joint war-fighting requirements; complementary F-22 and F-35 \n     roles in the future security environment; potential \n     advantages of continuing a warm F-22 production line as \n     insurance against possible delays/ failures in the F-35 \n     program; potential impacts to the Services and international \n     partners if resources were realigned from the F-35 to the F-\n     22; overall tactical aircraft force structure; and funding \n     implications, given that extending F-22 production to 243 \n     aircraft would create an unfunded requirement estimated at \n     over $13 billion.\n\n  And then they summarized--this is the Air Force speaking; top \ncivilian, top military leader in the U.S. Air Force--as follows:\n\n       We assessed the F-22 decision from all angles, taking into \n     account competing strategic priorities and complementary \n     programs and alternatives, all balanced within the context of \n     available resources. We did not and do not recommend F-22s be \n     included in the FY10 defense budget. This is a difficult \n     decision but one with which we are comfortable. Most \n     importantly, in this and other budget decisions, we believe \n     it is important for Air Force leaders to make clear choices, \n     balancing requirements across a range of Air Force \n     contributions to joint capabilities.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the entire letter from the Secretary of the Air Force and the \nChief of Staff of the Air Force at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Secretary of the Air Force,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 13, 2009.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As the Senate considers the FY10 Defense \n     Authorization Bill, we write to reiterate our personal and \n     professional views concerning the future of the F-22 program, \n     and why we recommended to the Secretary of Defense that the \n     Air Force not pursue F-22 production beyond 187 aircraft.\n       The F-22 is the most capable fighter in our military \n     inventory and, arguably, the world. Among its principal \n     advantages are stealth and speed; and while optimized for \n     air-to-air combat, it also has a ground attack capability. \n     Requirements for the F-22 have changed significantly over the \n     past 20 years, as DoD has continued to reassess potential \n     threats, scenarios, and force structure--to include the \n     number of major combat operations we might be challenged to \n     conduct and their timing/phasing.\n       Broadly speaking. previous assessments have concluded that \n     a progressively more sophisticated mix of aircraft, weapons, \n     and networking capabilities will, over time and within \n     practical limits, enable us to produce needed combat power \n     with fewer platforms. As the overall requirements for fighter \n     inventories have declined. including F-22s, the rising F-22 \n     program costs also led to smaller buys. Together these \n     trends, coupled with constrained resources, ultimately led to \n     a DoD-imposed funding cap and a December 2004 approved \n     program of 183 aircraft (later adjusted to 187).\n       As we prepared the Fiscal Year 10 funding submission, and \n     mindful that the final lot of aircraft is scheduled for \n     completion over the next year. we methodically reviewed this \n     issue from multiple perspectives. These included: emerging \n     joint warfighting requirements; complementary F-22 and F-35 \n     roles in the future security environment; potential \n     advantages of continuing a warm F-22 production line as \n     insurance against possible delays/failures in the F-35 \n     program; potential impacts to the Services and international \n     partners if resources were realigned from the F-35 to the F-\n     22; overall tactical aircraft force structure; and funding \n     implications, given that extending F-22 production to 243 \n     aircraft would create an unfunded requirement estimated at \n     over $13 billion.\n       This review concluded with a holistic and balanced set of \n     recommendations for our fighter force: 1) focus procurement \n     on modern 5th generation aircraft rather than less capable F-\n     15s and F-16s; 2) given that the F-35 will constitute the \n     majority of the future fighter force, transition as quickly \n     as is prudent to F-35 production; 3) complete F-22 \n     procurement at 187 aircraft, while continuing plans for \n     future F-22 upgrades; and 4) accelerate the retirements of \n     the oldest 4th generation aircraft and modify the remaining \n     aircraft with necessary upgrades in capability.\n       And finally, while it is tempting to focus only on whether \n     the Air Force would benefit from additional F-22s, which we \n     acknowledge some in the airpower community have advocated, \n     this decision has increasingly become a zero-sum game. Within \n     a fixed Air Force and DoD budget, however large or small, our \n     challenge is to decide among many competing joint warfighting \n     needs; to include intelligence, surveillance and \n     reconnaissance; command and control; and related needs in the \n     space and cyber domains. At the same time. we are working to \n     repair years of institutional neglect of our nuclear forces, \n     rebuild our acquisition workforce, and taking steps to \n     improve Air Force capabilities for irregular warfare. \n     Ultimately, buying more F-22s means doing less of something \n     else and we did not recommend displacement of these other \n     priorities to fund additional F-22s.\n       In summary, we assessed the F-22 decision from all angles, \n     taking into account competing strategic priorities and \n     complementary programs and alternatives, all balanced within \n     the context of available resources. We did not and do not \n     recommend F-22s be included in the FY10 defense budget. This \n     is a difficult decision but one with which we are \n     comfortable. Most importantly, in this and other budget \n     decisions, we believe it is important for Air Force leaders \n     to make clear choices, balancing requirements across orange \n     of Air Force contributions to joint capabilities.\n       Make no mistake: air superiority is and remains an \n     essential capability for joint warfighting today and in the \n     future. The F-22 is a vital tool in the military toolbox and \n     will remain in our inventory for decades to come.\n\n     Norton A. Schwartz,\n       Chief of Staff.\n     Michael B. Donley,\n       Secretary of the Air Force.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, at this point, I thank Chairman Levin \nfor his important comments, especially about the letters from the \nSecretary of the Air Force and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force on \nthis issue. Let me repeat that this debate is not about depriving, in \nmy view, the U.S. Air Force of a much needed part of our arsenal to \ndefend this Nation's national security; it is about whether we will \ncontinue to spend money on the F-22, of which we are already acquiring \n187, and additionally adding the F-35, the Joint Strike Fighter, which \nis very badly needed by the other services as well. I believe the F-35, \nthe Joint Strike Fighter, is a very important counterpart to the F-22. \nThe F-22 has great capabilities in certain areas, and the Joint Strike \nFighter does too. So this debate is not just about removing the funds \nfor the F-22. What it is about is removing funds for the F-22 and \nmoving forward with the Joint Strike Fighter to give the U.S. Air \nForce, Marine Corps, and Navy a balanced inventory that will maintain \nthe Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps as the most powerful projections \nof air power in the world for a long time to come.\n  So I emphasize, this is not so much about terminating a program as it \nis ending a much needed program and supplementing it with another. I \nthink that sometimes this argument is portrayed simply in the area of \nthe F-22 itself. It is not. I know the chairman and I and the majority \nof the committee want a balanced, powerful, capable Air Force, Marine \nCorps, and Navy throughout the 21st century.\n  There have been various points raised and arguments made during this \ndebate. I would like to respond to several of those arguments that have \nbeen made so far and probably will be raised again during the rest of \nthis debate.\n  The first argument addresses the fact that 187 F-22s will not meet \noperational demands at an acceptable level of risk.\n  In the view of some Air Force officials, including the Air Combat \nCommand general, John Corley, for example, a total of 381 F-22s would \nbe sufficient to meet operational demands at a low level of risk and a \ntotal of 243 to 250 would be sufficient to meet operational demands \nwith a moderate level of risk. That is the view of some very credible \nindividuals.\n  Our response to that is that in December 2004, the Department of \nDefense determined that 183 F-22s was sufficient to meet its military \nrequirements. This is back in December of\n\n[[Page S7451]]\n\n2004. The Department conducted several analyses which affirmed that \nnumber based on a number of variables, including the lengths and types \nof wars the Department of Defense believes it will have to fight in the \nfuture and future capabilities of likely adversaries.\n  The President, the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman and Vice \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Air Force Chief of Staff, \nand the Secretary of the Air Force have all stated that 187 F-22s is \nsufficient to meet operational requirements, particularly when combined \nwith other U.S. military assets, including cyber warfare, strike \nfighter aircraft, long-range standoff precision weapons to counter \nenemy aircraft and surface-to-air missile systems in the future from \npotential adversaries.\n  We need to look at this in the entirety of its inventory. That means \ncyber warfare, it means long-range standoff precision weapons, it means \nthe dramatic increase in capability of unmanned aircraft. Look at the \nrole unmanned aircraft have played in Iraq and Afghanistan. In all \ncandor, look at the role the F-22 has not played in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. It has not been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan; whereas, \nour unmanned aircraft, our Predators, have had an incredible effect in \nidentifying, locating, and destroying the enemy. I think General \nPetraeus will attest to that in a very persuasive fashion.\n\n  In response to the argument that more F-22s are necessary to close a \ngap in fifth-generation fighters between the United States and China, \non May 14, Secretary Gates noted, ``[W]hen you look at potential \nthreats--for example, in 2020, the United States will have 2,700 \nTACAIR. China will have 1,700. But, of ours, 1,000 will be fifth-\ngeneration aircraft, including the F-22 and the F-35. And, in 2025, \nthat gap gets even bigger. So, the notion that a gap or a United States \nlead over China alone of 1,700 fifth-generation aircraft in 2025 does \nnot provide additional fifth-generation aircraft, including F-22s, to \ntake on a secondary threat seems to be unrealistic.''\n  Secretary Gates summarized his position on the operational need issue \non June 18, when he said that ``the U.S. military has to have the \nflexibility across the spectrum of conflict to handle the threats of \nthe future'' and that ``this will mean a huge investment for the \nfuture, one that is endangered by continuing the F-22 Raptor program.'' \nHe concluded, ``frankly, to be blunt about it, the notion that not \nbuying 60 more F-22s imperils the national security of the United \nStates, I find complete nonsense.''\n  As military deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for \nAcquisition GEN Mark D. Shackleford said, ``the capability that we get \nout of the 187 F-22s we believe is more than sufficient for the type of \nthreat that the Secretary of Defense is addressing in the future''. \nWhatever moderate risk may arise from ending the F-22 program, now is \nmerely short term and, under the Air Force's Combat Air Force--CAF--\nrestructure plan, necessary for the Air Force to transition the current \nfleet to a smaller, more capable fifth-generation fighter force for all \nthe Services.\n  The next argument being made is buying more F-22s could help mitigate \na projected fighter shortfall of up to 800 aircraft by 2024 that Air \nForce leaders identified in 2008 and a projected gap recently \nidentified within the Air National Guard's fighter inventory. Such \npurchases could also hedge the United States against the risk of \nunexpected age-related problems developing in the Air Force's legacy \nforce.\n  Our response to that is the fighter gap that the Air Force identified \nis questionable, given that it turns on various assumptions regarding \nthreats and whether the United States will fight by itself or as part \nof a coalition. In any event, the Air Force has put in place a plan \nthat will both mitigate any shortfall in fighter capability and bridge \nthe current fleet to a smaller, more capable fifth-generation fighter \nforce. An essential element of that plan--called the Combat Air Force--\nCAF--restructure plan--is to stop investing in the F-22 program after \nthe current program of record of 187. That plan addresses possible \nshortfalls in fighter capability more cost-effectively than simply \nbuying more F-22s. It does so by restructuring the Air Force's current \nfleet of fighters now and directing resulting savings to modifying \nnewer or more reliable fighters in the legacy fleet, including, \nupgraded F-15s and F-16s, procuring less expensive aircraft, including \nthe F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, and investing in joint enablers. Under \nthe plan, those investments will help create a more capable fleet that \ncan bridge the Air Force to a future fleet with a smaller, more capable \nforce.\n\n  In addition, in the years ahead, the Department of Defense needs to \nfocus on improving its capabilities for irregular warfare operations, \nand the F-22 is not a key program for improving those capabilities. \nWhile the F-22 is an extraordinarily capable ``air superiority'' \nplatform, its limited air-to-ground capability makes it less \nappropriate for supporting counterinsurgency operations--so much so \nthat, as Secretary Gates has pointed out several times, ``the reality \nis we are fighting two wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the F-22 has \nnot performed a single mission in either theater.''\n  The next argument is the decision to end the F-22 program is purely \nbudget driven.\n  Secretary Gates has indicated numerous times that his decision to end \nthe program is not resource driven. He announced that decision on April \n6, weeks before his plan was even submitted to the Office of Management \nand Budget for vetting. On April 30, Secretary Gates plainly stated, \n``if my top-line were $50 billion higher, I would make the same \ndecision [regarding the F-22 program].'' That having been said, given \nthe current fiscal crisis, buying more F-22s would likely reduce \nfunding for other more critically needed aircraft, such as the F-35, F/\nA-18E/F, and EA-18G, which unlike the F-22 are equipped with electronic \nwarfare capability--the combatant commanders' number one priority. In \nthat sense, continuing to purchase of F-22s could create operational \nrisks for the United States military in the near term.\n  The next argument is buying more F-22s will ensure the Air National \nGuard gets modernized fighter aircraft sooner.\n  Our response is that under the Total Force policy, all the Services, \nincluding the Air National Guard, will receive Joint Strike Fighters at \nthe appropriate time and at the appropriate rate to replace their aging \nF-15 and F-16 aircraft. The only requirement that the Air National \nGuard obtain Joint Strike Fighters ``sooner'' arises from the \n``additional views'' of Senator Chambliss in the report accompanying \nthe fiscal year 2010 authorization bill.\n  In a letter to Senator Chambliss, the head of the Air National Guard \nLTG Harry M. Wyatt III noted, ``I believe the current and future \nasymmetric threats to our nation, particularly from seaborne cruise \nmissiles, requires a fighter platform'' such as the F-22. However, that \nthreat is simply not present today. This is something that is being \nclosely looked at now in the on-going QDR debate. When asked about the \ncruise missile threat during our committee hearing recently, Secretary \nGates correctly noted that the most effective counter to these sorts of \nthreats is an aircraft that doesn't have a pilot inside of it.\n  The next argument is that large-scale production of F-35 Joint Strike \nFighters has only recently begun and has not yet increased to planned \nhigher annual rates. Until production of the Joint Strike Fighter has \nbeen successfully demonstrated at those planned higher annual rates, it \nwould be imprudent to shut down the F-22 production line, which is the \nonly ``hot'' fifth-generation production line.\n  Our response is that given how relatively similar the development and \nmanufacturing efforts supporting the Joint Strike Fighter are to those \nsupporting the F-22, concerns about an overall compromise in the \nindustrial base appear to be overstated. In addition, whatever moderate \nrisk may arise from ending the F-22 program now is operationally \nacceptable: it is short-term in duration and, under the Air Force's \nCombat Air Force--CAF--restructure plan, necessary for the Air Force to \ntransition the current fleet to a smaller, more capable fifth-\ngeneration fighter force for all the Services.\n  It is true that although ``full-rate production'' of the Joint Strike \nFighter isn't anticipated until 2015, the program is making very \nmeaningful\n\n[[Page S7452]]\n\nprogress. But, maturation in the technical, software, production-\nprocesses, and testing aspects of the program are on track to plan and \nare in fact exceeding legacy standards--including those for the F-22. \nAll 19 ``systems development and demonstration'' aircraft will roll out \nby the end of the year and major assembly on the 14 aircraft comprising \nthe earlier ``low-rate initial production,'' L-RIP, lots have begun. I \ncan assure the Members of this body that Senator Levin and I and our \ncapable staffs will be keeping a very close eye on the Joint Strike \nFighter production. It is vital that aircraft meet its cost estimates \nand meet its time schedules.\n\n  At this point, the first of those copies is expected to be delivered \non time to Eglin Air Force Base in May 2010, and the first \noperationally capable versions of the fighter are expected to be \ndelivered to the Marine Corps in 2012, the Air Force in 2013, and the \nNavy in 2015.\n  This is not to say we should take, as I said, our eyes off the \nprogram. We need to track continuous progress on the F-35 to ensure \nthat development costs leading to production remain stable.\n  I am persuaded, as I hope the majority of this body will be, that on \nthe issue of whether the F-22 program should continue, the President, \nthe Secretary of Defense, the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, the Air Force Chief of Staff and the Secretary of the \nAir Force are all correct: Ending the F-22 program now is vital to \nenabling the Department to bridge its current fighter capability to a \nmore capable fifth-generation fighter force that is best equipped to \nboth meet the needs of our deployed forces today and the emerging \nthreats of tomorrow.\n  Finally, the chairman and I are not unaware that this will lead to \nthe loss of jobs in certain States in certain production facilities \naround the country. We know this is very tough, particularly in times \nof high unemployment across the country. But I would like to make the \nargument, No. 1, that the F-35, the Joint Strike Fighter, once it gets \ninto production, will also be a job creator.\n  But I would also point out that the purpose of building weapons is \nnot to create jobs. The purpose is simply to defend this Nation's \nnational security. We have an obligation to be careful stewards of all \nour taxpayers' dollars but, most importantly, those taxpayers' dollars \nthat go to the defense of this Nation should be first and foremost what \ncan best defend the Nation's national security in times when we are in \ntwo wars and facing future threats that are, indeed, formidable in the \nview of most.\n  We are not without sympathy for the parts of our country, including \nthe State of Georgia, where there are a large number of jobs that are \nat risk. Our sympathy is with them, and we will do everything we can to \nprovide job opportunities, including in the defense industries across \nthis country. But we cannot argue that we should spend taxpayers' \ndollars for weapons systems simply to create or keep jobs. That is not \nthe use of taxpayers' dollars. If we want to do that, then there are \nmany other programs we should fully fund to help create jobs and small \nbusiness opportunities across this Nation.\n  This issue, I hope, will continue to be debated today and that we \ncould resolve it, hopefully, sometime tomorrow morning with a final \nvote.\n  I know, from previous experience, there are perhaps 100 or more \namendments that await the consideration of this body on the Department \nof Defense authorization bill. This is, obviously, a very important \nissue. This issue, perhaps, is maybe even more important than the $1.75 \nbillion we are talking about. This debate is about whether we are going \nto make the tough decisions to most wisely and most expeditiously \ndefend this Nation and spend those dollars wisely.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, first let me thank Senator McCain for his \nvery comprehensive, thorough, and compelling argument relative to the \nF-22.\n  This last point about the number of amendments which we expect would \nbe, if not offered, at least proposed and considered, we need those \namendments to come to the floor.\n  We have a lot of work ahead of us. I know it is a statement of high \nambition to suggest that we try to finish the bill this week. But I \nthink we are obligated to use the time wisely. There are not going to \nbe votes today. We attempted to schedule a vote prior to lunch today, \nbut as an accommodation to some Senators, we did not do that. We then \nattempted to schedule a vote for tomorrow morning. That effort did not \nsucceed last night. But as Senator McCain said, we are trying to see if \nwe can't schedule that today.\n  In the meantime, while we are awaiting some other speakers, \napparently on this amendment, we would welcome those who are \nconsidering amendments; that they get those to us and our staffs so we \ncan begin the arduous work of going through those amendments and \ndetermining which ones we might be able to accept, which ones we \ncannot, so that those who want to proceed, even if we cannot accept \nthose amendments, can then indicate they wish to debate.\n  The floor is open now to debate. We await other speakers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the Levin-\nMcCain amendment to strike excessive funding in this bill for the F-22. \nI want to briefly outline why this amendment is in the best interests \nof our national defense and our fiscal future.\n  This amendment represents the best of leadership that our Nation has \nto offer. Senator McCain and President Obama have put political parties \naside and have acted to protect taxpayers at a time when our fiscal \ncircumstances require us to make difficult choices. And Chairman Levin \nhas supported their efforts. They are willing to make hard choices. \nCongress must follow their wise leadership.\n  The media has reported that our budget deficit now exceeds $1 \ntrillion. We have provided middle class tax cuts, first-time homebuyer \ntax credits and invested resources in order to turn this economy \naround. But we have to reexamine our other spending choices and say no \nto excessive spending. The F-22 embodies spending to an excess, and it \nborrows from key operations and maintenance and personnel accounts to \ndo so.\n  The Secretary of Defense, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and \nour Commander-in-Chief have said we do not need any more F-22s. In \nfact, they say that the costs of acquiring and maintaining these \naircraft, which have ballooned far beyond the Pentagon's original \nestimates, are hindering our ability to make much-needed investments in \nother necessary programs.\n  It is not only the Obama administration. President Bush and Secretary \nRumsfeld also agreed that this is an area where we can show restraint \nand help strained taxpayers. The Levin-McCain amendment is the right \npolicy for the country--armed services leadership and Presidents from \nboth parties agree.\n  We should be listening when the Air Force tells us that the 187 F-22s \nthat we have are enough. Our President has shown the wisdom to listen \nto our uniformed leaders. Now only Congress stands in the way of saving \ntaxpayers $1.75 billion.\n  The F-22 has never supported a single mission in Iraq or Afghanistan. \nIt is time to reassert the actual military priorities of today. It is \ntrue that the F-22 supports jobs, sprinkled around our nation. But we \nneed to focus on weapons programs that create jobs an also serve a \nmodern military purpose. As the chairman and ranking member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee have said, the F-35 represents the \nfuture of our fighter fleet. As we look to the future, I simply cannot \nlend my support to this effort to allow unnecessary expansion of a \nprogram at the expense of the American and Coloradan taxpayer.\n  There are far more useful ways to create and maintain jobs that \nactually enhance our military readiness. Phasing out expansion of the \nF-22 fleet will\n\n[[Page S7453]]\n\nallow needed funding to be reallocated to more important, pressing \nneeds of our military. Let's pass a Defense authorization bill actually \ncontains the requests that our military has made. Madam President, \n$1.75 billion for the F-22 has not been requested, and I agree with \nChairman Levin, Senator McCain, Presidents Obama and Bush.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in this effort to show fiscal restraint. \nSupport the Levin-McCain amendment. The best way to defend our country \nis to listen to our military when it tells us to change the way we \ninvest. Our fiscal health and our national security both depend on it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/14/senate-section/article/S7453-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business to speak about the health care deliberations we are \nundertaking. I know we are under the Defense authorization bill. My \nremarks should not take that long.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, as I indicated, I rise today to talk \nabout health care reform and the hard truths that have so far been not \nhidden but I do not think have been very much aware to many Americans.\n  I was inspired to come to the Senate floor today because we are \nholding hearings in the HELP Committee--and we are holding hearings in \nthe Finance Committee--and a series of events in the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee made me recall the observations of a \nwell-respected public opinion analyst, pollster Daniel Yankelovich, \nfounder of the New York Times/Yankelovich Poll.\n  The HELP Committee has been struggling--well, we have been working \nhard; ``struggling'' probably is not the right word; and many thanks to \nthe chairman, Chris Dodd, our ranking member, Mike Enzi, and the \nmembers of the HELP Committee--but we have been going through a \nmultiweek markup that I think has been characterized by some very \nwishful thinking on the part of the majority members of that committee; \nnamely, the hope or the wish that they can somehow not reveal the very \nreal costs and tradeoffs raised by their health care reform bill. I \nthink the American people ought to become more and more aware of this.\n  The bill the HELP Committee is marking up establishes all sorts of \nnew government programs, all sorts of new government mandates and \ncontrols--all justified by the need to ``rein in health care costs'' \nand ``increase health insurance coverage.'' I know those are two very \ngood and noble pursuits, which I support wholeheartedly. As a matter of \nfact, I think Republicans now have about six bills to do the same \nthing. They do not get much attention, but we have six bills.\n  But there is a big problem with this bill. It does neither of these \nthings, in my opinion. It neither reduces costs, nor does it \nsignificantly increase coverage. In fact, it significantly increases \ncosts for very little gain--``costs,'' c-o-s-t-s. Remember that word. \nBut my colleagues on the HELP Committee continue to wish and to hope \nthey can obscure this reality through a barrage, really, of speeches \nand rhetoric and what I call misleading figures.\n  It has been this behavior that has caused me to recall Mr. \nYankelovich's observations on something called the evolution of \nopinion. I am going to use that as the basis of my remarks--the \nevolution of opinion. The article was in Fortune magazine, and it \njogged my memory in this regard. But, in any event, I think it serves \nas an important illustration of the health care reform process so far. \nMr. Yankelovich observed that the evolution of a person's opinion could \nbe traced through a continuum of seven stages. That is a fancy way of \nsaying there are steps you go through when you are trying to think \nsomething through.\n  First, we have had daunting awareness: the realization that our \nhealth care system was not working for every American and needed to be \naddressed. I think everybody understands that.\n  The second stage, greater urgency: the economy began to go south and \npeople who used to rely on their employer for health insurance began \nlosing their jobs.\n  Then there is the third stage: reaching for solutions. Our committee \nhas held hearings and began to meet with stakeholders. The \nadministration met with stakeholders. The stakeholders, I think, \nprobably met in good faith. And it has only been recently they have \ndiscovered they may have signed on to something that is very illusory, \nto say the least.\n  Fourth, the stage where many on the HELP Committee and elsewhere have \narrived at today: the wishful thinking stage, the well-intentioned, \nromantic, simplistic, perhaps naive moment where all one sees are the \nbenefits, without considering the consequences--the law of unintended \neffects. For example: the totally misleading claim by the majority that \nthe new data from the Congressional Budget Office revealed a much lower \nscore for this bill, $597 billion--a lot of money--while still \nexpanding health insurance coverage to 97 percent of Americans. This \nclaim is the very definition of ``wishful thinking.'' But facts are \nstubborn things. The actual CBO numbers say this bill leaves 34 million \npeople still uninsured. That is not 97 percent coverage. In order to \ngain anywhere near 97 percent coverage, we would have to significantly \nexpand Medicaid--a very expensive proposition which, according to CBO, \nadds about $500 billion or more to the cost of this bill.\n  More wishful thinking: The $597 billion cost was further artificially \nlowered through several budget maneuvers, such as a multiyear phase-in \nand a long-term care insurance program that will increase costs \nsignificantly outside the 10-year budget window CBO is required to use. \nHere we are passing a long-term insurance bill that goes beyond 10 \nyears that CBO cannot even score.\n  After taking these realities into account, a more accurate 10-year \nscore of this bill is closer to $2 trillion. I said that right: not $1 \ntrillion--$2 trillion.\n  This is when we should arrive at the fifth stage of opinion making: \nweighing the choices. Since the true cost of this bill is approximately \n$2 trillion, we must own up to the American public about the tradeoffs. \nWe must finally understand that the tradeoffs threaten a health care \nsystem that polls tell us has a 77-percent satisfaction rate.\n  This is not to say we should not undertake any reforms, but we need \nto honestly discuss the costs and benefits of reform proposals. And the \nmajority's proposal is high on cost and low on benefits.\n  The No. 1 tradeoff that Americans need to know is, higher taxes. \nRemember when the President promised: If you make under $250,000, you \nwill not see your taxes increased, that you would actually see a tax \ncut. Well, like so many other pledges, those promises had an expiration \ndate, and that date is rapidly approaching.\n  The bill raises $36 billion in the first 10 years in new taxes on \nindividuals who do not purchase health insurance. That is a penalty. It \nraises another $52 billion in new taxes on employers who do not offer \ntheir employees health insurance.\n  As an aside, guess who suffers when the employer's taxes get raised? \nIt certainly is not the employer. It is the employee who gets laid off \nor does not get a raise. It is the applicant who does not get hired. \nEven President Obama's own Budget Director admits this fact.\n  At least one economic survey estimates that an employer mandate to \nprovide health insurance, such as the\n\n[[Page S7454]]\n\none in the Kennedy-Dodd bill, would put 33 percent of uninsured workers \nat risk for being laid off--33 percent of uninsured workers. The study \nwent on to say that ``workers who would lose their jobs are \ndisproportionately likely to be high school dropouts, minority, and \nfemale.'' It is a job killer for the very people whom the bill \nostensibly seeks to help.\n  These new taxes do not come close to paying for this bill, and the \nideas that have been coming out of the Finance Committee, on which I am \nalso privileged to serve, the House of Representatives--the so-called \npeople's body--and the administration prove that these new taxes will \nbe just the first of many.\n  One option: a new and higher income tax on taxpayers with earnings in \nthe top income tax brackets--there is some press on that as of now--\nincluding small businesses--essentially a small business surtax--to pay \nfor government-run health care. Keep in mind that this surtax is in \naddition to the higher income taxes the President is already calling \nfor in his budget.\n  The President's budget proposal calls for raising the top two \nindividual tax rates in 2011. Many small businesses file their tax \nreturns as individual returns, and the National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses, NFIB, estimates that 50 percent of the small \nbusiness owners who employ 20 to 249 workers fall into the top two \nbrackets. When these higher income taxes are combined with the proposed \nsurtax to pay for the government-run health care, it means that a small \nbusiness could see its tax bills go up by as much as 11 percent--11 \npercent--when this health care reform bill finally takes effect--an \nincome tax rate increase of about 33 percent over what they pay today.\n  But it does not stop there. Under the proposal the House is expected \nto unveil, possibly today, they leave the door open for even more tax \nincreases on small businesses. That proposal is expected to allow, in \n2013, for the small business surtax to be raised by several additional \npercentage points if health care costs are higher than expected, which \nis likely.\n  These higher income taxes would be a devastating hit on our Nation's \nsmall businesses--the same small businesses that create roughly 70 \npercent of the jobs in this country and are the backbone of our \neconomy. We should not be raising taxes on these job creators if we \nwant our economy to rebound and grow and expand.\n  Small businesses in Kansas tell me they feel they are already \nstretched to the limit, and they worry that to pay the additional taxes \ncalled for in the President's budget, not to mention an additional \nsmall business surtax to pay for a government-run health care program, \nthey will have to cut back elsewhere--``cut back,'' meaning layoffs; \ncutbacks, meaning really it is the worst thing you could do for the \neconomic catalyst of our country, the small business community. Make no \nmistake, these will be difficult choices. They will have to reduce the \nwages and benefits of current employees. They will have to pass their \ncosts on to their customers. They will have to lay off workers or not \nhire new employees. None of these are good options for workers, small \nbusinesses, or our economy.\n  But higher taxes are just one of the ways the majority wants to pay \nfor this massive expansion of government. The other method? The other \nmethod will be cuts to Medicare. You heard me right: Medicare, cuts to \nMedicare, cuts to the reimbursements to providers to our senior \ncitizens, cuts we have been trying to prevent, where we have added \nmoney in almost every session we have been in.\n  There would be $150 billion from the hospitals. The hospitals have \nagreed to this with their national organizations but funny thing: The \nhospitals from Kansas came back to me and said: Not on your life. For a \nperson who has worked hard to prevent cuts in that market basket of \nprovider reimbursements to keep our rural health care delivery system \nwhole, it comes to me as a great surprise that their national \norganizations would sit down and say: OK, we are going to give up $150 \nbillion, only to learn a couple days or weeks later that some in the \nHouse say: That is not enough. So they didn't have a deal--and another \nfew hundred billion from the physicians. I haven't heard any agreement \non that from the physicians.\n\n  Tens of billions from home health care agencies and radiology and \nhome oxygen and PhRMA. Let's don't forget PhRMA, who agreed to a \ncertain amount of cuts--I think it was $80 billion--but now they have \nlearned that figure isn't firm. So whoever else gets strong-armed or \nweak-kneed into making a deal with this administration, you better be \ncareful.\n  Again, when doctors and hospitals and pharmacists and home health \nagencies get their reimbursements slashed by Medicare or Medicaid, who \npays the price? It is not the provider, at least not at first. It is \nthe people with private insurance who pay a hidden tax to make up the \ndifference--some $88.8 billion per year, according to a recent Milliman \nstudy. Once the provider runs out of private payers to shift this cost \ndeficiency onto, who pays? It is the patients who lose access to a \ndoctor or a hospital or a pharmacist or a home health agency.\n  In addition to cutting Medicare payments, this bill will dump, by \nsome estimates, well over a million new people onto a government-run \nhealth care plan which will never pay providers enough to cover their \ncosts, despite any rhetoric otherwise. As this number grows and the \nprivate market shrinks, the decrease in the number of doctors and \nhospitals and other providers will be inevitable. We see that already. \nWe already have rationing. We already have shortages. We already have \ndoctors and providers who say: I am sorry, I am not reimbursed to the \nextent I can stay in business and offer you Medicare. So rationing is \nnot a scare word, it is something that is happening now. It will simply \nnot be possible for them to keep their doors open on the margins that \nthe government will pay them. And that is when rationing of health care \nwill become a way of life in this country.\n  Oh, I can see it now. It will either be by age or by test or by the \ncomparative effectiveness research golden ring that CMS--that is \nanother acronym--an outfit that works for the Department of Health and \nHuman Services. These are the bean counters who look in this way at \nhealth care and don't look at the real effects, and I see what can \nhappen.\n  These are the tradeoffs the American people need to know about in \nthis bill. Yep, $2 trillion in new spending, higher taxes, job-killing \nemployer mandates, and rationed health care. And for what? To overhaul \na system with which 77 percent of Americans are satisfied.\n  I offered several amendments in the HELP markup just this morning, \nattempting to force the committee to face stage 5--remember my Fortune \nmagazine and my stages of evolution of thought--to truly weigh the \nchoices, that is the next stage. My amendments would have prevented \nFederal health subsidies from being funded through higher taxes on \nemployers, higher taxes on individuals and families or through cuts to \nMedicare. All three were defeated in a party-line vote. I wasn't alone \nin trying to get the committee to weigh the choices in this bill. \nSenator Alexander spoke very credibly as a former State governor about \nthe fiscal catastrophe that expanding Medicaid eligibility will cause \nfor the States. Again, he was defeated by a party-line vote.\n  How can we ignore the very real consequences of raising taxes on \nindividuals and employers in a recession--some say the worst recession \nsince in the 1930s? How can we deny that further cutting Medicare will \nincrease costs for everyone else and possibly eliminate access to \nhealth care for our seniors? How can we turn a blind eye to all the \nStates that are already facing a financial meltdown and force them to \ntake on billions of dollars of new Medicaid obligations?\n  Some are still stuck in stage 4, still hanging on to their wishful \nthinking.\n  Well, I am ready to move on to stage 6, and probably everybody else \nis as well here on the floor. It is called taking a stand. I hope we \ncan all take a stand to preserve the system that works well for the \nvast majority of Americans and to consider a more cost-conscious, \nrealistic, and patient-friendly approach to greater health care reform.\n  By far the most important stage for us is--yes, the final stage--\nstage 7:\n\n[[Page S7455]]\n\nmaking a responsible judgment. The policies in this bill are very \nexpensive, and the American people need to know that someway, somehow \nthey will have to pay for them. So we must thoroughly examine the cost \nand the tradeoffs in health care reform. We cannot simply engage in \nwishful thinking. The American people expect us to make responsible \njudgments. There is simply too much at stake.\n  I understand the leadership of this body is in a dash, a rush to \nfinish the hearings in the HELP Committee to produce a bill, as well as \nto force the Finance Committee to come up with a markup of a bill to \npay for all this. I don't know how you pay for $2 trillion while the \nFinance Committee is talking about $350 billion and those are very \ncontroversial. I have a suggestion. I think we ought to put a big \nbanner right up here where the President is not, right over there. I \ndon't think the President would mind very much, and it could just say, \n``Do No Harm.'' Then maybe we could put something underneath that and \nsay: ``Slow Down'' or maybe in the language of my State ``Whoa.'' And \nthen put that in the back of the HELP Committee, put in the back of the \nFinance Committee, and let's do the job right.\n  Mr. WICKER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. WICKER. I thank the Senator from Kansas for his remarks. I think \nit is interesting and perhaps symbolic that his cell phone was ringing \noff the wall or off of his belt when he was beginning to make his \nremarks. I think perhaps that is symbolic of what we are beginning to \nhear in the Senate as well as in the House of Representatives from the \npublic. It is not just from the rightwing; it is from Main Street \nmedia. It is from the Washington Post last Friday. It is from liberal \ncommentators such as Michael Kensley last Friday who say: Let's slow \ndown on this.\n  I think what the American people might be saying is that they have \ngone through this hierarchy of decisionmaking and that this is not the \nkind of health care they were promised last year. We were told health \ncare would save money for Americans. Now we are hearing it is going to \ncost $1 trillion to $2 trillion, perhaps even $3 trillion. We were told \nthat if Americans were satisfied with their insurance, they would be \nable to keep it. Now we are told they would be moved into a public \nplan. We didn't hear about cuts to Medicare when this was being debated \nlast year in the Presidential campaign, and we certainly didn't hear \nabout higher taxes on middle-income Americans.\n  So I was glad to help the Senator from Kansas avoid taking those \nphone calls while he was speaking.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If my distinguished colleague--well, I will take back my \ntime and yield back for any comments he may want to make. The person on \nthe other end of the phone call, was he for the health care bill or was \nhe against it?\n  Mr. WICKER. Well, I would not have presumed to answer the Senator's \nphone call. I simply put it back in the cloakroom. But I am hoping it \nis symbolic of the American people--\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Whether for or against, I hope the Senator from \nMississippi would have explained that we both have some real concerns, \nand we hope we can get real health care reform.\n  Mr. WICKER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I also thank the Senator.\n  Let me just give one quick example of what I am talking about with \nregard to Medicare. The President of the Kansas Pharmacists Association \nis from a very small town out West. We conduct a lot of listening \ntours, and we go into the pharmacy. The pharmacists, we ought to give \nthem a GS-15 salary because they are the people who deal with Medicare \nPart D. That is the prescription drug program we give to seniors; it is \nvery popular.\n  Let's say a lady named Mildred came in to see her pharmacist there \nand Mildred talked to Tom, the pharmacist, and said: What is this \ndoughnut hole? And Tom says: Well, that is where you have to pay a \nbigger copayment. And she says: Well, can't I get a new kind of program \nor something else that will help me out here? He said: Yes, there are \n47 new programs you can choose from. Mildred, the one that you want is \nright here. She says: Good. Then I am not going to get hurt with the \ncost of the prescriptions I need. He says: But I can't offer it to you? \nWhy? Because I only get reimbursed 71 percent.\n  That is about the national average. How on Earth can we expect every \npharmacist all around the country to administer--and they are the ones \ndoing the administering; it isn't the Area Agency on Aging or the 1-\n800-Medicare. So he had to tell her that the program in Medicare Part D \nthat would cover the doughnut hole, he didn't get reimbursed enough and \ncouldn't offer it. Well, he helped her out. All pharmacists try to do \nthat. That is where we are.\n  Or if Mildred goes to the doctor and the doctor says: I am sorry, I \ncan't take any more Medicare patients--that is happening. It is real. \nThis bill exacerbates that--exacerbates it. That is why I am so upset \nand why I came to the floor today.\n  I will go back to the HELP Committee in good faith to work with my \ncolleagues and we will try to make it bipartisan. I know on Thursday we \nare supposed to have a markup in the Finance Committee--marching orders \nfrom the leadership around here, right in the middle of a Defense \nauthorization bill. We don't need marching orders. We need to slow \ndown. We need to slow down and get this right.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the members of the Armed \nServices Committee for their tireless work on this bill. I thank \nChairman Levin and Senator McCain for their amendment to strike $1.75 \nbillion in unnecessary funding for the F-22 aircraft.\n  I strongly support those provisions of the Defense authorization bill \nwhich aim to support critical defense spending priorities such as \nproviding fair compensation and health care to members of the Armed \nForces and their families, enhancing the capability of our troops to \nconduct successful counterinsurgency operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, improving our ability to counter nontraditional and \nasymmetric threats and terminating troubled and wasteful military \nspending programs in favor of those which are deemed more efficient and \neffective.\n  Also, I strongly support the recommendation of Secretary Gates that \nwe must rebalance the Defense budget in order to institutionalize and \nenhance our capabilities to fight current wars as well as likely future \nthreats. As events in Iraq and Afghanistan have demonstrated, the \nmilitary challenges currently before us are unlike conventional wars of \nthe past. I am pleased this bill provides the resources necessary to \nprotect our troops in counterinsurgency missions by providing \nadditional funding for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles or \nMRAPs; U.S. Special Operations Command, or SOCOM, and the Joint \nImprovised Explosive Device Defeat Organization, as well as supporting \nthe vital train and equip mission for Afghan security forces. This \ntraining is an essential prerequisite for achieving stability and \nsecurity in Afghanistan and succeeding in our ongoing counterinsurgency \nmission.\n  These and other provisions of the bill aim to institutionalize many \nof the administration's recommendations regarding future Defense \npriorities based on the conclusion of military officials--including \nSecretary Gates, Admiral Mullen, and General Petraeus--that irregular \nwarfare is not just a short-term challenge; rather, it is a long-term \nreality that requires realignment of both military strategy and \nspending. As Secretary Gates has said, this rebalancing need not come \nat the expense of conventional weapon programs, which are deeply \nembedded in the Department of Defense, in its bureaucracy, in the \ndefense industry, and in the Congress. At the same time, we must move \naway from funding Cold War-era weapons programs with an eye toward the \nfuture and accept that threat requirements have changed. This requires \ndifficult decisions, sacrifice, and change, such as ending the F-22 \nproduction line which the White House and the Department of Defense\n\n[[Page S7456]]\n\nhave concluded will save valuable resources that could be more usefully \nemployed.\n\n  As President Obama explained yesterday in a letter to the Senate, \nthis determination was not made casually. It was the result of several \nanalyses conducted by the Department of Defense regarding future U.S. \nmilitary needs and an estimate of likely future capabilities of our \nadversaries.\n  The F-22 has never flown over Iraq or Afghanistan because it is not \nthe most efficient or effective aircraft to meet the current needs of \nthe military. Its readiness has been questioned, it has proven too \ncostly, and continued production will come at the expense of more \ncritical defense priorities. I say critical defense priorities. But \nthis debate is really not about the future of the F-22. This is just \nthe first test as to whether we are ready to end unnecessary spending \nand rebalance the defense budget to better reflect the reality of \ncounterinsurgency missions.\n  Today I voice my support for the Levin-McCain amendment which \nterminates procurement of additional F-22 fighter aircraft when the \ncurrent contract ends at 187 jets.\n  In December 2004, the Department of Defense concluded that 183 F-22s \nwere sufficient to meet our military needs, especially given the future \nrole of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which is a half generation newer \naircraft and more capable in a number of areas, including electronic \nwarfare and combating enemy air defenses.\n  Ending the F-22 production line at 187 meets the needs of our \nmilitary and allows us to purchase equipment deemed more efficient and \neffective. According to Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen:\n\n       If the Air Force is forced to buy additional F-22s beyond \n     what has been requested, it will come at the expense of other \n     . . . priorities--and require deferring capabilities in the \n     areas we believe are much more critical for our national \n     defense.\n\n  Some of my colleagues have argued that ending the procurement of F-\n22s will have a significant impact in terms of jobs. Of course, I share \nthe concern of keeping jobs and am focused, first and foremost, on \npreserving jobs and job creation. At the same time, however, I believe \njob losses incurred in the F-22 line will be offset by an increased F-\n35 production. Moreover, I agree with my colleague, Senator McCain, \nthat ``in these difficult economic times, we cannot afford business as \nusual. We cannot afford to continue to purchase weapons systems that \nare not absolutely vital . . . '' to our national security interests.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Levin-McCain \namendment which reaffirms America's commitments to our troops by ending \nwasteful spending and enhancing military readiness. This reflects the \nsound and bipartisan judgment of two U.S. Presidents, two Secretaries \nof Defense, three Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as the current \nSecretary and Chief of Staff of the Air Force. I hope we can pass a \nDefense authorization bill that supports the sound judgment of our \nmilitary leaders and President and avoid wasteful spending of precious \nnational resources.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       Enslaved African Americans\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the Senate for \nadopting my resolution that authorizes a marker to be placed in the new \nCapitol Visitor Center. The marker recognizes the role of African \nAmericans in the building of this great U.S. Capitol Building.\n  I also thank Susan and my legislative director, Jim Stowers, who have \nbeen tireless in their work and certainly have done an incredible job \nin bringing forth this resolution, along with many others we have been \nworking on to try and recognize the tremendous work and labor that was \nput into building this magnificent symbol of our freedom and \nparticularly that which was done by the slave labor in this country \nwhen the Capitol was built. Those two individuals have done a \nremarkable job in working on this resolution. I am very grateful to \nthem and all of the work they have put into it.\n  I also thank Congressman John Lewis for his unbelievable leadership \nin moving this resolution through the House and for his leadership of \nthe Slave Labor Task Force. I had the privilege of serving with \nCongressman Lewis in the House, and upon my election to the Senate, we \nworked together on a number of issues, including funding for the Little \nRock Central High Visitor Center and the Slave Labor Task Force. It has \nbeen an honor to work with him on these very important issues. He is a \ntremendous gentleman to work with on all issues, but I have had the \nparticular pleasure of being able to work with him on these two. It has \nbeen a great learning experience for me and certainly an honor.\n  The crowning feature of our Nation's Capitol is the majestic statue \nthat stands atop its dome. It was designed by an American, Thomas \nCrawford, to represent ``Freedom triumphant in War and Peace.'' It has \nbecome known simply as the Statue of Freedom to those of us who come in \nand out of the Capitol on a daily basis.\n  Thomas Crawford cast the five-piece plaster model of his statue at \nhis studio in Rome, Italy. Before it was shipped to the United States \nto be cast, Crawford passed away. Once it arrived in Washington, DC, \nproblems soon arose. A workman who assembled the plaster model for all \nto see, just as it is downstairs, soon got into a pay dispute, and when \nit came time to disassemble it and move it to a mill in Maryland where \nit would be cast in bronze, he refused to reveal how it had been taken \napart. Work on the statue stalled until a man named Philip Reid solved \nthe mystery.\n  Mr. Reid was an enslaved African American who worked for the owner of \nthe foundry selected to cast the bronze statue. Mr. Reid figured out \nhow to disassemble the plaster model by attaching an iron hook to the \nstatue's head, and he gently lifted the top section until a hairline \ncrack appeared. The crack indicated where the joint was located. Then \nhe repeated that operation until all five sections were visible.\n  If you go down to the Capitol Visitor Center, you can see this huge \nplaster cast and you can see how large it is, how cumbersome it is, and \nhow difficult it would be to work with even in today's age with the \ntools and all of the mechanics we have. Yet this gentleman on his own \nfigured it out with very little other than just a hook to be able to \npull up and figure out where he would find that path of least \nresistance.\n  We know about Philip Reid today because Fisk Mills, the son of the \nfoundry owner, told the story to a historian who recorded it in 1869. \nIt describes Philip Reid as an ``expert and an admirable workman'' and \n``highly esteemed by all who know him.''\n  Philip Reid's story is probably the best known among the enslaved \nAfrican Americans who worked so diligently on our Nation's Capitol. \nUnfortunately, there are many others who worked in obscurity.\n  When the Capitol was first being built in the late 1700s and early \n1800s, enslaved African Americans worked in all facets of its \nconstruction. They worked in carpentry, masonry, carting, rafting, \nroofing, plastering, glazing, painting, and sawing. These slaves were \nrented from their owners by the Federal Government for about $60 a \nyear.\n  For nearly 200 years, the stories of these slave laborers were mostly \nunknown to the visitors of this great building, our Capitol. Then in \n1999, old pay stubs were discovered that showed slaves were directly \ninvolved in the construction of the U.S. Capitol.\n  To recognize these contributions, I sponsored a resolution in July of \n2000 to establish a special task force to make recommendations to honor \nthe slave laborers who worked on the construction of this great \nCapitol.\n  The bicameral, bipartisan Slave Labor Task Force brought together \nhistorians and interested officials to work on this issue. In 2007, the \ntask force presented the congressional leadership with our \nrecommendations.\n  This resolution fulfills one of those recommendations, the resolution \nwe passed in the Senate. It authorizes a marker to be placed in \nEmancipation Hall to serve as a formal public recognition of the \ncritical role that\n\n[[Page S7457]]\n\nenslaved African Americans played in the construction of the Capitol.\n\n  Much of the original Capitol no longer stands, due to the fires of \nwar and renovations to create more space for the ever-growing body. In \nfact, some of the stones that were removed when the Capitol was \nrenovated have been stored in Rock Creek Park. It is our hope that \nthose very stones that were quarried years and years ago by the slaves \nwill be used to make the CVC marker we hope to place in the CVC.\n  I also would like to take a moment to remember one of the members of \nthe Slave Labor Task Force, Curtis Sykes, who was a native of Little \nRock, AR, and an original member of Arkansas's Black Advisory \nCommittee.\n  I asked Mr. Sykes if he would come and serve on this committee. I \nselected him because he was, first and foremost, an educator. During \nhis time on the task force, he was focused on the need to ensure that \nas many citizens as possible be made aware of the contribution of \nenslaved African Americans in the building of this great U.S. Capitol.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Sykes passed away before our work was completed. \nNevertheless, he made important and lasting contributions to our work. \nI know he is looking down with a great sense of pride for what we have \nbeen able to accomplish.\n  The heart of this effort and the mission of the Capitol Visitor \nCenter is education. It was at the root of what Mr. Sykes stood for, \nand it certainly has been at the root of what our task force has been \nprofessing and wanting more than anything to create for the visitors \nwho come through our Nation's Capitol. That is why there is no more \nappropriate place for this marker to recognize those who built the \nCapitol than our new Capitol Visitor Center, an education model in \nitself.\n  The plaster model of the Statue of Freedom, the same one that was \nseparated by Philip Reid, now stands tall in Emancipation Hall of the \nCVC for all visitors to see. Visitors look at the model each and every \nday and can compare it to the actual statue standing atop the Capitol \ndome. I want to make sure every visitor who comes to the CVC, our \nCapitol Visitor Center, knows how that statue got up there and that \nthey know the story of Philip Reid and the other enslaved African \nAmericans who played such a critical part in the building of this \nCapitol--our symbol of freedom in this Nation.\n  In closing, I thank Chairman Schumer and Ranking Member Bennett of \nthe Rules Committee for their help and guidance on this resolution. I \nalso certainly cannot finish my remarks without offering my tremendous \nthanks to my colleague and friend, Senator Chambliss from Georgia, who, \nalong with Senator Schumer, was an original cosponsor of this \nresolution.\n  Senator Chambliss has done a tremendous job. He is a delight to work \nwith, and I am not only grateful for the hard work he has put in on \nthis issue but other issues we have worked on, but without a doubt for \nhis friendship in working on so many issues.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for again adopting this \nresolution in the Senate. We look forward to being able to add many \nother of those recommendations of the task force as we move forward and \nas our Capitol Visitor Center continues to grow.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to concur with my good \nfriend from Arkansas with respect to H. Con. Res. 135, which \nacknowledges the role slave labor played in constructing the U.S. \nCapitol and thank her for her leadership on this issue. Once again, she \nand I had an opportunity to work on an issue that is important to \nAmerica and to Americans.\n  Senator Lincoln has been a true champion for the common man, as well \nas for all Americans, on any number of issues. It has been a great \npleasure to work with her on any number of issues over the years. I do \nthank her for her great leadership on this resolution.\n  The story of the very building in which we are standing is a story of \nfreedom. It is a story of how people from every corner of the globe \narrived to have a chance to steer their own lives, shape their own \ndestinies, and toil at tasks of their own choosing, not those dictated \nby birth or caste.\n  Sadly, however, that shot at freedom was not given to everyone. For \nthose who were brought here against their will and forced to toil for \nsomeone else's gain, freedom was a vague concept--for others but not \nfor them. Slavery will forever remain a shameful tarnish on the shining \ncity that is America. Unbeknownst to most Americans, slave labor helped \nbuild our Nation's Capitol. It is one of the saddest ironies of our \nhistory that the very foundation of this building in which we have \ndebated the most fundamental questions of liberty was laid by those in \nshackles. They labored in the heat, cold, and dust of quarries in \nVirginia and Maryland to cut the stone upon which rests this temple of \nliberty.\n\n  We know very little about these workers and artisans, and of the few \nrecords that were kept at the time, only several first names survived, \nnext to those of their owners and sums paid for the grueling labor. \nFrom 1793 to 1826, up to 800 slaves at one time painted, roofed, sawed, \nglazed, and perfected this building which represents a freedom most of \nthem were never to know. They laid the foundation still visible at the \nCapitol's east front. They carved the marble columns that witnessed so \nmany of the deliberations on the future of our Nation in the old Senate \nChamber. They erected and polished the tall marble columns that lend \nStatuary Hall such elegance and grace.\n  As the Civil War ripped this Nation asunder over the very issues of \nhuman liberty, a slave artisan named Philip Reid cast the statue that \ncrowns this very building, aptly named ``Freedom.'' I am pleased to \njoin with my colleague from Arkansas and my House colleague from my \nhome State of Georgia, Congressman John Lewis, in the submission of S. \nCon. Res. 135, which directs the Architect of the Capitol to place a \nmarker in Emancipation Hall of the Capitol Visitor Center acknowledging \nthe role these slave laborers played in the construction of this \nbuilding and to accurately reflect its history. I would especially like \nto thank Congressman Lewis for his work in heading the Slave Laborer's \nTask Force, which recommended that such a marker be designated and \nerected.\n  This marker is a small way of showing our gratitude to these \nAmericans, but it is a necessary and proper one.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1469\n\n  Mr. President, I now wish to move to another issue. It is the issue \nof the McCain-Levin amendment that is before us on the Defense \nauthorization bill. In the Defense authorization mark, we filed an \namendment seeking to add seven F-22s for additional procurement by the \nAir Force. And as a part of that amendment, we provided all the offsets \nnecessary within the budget to purchase those seven aircraft. That \namendment passed in the full committee and now is a permanent part of \nthe mark. The amendment by Senators McCain and Levin seeks to strip \nthose seven airplanes out of that mark and to deny--to basically shut \ndown--the production line for the F-22.\n  First, with respect to this debate, let me put it in context and draw \nfrom a statement by a Washington expert in this area who is known for \nbeing bipartisan and level-headed, and that is John Hamre, President \nand CEO of CSIS, and a former Pentagon Assistant Secretary under the \nClinton administration. In an April newsletter, Mr. Hamre stated as \nfollows:\n\n       All of the systems proposed for termination by Secretary \n     Gates in his budget have valid missions and real \n     requirements. None of them is a wasteful program. This is a \n     case of priorities. Secretary Gates has decided that these \n     programs don't enjoy the priority of other programs in a \n     constrained budget, but Congress can and should legitimately \n     question spending priorities. Every individual has a unique \n     calculus for prudent risk. Secretary Gates has rendered his \n     judgment. Not only is it appropriate but necessary for \n     Congress to pass final judgment on this question.\n\n  Mr. Hamre goes on to say:\n\n       I admire Secretary Gates, but it is the duty and obligation \n     of Members of Congress to question his recommendations. These \n     recommendations merit serious and dispassionate debate, not \n     sloganeering. Secretary Gates has made a series of \n     recommendations. Only the Congress can decide what to do for \n     the Nation.\n\n  Congress is the branch of government most directly connected to the \nAmerican people. We have a crucial role in the budget process, which we \nshould not shy away from. Some will say this\n\n[[Page S7458]]\n\nis a debate about jobs and pork-barrel spending, unnecessary spending \nand powerful defense contractors. Hopefully, Mr. Hamre's statements \nhave at least partially dispelled what is truly a myth in this respect.\n  Clearly, jobs are at stake--lots of jobs--and good-paying jobs at \nthat. About 95,000 jobs are going to be lost if the McCain-Levin \namendment passes--95,000 good-paying jobs across America. Several \nthousand of those jobs are in my home State.\n  But this is not a debate about jobs. This is a debate about the \nsecurity of the United States of America, and I am going to talk in \ngreater detail about that in a minute.\n  Since the Korean War, our military has been able to maintain what we \ncall air dominance and air superiority. And what that means is that our \nAir Force has been able to control the skies, to rid the skies of any \nenemy aircraft. We have been able to control the skies by having the \ncapability of taking out any surface-to-air missile that might seek to \nshoot down one of our planes in any conflict with an adversary. Since \nthe Korean War, the United States of America has not lost a foot \nsoldier to tactical enemy aircraft because of our ability to maintain \nair dominance and air superiority. Well, if we do not have the F-22, \nour ability to maintain air dominance and air superiority is in \njeopardy.\n  Over the years, we have been in conflicts in different parts of the \nworld with different adversaries, and there will be additional \nconflicts down the road at some point in time. We hope not, but we know \none thing, and that is if we have an inventory--the capability of \ntaking away the enemy's ability to come after us--then it puts our \nenemy in a difficult position from the standpoint of ever wanting to \nengage us.\n  Let me respond now to some comments that Senator McCain made \nyesterday, and which he and others have made often, about the power of \nthe military industrial complex. Our industrial complex is powerful, \nbut it is not all powerful. If there were not serious national security \ninterests at stake here, we wouldn't be having this debate.\n  Also, there is absolutely nothing unique about the role of outside \ninterests in the case of the F-22. Anyone involved in the current \ndebate we are having in this body over health care, and even this \nweek's hearings regarding Sotomayor, knows that outside interests, \nincluding industry, are intimately involved in trying to influence the \nprocess in regard to those issues. It is simply part of the process in \na democracy, and there is absolutely nothing unique to it in relation \nto the F-22. We wouldn't be here if there were not serious national \nsecurity issues at stake that are worth debating.\n  However, most importantly, this debate is about what kind of military \nwe need today and what kind of military these young people who are \nsitting before us today are going to need in the future. It is about \nthe balance between needing to maintain both the ability to win current \nwars and guard against future challenges. The United States is a global \npower, with global commitments and responsibilities that exceed Iraq \nand Afghanistan. We are also a nation that has fought and won wars \nthrough the use of technology and not just a total reliance on \nmanpower.\n\n  Lastly, we are a nation for whom the basic war-planning assumption \nfor the last 50 years has been that we will control the skies--air \ndominance and air superiority. If that assumption goes away, so does \none tenet of American military strategy and the planning assumptions \nattached to maintaining air dominance.\n  A criticism of the F-22s in the bill is that it is funding something \nDOD does not want. Defense budgets, as enacted into law, always--and I \nemphasize always--contain measures, be they weapons systems or other \nprograms, that DOD does and does not want. As John Hamre said, it is \nthe job of Congress to assess what DOD requests and to render judgment \nthereon. If we do not do that, we have given up our oversight role with \nwhich the constitution entrusts us. Congress is the branch of \ngovernment most connected to the American people. It has an important \nrole to play, and we should not shirk that role and be afraid to \nchallenge DOD's priority, when necessary, and when we know they are \nwrong. This is a debate about military priorities and what kind of \nmilitary we need. We cannot and should not assume that future \nchallenges will be like today. In predicting where the next threat will \ncome from, the United States of America and our tacticians have a \nperfect record: We have been wrong every single time.\n  Jobs are at stake, and a variety of different interests are at stake \nbut, most importantly, what is at stake is our national security and \nour ability to execute our global responsibilities. That is what is at \nstake and that is what I am going to focus on in my remarks today.\n  I would also like to rebut one point critics make about the F-22 not \nflying in missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Senator McCain and \nSecretary Gates have made this point often and over and over again. But \nthere are numerous and very expensive weapon systems in this budget \nthat we are going to be voting on in the next couple weeks that have \nnot, and hopefully will not, be needed in Iraq and Afghanistan--the \nTrident missiles, the ballistic missile system, the DDG 1000. There is \na long list of items that are not going to be used in Iraq and \nAfghanistan that are very expensive and that are contained within this \nauthorization bill. That does not mean these systems are not needed. It \nis merely that they are intended to address a different threat. To \nargue against the need for a system because it is not being used in the \ncurrent conflict is shortsighted and betrays a very short-term \nperspective on our national security.\n  Frankly, if the Pentagon had wanted to use the F-22 in the current \nconflicts, they could have been used. I don't know whether a conscious \ndecision was made otherwise, but the conflict in Afghanistan is not \nover, and we are going to be in that area of the world for a long time \nto come. I suspect that before it is over, we will have F-22s flying in \nthe region.\n  Let me just add that these numerous projects that DOD did not \nrequest--and there are several DOD projects which DOD did not request--\nhave drawn little or no attention. For example, $560 million for \nunrequested FA-18s, $1.2 billion for unrequested MRAPs, and significant \nfunds to support a pay raise above what was recommended by the \nPresident. We spent a lot more money on these items than what DOD \nrequested. So to come up here and say: Well, DOD didn't request any F-\n22s and, therefore, we are to salute and go marching on is something we \nhave never done, we did not do in this bill, and we should not have \ndone in this bill.\n  Let me also address the veto threat regarding the F-22 funding. A \nveto is a serious step and one that should only be taken when the \nwelfare of our troops or national security is at stake. After doing \nextensive research of Defense bills as far back as data is available, I \nhave been unable to find one single example where a veto has been \nthreatened or issued in relation to funding that correctly supports an \nunmet military requirement, as funding for the F-22s in this bill does. \nIt is regrettable the administration needs to issue a veto threat for \nfunding intended to meet a real national security requirement that has \nbeen consistently confirmed by our uniform military leaders.\n  Specifically, in his letter to Senators Levin and McCain, President \nObama states as follows:\n\n       The Department conducted several analyses which support \n     this position to terminate F-22 production at 187.\n\n  I am not sure who was advising the President on this, but that \nstatement is simply not true. Of the countless studies--and I emphasize \nstudy after study after study--that DOD has done, only one recommended \n187 F-22s, and that study was based on one major contingency operation \nthat has not even been factored into our national security strategy.\n  There are numerous other studies--again, numerous other studies--\nincluding one commissioned by the DOD itself in 2007, which support \nbuying a minimum of 250 F-22s, not 187.\n  I would also like to offer a few comments on the letter from \nSecretary Gates and Admiral Mullen. Like General Cartwright did at last \nweek's hearing, Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen talk about the \nimportance of UAVs in obviating the need for F-22s. That means taking \npilots out of the air\n\n[[Page S7459]]\n\nwhen it comes to destroying critical adversarial weapon systems that \nare on the ground or in the air trying to take out our men and women.\n  What they don't note is that of the UAVs we are procuring in this \nbudget--and I am a big fan of UAVs; we need them in certain scenarios, \nbut of the UAVs we will be procuring in this budget, that we will be \nprocuring in additional budgets, virtually none of them will have any \nstealth capability, and they will be useless in a situation that \nrequires penetrating denied airspace.\n  In other words, if we need to fly a UAV into a country--and there are \na number of countries in the world today that have the Russian-made SU-\n30 surface-to-air missiles--those UAVs get shot down every single time. \nThe F-22 is the only weapon system in our inventory that has the \ncapability of penetrating that airspace and firing not one shot, not \ntwo shots, but three shots and getting out of that enemy territory \nbefore the enemy ever knows the F-22 is in the theater. There is \nnothing in our inventory or on the drawing board that has that kind of \ncapability--certainly not the UAVs.\n  As they did in hearings before the Armed Services Committee, \nSecretary Gates and Admiral Mullen also do not address the issue of \nsurface-to-air missiles and that the F-22 is more capable against those \nsystems.\n  Lastly, their letter notes the decision to terminate the F-22 program \nat 187 has been consistent across administrations. Again, let me just \nsay it was Secretary Gates himself, as the Secretary of Defense at the \nend of the Bush administration, who decided to procure additional F-\n22s. We just procured those four F-22s in the supplemental we passed a \nmonth ago, or 6 weeks ago--that is additional F-22s beyond the program \nof record--to keep the option for additional F-22 procurement open for \nthe next administration. So that has not been a decision of previous \nadministrations. It is this administration that is making the decision \nto terminate the best tactical airplane ever conceived in the history \nof the world.\n  In relation to the letter sent yesterday from Secretary Gates and \nAdmiral Mullen, I would like to quote from a letter I received from \nRebecca Grant, a military expert who is at the Mitchell Institute for \nAir Power Studies. Here is what she says:\n\n       In the letter of July 13, from Admiral Mullen and Secretary \n     Gates, the characterization of F-35 as a half generation \n     newer aircraft than F-22 and more capable in a number of \n     areas such as electronic warfare and combating enemy air \n     defenses is incorrect and misleading. Air Force Secretary \n     Donley and General Schwartz have repeatedly stated, ``The F-\n     22 is unquestionably the most capable fighter in our military \n     inventory.'' And citing a Washington Post article of April \n     13, 2009:\n       The F-22 was designed with twice the fighting speed and \n     altitude of the F-35, to preserve U.S. advantages in the air \n     even if adversaries can test our countermeasures or reach \n     parity with us. If electronic jamming fails, the speed, \n     altitude and maneuverability advantages of the F-22 remain. \n     The F-35 was designed to operate after F-22s have secured the \n     airspace, and does not have the inherent altitude and speed \n     advantages to survive every time against peers with \n     electronic countermeasures. America has no unmanned system \n     programs in production today that can cope with modern air \n     defenses such as those possessed by Iran. The Navy UCASS \n     demonstrator program may produce such a system in several \n     years for carrier-based operations only. However, together, \n     China and Russia have 12 open production lines for fighters \n     and fighter bombers. Only 5 F-35s are flying today. The F-35 \n     has completed less than half its testing. Developmental tests \n     will not be complete until 2013. It is impossible to assess \n     the full capabilities of the F-35 until operational test is \n     complete in 2014.\n\n  Let me just add right here, in the history of the United States of \nAmerica, when it comes to tactical aircraft, we have never ever \npurchased a tactical air fighter while it was still in test and \ndevelopment stage. We always allow that to be completed because we know \nthere are going to be deficiencies.\n  Going back to the letter from Ms. Grant:\n\n       The United States Air Force will not have a robust F-35 \n     force structure for another 10 years. In addition, the \n     Pentagon removed funding for the F-35 to reach the rate of \n     110 per year as desired by the Air Force. Departing Air Force \n     Secretary for Acquisition Sue Payton recently warned of \n     potential cost growth in F-35, upon her departure. Cost \n     growth, or a Nunn-McCurdy breach, could slow down the rate at \n     which the United States Air Force takes delivery of the F-35. \n     The letter misrepresents the position of former Chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Richard Myers.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     From Rebecca Grant, Director, Mitchell Institute for Airpower \n         Studies, Air Force Association.\n\n       In the letter of July 13 from Admiral Mullen and Secretary \n     Gates, the characterization of F-35 as a ``half generation \n     newer aircraft than F-22 and more capable in a number of \n     areas such as electronic warfare and combating enemy air \n     defenses'' is incorrect and misleading.\n       Air Force Secretary Donley and General Schwartz have \n     repeatedly stated: ``The F-22 is, unquestionably, the most \n     capable fighter in our military inventory.'' (Washington \n     Post, April 13, 2009.)\n       The F-22 was designed with twice the fighting speed and \n     altitude of F-35 to preserve US advantages in the air even if \n     adversaries contest our electronic countermeasures or reach \n     parity with us.\n       For example, the Russian-made Gardenia series jammer fits \n     the Su-27 or MiG-29 aircraft and detects radar signal threats \n     and defeats them by processing and returning the same signals \n     with jamming modulation. This jammer has been exported to \n     nations such as Israel which may have modified and improved \n     the jammer. It is made by the Kaluga Scientific Institute of \n     Radio Technology which has other advanced jammers in the \n     works.\n       New digital technologies enable advanced SAMs to switch \n     rapidly between different frequencies for jamming which \n     greatly complicates our electronic countermeasures. The \n     advanced SAMs are therefore much more difficult to defeat \n     than the analog SA-6s and SA-2s designed in the 1960s.\n       If electronic jamming fails, the speed, altitude and \n     maneuverability advantages of F-22 remain. The F-35 was \n     designed to operate after F-22s secured the airspace and does \n     not have the inherent altitude and speed advantages to \n     survive every time against peers with electronic \n     countermeasures.\n       America has no unmanned systems programs in production \n     today that can cope with modern air defenses such as those \n     possessed by Iran. (The Navy UCAS demonstrator program may \n     produce such a system in several years for carrier-based \n     operations only.) However, together China and Russia have 12 \n     open production lines for fighters and fighter-bombers.\n       Only five F-35s are flying today. The F-35 has completed \n     less than half its testing. Developmental test will not be \n     complete until 2013. It is impossible to assess the full \n     capabilities of F-35 until operational test is complete in \n     2014.\n       The USAF will not have a robust F-35 force structure for \n     another ten years. In addition, the Pentagon removed funding \n     for the F-35 to reach the rate of 110 per year as desired by \n     the Air Force.\n       Departing Air Force Assistant Secretary for Acquisition Sue \n     Payton recently warned of potential cost growth in F-35 upon \n     her departure. Cost growth or a Nunn-McCurdy breach could \n     slow down the rate at which the USAF takes delivery of F-35.\n       The letter misrepresents the position of former Chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Richard Myers.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. As I mentioned earlier, we see this debate and vote \nabout the need to maintain the ability to win current wars and to guard \nagainst future challenges. While respecting Secretary Gates and his \ndesire to emphasize winning current conflicts, we feel his stance with \nrespect to the F-22 does not adequately account for other kinds of \nthreats.\n  Specifically, I find DOD's assumption that F-22s will only be \nrequired in one major contingency or theater to be totally unrealistic. \nThis is the assumption the 187 number is based on. Given the ability \nand proliferation of advanced surface-to-air missiles which require \nstealth to counter, and numerous hostile nations' desire for these \nSAMs, the likelihood of an adversary outside east Asia requiring these \nsystems in the near to midterm is increasingly likely.\n  In fact, in the press recently there have been reports about a \npotential adversary seeking to buy the S-30s from Russia. The F-22 is \nthe only weapon system America has that is capable of penetrating the \nS-30. There is a follow-on, more sophisticated surface-to-air missile \nbeing produced by the Russians today. That missile, again, will \nproliferate around the world at some point in time, and the only weapon \nsystem in the inventory of the United States that has capability of \npenetrating airspace where those weapons exist is the F-22.\n  The administration's current plan for F-22 basing would result in no \nF-22s being stationed in Europe or being\n\n[[Page S7460]]\n\navailable to address a crisis situation requiring penetrating denied \nairspace in the Middle East.\n  At the press conference announcing his budget recommendations on \nApril 6, 2009, Secretary Gates said there was no military requirement--\nI emphasize that, ``military requirement''--beyond 187 F-22s, and the \nAir Force agreed.\n  On this specific issue, either Secretary Gates misspoke or he was \ngiven incorrect information. In any case, this statement has been \nrepeatedly contradicted by his Air Force leadership.\n  The Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Schwartz, in February of \n2009, said he suggested he would request some additional 60 F-22s and \npresent analysis supporting that number to the Secretary of Defense \nduring formulation of the fiscal year 2010 budget. He commented that \nthis request was driven by analysis as opposed to some other \nformulation and spoke of 243 as being a moderate-risk number of F-22s.\n  On April 16, 2009, after Secretary Gates's budget announcement, while \nspeaking at a National Aeronautics Association event, General Schwartz \nstated, regarding the F-22: ``243 is the military requirement.'' He \ncommented that 243 would have been a moderate-risk inventory.\n  On May 19, 2009, before the House Armed Services Committee, General \nSchwartz testified 243 is the right number of F-22s. Before the Senate \nArmed Services Committee on April 21 of this year, General Schwartz \nsaid he gauged the risk of a fleet of 187 F-22s as ``moderate to \nhigh.''\n  Mr. President, 187 F-22s puts America in a ``moderate to high'' risk \ncategory, according to the Chief of Staff of the United States Air \nForce.\n  There have been other generals who have made statements with respect \nto the F-22. I commend these gentlemen because they are, frankly, \nputting their military future at risk. I know they probably received \nsome harsh phone calls from the leadership. But I know this too. They \nhave also received a lot of calls from majors and captains and \nlieutenants and Air Force academy students today, as well as Army foot \nsoldiers, just like I have. I know they have gotten those phone calls \nbecause I have gotten those phone calls thanking me for being willing \nto stand up and say: Mr. Secretary, you are wrong about this, and we \nneed more F-22s.\n  Air Combat Command holds the need for 381 F-22s to provide air \nsuperiority to our combatant commanders and protect against potential \nadversaries.\n  General Corley, who is the Commander of Air Combat Command, stated \nthat a fleet of 187 F-22s puts execution of our national military \nstrategy at high risk in the near to midterm. Air Combat Command \nanalysis shows a moderate risk force can be obtained with an F-22 fleet \nof approximately 250 aircraft.\n  The F-22 underpins our ability to dissuade and defer. Simply put, 243 \ngives us the required global coverage with 180 combat-coded jets versus \n115 to 126 combat-coded jets that we are going to get if we terminate \nthis program with 187 F-22s being purchased.\n  Mr. President, 180 combat deployed F-22s allows us to quickly win \nmajor contingencies with a moderate risk. Lower numbers of F-22s would \nsacrifice global coverage during a major contingency, encouraging \nadversaries to take advantage of a diminished ability to ensure air \nsovereignty. Out of dozens of studies conducted by DOD regarding the F-\n22, every study except one recommended procuring at least 243 F-22s.\n  The one study that did not was conducted by the DOD staff without any \nAir Force input and was based on the assumption that F-22s would only \nbe required in one scenario, which, as stated earlier, is an \nunrealistic assumption.\n  General Schwartz and Secretary of the Air Force Donley have spoken \noften on this issue in the last several months, including an op-ed they \nput in the paper on April 13. I understand there is another letter \ncoming from them. I look forward to reading it, although I am not sure \nit can say anything new.\n  In order to better understand his position, I, along with six other \nSenators, sent General Schwartz a letter on May 4 of this year. Let me \nquote from his letter. General Schwartz stated:\n\n       We have been consistent in defining a long-term requirement \n     of 381 F-22s as the low-risk fleet, and 243 as the moderate-\n     risk for both warfighting capability and fleet sustainment. \n     The F-22 program of record represents the minimum number for \n     current force planning at higher risk. While 60 more F-22s \n     are desirable, they are simply unaffordable.\n\n  I think these comments from General Schwartz confirm what we all \nalready know, that the decision to limit production to 187 is budget \ndriven, pure and simple, and 187 is a high-risk fleet and does not meet \nthe full military requirement.\n  I would simply like to ask my colleagues: Why should the United \nStates of America accept a moderate to high-risk situation in our \nability to carry out the mission of the United States Air Force in the \nfirst place?\n  Substituting F-22s with other aircraft will not serve the Nation's \ninterest. Some have suggested filling the remaining F-22 requirements \nwith other aircraft such as the F-35, the Joint Strike Fighter. I am a \nbig fan of the Joint Strike Fighter. It is going to be a great \nairplane. But as Ms. Grant stated, we have five flying today that are \nbeing tested. We are simply a long way away from the F-35 reaching a \nfull production rate and having the capability for which it was \ndesigned. That mission that the F-35 is being designed for is entirely \ndifferent from the mission of the F-22.\n  The Joint Strike Fighter is designed for multirole strike missions \nand not optimized for the air dominance mission of the F-22. All the \nforce structure studies have determined that a complementary mix of F-\n22 and F-35s is the best way to balance risk, cost, and capability. The \nF-22 is the only proven fifth-generation fighter in production.\n  The Air National Guard is charged with providing homeland air defense \nfor the United States and is primarily responsible for executing the \nair sovereignty alert mission. In addition to the over 1,600 Air \nNational Guard men and women who carry out this mission on a daily \nbasis, the Air National Guard relies on legacy F-15 and F-16 fighter \naircraft.\n  The projected retirements of these legacy aircraft--and we have in \nthis budget that we are going to retire 250 F-15 and F-16s. I have no \nreason to think we will not retire at least another 250 next year, and \nthis trend is going to continue.\n  Those retirements leave the Guard short of the required number of \naircraft to execute this mission. GAO has commented:\n\n       Unless the Air Force modifies its current fielding \n     schedules or extends the service lives of the F-15s and F-\n     16s, it will lack viable aircraft to conduct ASA operations \n     at some of the current ASA sites after fiscal year 2015.\n\n  The F-15 has been a great airplane. The F-16 has been a great \nairplane. It has served us so well over the 30 to almost 40 years we \nhave been flying those airplanes. In my home State at Robins Air Force \nBase, we have an Air Force Depot, a maintenance depot for aircraft. \nLast year, an F-15 literally fell out of the sky. It crashed.\n  Those airplanes were immediately sent to Robins Air Force Base. A \nnumber of those airplanes were sent to Robins Air Force Base to be \nchecked out. They figured out what the problem was. We have now fixed \nthe problem. But that is the kind of aircraft we are putting our brave \nmen and women who are flying for the U.S. Air Force in today, and we \nare talking about extending the life of those airplanes for a period of \ntime to meet the mission of the National Guard.\n  No plan has been developed to fill the shortfall through either \nmodernized legacy aircraft or new aircraft procurement if we stop the \nproduction of F-22s at 187. Some 80 percent of the F-16s will be gone \nin 8 years.\n  According to LTG Harry Wyatt, the Director of the Air National Guard, \nthe nature of the current and future asymmetric threats to our Nation \nrequires a fighter platform with the requisite speed and detection to \naddress them. The F-22's unique capability in this arena enables it to \nhandle a full spectrum of threats that the Air National Guard's current \nlegacy systems are not capable of addressing. Basing F-22 and \neventually F-35s at Air National Guard locations throughout the United \nStates, while making them available to rotationally support worldwide \ncontingency operations, is the most responsible approach to satisfying \nall our Nation's needs.\n  So the F-22 is not just needed to counter international threats, but \nas\n\n[[Page S7461]]\n\nwe look at a map of the United States and we look at our various Air \nNational Guard locations around the country, we need the F-22, \naccording to the Air National Guard, to supplement the support that is \ngoing to be required for the mission of the Air National Guard.\n  Let me, for 1 minute, talk about another issue that is a part of this \noverall long-term mission of the F-22, and that is foreign military \nsales. The F-22 is such a technologically advanced weapons system that \na decision was made several years ago that we were not going to share \nthis technology with other countries, as we have done with the F-16 and \nthe F-15, and heretofore basically all our aircraft.\n  That was probably the right decision, to a point. But today, with \nrespect to the F-35, we are sharing technology on that airplane, which \nis based upon the technology of the F-22, with the Brits, who are our \nprimary partner with respect to the development and the production of \nthe F-35.\n  So we have made a decision we are going to share the stealthy \ntechnology primarily that is available on the F-22 and the F-35 with \nthe Brits. The F-22 and the F-35 contain a lot of other technologically \nadvanced assets. But we now have the opportunity to develop and produce \na somewhat toned-down version of the F-22 to other countries. For the \nlast several years, we have had interest expressed in a very serious \nway from other countries. One of those countries has been to see me, \nabout 3 weeks ago, and said they are dead serious about looking it \npurchasing the F-22 as soon as the foreign sales version can be made \navailable.\n  I happen to know there are other countries that have talked to the \ncontractor as well as the Department of Defense about the potential, \ndown the road, for the purchase of that airplane. Obviously, the \ncontractor cannot get involved in it, but the Department of Defense has \nconsistently said: We have made a decision to this point that we are \nnot going to share that technology with other countries.\n  Well, we live in an entirely different global world today than we did \n10 years or 20 years ago. So it is time we started thinking about the \npotential for foreign sales of the F-22. Japan has been a very trusted \nand reliable ally. They need the best aircraft available to defend \nthemselves over the long haul. Because they are an ally of ours in the \npart of the world in which they exist and because that part of the \nworld has the potential for the development of future adversaries, it \nis critically important that we continue--and I emphasize that because \nwe have sold them tactical aircraft in previous years--it is important \nthat we continue to share the latest, most technologically advanced \nweapons systems with friends and allies such as the Japanese.\n  Let me read you a statement from former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff GEN Richard Myers regarding the need for an exportable version \nof the F-22. General Myers stated:\n\n       Japan's F-15J force, once top of the line, is now \n     outclassed by the new generation of Chinese fighters such as \n     the SU-30MKK. Moreover, China's air defenses, which include \n     variants of Russian-made long-range SA-10s and SA-20s, which \n     is the S-300 family missiles, can only be penetrated by the \n     fast, high-flying stealthy Raptor or the F-22. Japan's \n     defense ministry has studied the problem closely and has \n     produced a very impressive tactical rationale for buying the \n     F-22 if its sale is approved by the United States Congress.\n\n  Only under the umbrella of air superiority that the Raptor provides \ncan U.S. military endeavors succeed.\n  Let me quote from another well-recognized individual, retired GEN \nBarry McCaffrey, on the need for adequate numbers of F-22s. This \nstatement is about a year and a half old, but it is applicable today.\n\n       There is no single greater priority for the coming 10 years \n     for the U.S. Air Force than funding, deploying, and \n     maintaining 350 F-22 Raptor aircraft to ensure air-to-air \n     total dominance of battlefield airspace in future contested \n     areas.\n       The F-22 provides a national strategic stealth technology \n     to conduct--long-range (Cruises at high supersonic speed \n     without afterburner) penetration (at altitudes greater than \n     15 kilometers)--undetected into any nation's airspace at Mach \n     2-plus high speed--and then destroy key targets (aircraft or \n     missiles on the ground, radar, command and control, nuclear \n     stockpiled weapons, key leadership targets, etc)--and then \n     egress with minimal threat from any possible air-to-air or \n     air defense system. It cannot be defeated in air combat by \n     any known current or estimated future enemy aircraft.\n\n  That is coming from a ground soldier, somebody who depends on that F-\n22 and, heretofore on the F-15, to maintain air dominance and air \nsuperiority so the ground troops under his command can have the \nassurance in knowing that they can move freely without the threat of \nenemy aircraft.\n  Without more than 187 aircraft, we are not going to be able to \nguarantee the foot soldier on the ground that capability. The F-22 \nRaptor is in production and is operationally deployed around the world. \nContinued F-22 acquisition is low risk, as the aircraft has \nsuccessfully completed its development program and passed a stringent \nset of real-world tests. By all measures, the F-22 is now a model \nprogram and continues to establish industry benchmarks for an aircraft \nproduction program.\n  The F-22 program is on budget. The contractor team is currently \ndelivering 20 F-22s per year under a 3-year multiyear program that was \napproved by Congress 3 years ago. The multiyear contact is firm, fixed \nprice, meaning that the U.S. Government is buying a proven capability \nwith no risk of cost growth. It is ahead of schedule. In 2008, every F-\n22 delivery was ahead of contract schedule.\n  This ahead-of-schedule performance continues into 2009. Since early \n2006, every F-22 has been delivered on or ahead of contract schedule. \nThe contractor is producing a high-quality aircraft. In military \naircraft production, the highest standard for quality is zero defect. A \nzero-defect aircraft is evaluated by the customer to be perfect in all \nrespects. In 2008, nearly one-half of the F-22 deliveries were \nevaluated to be zero defect--an exceptionally high level of aircraft \nquality.\n  Still to this day, no one can say for sure, with any analysis to back \nthem up, that 187 F-22s is enough. The F-22 should be viewed in the \ncollective as a tool in the toolbox.\n  Detractors argue that the F-22 is single-purpose. Throughout history, \nwe have been effective in adapting the tools we have to the needs we \nhave. All one has to do is to look at what we are doing today with the \nB-52. That airplane is 50 years old--older than that; it may be 60 \nyears old. There was a point in time when we thought we would retire \nall of the B-52s. It is a bomber. What are we doing with the B-52 \ntoday? Today, the B-52 is flying close air support for our troops in \nAfghanistan. The SSBNs are being used by our special operations men and \nwomen, and they are doing a very effective job.\n  A general once said that the most tragic error a general can make is \nto assume, without much reflection, that wars of the future will look \nmuch like wars of the past. If we are going to pass a budget and \ndevelop a weapons system inventory that is based upon the wars of the \npast, then we are headed in the wrong direction. The war we are \nfighting today is entirely different from any conflict in which we have \never been engaged. We have been wrong every single time when it comes \nto predicting the next adversary we will have.\n  Senator McCain mentioned the July 10 Washington Post article on the \nperformance and maintainability of the F-22. Let me say that we know \nnothing appears on the front page of the Washington Post by accident, \nparticularly the week before an important vote. I guess I ought to be \nflattered by the attention. But for the record, the same reporter who \nwrote that article on the day of an important hearing in relation to \nthe F-22 multiyear contract in 2006 is the same author of the July 10 \narticle.\n  The article in question bore absolutely no relation to the issues at \nstake. Nevertheless, it led to a new study on the savings that would be \nachieved through a multiyear contract, a study which was conducted at \ngovernment expense. Despite the article's obvious attempts to obscure \nthe facts and issues in the situation, that new study, done pursuant to \nrequest of this body, concluded that the multiyear contract would save \ntwice as much as the previous study.\n  Just briefly in relation to the Washington Post article, by close of \nbusiness the day the article was published, the Air Force had already \nissued a rebuttal. It concluded that of the 23 claims in the article, \nonly 4 were true,\n\n[[Page S7462]]\n\n4 were misleading, 10 were false, and 5 required greater explanation \nand context beyond what the Post article reported.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Air Force statement in \nrebuttal to the article in the Washington Post be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7463]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS14JY09.001\n\n\n\n[[Page S7464]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS14JY09.002\n\n\n\n[[Page S7465]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS14JY09.003\n\n\n\n[[Page S7466]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS14JY09.004\n\n\n\n[[Page S7467]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS14JY09.005\n\n\n\n[[Page S7468]]\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. The Washington Post article is unique in some ways. I \nguess it may be SOP for articles that are somewhat vicious and where \nthey contain as many errors as the Air Force has pointed out with the \nfacts supporting the errors that were made; that is, the July 10 \nWashington Post article was based upon unnamed sources. It was based \nupon a couple of folks who said they were fired either by the \ncontractor or by the Air Force. We take that for what it is worth.\n  One of the complaints cited in that article was the fact that there \nare problems with the skin on the F-22. Let me back up a minute and \ntalk about the sophistication of this airplane. There is a problem with \nthe skin. That has been a problem. What we have to remember is that we \nhave never had an airplane that could fly with the capability that this \nairplane has, that could fly completely undetected, completely through \nany radar system of the most sophisticated nature of any potential \nadversary in the world. The reason this airplane can do that is because \nit is made of substance and material that is unique and different to \nthis airplane, including the skin on the airplane. Are we going to have \nproblems with something that is that unique and has never been used \nbefore on any tactical air fighter? You bet we are.\n  The position of the folks who are in support of this amendment is \nthat we ought to stop production of the F-22 and buy the F-35 at a \nfaster rate. Even if we do that, if we have F-35s flying tomorrow, they \nare going to have exactly the same maintenance issues as the F-22. The \nF-22 is the model upon which the Joint Strike Fighter is based. So \nlet's don't kid ourselves. We are not taking an airplane that costs X \nand substituting it with an airplane that costs half or three-quarters \nof X. That is not going to be the case. Mistakes have been made--\nsurely--but it is the first time we have ever had a weapons system like \nthe F-22 manufactured by anybody in the world. From the mistakes we \nhave learned. We are going to have a better F-35. But that F-35 is \ngoing to have the same skin problem. It is going to have the same \nweight problem the F-22 had, the F-15 had, the F-16 had, and probably \nevery airplane we have ever developed. It is going to have the same \nmaintenance issues we are having with the F-22 today.\n  Although the article was wrong in one major area with respect to \nmaintenance, the article says the maintenance of the airplane was \nhaving a success rate of 55 percent. That is wrong. As the Air Force \npoints out, between 2004 and today, the successful maintenance rate on \nthose airplanes has gone from 64 to 69 percent.\n  The future of TACAIR for the United States likely does reside in the \nF-35 and not with the F-22. Even if we keep buying F-22s, it will never \nmatch the number of F-35s we will eventually buy. Everyone hopes, as I \ndo, that the F-35 succeeds. But as the chair and the ranking member of \nthe Armed Services Committee themselves have stated, there is a good \ndeal of risk in the F-35 program, and there is additional risk in what \nwe need to put in place today when it comes to the lives of our men and \nwomen who are fighting our conflicts and who are flying these \nairplanes.\n  The history of Defense programs, and aviation programs in particular, \nhas been remarkably consistent, particularly when it comes to building \nprograms that represent a leap in technology. They cost more. They take \nlonger. They have more problems than we expect. GAO has criticized the \nF-35 approach, and they, as well as the leadership of our committee, \nhave stated that not performing sufficient development testing before \nwe proceed to procurement is one of the primary drivers for cost \nincreases and schedule delays in major programs. That is exactly what \nis being proposed with respect to the F-35.\n  I am a supporter of the F-35. We are going to build far more of them \nthan we are F-22s. But I am not the only observer to state that we \nshould think twice about staking the future of our TACAIR fleet on a \nprogram that has only five test aircraft flying today.\n  I wish to talk briefly about the offsets included in our amendment \nwhich are in the mark used to fund the purchase of these additional \nseven F-22s. Senator Levin talked about the offset at length. I would \nlike to respond to some of his comments. Most importantly, there is \nabsolutely nothing in the offset we used and nothing that has not been \nused by the Senate Armed Services Committee or the chairman himself in \nprevious bills.\n  Just last year, Senator Levin reduced military personnel funding by \n$1.1 billion, which is significantly more than what my amendment \nreduced it by. For the MILPERS and O reductions in my amendment and \nthe markup, in each case the amendment takes either less or \napproximately the same amount as the House Armed Services Committee \nbill did for this year. In every case, the amendment takes less than \nthe GAO reported average under-execution/unobligated balances in those \naccounts. This includes the cuts the Senate Armed Services Committee \nalready took in their mark.\n  The SASC bill itself notes that GAO estimates that DOD has $1.2 \nbillion in unobligated O balances and $588 million under-execution in \nthe Air Force civ pay accounts. This is from actual language in the \nSenate report.\n  In the civilian personnel area, the GAO reports conclude that more \nfunding is available than what my amendment takes. The GAO report takes \ninto account the expansion of acquisition personnel who will be hired \nthis year.\n  Regarding MILPERS, GAO analysis suggests that there is on average $1 \nbillion available. My amendment leaves a balance of $200 million in \nthat account.\n  The chairman also commented on the provision in my amendment that \nassumes savings based on acquisition reform legislation authored by \nSenators Levin and McCain. Let me say that my inspiration for this \nparticular offset was Senators Levin and McCain. I thought they did a \ngreat job with that bill. I hope we can continue to improve it because \nit is an area where we have to work harder to avoid wasteful spending.\n  The chairman included a nearly identical provision as mine in S. \n1416, which was the Senate version of the fiscal year 2002 Defense \nauthorization bill. That bill assumed a savings of $1.6 billion based \non acquisition reform bills and the SASC bill for that year. However, \nunlike my provision, which assumes savings already in law because of \npassage of the Levin-McCain bill, savings assumed by the chairman were \nbased on provisions that were not yet enacted and, based on the \nconference process, may never have been enacted. Based on inflation and \nlarge increases in the DOD budget since then, that is probably the \nequivalent of $2 to $2.5 billion today. In any case, this is a \ntremendous amount of savings, and my amendment would assume far less. \nThe offset is based upon predicted savings in the fiscal year 2010 \nbudget based on recently passed acquisition reform legislation such as \nthe Weapons System Acquisition Reform Act, Public Law 111-23, also the \nbusiness process reengineering provision in the SASC mark and other \nmanagement efficiencies and business process reforms.\n  Senators McCain and Levin and President Obama are correct. Savings \nfrom this acquisition reform measure could greatly exceed that number, \nbecause in their press conference after the successful passage of that \nbill, they all three talked about the tremendous savings. I agree with \nthem. That is going to happen. That is what we used as part of our \noffset.\n  I want to end where I started, by agreeing with John Hamre. John \nHamre says:\n\n       Congress can and should legitimately question spending \n     priorities.\n       Not only is it appropriate but necessary for the Congress \n     to pass final judgment on this question.\n       Secretary Gates has rendered his judgment. . . .But it is \n     the duty and obligation of members of Congress to question \n     his recommendations [and his analysis].\n\n  There is absolutely nothing unique or in the least bit wrong about \nwhat we are doing. Not to do so would be to abdicate the role with \nwhich the Constitution and the American people have entrusted us. If \nPresident Obama believes the additional funding for these F-22s \nwarrants a veto threat, even though that funding addresses an unmet \nmilitary requirement, then that is his decision. Our job in Congress, \nas John Hamre has indicated, is to look at the facts, weigh the risks, \nand render the judgment. That is our role--our independent role--in the \nprocess, and we should accept it and use our best judgment to decide \nwhat is right for the Nation.\n\n[[Page S7469]]\n\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise for two purposes. One is to make a \nquick response to the remarks of Senator Chambliss concerning the F-22 \nand a couple of remarks about what I understand is going to be next on \nthe agenda which will be proposed by the majority leader, which is a \nhate crimes bill, which is very difficult for me to understand.\n  Senator Chambliss very appropriately pointed out that many times when \nwe put together an authorization bill, we find offsets, as we call \nthem--ways of paying for whatever item we want to add in the \nauthorization bill. But I think it is important for us to point out \nthat the Chambliss amendment during the markup, while putting this bill \ntogether, provided $1.75 billion for F-22 procurement. It took funds \nfrom presumed unobligated balances of several accounts. In all candor, \nthey were unjustified assumptions.\n  The amendment cut $850 million from O accounts, which is operations \nand maintenance. That means the operating, the maintenance, the \nequipping, the replacement of very much needed parts and supplies that \nprovide for the readiness of our troops, enabling them to stay ready \nfor today's conflicts and for tomorrow's challenges. The account also \ncovers day-to-day costs of the Department. This includes items such as \ntraining, maintenance of ships, aircraft, combat vehicles, recruiting, \neducation support, procurement of general supplies and equipment, and \nrepairs and maintenance of Department of Defense facilities.\n  Our military is engaged around the world. It is irresponsible to cut \nthe resources they rely on to prepare successfully for their mission to \nprotect the United States and its security interests worldwide. We owe \nit to our military to provide them with every resource. Based on \nhistorical data, the reductions that are in the Chambliss amendment to \npay for the additional $1.75 billion would affect the following areas: \nArmy's training and operating tempo, including training additional \nhelicopter crews for irregular warfare missions; Navy's depot \nmaintenance for surface ships; Air Force's depot maintenance and \ncontractor logistical support for critical aircraft and unmanned \nvehicles; and the special operations command missions support and \ntraining of its forces.\n  Furthermore, a reduction of this magnitude would affect the \nSecretary's initiatives to hire and train additional acquisition \nprofessionals needed to improve the Department's ability to contract, \ndevelop, and procure weapon systems and to replace contractors with \nFederal employees, thereby reducing the $1.2 billion in savings that is \nreflected in the budget.\n  In addition, these accounts will have to absorb the increased cost of \nfuel that has occurred since the budget was submitted and additional \ncivilian pay raises. That assumes the Congress sets the civilian pay \nraises at the same level as the military pay raise of 3.4 percent.\n  The other two ``offsets'' are $400 million from military personnel \nfunding. Much of the funding in the military personnel accounts is \nentitlement driven. Thus, there is limited flexibility to absorb these \nreductions without affecting the readiness of U.S. forces. These \nreductions will directly translate into cuts to recruiting and \nretention bonuses incentives and other important programs such as \ncovering the cost to move members and their families to new \nassignments. It will affect unit readiness by hindering the services' \nability to meet end strength goals and fully staff operational units \nwith critical personnel prior to deployment. If Congress sustains these \nreductions, the services will need to submit a reprogramming action to \nmake sure our military forces are fully supported.\n  Finally, the Senator from Georgia assumes $500 million in first-year \nsavings from the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act, which he \nreferred to in his remarks. I am very proud to have worked under the \nleadership of Senator Levin and together coming up with a very \nimportant piece of legislation, strongly supported by the President and \nthe Secretary of Defense, to reform the way we acquire weapon systems. \nThe cost overruns have been outrageous, as we know, throughout the past \nfew years. But there is no one--no one in our wildest imagination--who \nbelieves that in the first year of acquisition reform we will save $500 \nmillion. I would love to see that happen. I would love to see pigs fly. \nBut we are not going to save $500 million in the first year of a piece \nof legislation that has not been implemented and would not be for some \nperiod of time.\n  So I am very flattered by the reliance of Senator Chambliss on $500 \nmillion in savings from the legislation we recently passed through the \nCongress and that has been signed by the President of the United \nStates, but in all due respect, it is totally unrealistic. So what we \nare really doing is adding $1.75 billion and not accounting for ways to \nreduce spending or impose savings in any other way.\n  But I also understand and appreciate the passion, commitment, \nknowledge, and contributions of Senator Chambliss of Georgia. There is \nno more valued member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. We simply \nhave an honest disagreement on this issue. I appreciate the many \nqualities of the F-22 aircraft and the enormous contribution it makes \nto our Nation's security, but the fact is, we don't need any more of \nthem. That comes from the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the \nAir Force, and others involved in these issues for a long period of \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will perhaps come back later to speak on \nthe F-22 and the work my colleagues, Senator Levin and Senator McCain, \nhave done. But I want to speak about another amendment I have offered \nthat I hope might gain acceptance as we move forward, and that is an \namendment to the Defense authorization bill that would require \ncontracting officials in the Pentagon to take into account evidence of \nbad past performance by a contractor when deciding who should get \nfuture contracts.\n  You might think that contracting officials would already be required \nto take past performance into account. But the fact is, that is not now \nrequired over in the Pentagon. I want to go through some thoughts with \nyou about this issue very quickly.\n  I have held 19 hearings on contractor waste, fraud, and abuse. I have \nto say, going back some years now, we have had the greatest amount of \nwaste and fraud and abuse by contractors than we have seen in the \nhistory of this country. Let me give you some examples.\n  Shown on this chart is a man named Efraim Diveroli, 22 years old. Oh, \nby the way, he is the CEO of a company. That is right, the president \nand CEO of a company. The company is a shell company his father used to \nhave. But he took it over, and he hired a vice president, as a matter \nof fact. The vice president's name is David Packouz, 25 years old, the \nformer vice president of the company. He is a massage therapist. So \nthis is a company in Miami, FL, that does business out of an unmarked \ndoor. Through the best evidence, there are only two employees--a 22-\nyear-old president and a 25-year-old massage therapist who is the vice \npresident. Well, guess what. These two guys got $300 million in \ncontracts from the U.S. Government. Can you imagine, $300 million in \ncontracts from the Pentagon?\n  There have been arrests in this case. But the question is, Why? I \ncalled a three-star general to my office to say: How on Earth could you \nhave done that? How could you possibly have done that? Did you not \ncheck?\n  I checked. These guys also had some small contracts with the State \nDepartment which turned out to be bad contracts. But they could have at \nleast done a small amount of checking before committing $300 million of \nthe American taxpayers' money. What they did for that money was ship a \nbunch of shoddy products over to Afghanistan to the military, bullets \nand guns that were dated from the 1960s. That is one of the reasons \nthis company and these fellows ran afoul of the law. But the question \nis, How did all this happen?\n  This guy, as shown in this picture, with a striped shirt is named \nFrank Willis. This is he, in the striped shirt. He is holding a Saran-\nwrapped pack of money. This is part of a couple million dollars that \nwent to a company called Custer Battles. This is he, by the way, in \nIraq. He said: Our motto was, You bring a bag because we pay cash. He \nis talking about defense contracting.\n\n[[Page S7470]]\n\n  Custer Battles is alleged to have taken--they were going to provide \nsecurity for the Baghdad Airport, which had no commercial airplanes \nflying in and out. It was alleged they took the forklift trucks off the \nairport and put them in some sort of machine shed and repainted them \nblue and then sold them to the Coalition Provisional Authority. So you \nbring a bag because we pay cash, it was said.\n  Here is what the guy over at the Baghdad Airport said. I am just \ntelling you all this because I held 19 hearings. I have done 19 of \nthem. Here is what the guy who is the airport director of security said \nin a memo to the Coalition Provisional Authority. Here is what he said \nabout Custer Battles, which was given the contract. They got over $100 \nmillion in contracts.\n\n       Custer Battles have shown themselves to be unresponsive, \n     uncooperative, incompetent, deceitful, manipulative and war \n     profiteers. Other than that they are swell fellows.\n\n  Think of it. So what do we think of these contractors? They got a lot \nof the taxpayers' money.\n  This is a picture of Cheryl Harris with her son Ryan Maseth, a Green \nBeret, Special Forces. Ryan, unfortunately, tragically was killed in \nIraq--no, he was not shot by some insurgent; he was electrocuted in the \nshower. His mother Cheryl was told that they thought maybe he went into \nthe shower carrying a radio and therefore was electrocuted. It turns \nout that was not the case at all. The fact is, he took a shower in a \nplace where the wiring had been done improperly. Why? Because Kellogg, \nBrown, and Root, which was paid to do the wiring, hired third-country \nnationals in most cases who could not speak English and did not know \nthe wiring codes, and they wired up a shower and this poor soldier lost \nhis life because he was electrocuted in the shower.\n  I held hearings about that. Eric Peters, who was working in Iraq as \nan electrician, said: Third-country nationals performed the majority of \nKBR's electrical work. Most have absolutely no knowledge of the \nNational Electric Code or British Standards, and the quality of their \nwork reflects that. Much of this work is not clearly inspected by \nlicensed electricians. I personally have refused to sign off on work \nthey have performed because I knew it was not up to code. That is what \nwe paid for, and some soldiers have lost their lives.\n  This list goes on and on and on.\n  Eric Peters, a brave soul who worked in Iraq to do electrical work, \nworked for KBR. He came back and testified: I concluded that KBR was \nnot capable of performing quality, legal, electric installations in \nIraq. I worried every day that people would be seriously injured or \nkilled by this defective work.\n  The reason I want to tell you about this is, not only have soldiers \nlost their lives, but the task orders for which that work was done \nresulted in award fees, bonus fees, to the company that did shoddy \nwork.\n  As a result of my hearing, they sent a task force over to investigate \nall of the buildings in Iraq. The fact is, we have testimony and \nevidence that there was a massive amount of wiring that was done \nimproperly that put soldiers at risk. Yet the Pentagon provided award \nfees, which are fees designed only for excellent performance, of $83 \nmillion of the taxpayers' money to a company that did shoddy work; work \nsufficient so we had to come back around and do what is called, I \nbelieve, a corrective action request order, where you had to go back \nand inspect everything and redo the work. The question is, How is all \nthis going on?\n  Let me describe the story of Bunny Greenhouse. A lot of people do not \nknow Bunny Greenhouse. What an extraordinary person she is. She grew up \nin southern Louisiana in a family who had nothing. Two in their family \nteach college. Her brother is Elvin Hayes, one of the top 50 basketball \nplayers of all time. Bunny Greenhouse has a couple of master's degrees, \nis very well educated, and rose to become the highest civilian in the \nCorps of Engineers over in the Pentagon. Here is what she testified to \nwith respect to some of the contracting that went on. She lost her job \nas a result of having the courage to speak publicly.\n\n       I can unequivocally state that the abuse related to \n     contracts awarded to KBR represents the most blatant and \n     improper contract abuse I have witnessed during the course of \n     my professional career.\n\n  For that, she lost her job.\n  It is not just KBR. I mentioned Custer Battles, Efraim Diveroli. How \nabout Parsons Corporation?\n  This, by the way, is a photograph every American should remember when \nyou talk about waste and fraud and abuse. This is called ``The Whale.'' \nThis picture is a picture of a prison in Iraq that was never completed \nand will never be used. Mr. President, $31 million was paid to the \nParsons Corporation for building a prison the Iraqis said they did not \nwant and would not use. The $31 million was colossally wasted in \nunbelievably bad construction. That is after this same company was \ngiven a couple hundred million dollars to rehabilitate 140 health \nclinics in Iraq, and we were told later that most of those health \nclinics are imaginary, quote/unquote. They do not exist. Well, the \nmoney is gone. The $200 million is gone. But the health clinics are \nimaginary.\n  Well, the same company was contracted to build the prison in Iraq. It \nis called the Kahn Bani Sa'ad prison, but it is referred to as ``The \nWhale.'' Here is what it looks like, as shown in this picture. We spent \n$40 million. The first $31 million was paid to Parsons. Another $9 \nmillion was paid to an Iraqi contractor. And here it sits in the \ndesert, never ever to be used, paid for by the American taxpayer, and \npaid to contractors who did shoddy work and were kicked off the site.\n  The question is, What do we do about all that?\n  I have proposed an amendment that is pretty simple. It is \ninteresting. There is currently no requirement that contracting \nofficials over in the DOD have to take into account shoddy work \npractices or shoddy performances by contractors. There is a requirement \nthey take into account criminal actions, civil fines, that are leveled \nagainst contractors. But there is no requirement they must consider bad \npast performance. It is unbelievable, but it is true.\n  I offer an amendment that says, Do you know what, the time is past \nwhen bad performance by big contractors gets you a slap on the wrist \nand a pat on the back and another contract. It is time--long past the \ntime--we put an end to this.\n  I know my colleagues, Senator Levin and Senator McCain, feel strongly \nabout this issue as well. I appreciate the work they have done. All of \nus need to do everything we can to assure the American taxpayers they \nare getting their money's worth. Defense is something we invest in for \nthis country. It is very important.\n  As I conclude, I want to say this: I put together a chart, and I am \ngoing to speak about it in the next day or two. But it relates to this \nquestion of the F-22. This chart shows Federal budget deficits. We are \non an unsustainable path. It is not a Republican path or a Democratic \npath. It is just an unsustainable path that cannot work for this \ncountry's future.\n  Take a look at this chart. Here is the middle of a deep recession, \n$1.9 trillion in deficits, and then it gets a little better, and then \ngoes back down.\n  We are on an unsustainable path, and it does not matter what you are \ntalking about, whether you are talking about an airplane or some other \narea of Federal budget responsibility. We finally have to decide: \nThings have changed. We have to invest in things that provide dividends \nfor this country's future. We cannot continue to spend money we do not \nhave on things we do not need. That is not a sustainable course for \nthis country.\n  So I will speak more about these issues, including the F-22, at some \nother point. But let me thank my colleague, Senator Levin, and my \ncolleague, Senator McCain as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, very briefly, let me thank Senator Dorgan \nfor his extraordinary work in the area of waste, fraud, and abuse, not \njust in the area of the Department of Defense but in so many other \nareas as well. He is surely a foremost leader in this institution in \nthis effort, and the oversight work he has been able to do is surely \ncutting-edge with the kind of leadership he has undertaken. We \nappreciate it. We need it. We need more of it. We are grateful for it. \nEvery taxpayer in America ought to be grateful to Senator Dorgan.\n\n[[Page S7471]]\n\n  Mr. President, let me urge Members who are going to be speaking on \nthe F-22 to let us know and come to the floor because we are hopeful to \nconclude this debate no later than early tomorrow morning and to bring \nit to a vote. We are making every effort to see if we can agree on \nthat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, just for a minute, because I know \ncolleagues are waiting, it is my understanding that following the \ndisposition of this amendment, which we hope would happen tomorrow \nmorning, the majority leader will move to take up a hate crimes bill. \nThe hate crimes bill is, to say the least, a very controversial piece \nof legislation and may deserve the debate and discussion of the Members \nof this body. But the fact is, it has nothing to do with the Department \nof Defense authorization bill. What the Defense authorization bill has \na lot to do with is the training, equipping, taking care of \nreenlistment and retention, and all of the things necessary to defend \nour Nation's national security.\n  We are in two wars. We are in two wars, and we need to pass this \nlegislation. So the majority leader's priority is a hate crimes bill--a \nhate crimes bill which has nothing to do with the Defense \nauthorization. I hope if the majority leader does that, it will be the \nlast time he will ever complain about an unrelated amendment being \nbrought up by this side of the aisle.\n  Look, there are important amendments that need to be debated and \nconsidered on this legislation. This has to do with the defense of this \nNation. So what are we going to do? We are going to tie up the Senate \nfor a number of days. For a number of days we are going to tie up the \nSenate on a totally unrelated, very controversial, very emotional issue \nthat has nothing to do with defending this Nation.\n  So I urge my colleagues on this side of the aisle, I urge the \ndistinguished chairman, I urge the majority leader, let's move forward \nwith addressing the defense needs of this country, save the hate crimes \nbill for another day, and do what is necessary for the men and women in \nour military rather than putting an agenda item that has nothing to do \nwith defense next before this body.\n  I predict again that when this bill comes up, if the hate crimes bill \nis proposed by the majority leader and agreed to by the distinguished \nchairman, it will lead to a great deal of controversy and unnecessary \ndebate and discussion on a defense bill. If the majority leader, who \ncontrols the agenda, wants to bring up a hate crimes bill, I would \nimagine he would be able to bring it up on his own. Instead, he wants \nto stick it on to the bill that the men and women who are serving in \nour military and are in harm's way today are depending on. It is not \nright. It is not the right thing to do.\n  I hope the majority leader and the chairman of the committee will \nreconsider their position and wait and bring up a hate crimes bill as a \nseparate piece of legislation for deliberation and discussion and vote \nfrom this body and not tie it to the Defense authorization bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on another amendment I \nhave filed that is at the desk, but I know there is a pending \namendment, so I suppose I should ask to speak as in morning business \nfor 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1528\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this amendment I rise to speak about is \nnumbered 1528. I am hopeful before too long it will be the pending \nbusiness. I know it has now, and I believe it will, enjoy broad \nbipartisan support.\n  This amendment would increase the authorization for the Active-Duty \nend strength of the U.S. Army over the next 3 years by 30,000 \nadditional soldiers. I wish to say right at the outset it is an \nauthorization; it is not an appropriation. It says within its terms \nthat it is contingent on a decision by the Secretary of Defense that he \nchooses to fill these positions, and if he does, then he has two major \noptions.\n  One is to reprogram from other funds under his control to support \nthese additional troops, and the second, of course, is to return to \nCongress for a supplemental appropriation.\n  In my opinion, for all we have said and done in expression of our \nconcern about the stress the members of the U.S. Army are feeling and \ntheir families are feeling, based on the fact that they are carrying \nthe overwhelming burden of the wars in which we are involved in Iraq \nand Afghanistan--we have done a lot to improve living conditions, to \noffer more support for physical and mental health services, to provide \nbetter housing for families, but this is about how much time the \nsoldiers can be back at their home bases and back with their families. \nI will get to this in detail as we go on.\n  Last month, the House and Senate Armed Services Committees voted to \ngive the Secretary of Defense the authority to increase the Army's end \nstrength by an additional 30,000 soldiers for fiscal years 2011 and \n2012 but not 2010, for reasons that I will describe as somewhat arcane. \nThis new authorization will provide the Secretary of Defense with the \nability to increase the size of the Army to the extent he thinks it is \nnecessary for the national defense or for other purposes such as \nreducing the stress to which I have referred on our troops today.\n  I was privileged to introduce the amendment along with Senator Thune, \nmy ranking member on the Airland Subcommittee, during the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, as well as Senator Graham, to provide this \nauthorization, and I am glad to be joined in introducing this amendment \nNo. 1528 with my bipartisan group, including the two formerly mentioned \nSenators, and others.\n  This amendment would extend this authorization where it logically \nmust begin to fiscal year 2010 beginning on October 1 of this year, \n2009. We introduced this amendment because it will provide our soldiers \nwith the reinforcements they will need to execute the missions we as a \nnation have sent them on. Indeed, our soldiers will be under even more \nstress in the coming months because of this fact. As we begin the \nresponsible strategy for drawdown in Iraq based on the extraordinary \nsuccess of our troops and the Iraqis in turning around the war in \nIraq, we are also deploying additional soldiers under the direction of \nour Commander in Chief, President Obama, to Afghanistan at an even \nfaster pace than they are returning home.\n\n  GEN George Casey, the Army's Chief of Staff, warned us in the Armed \nServices Committee earlier this year that the effect of these two \nfacts--a slow and methodical drawdown in Iraq of our Armed Forces, \nArmy, and an increase in deployment to Afghanistan--means that the \ntotal number of soldiers deployed to combat will be increasing through \nthe rest of this calendar year and into the next.\n  As General Casey said to us, this matter of dwell time, which I will \nspeak about in more detail in a moment, is a matter of supply and \ndemand: How many soldiers do we have, and what is the demand for them \nin the battle zones, the war zones.\n  GEN James Cartwright, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nrecently confirmed the critical challenges the U.S. Army will face in \nthe near term and the importance of increasing Army Active Duty end \nstrength. Speaking before the Senate Armed Services Committee just last \nweek, General Cartwright said:\n\n       There is that period of 2010 and 2011 in particular where \n     that stress is going to be there. During 2010 because of \n     execution, and in 2011 because [units will be] coming back, \n     refilling and trying to retrofit. You're going to have stress \n     on the Army in a significant way.\n\n  And I add, stress on the Army means stress on the families of those \nwho serve us in the Army.\n  General Cartwright continued by stating that the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff are working with the Army to find a range for growth that would \nreduce this strain on the service. ``We have looked at this, we have \nworked in a range''--and I add here of increasing Army Active Duty--\n``from about 15,000 to 25,000 . . . 30,000 would give us the range in \nwhich to work to allow us to do that.''\n  That is exactly what this amendment would do, give the Secretary of \nDefense, the Joint Chiefs, and the Secretary of the Army the latitude \nto increase the Army temporarily by as\n\n[[Page S7472]]\n\nmuch as 30,000. Why? To increase the dwell time. That is the time our \ntroops can spend at home and, thereby, reduce the stress in a most \nsignificant way imaginable.\n  I deeply appreciate that General Cartwright would speak so clearly \nabout the Army's requirements of additional soldiers in the coming \nmonths and how hard he and Secretary Gates are working to support our \ntroops. I believe it is our duty to make sure they have all the \nauthority required to do so.\n  Let me speak more about what dwell time is. Dwell time is time \nsoldiers have between Active Duty deployments, time they spend \nrecovering and preparing for their next deployment and, most \nsignificant to our soldiers, I would guess, precious time they can \nspend at home with their families. This dwell time ratio for many of \nour soldiers today is little more than 1 to 1, which means they have \nbut 1 year at home for every year they spend in the theater. Everyone \nagrees--everyone agrees--that this dwell time is absolutely \nunacceptable. It may also be unsustainable.\n  When General Casey testified before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee earlier this year, he said it is his goal to get to a point \nwhere we have at least 2 years back home for every year our soldiers \nspend deployed. In fact, he said his ultimate goal at which he believes \nthe Army would be most effective would be to have 3 years at home for \nevery year in the field.\n  General Casey hopes that a responsible drawdown from Iraq will allow \nhim to achieve that goal. I share the general's hopes. But, frankly, I \ndo not believe we can bet the well-being of our Army on them without \nproviding authority to the Army and the Secretary of Defense to expand \nthe troops to reach those dwell-time goals of at least 2 to 1 about \nwhich General Casey talked.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Admiral Mullen, told our committee \nthis year that the ``light at the end of the tunnel'' is still more \nthan 2 years away for the Army, and that is only if everything goes \naccording to plan in Iraq. I believe that 2 years is too long to wait, \nespecially when we can take steps now to turn on the light, if you \nwill, to provide our soldiers with the reinforcements and relief they \nneed.\n  I think it is important for my colleagues to know this amendment has \nthe strong support of many of our soldiers and those organizations that \nfight for them.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \ntwo letters, one from GEN Gordon Sullivan, president of the Association \nof the U.S. Army, and, second, from ADM Norbert Ryan, writing on behalf \nof the Military Officers Association of America.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    Association of\n\n\n                                       the United States Army,\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, July 13, 2009.\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     United States Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: On behalf of the more than 100,000 \n     members of the Association of the United States Army, I want \n     to thank you for your floor amendment to S. 1390, the FY 2010 \n     Defense Authorization Act, which would provide authority to \n     increase Army active-duty end strengths for fiscal years 2010 \n     through 2012.\n       As you know, the troop increases in Afghanistan will \n     precede decreases in Iraq, causing the number of deployed \n     soldiers to increase into next year. The Chairman of the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff testified to Congress that it will be \n     difficult to increase dwell time at home over the next 18 to \n     24 months with our current end strength. Factor in the more \n     than 30,000 soldiers who are on the rolls but not deployable, \n     and it's obvious what a strain that would be to our current \n     troop levels. You get this, and I hope your floor amendment \n     will help your fellow Senators see it, too.\n       The Army is in dire need of sufficient troops to increase \n     dwell time for active duty soldiers, increase support for \n     operational missions, and help the Army achieve \n     reorganization objectives. Thanks to your recognition of this \n     gap in end strength planning, we have a chance at giving the \n     Army the resources our Soldiers deserve.\n       We say that we want to ease the stress and strain on \n     soldiers and their families, and now is the time to do the \n     one thing that will provide immediate relief. Your actions to \n     make this a reality show that you are a true ally to the \n     Armed Forces. Thank you for introducing the Lieberman \n     Amendment to S. 1390 which will authorize the Army to \n     increase its size now, I hope that your fellow Senators also \n     lend their support to your worthy cause.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Gordon R. Sullivan,\n     General, USA Retired.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Military Officers\n\n\n                                       Association of America,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, July 10, 2009.\n     Hon. Joe Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: On behalf of the 370,000 members of \n     the Military Officers Association of America (MOAA), I am \n     writing to express MOAA's strong support for your proposed \n     FY2010 Defense Authorization Act amendment that would \n     authorize an additional 30,000 end strength increase for the \n     Army in FY2010.\n       Today's combat forces and their families are paying a \n     terrible price in family separation and stress for our past \n     failure to grow our armed forces at a pace sufficient to \n     accommodate the extraordinary wartime deployment requirements \n     of the past seven years.\n       For years, we have relied on the patriotism, dedication, \n     and resilience of our men and women in uniform to bear 100% \n     of the nation's wartime sacrifice. But with thousands \n     experiencing their third or fourth combat tour since 2001 and \n     the prospect of a decade of persistent conflict ahead, \n     reasonable leaders must take responsible action to ease the \n     extreme strain our military members and families have been \n     required to absorb for so long.\n       Your amendment recognizes that the only way to do so in the \n     face of increasing deployment requirements in the near term \n     is to authorize a substantial increase in Army end strength \n     for FY2010.\n       MOAA applauds your strong and persistent leadership in \n     pursuing this important personnel readiness initiative, and \n     we pledge to do all we can to ensure it is sustained in the \n     final defense bill.\n           Sincerely and with deep gratitude for your leadership,\n                                                     Norbert Ryan.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, General Sullivan is a retired former \nChief of the U.S. Army, a great American soldier. I quote, briefly, \nfrom his letter to me about this amendment supporting the amendment:\n\n       As you know, the troop increases in Afghanistan will \n     precede decreases in Iraq, causing the number of deployed \n     soldiers to increase into next year. The Chairman of the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff testified to Congress that it will be \n     difficult to increase dwell time at home over the next 18 to \n     24 months within our current end strength. Factor in the more \n     than 30,000 soldiers who are on the rolls but not deployable, \n     and it's obvious what a strain that would be to our current \n     troop levels. . . . I hope your floor amendment [and the \n     debate of it] will help your fellow Senators see [that].\n       The Army is in dire need of sufficient troops to increase \n     dwell time for active duty soldiers, increase support for \n     operational missions, and help the Army achieve \n     reorganization objectives.\n\n  He concludes:\n\n       We say that we want to ease the stress and strain on \n     soldiers and their families, and now is the time to do the \n     one thing that will provide immediate relief.\n\n  And that is to increase the authorization of the U.S. Army end \nstrength as the number of troops it can have actively deployed by \n30,000 and to fill that 30,000 increase.\n  Second, Admiral Ryan, another distinguished servant of the United \nStates, a patriot, says:\n\n       On behalf . . . of the Military Officers Association of \n     America . . . Today's combat forces and their families are \n     paying a terrible price.\n\n  This is a very personal letter. I will start again.\n\n       Today's combat forces and their families are paying a \n     terrible price in family separation and stress for our past \n     failure to grow our armed forces at a pace sufficient to \n     accommodate the extraordinary wartime deployment requirements \n     of the past seven years.\n       For years, we have relied on the patriotism, dedication, \n     and resilience of our men and women in uniform to bear 100 \n     percent of the Nation's wartime sacrifice. But with thousands \n     experiencing their third or fourth combat tour since 2001 and \n     the prospect of a decade of persistent conflict ahead, \n     reasonable leaders must take responsible action to ease the \n     extreme strain our military members and families have been \n     required to absorb for so long.\n\n  And then he says:\n\n       [This] amendment recognizes that the only way to do so in \n     the face of increasing deployment requirements in the near \n     term is to authorize a substantial increase in Army end \n     strength for FY2010.\n\n  That is exactly what this amendment would do. The authority provided \nin the amendment is temporary in nature and will expire in 2012. We \nhope and pray that by that time, we will be able to return the Army end \nstrength to 547,000. If Congress increases the end strength of the Army \nnow, as this\n\n[[Page S7473]]\n\namendment would authorize, we would be able to reevaluate that judgment \nas conditions on the ground and in the world justify.\n  I say, in conclusion, again, there is no money attached to this \namendment. This gives authority to the Defense Department to raise the \nArmy end strength, the number of troops on Active Duty by 30,000. If \nSecretary Gates decides, in his judgment, it is necessary to do in our \nnational interest, then he will either have to come back and ask us for \nthe money to do so or he will reprogram funds that are now under his \ncontrol.\n  I ask my colleagues for their support when this amendment comes up, \nand I hope it comes up soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Community College Initiative\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, President Obama was in Warren, MI, \ntoday, and a little while ago he made an announcement. He announced a \nnew $12 billion national community college initiative. That sounds very \ngood at first. As a former Governor and Secretary of Education for the \nUnited States, I am a big fan of community colleges. I think they are \nour secret weapon for helping men and women in this country go from one \njob to the next and to improve our workforce.\n  But I respectfully suggest that what the President, his Education \nSecretary and his economic advisers--and I think his Education \nSecretary may be his very best appointee of all--I say this with \nrespect, I think they ought to be asked to stay after school at the \ncommunity college and write on the blackboard 100 times that in a year \nin which we have run the Federal deficit up by another $1.8 trillion, I \nwill never again add another penny to entitlement mandatory spending. \nThen I think we in the Congress, as we legislate this year, ought to do \nsome truth in lending. To do that, we would have to put a little card \nwith every 1 of the 15 million student loans, if the President's \nproposal goes through, and say: The interest you are paying on the \nmoney you are borrowing is almost all being used to pay for somebody \nelse's scholarship in the President's community college initiative.\n  I think it is important to say that because, as good as it sounds to \nsay: Let's help the community colleges, I am afraid this is a familiar \nrefrain we have been hearing from the White House for the last 6 \nmonths. Instead of reducing entitlement spending the President is again \nadding to mandatory spending. Entitlement spending, which is driving up \nour debt to unbelievable numbers, a situation where the President's \nproposal for the next 10 years is more new debt than we spent, three \ntimes as much money as we spent in World War II. This is one more \nWashington takeover, in addition to banks and insurance companies and \ncar companies and maybe health care. It is now the student loans of the \ncountry.\n  It also changes the way we fund higher education, which is usually to \ntake almost all our money and give it to students in Pell grants and \nstudent loans and let them choose the college, rather than to give \ngrants the way we do with K-12.\n  Let me take a few minutes to explain why I am saying this. The idea \nthe President has is to spend $2.5 billion for community college \nfacilities, buildings. Every State has community colleges. One of our \nmajor jobs as governors and state legislators is to fund those \ncommunity colleges. Traditionally, the Federal Government gives \nscholarships, and the Pell grants often pay for almost the entire \ntuition at a community college, making them very important to American \nstudents. But this moves the Federal Government into construction and \nrenovation of community colleges, as well as $9 billion for competitive \nchallenge college grants to increase graduation rates and $500 million \nfor online curriculum. So the choice is, instead of more money for Pell \ngrants and administration of student loans, we are going to spend it on \ndirect grants to some community colleges. In other words, we are going \nto start funding higher education, community colleges, in the way we \nfund kindergarten through the 12th grade.\n  Despite the fact that higher education is by far the best in the \nworld, the most admired system--and one reason is because we don't have \na lot of Federal direct programs for it; we give the money to students, \nthey choose the school--we are going to start doing it more like K-12, \nwhich is not the most admired system in the world.\n  The $12 billion would be paid for out of savings from the regular \nstudent loan program we have now because under the President's plan all \nnew student loans would go through the U.S. Department of Education. So \nlet's take that idea first.\n  We have about $75 billion in student loans every year. That is a huge \nbank. Fifteen million students borrow money for student loans. Twelve \nmillion of them borrow through 2,000 different institutions--banks--and \nspend the money at 4,000 institutions of higher education. Three \nmillion choose to go through the government, where they get a direct \nloan directly from the government.\n  I was the Secretary of Education when this program was created. I \ndidn't see any reason for the Direct Loan Program because I didn't \nthink the U.S. Department of Education ought to be a bank. I thought \nthe Secretary of Education ought to be trying to be the educator of the \nyear, not the banker of the year. But the argument is, well, we can \nborrow money more cheaply in the government. We can borrow it for a \nquarter of 1 percent and then we can loan it out at 6.8 percent to \nstudents. Banks can't do that. So we will do it, and we will take it \nover and do it all here. We will do all 15 million loans from the U.S. \nDepartment of Education. We will be the banker of the year.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Government is getting real busy. This is \nbecoming the national headquarters for automobiles, where we own 60 \npercent of General Motors; we are running a bunch of banks; we run some \ninsurance companies; we are talking about a government-run health care \nprogram; and now we are going to take over and make a huge national \nbank out of the U.S. Department of Education. The reason is because we \ncan borrow money more cheaply here.\n  Well, why don't we just abolish all the financial institutions in \nAmerica and say: We can borrow money more cheaply than you can, so you \ngo away and we will do it all.\n  That is not the American way. In fact, most Americans would like to \nget the government out of the car business, out of the banking \nbusiness, and out of the insurance business. I can guarantee you that \nas soon as 15 million students start lining up outside the U.S. \nDepartment of Education to get their student loans, instead of going \nthrough their local banks and dealing with their local universities, \nthey are not going to be very happy about this either because they have \nhad a choice for nearly 20 years, and they have chosen to go to their \nprivate lenders.\n  So that is the first problem. We are canceling the choice that 12 \nmillion students are exercising this year to get a federally backed \nstudent loan from a bank even though they could have gotten a student \nloan directly from the government.\n  Then we are saying: All right, because we are canceling that, we are \nsaving $94 billion and we have money to spend. Well, in the first \nplace, that is not right, Mr. President. By my calculation, according \nto the Congressional Budget Office estimate of what it costs to operate \nthe current Direct Loan Program, it will cost about $32 billion over \nthe next 10 years, at least, to operate the entire student loan program \nout of the U.S. Department of Education.\n  My common sense tells me--and I have thought this for years--that \nthere is not any way a group of educators in the Department of \nEducation--a relatively small department--are going to operate more \nefficiently than banking institutions across America in making loans. \nThat is not their business. They know about scholarships and graduation \nrates, not about being bankers. My common sense tells me that, and I \nthink it does most Americans. Plus, we have a free market system, or at \nleast we did, where we try to get things out of government, not into \ngovernment.\n  So that is the proposal. Yet 32 billion of the dollars over the next \n10 years are\n\n[[Page S7474]]\n\nillusory savings, so we are really adding to the debt. Then the \nPresident is saying, well, let's take some of that $90 billion as \nmandatory spending. I know this gets a little complicated, but it is \nreally not that complicated. He is saying the money we now spend to pay \nthe costs to the government of loaning out this $75 billion every year \nis automatic mandatory spending, so let's take it away from how we now \nspend it on the administration with banks, and let's spend it instead \non mandatory spending for community colleges.\n  In other words, he has an opportunity to say let's take away some \nmoney that is being automatically spent every year and save it. Let's \nsave it. Or he could say, let's put it for students. But I think most \nof us would say--and he has said in his summit on entitlement \nspending--that we need to stop adding entitlement spending. But that is \nnot what he is doing.\n  Indeed, his other proposal--which is not announced today but is the \nrest of his proposal--is to say we have this $94 billion--which I think \nis closer to $60 billion or $50 billion--that we could save, and he is \ngoing to say we will make Pell grants entitlement spending. Well, Pell \ngrants are terrific grants. There are 5 million of them. We appropriate \nthem every year for low-income students. There was $19 billion \nappropriated for that purpose last year. The Congress has always been \nenormously generous with that. We appropriate a certain amount. It is \nalmost automatic, but it is not automatic.\n  In other words, we appropriate what we think we can afford, and then \nwe spend it on the students who need it. This proposal to shift Pell \ngrants to mandatory says it doesn't matter what we can afford, we are \njust going to do it. Again, it is exactly the kind of thing that most \neconomists, most Americans, and the President himself has said we need \nto stop doing. Yet in the full light of day, we are saying and \nannouncing that we are going to create a community college program, and \nlater a Pell grant program, and we are going to pay for it with \nmandatory automatic entitlement spending.\n  While the President says it is $94 billion that could be saved over \n10 years, the Congressional Budget Office said it is $293 billion--\nnearly $300 billion--in automatic spending over 10 years that we could \navoid. Yet the President is saying we should spend it. I am very \ndisappointed with that.\n  Then here is the last point I would like to emphasize--well, there \nare two points really. The President is saying: I am here today to do a \nfavor for you. I am going to spend $12 billion on community colleges. \nBut what he doesn't tell you is the people paying for that are the \npeople borrowing money to go to college.\n  So if you are getting an extra job at night so you can go to college, \nand you are taking out a student loan, the government is going to \nborrow money at a quarter of 1 percent and loan it to you at 6.8 \npercent and use the difference for its own purposes. We are making \nmoney on the backs of students who are borrowing money to go to college \nand then taking credit for spending it for somebody else's scholarship \nor some community college program and we are not telling anyone that. \nSo we need a little truth in lending.\n  Finally, I am concerned about the changes in direction from the way \nwe support higher education. We are very fortunate in America to have \nthis terrific higher education system, including our community \ncolleges. In a way, we got it by accident because with the GI bill, \nwhen the veterans came home from World War II, we just gave the money \nto them and they went anywhere they wanted to. That is not the way we \ndo with kindergarten through 12. We have all these programs. It is \ncommand and control, and we support the institution instead of the \nstudent. We call the argument about that ``vouchers.''\n  When we have arguments like that, we get all excited. We did in the \nAppropriations Committee the other day, and the Senator from Illinois \nand I argued--we each got 15 votes--about the DC voucher program: Shall \nwe give our money to students and let them choose a school or shall we \nsupport the school? Well, in higher education, 85 percent of the \ndollars we spend, or some figure about like that, goes to the student, \nwho then chooses the school. It may be a community college or a Jewish \nschool or an African American school or a Catholic school or a public \nschool or a private school or a for-profit school. We don't care, as \nlong as it is accredited.\n  As a result, we have a higher education system that attracts the best \nforeign students anywhere in the world and gives Americans choices. As \na result we have almost all the best colleges and universities in the \nworld.\n\n  So this proposal is a little shift from that to say the Federal \nGovernment would take all the money--which I would argue we don't \nhave--but this $12 billion we are going to give to grants in higher \neducation instead of to students. I would rather give it to students.\n  So I applaud the President for his interest in higher education and \ncommunity colleges, but I would suggest to him that we have too much \ndebt and too many Washington takeovers, and we shouldn't be funding \nthis program on the backs of the students who are borrowing money and \nworking an extra job to go to college. I don't think they would \nappreciate knowing that the interest they are paying is mostly going to \npay for someone else's scholarship. They might ask: Why do I have to do \nthat? Why isn't that person in the same shape I am?\n  The President was in Warren, MI, in the middle of the auto business, \nand we have some suggestions--or I would have--for other ways to deal \nwith the problems we have with the economy today. One would be that \nsince we are near the General Motors headquarters, to celebrate their \nemergence from bankruptcy by giving the 60 percent of the stock the \ngovernment owns in General Motors back to the taxpayers who paid taxes \non April 15; that we should focus on cheap energy so we can \nreindustrialize America, including our automobile industry, by 100 \nnuclear powerplants; that we could take the mandatory spending and \ninstead of spending it, save it and have less debt. That would be a \nreal favor to the students.\n  To revitalize housing, we could have Senator Isakson's $15,000 tax \ncredit to help get the housing market going again. Then in our health \ncare debate we could stop talking about more government takeovers and, \ninstead, take the available dollars and give the money to low-income \nAmericans and let them buy their own insurance, like most of the rest \nof us have.\n  So this is a big difference of opinion we have. As noble as the idea \nof supporting community colleges is, this is not the way to do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 15 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Another Washington takeover and too much debt. There \nis a better way.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes, to be followed by the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, \nwho wishes to speak for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1469\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to voice my \nsupport for the Levin-McCain amendment to strike $1.75 billion added to \nthe bill that is on the Senate floor to purchase additional F-22 \naircraft that have not been requested by the Pentagon.\n  I believe this amendment presents us with an important choice of what \nour national security priorities will be going forward: Will we \ncontinue to pour billions and billions of dollars into weapon systems \ndespite the fact they are not requested and despite cost overruns and \nprogram delays, or will we make the hard choices necessary to ensure \nthat our troops in the field have what they need to fight present and \nfuture conflicts?\n  I believe the choice is clear. I am aware this means, for some States \nthat are making this plane or have subcontracts--and we have some in \nour own State--that this means jobs. But if we don't move forward to \nwhat we really need to produce for our troops today, we are never going \nto be able to do the best for our troops and do the best for our \ncountry.\n  By the way, as we move forward, that means jobs. I was just up in \nnorthern\n\n[[Page S7475]]\n\nMinnesota visiting a little company that has no contacts with the \nmilitary, no political connections to get contracts, and they had been \nin a very open, transparent process because they make an incredibly \nlight backpack that is good for the troops, good for their back, and \nthey got the contract. This is a new era, and part of this new era is \ntransparency. Part of the new era means we actually will look at what \nour military needs.\n  No one can dispute that the F-22 possesses unique flying and combat \ncapabilities or that it will serve an important role in protecting our \nNation in the future. The question is not whether we should keep the F-\n22 in service, the question is whether we should purchase additional \nplanes at the expense of more urgent needs for our troops.\n  Our Armed Forces are currently fighting in two major conflicts in \nIraq and Afghanistan. After more than 7 years in Afghanistan and more \nthan 6 years in Iraq, the F-22 has not been used in combat. It has not \nflown over those countries. Over the course of these conflicts, we have \nseen the tragic consequences when our troops don't have the equipment \nand resources they need, such as enhanced body armor or vehicles to \nprotect them from IEDs. We have seen what happens when we don't give \nour troops what they need. We cannot continue on this course. We must \nfocus our defense resources on the personnel, equipment, and systems \nnecessary to respond quickly to unconventional and evolving conflicts \nwhile maintaining the ability to counter conventional foes.\n  For years, Members on both sides of the aisle have come to the Senate \nFloor to denounce wasteful spending in our defense budget and called on \nthe Pentagon to be more responsible in its budgetary and procurement \npolicies. Hearing this call, our military leaders have produced a plan \nthis year to address wasteful and unnecessary defense spending so we \ncan ensure that we are providing our Armed Forces the tools they need \nto keep America safe and strong while also ensuring that taxpayer \ndollars are used responsibly.\n  We have a major debt in this country. Some of it is because of \nmistakes made in the past. With this economy, there is enough blame to \ngo around everywhere. We have a major debt, a major deficit, and we \nhave troops who need to get the equipment they deserve. What is the \nanswer, put $1.75 billion into some planes the Pentagon says they do \nnot need? I don't think that is the answer.\n  It should be noted that the limit on the number of F-22s that the \nLevin-McCain amendment would restore is supported by the Secretary of \nDefense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and both the current and the \nimmediate past Presidents of the United States.\n  I believe Senators Levin and McCain should be commended for their \ndedication to improving our defense posture and budget and for putting \ntheir own political interests aside--their own jobs, in their own \nStates.\n  Earlier this spring, I was traveling with Senator McCain in Vietnam \nwhen the Pentagon's proposed reductions, including the F-22s, were \nannounced. I discussed with him at length what this would mean, the \ndifficult decisions that Members are going to have in their own States. \nBut I also talked to him about what the troops need. Right now the \ntroops and their commanders are telling us they do not need these \nplanes, so it is a testament to the service of Senator McCain to our \nNation and the work Senator Levin has done for years that they are \nleading the fight to defend the recommendations of our military and \ncivilian leaders. I am proud to join them.\n  This amendment presents us with an opportunity. We can begin making \ndecisions based on security interests and fiscal responsibility and cut \n$1.75 billion for additional F-22 aircraft that our military commanders \nsay they do not need or we continue on a course that cannot be \nsustained. I urge my colleagues to do what is in this Nation's best \nlong-term interest, in the best interests of our troops, and to vote \nfor the Levin-McCain amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from Minnesota \nfor yielding me this time and, second, I wish to talk today about \nwaste. We are all concerned about waste. I have an amendment which I \nunderstand I cannot call up because the parliamentary situation is such \nthat the floor leaders did not wish to have another amendment brought \nup.\n  This sign here, which is a type of sign that is proliferating across \nour Nation everywhere, reflects waste. It is totally inexcusable. It is \na political advertisement for money that is being spent as a result of \nthe stimulus package. That is all it is. The sign says: ``Project \nFunded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Completion August \n2009.''\n  That is a political statement, the purpose of which is to promote \nspending on the stimulus package. I did not vote for the stimulus \npackage. I thought a program which is going to spend almost 50 percent \nof the money after the year 2011 made little sense and was not stimulus \nat all. But I certainly would not have expected that as a result of \nthis program we would be funding these signs all over America to \npromote this program.\n  These signs are not cheap, by the way. In New Hampshire we get them \nfor less than most places. They cost about $300 a sign. But in Georgia \nthey cost $1,700 a sign; in Pennsylvania they cost $2,000 a sign; in \nNew Jersey they are costing $3,000 per sign. Literally, there are \n20,000 projects going on--most of them paving projects across this \ncountry, paving projects most of which may have occurred anyway, but in \nany event they are paving projects. If you start multiplying the number \nof signs going up, and each one of these projects require having two or \nthree signs put up, you are talking very significant dollars, you are \ntalking tens of millions of dollars for self-promotion of these \nprograms.\n  Ironically, these signs are actually required before people can get \nthe funds. We had a gentleman in one of our towns in New Hampshire, I \nthink it was Derry, who said, before he would be released the dollars \nto do the project in his town that the town had applied for and it had \napproved, they had to agree to put up this sign. He didn't want to put \nup the sign. He thought it was a waste of money, but he was required to \nput up this sign.\n  Why are we doing this? The American people are sort of tired of us \nwasting dollars. They are especially tired of us wasting dollars trying \nto blow our own horn around here. If the administration believed these \nsigns promoting the stimulus package were so valuable, let them spend \ncampaign funds--because that is what they are, they are campaign \nsigns--to put them up. But instead we are putting these signs up.\n  What these signs should say if we are going to put them up is: \nProject funded by the future generations of American taxpayers--and \nthey add to the debt of our children. That should be added under here, \n``add to the debt of our children.''\n  The signs have no value at all, none, other than self-promotion of \nthese projects.\n  Maybe some of the projects are legitimate. I think probably most of \nthem are legitimate. To the extent they are done within this period of \nrecession, I support them. The problem I had with the stimulus package \nwas so much of the money was being spent outside the period when we \nknow the recession will be over. But even if the projects are \nlegitimate, which most of them I am sure are--although some have been \nquestioned, such as the crossing path for turtles. That received a fair \namount of press. I have to say I didn't understand why we had to build \nan underpass for turtles, but I don't live in whatever State that was \nin. But as a very practical matter, the underpass for turtles had a \nsign which said the project is being built at the expense of the \nAmerican taxpayers, promoting the American Recovery and Reinvestment \nAct.\n  This is foolish. This is the type of thing that drives taxpayers \ncrazy, and it should. It is so inexcusable. People get outraged by us \ndoing things such as this and by the Government doing things such as \nthis. You drive by this sign and, if you have a chainsaw in the back of \nyour truck, you want to cut them down. Of course, they put them up in \nsteel so you have to have a blowtorch, but in any event they should not \nbe out there, and they certainly should not be out there costing $300 \nto $3,000\n\n[[Page S7476]]\n\nper sign. That money, at the minimum--first, it should not have been \nspent. But if it is going to be spent, it should have been actually \nspent on the project itself or other projects which were deserving. But \ncertainly there was no reason to spend it to promote the project \nthrough these signs.\n  I will have an amendment which says, essentially, no more signs, no \nmore wasting taxpayers' dollars on signs that cost $3,000 promoting \nprojects for the purposes of political aggrandizement. I hope to be \nable to call it up as we move forward on the Defense bill. I recognize \nit is not immediately a defense issue, but unfortunately this is the \nonly authorizing bill floating around the body. These signs are going \nup like weeds across the Nation. Every time they go up, they cost our \nchildren a few thousand dollars on the national debt. So if we are \ngoing to stop that type of profligate spending, we have to act now. \nTherefore, I am going to call up this amendment when the proper time \noccurs on the floor.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I hope, if our colleagues might have \nremarks on the pending amendment, they would come over now or give us \nsome indication they might want to speak in the morning because we need \nto press ahead with this amendment. In the next few minutes, I am going \nto be making inquiry with the other side of the aisle to see if we \ncannot reach a unanimous consent agreement to have a vote tomorrow \nmorning. We tried this yesterday without success and earlier today \nwithout success, but we are going to try again because it is important \nwe resolve this amendment, dispose of this amendment, so we can go on \nwith other amendments to the bill. I will be making that inquiry of my \ngood friend from Arizona in the next few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to express my \nopposition to the Levin-McCain amendment that would cut off production \nof the F-22 fleet and would hurt hard-working families in the aerospace \nindustry across our country.\n  I know many of my colleagues have come to the floor to echo their \nopposition to this amendment, and I have listened to them speak very \nconvincingly about how it would limit our continued air superiority in \nthe skies across the globe. I have listened to them talk about how \nallowing our air superiority to slip would mean we could lose our \nability to safeguard our Nation in the years ahead. They have also \nnoted that prominent military officials have been clear that cutting \noff production of the F-22 would put our Nation's defense at high to \nmoderate risk.\n  While I agree with my colleagues on all of these points, today I want \nto discuss on the floor, this afternoon, another negative consequence \nof this amendment that would harm our security, our economy, and our \nability to respond quickly to threats in the future--a consequence that \nwill hit home for so many in States such as Georgia, Connecticut, \nTexas, California, and Washington, where every day we are fighting \nrising unemployment. It is another area in which our country has had \nclear superiority but where today, because of actions like this \namendment, we are slipping into deep trouble.\n  Today, I want to discuss how this amendment will erode the health and \nlong-term needs of our Nation's industrial base. As many here in this \nbody know, this is not the first time I have sounded the alarm about \nour disappearing industrial base. This effort to prematurely cut \nproduction of the F-22 is simply the latest in a series of decisions \nthat fail to take into account the men and women who work every day to \nprovide for their families by building the equipment that protects our \ncountry. But, as I have said all along, protecting our domestic base is \nnot just about one company or one program or one State or one industry. \nThis is about our Nation's economic stability. It is about our future \nmilitary capability and the ability to retain skilled family-wage jobs \nin communities throughout our country.\n  Just a few months ago, we passed a long overdue bill in the Senate \nthat reforms many of the Pentagon's procurement practices. In that \nbill, I worked with Chairman Levin and others to successfully add an \namendment that draws the attention of the Pentagon leadership to \nconsider the effects of their decisions on our industrial base and its \nability to meet our national security objectives. I worked to include \nthat provision because I believe it is time to start a serious \nconversation about the future of the men and women who produce our \ntanks, our boats, and our planes, the skilled workers our military \ndepends on. It is a workforce that is disappearing before our eyes.\n  Providing the equipment our warfighters need is a partnership. It is \na partnership that requires the Pentagon to be actively engaged with \nthe manufacturers that supply the systems and parts that make up our \naircraft and defense systems. It is a partnership that requires the \nPentagon to take into account how our workforce and manufacturing \ncapability will be affected when they cancel vital programs.\n  Unfortunately, today military procurement is a one-way street. In \nfact, just yesterday, the Aerospace Industries Association issued a \nmajor report. I have it here in my hand today. This report finds that \nthe Pentagon has failed to consider industrial efforts when choosing \nstrategies.\n  Much like my amendment to the procurement reform bill, this report \nurges the Pentagon to take into account the impact decisions, like the \none to stop production of the F-22, take on our manufacturing base. \nThis report--and I urge my colleagues to take a look at it if you have \nnot seen it--notes that our manufacturing base was not taken into \naccount in past Quadrennial Defense Reviews and that when Secretary \nGates unveiled his program cuts in April, he specifically said that \ndefense industry jobs were not a factor in his decisions.\n  Well, as our country faces two difficult but not unrelated \nchallenges--safeguarding our country in a dangerous world and \nrebuilding our faltering economy--ignoring the needs of our industrial \nbase should not be an option. Whether it is the scientists who are \ndesigning the next generation of military satellites or the engineers \nwho are improving our radar systems or the machinists who assemble our \nwarplanes, these industries and their workers are one of our greatest \nstrategic assets. What if they were not available? What if we made \nbudgetary and policy decisions without taking into account the future \nneeds of our domestic workforce? Well, that is not impossible. It is \nnot even unthinkable. It is actually happening today.\n  We need to be clear about the ramifications of amendments such as the \none that has been offered here today because once our plants shut down \nand once our skilled workers have moved on to other fields and once \nthat basic infrastructure is gone, we are not going to be able to \nrebuild it overnight. Building an F-22 is not something you learn in \nschool. It takes years of on-the-job experience. Ask any one of the \nworkers from Forth Worth to Baltimore who are responsible for the \nintricate radar systems or the high-tech engine parts or the complex \nstealth technology. We have machinists today in this country who have \npast experience and know-how down the ranks for 50 years. We have \nengineers who know our mission and who know the needs of our soldiers \nand sailors and airmen and marines. We have a reputation for delivering \nfor our military. It took us a long time to build this industrial base \nto the point where we have workers who can make fifth-generation air \nfighter planes. What we have left we have to work to keep because once \nour plants shut down, those industries are gone, and we not only lose \nthe jobs but we lose the skills and the potential ability to provide \nour military with the equipment to defend our Nation and project our \nmight worldwide.\n  So today, as we consider a critical tool for the future of our \nmilitary across the globe, we cannot forget the needs of our industrial \nbase, because unless we begin to address this issue\n\n[[Page S7477]]\n\nnow and really think about it, we are not only going to lose some of \nour best-paying American jobs, we are going to lose the backbone of our \nmilitary might.\n  At a time when we are looking to create jobs and build the economy, \neliminating the $12 billion in economic activity and thousands of \nAmerican jobs that are tied to the F-22 production does not make sense \nto me. Supporting continued F-22 production will help defend against \npotential threats, and, of course, it will protect family-wage jobs, \nand, importantly, it will preserve our domestic base.\n  So I urge our colleagues to oppose the amendment that has been \noffered.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Matthew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Act\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I would like to speak on the National \nDefense authorization bill that is pending before the Senate in \nreference to an amendment that would be on that bill.\n  More than a decade ago, on a cold night in Wyoming, a young man was \nassaulted and killed simply for being who he was. The brutality of that \nmurder shocked the Nation. But even more shocking was the motive for \nthe crime. Matthew Shepard was targeted and killed that night for \nnothing more than his sexual orientation.\n  The fact that the vicious attack could occur at all is hard to \nbelieve. But the fact that it was done out of blind hatred is simply \ntoo much to bear. So we must make sure Matthew Shepard's death was not \nin vain.\n  We must shape a positive legacy from the ashes of this terrible \ntragedy. I believe this is the next chapter in the struggle against \nhatred and in the favor of equal rights. As we have been called to do \nthroughout our history, I believe it is time to take action once again.\n  I rise today in support of the legislation inspired by Matthew's \ntragic story. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Matthew Shepard Local \nLaw Enforcement Hate Crime Prevention Act. If it becomes law, the \nMatthew Shepard Act will add ``sexual orientation'' to the definition \nof hate crimes under Federal law, giving law enforcement officials the \ntools they need to bring all violent criminals to justice.\n  Many States already have hate crimes legislation on the books. I am \nproud to say my home State of Illinois is among them. But we need to \nmake sure violent criminals face the same penalties in Washington as \nthey do in Illinois and across the Nation.\n  Hate crimes are assaults against individuals, but they tragically \ntarget an entire group of people. Matthew Shepard was not just a young \ngay man, he was a very young gay man. Colleagues, it is time to take a \nstand. It is time for the Senate to help end the hatred, to reaffirm \nour commitment to an America that is as free and as equal as our \nfounders intended for it to be, to make sure that no American lives in \nfear because of who they are.\n  As a former attorney general of Illinois, I have been fighting hate \ncrimes for many years. Since the very beginning of my career, I have \nspoken out against injustice and worked hard to end discrimination. So \nI understand how important the Matthew Shepherd Act will be as we seek \nto bring criminals to justice for their actions.\n  But some have expressed concern about this measure. I have heard from \nIllinois residents who worry that this may prevent them or their \nreligious leaders from expressing their faith. As a deeply religious \nAmerican myself, I would oppose any bill that restricts our freedom of \nspeech or our freedom of religion.\n  So let me assure my constituents and my colleagues that the Matthew \nShepard Act applies to violent crimes, not religious speech. It will \nhelp us end murder and assault, but it will not affect the sermons \npeople will hear every Sunday or the ability to preach the things they \nbelieve.\n  A decade has passed since Matthew Shepard's tragic death. We must not \nlet another year go by without the Matthew Shepard Act as the law of \nthe land.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation. Hopefully, we will be able to have hate crimes as a crime \non the books in the Nation as well as in our States.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 30 years ago this November, two \nAmericans were killed when a mob attacked the American Embassy in \nIslamabad, Pakistan. I wish to pay tribute to those men, Marine CPL \nSteven Crowley and Army WO Brian Ellis.\n  Just a little over 2 weeks earlier, 66 Americans had been taken \nhostage by students in Tehran. On November 21, 1979, Ayatollah \nKhomeini, the Supreme Leader of Iran, took to the airwaves and falsely \naccused American troops of occupying the Great Mosque in Mecca.\n  Protests raged against the United States throughout Pakistan that \nday. A student protest formed outside the gates of the American Embassy \ncompound in Islamabad, but it quickly turned violent. Protesters broke \ndown part of the wall, surged into the compound, and began shooting at \nAmerican forces, breaking windows, and setting fire to the buildings.\n  Most of the Embassy staff members were able to get to a secure \ncommunications room, where they remained for over 5 hours until the \nPakistani military arrived to quell the rioters. Corporal Crowley was \nkilled while protecting the compound; Warrant Officer Ellis was found \nburned to death in his apartment on the compound. Two Pakistani \nemployees of the Embassy were also killed by rioters that day.\n  This weekend, survivors of that attack will meet at Arlington \nNational Cemetery. My thoughts and prayers will be with them as they \nremember those whose lives were cut short that fateful day in November.\n  Steven Crowley and Brian Ellis died in the line of duty, serving \ntheir country and defending American lives. Their service must not be \nforgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/14/senate-section/article/S7477-3", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7477-S7478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              COMMENDING THE NORTH DAKOTA WHEAT COMMISSION\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I honor the North Dakota \nWheat Commission.\n  On July 8, the North Dakota Wheat Commission celebrated its 50th year \nmarketing and promoting wheat on behalf of my State's farm families. As \nthe top spring wheat and durum wheat producing State in the Nation, I \nam proud of what the North Dakota Wheat Commission has been able to \nachieve for our State's producers.\n  The commission, created by the North Dakota Legislature in 1959, has \nallowed my State's farmers to become more actively engaged in the \nexport and market promotion of our wheat crop because the commission is \nfunded and directed by producers. During its 50 years of existence, \nNorth Dakota's average wheat production has increased from 100 million \nbushels to 300 million bushels annually. In that same\n\n[[Page S7478]]\n\ntime period, total U.S. exports have increased from 500 million bushels \nto 1.3 billion bushels.\n  Thanks in part to the work of the North Dakota Wheat Commission, U.S. \nhard red spring and durum wheat are exported to more than 80 countries \naround the world. These exports account for 50 percent of hard red \nspring wheat and one-third of durum wheat. The North Dakota Wheat \nCommission's customer base includes markets across the globe, including \nAsia, Latin America and Europe.\n  While our wheat output and exports have increased, one thing has \nremained the same: My State's wheat producers have a solid reputation \naround the world for having a premium product. This is, in part, thanks \nto the hard work of the North Dakota Wheat Commission.\n  In closing, I again want to recognize the North Dakota Wheat \nCommission for a successful first 50 years and wish them continued \nsuccess in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/14/senate-section/article/S7478-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          COMMENDING ERIC YANG\n\n Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \nachievements of Eric Yang, a 13-year-old seventh grade student at \nGriffin Middle School in The Colony, TX. Eric recently competed in and \nwon the 2009 National Geographic Bee, held here in Washington, DC. Out \nof a field of 55 contestants, one from each of the 50 States and \nterritories, Eric won the competition in the third finals tie-breaker. \nOut of nine students, Eric was the only one who missed no questions. \nThis has only occurred five times in the competition's 21-year history. \nIn recognition of his success, Eric will receive a college scholarship \nworth $25,000, a lifetime membership in the National Geographic \nSociety, and a trip to the Galapagos Islands with the moderator of the \nNational Geographic Bee and host of ``Jeopardy!,'' Alex Trebek. To \nachieve this honor, Eric won a nationwide contest comprised of nearly 5 \nmillion students in the fourth through eighth grades who had \nparticipated in the local geographic bees held in the 50 States and \nfive territories.\n  The winning question was: ``Timis County shares its name with a \ntributary of the Danube and is located in the western part of which \nEuropean country?'' The answer, ``Romania,'' was given correctly by \nEric Yang after two other tie-breaker questions. Eric is the first \nTexan to be named champion in the competition's 21-year history. \nAccording to Eric's mother, the main reason for his success has been \nhis curiosity, saying that it ``is a major part of Eric. He reads \neverything from history books to cookbooks to learn about other places \nand cultures.'' Eric's desire to learn is also evident in his \nscholastic record. At age 13, Eric scored a 2200 on the SATs out of a \npossible score of 2400.\n  Young Texans, such as Eric Yang, prove that persistence and a curious \nmind are the keys to unlocking opportunities for success. I \ncongratulate Eric on this important accomplishment and encourage him as \nhe continues his quest for knowledge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/14/senate-section/article/S7478-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COMMENDING JOE AND CHRISTINE TOWNSEND\n\n Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I recognize the distinguished \nservice of two Texans, as they approach retirement from Texas A in \nJanuary 2010. For over 30 years, Dr. Joe D. Townsend and Dr. Christine \nTownsend, often referred to as ``Dr. Joe and Dr. Chris'' by their \nstudents, have served the students of Texas as instructors, mentors, \nand friends. By recognizing and cultivating the untapped potential \nwithin students, they have inspired countless youth to be men and women \nof character, vision, and dedication.\n  Dr. Joe began serving students over 40 years ago as a vocational \nagriculture teacher in Aubrey, TX. Since that time, he has positively \nimpacted the lives of thousands of students through many different \nroles. At Texas A University, Dr. Joe served as a professor, \nassociate dean for student development in the College of Agriculture \nand Life Sciences, and most recently, associate vice president for \nstudent affairs. His office was known as refuge for students in need of \nwisdom and advice, and many relied on his support and encouragement to \nmake the difficult transition from high school to college.\n  Dr. Chris' career in higher education began three decades ago at \nIllinois State University. At Texas A, Dr. Chris has served as a \nprofessor, department head, undergraduate coordinator, and \nundergraduate adviser in the department of agricultural leadership, \neducation, and development. She has a gift for recognizing the unique \nneeds of students and never failed to commit her time, energy, and \nresources to meeting their needs. Dr. Chris' love for teaching students \nhas made a lasting impact on her department and her departure will \nleave a void that will be difficult to fill, and a legacy that will be \neasy to remember.\n  Their years of selfless service and unwavering devotion to the \nimprovement of students' lives have earned the respect of countless \nTexans.

Mr. President, today I wish to pay \ntribute to a good friend and great Nebraskan, Jack Eberspacher, who \npassed away on July 5, 2009, at the tender age of 55 after a short but \ncourageous battle with cancer. Jack was a very special friend to all \nwho knew him, dedicating his professional life to the advancement and \nbetterment of the agricultural industry and the agribusiness community.\n  A native of Seward, NE, Jack received his bachelor of science degree \nfrom the University of Nebraska at Lincoln. After several years working \nin various agribusiness positions throughout the United States, Jack \nwas named the chief executive officer of the National Grain Sorghum \nProducers Association, headquartered in Lubbock, TX. He is credited \nwith growing that association by 300 percent and with developing \nbalanced association programs on policy, plant science and utilization, \nand for placing the association on the national legislative and \nregulatory scene.\n  In 1998, Jack accepted the position of chief executive officer of the \nNational Association of Wheat Growers here in Washington, DC. Under his \nleadership, the organization experienced a financial turnaround, with \nJack leading the group out of a negative budget in net earnings to a \npositive one in just over 2 years.\n  Jack was appointed president and chief executive officer of the \nAgricultural Retailers Association in 2001, where he remained until his \npassing. In this capacity, he increased the annual association dues \nrevenue by more than 100 percent. In February 2002, he was the only \ncommodity leader invited to address the National Governors' Conference, \nwhere he discussed the importance of the 2002 farm bill and the state \nof the agricultural economy.\n  Jack was also a political activist and volunteer; an active member of \nthe Bennett Roundtable of the Farm Foundation of Chicago, Illinois; and \na recipient of the Alpha Gamma Rho Fraternity Brother of the Century \nAward.\n  I offer my most sincere condolences to Jack's wife Jinger and their \nfamily. Jack's passion for service, dynamic leadership, and unwavering \ndedication to the greater agribusiness community will remain a source \nof inspiration to all those who knew him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/14/senate-section/article/S7478-4", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7478-S7479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THUNDER ROAD INTERNATIONAL SPEEDBOWL\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, today I honor a renowned Vermont \nlandmark and business, Thunder Road International SpeedBowl, which is \ncelebrating its 50th anniversary this season.\n  Thursday nights every summer, short track races take place on Thunder \nRoad's uniquely configured quarter-mile paved track. Thunder Road has \nbeen recognized as one of the finest short tracks in the Nation. Built \nin 1959 on farm land in Barre, VT, by longtime network sports \ncommentator Ken Squier and his partners, Thunder Road is an American \ninstitution of which Vermont is proud.\n  Thunder Road has offered inexpensive family entertainment for five \ndecades. This revered race track has brought international racing stars \nto the Green Mountain State while also offering opportunities for \nVermonters\n\n[[Page S7479]]\n\nto compete in front of passionate and knowledgeable fans.\n  After World War II, there were more than 22 short tracks in the State \nof Vermont. With only three tracks remaining, Thunder Road stands out \nas the largest spectator sports venue in the State.\n  Today, some drivers at Thunder Road can recall watching their \ngrandfathers drive the same track. ``Thunder Road is just about \nracing--there's no politics, no marketing--it's just racing and it's \nalways been that way,'' said Steve Letarte, a Maine native and crew \nchief for NASCAR star Jeff Gordon.\n  Vermonters appreciate Thunder Road for its longtime contributions to \nits community. For 50 years, this short track has been an invaluable \ninstitution for the people of Vermont and throughout the \nNortheast.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/14/senate-section/article/S7479-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                125TH ANNIVERSARY OF WHITE, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize White, SD. The \ntown of White will celebrate the 125th anniversary of its founding this \nyear.\n  Located in Brookings County, White was founded as an agricultural \ntown in 1884.

A bill to amend Public Law 106-392 to maintain annual base \nfunding for the Bureau of Reclamation for the Upper Colorado River and \nSan Juan fish recovery programs through fiscal year 2023; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nBureau of Reclamation Fish Recovery Programs Reauthorization Act of \n2009 with my colleagues Senator Udall of New Mexico, Senator Udall of \nColorado, Senator Bennet, Senator Bennett, and Senator Hatch. This bill \nwill extend the Bureau of Reclamation's authorization to provide cost \nsharing for capital construction and annual operations from 2011 \nthrough 2023 for the Upper Colorado and San Juan River Basin endangered \nfish recovery programs.\n  The programs have the dual goals of recovering federally listed \nendangered fish species in the Upper Colorado River basin while \nallowing water development and management activities to proceed in \ncompliance with state laws, interstate compacts and the federal \nEndangered Species Act. The programs have substantial support from the \nUpper Basin states of New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming and Utah, the \nNavajo Nation, the Jicarilla Apache Nation, the Southern Ute Tribe, and \nthe Ute Mountain Tribe. Other water users, power customers and \nenvironmental organizations are also active participants in the \nprograms. The Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, the \nNational Park Service and Western Area Power Administration also \nparticipate in the programs. All of the partners contribute \nsignificantly to the success of the programs.\n  Since 2000, the Bureau of Reclamation has been authorized to utilize \nrevenues generated from Colorado River Storage Project Act projects as \nbase funding for operation and maintenance of capital projects, \nmonitoring and research to evaluate the need for, and effectiveness of, \nany recovery action, and for general program management. This bill \nextends the Bureau of Reclamation's authority to provide annual base \nfunding for the programs through 2023 which coincides with the term of \nthe existing Cooperative Agreements for the recovery programs and the \nexpected date of recovery for certain species covered by the programs. \nThe annual base funding contributes significantly to the successful \nimplementation of the recovery actions in both programs.\n  Currently the Bureau of Reclamation's ability to use such funding \nwill expire in 2011. If the expiration date is not extended, the annual \nbase funding will be significantly reduced which would likely delay or \nimpede the success of the recovery programs. The original authorizing \nlegislation has been extended most recently through Section 9107 of the \nOmnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, P.L. 111-11, and the \namendments proposed by this bill would ensure that the Bureau of \nReclamation's authorization for base funding coincides with the other \nauthorizing provisions in P.L. 106-392.\n  I hope my colleagues will work with me and the bi-partisan group of \ncosponsors to help ensure that the recovery goals of the San Juan and \nUpper Colorado River Basin Recovery Programs can continue to be met. I \ntherefore urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n[[Page S7483]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1453\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This division may be cited as the ``Matthew Shepard Hate \n     Crimes Prevention Act''.\n\n     SEC. _02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The incidence of violence motivated by the actual or \n     perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, \n     sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability of the \n     victim poses a serious national problem.\n       (2) Such violence disrupts the tranquility and safety of \n     communities and is deeply divisive.\n       (3) State and local authorities are now and will continue \n     to be responsible for prosecuting the overwhelming majority \n     of violent crimes in the United States, including violent \n     crimes motivated by bias. These authorities can carry out \n     their responsibilities more effectively with greater Federal \n     assistance.\n       (4) Existing Federal law is inadequate to address this \n     problem.\n       (5) A prominent characteristic of a violent crime motivated \n     by bias is that it devastates not just the actual victim and \n     the family and friends of the victim, but frequently savages \n     the community sharing the traits that caused the victim to be \n     selected.\n       (6) Such violence substantially affects interstate commerce \n     in many ways, including the following:\n       (A) The movement of members of targeted groups is impeded, \n     and members of such groups are forced to move across State \n     lines to escape the incidence or risk of such violence.\n       (B) Members of targeted groups are prevented from \n     purchasing goods and services, obtaining or sustaining \n     employment, or participating in other commercial activity.\n       (C) Perpetrators cross State lines to commit such violence.\n       (D) Channels, facilities, and instrumentalities of \n     interstate commerce are used to facilitate the commission of \n     such violence.\n       (E) Such violence is committed using articles that have \n     traveled in interstate commerce.\n       (7) For generations, the institutions of slavery and \n     involuntary servitude were defined by the race, color, and \n     ancestry of those held in bondage. Slavery and involuntary \n     servitude were enforced, both prior to and after the adoption \n     of the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, through widespread public and private violence \n     directed at persons because of their race, color, or \n     ancestry, or perceived race, color, or ancestry. Accordingly, \n     eliminating racially motivated violence is an important means \n     of eliminating, to the extent possible, the badges, \n     incidents, and relics of slavery and involuntary servitude.\n       (8) Both at the time when the 13th, 14th, and 15th \n     amendments to the Constitution of the United States were \n     adopted, and continuing to date, members of certain religious \n     and national origin groups were and are perceived to be \n     distinct ``races''.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON NEGOTIATING CONCESSIONS WITH \n                   TERRORISTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States has a longstanding policy of opposing \n     negotiations with terrorists and terrorist organizations on \n     concessions of any kind, including ransom demands, prisoner \n     releases, and hostage exchanges. This longstanding policy has \n     been repeated by numerous administrations over the past 4 \n     decades.\n       (2) For example, at an August 4, 1975 meeting between \n     President Gerald Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger \n     and Yugoslavian President Josip Tito, Secretary Kissinger \n     explained that the United States ``position is, as it has \n     always been, that we refuse to negotiate and to pay ransom in \n     these cases. We do this in order not to encourage the capture \n     of other Americans for the same purpose.''.\n       (3) In his comments to President Tito, Secretary Kissinger \n     explained the basis for the United States policy, as well as \n     his expectation that the United States would never change \n     this no-negotiation policy: ``The American Government will \n     always refuse to negotiate because that is the only way we \n     can keep demands from being made upon us.''.\n       (4) In the same conversation, President Ford said, ``It's \n     our strong feeling that if we were to breach this hard line \n     that we take there would be no end to the demands being made \n     upon us. We have to be tough and that is right in the long \n     run.''.\n       (5) On January 20, 1986, President Ronald Reagan issued \n     National Security Decision Directive 207, which prohibits \n     negotiations with terrorist organizations regarding the \n     release of hostages.\n       (6) National Security Decision Directive 207 sets forth in \n     unequivocal terms the United States ``firm opposition to \n     terrorism in all its forms'' and makes clear the Government's \n     ``conviction that to accede to terrorist demands places more \n     American citizens at risk. This no-concessions policy is the \n     best way of protecting the greatest number of people and \n     ensuring their safety.''.\n       (7) National Security Decision Directive 207 continues to \n     say: ``The [United States Government] will pay no ransoms, \n     nor permit releases of prisoners or agree to other conditions \n     that could serve to encourage additional terrorism. We will \n     make no changes in our policy because of terrorist threats or \n     acts.''.\n       (8) Department of State Publication 10217, which was \n     released in similar formats by the administrations of George \n     H.W. Bush in 1991 and Bill Clinton in 1994, espouses the same \n     no-concessions policy and makes clear that the United States \n     ``will not support the freeing of prisoners from \n     incarceration in response to terrorist demands.''.\n       (9) On April 4, 2002, President George W. Bush said, \n     ``[t]error must be stopped. No nation can negotiate with \n     terrorists, for there is no way to make peace with those \n     whose only goal is death.''.\n       (10) Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while serving in \n     the United States Senate, wrote in 2007 that the United \n     States ``cannot negotiate with individual terrorists; they \n     must be hunted down and captured or killed.''.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the United States should firmly maintain its \n     longstanding policy against negotiating with terrorists and \n     terrorist organizations on any concession or demand. It is \n     further the sense of the Senate that any abandonment or \n     weakening of this policy would endanger the safety of \n     American citizens, including United States servicemen, and \n     increase terrorist kidnappings, hostage demands, and murders.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1532.
