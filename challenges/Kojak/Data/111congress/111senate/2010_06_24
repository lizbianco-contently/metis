Madam President, it was really a pleasure for me this \nmorning to listen to and visit with Rev. Marvin Gant. Marvin is from \nthe town where I went to high school. When I went to high school there, \nHenderson was a relatively small community, but, of course, now it is \nthe second largest city in Nevada. It is a metropolitan area. But when \nReverend Gant first started preaching in Henderson, it was a much \nsmaller community. So I am happy to have him here. He is now part of--\nnot a small church like he has been involved in in other phases of his \nlife but a huge church--a megachurch, it is called, the largest in \nNevada, led by a man by the name of Judd Wilhite.\n  Judd Wilhite is a man who has such a great presence, as we say. The \nfirst time I witnessed his presence was at a funeral service he \nconducted for a police officer who was killed, a U.S. marshal who was \nkilled. There were thousands of people there. When it came time for him \nto talk, he did speak and it was for less than 5 minutes, but he was \nconducting the ceremony and did it in a unique and brilliant and \nspiritual way.\n  I am very happy to have my friend Reverend Gant here. He brings honor \nto Nevada and to all the congregations he has served over many years in \nhis pastoral duties. I am glad to call him my friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/24/senate-section/article/S5381-7", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, this morning I want to take just a few \nminutes and update the Senate on our work here in the Senate. Not only \ndo I want to update our fellow Senators but also our constituents \nwatching around the country about the bill currently before this body.\n  For people around America, for people in the State of New York, the \nState of the Presiding Officer, I have received calls from the Governor \nof New York\n\n[[Page S5382]]\n\non many occasions, and I mean many occasions. We have had long \ndiscussions about how this money that is in this bill is so necessary \nfor the State of New York.\n  Yesterday, I met with Mayor Bloomberg. Mayor Bloomberg was here \ntrying to reach out on a bipartisan basis to get this bill passed. He \ncalled a number of Republican Governors and reported to me as to those \nconversations. Without a single exception, Republican Governors, \nDemocratic Governors--I have not talked personally to any Republican \nGovernors, but, as I indicated, Mayor Bloomberg did--I have talked to \nDemocratic Governors who have called me about how desperate parts of \nthis country are for this money. It is not only the money we refer to \nas FMAP, the money for teachers, the money for police officers, \nfirefighters, but it is all other moneys.\n  The State of New York, I have been told--I say New York because the \nPresiding Officer is here, but this story could be told many times over \nin the Senate Chamber about other States--the State of New York badly \nneeds these summer jobs. It may be the only opportunity these young men \nand women will have to learn how to work. You have to learn how to \nwork.\n  The bill that is before the Senate creates jobs, cuts taxes, and \ncloses corporate loopholes. We are closing many of those loopholes used \nby people who are shipping jobs overseas, in effect, cheating the \ngovernment, according to our constituents.\n  This is really a good bill, a necessary bill, and it would make our \neconomy stronger. It is a bill we are fighting for because the \nrecession has hit Nevada. Unemployment rates there are extremely high. \nI am personally fighting for it because we need to help small \nbusinesses grow and hire and once again be the engine that runs our \ncountry. I am fighting for it because I don't think big business should \nget rewarded for shipping jobs out of America when so many here at home \nare desperate for a paycheck and the dignity of a day's work.\n  I didn't recognize here on the Senate floor the distinguished Senator \nfrom the State of Michigan. No Senator has fought harder for the \nunderprivileged and the unemployed than the Senator from Michigan, Ms. \nStabenow. I appreciate her ability to communicate a message, and the \nmessage we all have to communicate is that this money is going to help \nour States, it will save jobs, and it will create jobs.\n  This is the eighth week since March that we have tried to find a \nresolution for this issue. We have gone back and forth countless times, \nconsidering ideas, compromising when necessary, and courting support. \nBut I have come to the conclusion that the other side does not want a \nsolution. We have changed, we have moved--you want this, we will give \nyou this. Everything in this bill is paid for--everything is paid for \nexcept unemployment compensation. FMAP, the money for firefighters, \npolice officers and teachers and nurses, is paid for. Everything is \npaid for except the long-term unemployed.\n\n  We have tried to bring it to the floor, but the Republicans have said \nno. Once we finally succeeded in bringing it to the floor, we tried to \nbring it to a vote. The Republicans said no. Somewhere along the line \nthroughout these charades, this job-creating, tax-cutting, loophole-\nclosing bill has become a political football, and that is really too \nbad. The debate is focused more on winning and losing than on doing \nwhat is right.\n  I want to take a step back and talk about what is really in the text \nof this legislation. Let's be really clear about all the good things a \n``yes'' vote enables our country to do--this is not what it allows the \nSenate to do; this is what will benefit the country--and what a ``no'' \nvote stops us from doing. Remember, everything is paid for except \nunemployment compensation.\n  This bill has an extension of a tax deduction for tuition.\n  It has an extension of the deduction for State and local sales tax.\n  It has an extension of the standard deduction for property taxes. If \nthis bill does not pass, they are not there.\n  It has an extension of a deduction for cost of classroom supplies \npurchased by teachers. This is not much. It may not seem like much to \nmost people. Teachers under this legislation get a $250 deduction for \nthe supplies they buy. My niece teaches high school. She buys lots of \nstuff because the school district doesn't supply the supplies that are \nneeded. She will get a $250 tax credit. That is not much, but it means \na lot to her, and it means a lot to the millions of teachers around \nthis country. That is in this legislation.\n  We have in this bill a $4 billion extension of Build America Bonds \nthat provide low-cost financing for infrastructure investments. We had \nthat first of all in the economic recovery package, the so-called \nstimulus bill, and that has created hundreds of thousands of jobs all \nover America. We put a few dollars in it in our last jobs package, we \nput some money in. That money is gone now, Build America money. State \nand local governments are begging for these moneys. This $4 billion \nwould create jobs all over America, jobs that are needed for \ninfrastructure development.\n  This legislation has in it an extension of the Small Business \nAdministration lending programs that provide low-cost loans to small \nbusinesses.\n  This legislation includes a $2.5 billion fund for State wage \nassistance programs to move people from welfare to work, the so-called \nTANF Program. This was created during the Clinton years to do something \nabout getting people off welfare and to work. It has been a wonderful \nprogram, but it is out of money. The State of Michigan and the State of \nNew York are desperately in need of this money.\n  This legislation before the Senate extends a research and development \ntax credit and provides more than $6 billion in assistance to firms \nconducting research on new technology.\n  This legislation provides $5 billion in new markets tax credits that \nencourage investments in economically distressed areas.\n  Everything I have talked about is job creating.\n  This legislation has in it something that is so important. We have \nhad a program here that was initiated and continued and was the \nbrainchild of Senator Isakson, from Georgia. It said: The housing \nmarket is very depressed. There are a lot of houses on the market. For \nfirst-time home buyers, why don't we give them an incentive. And we \ndid. We called it a first-time home buyers tax credit. It was $8,000. \nMillions of homes have been purchased on that program. Right now, we \nhave lots of people who have qualified for these first-time home buyer \nloans. They are totally qualified, but the banks and other financial \ninstitutions are moving very slowly. That money will be unavailable \nafter June 30 unless we extend this. We want to extend this for 90 \ndays. It is totally fair. It is totally paid for, again.\n  The legislation we have before us allows retail and restaurant \nbusinesses to write off property investments over 15 years rather than \nover 39 years.\n  This bill provides tax credits to assist mining firms with rescue \nteam training and virtual safety equipment.\n  This bill provides wage assistance so firms can continue to pay \nnormal wages to employees who are members of the military's Reserves \nand are Active Duty.\n  The bill contains incentives to encourage film and television \nproduction in the United States. Most television production now is \ngoing some other place outside the United States.\n  I have only talked about a few of the things in this legislation that \nare so very important. Later today, we will hold a vote on all these \nitems I talked about and more. Those who want to help middle-class \nAmerica will vote yes. Those who want to help business in America will \nvote yes--big business, small business. This is not just for the middle \nclass, it is for helping create jobs in America.\n  Those who want to protect corporate America with not having them do \ntheir fair share should vote no. If they want to continue to allow \nthese jobs to be shipped overseas and have these companies get tax \nbenefits for doing so, then they should vote no. If they want those \nbillionaires in our country--billionaires, these hedge fund operators \nand others who pay less taxes than someone who draws minimum wage--then \nthey should vote no if they want to continue that.\n  Many people I have met who run these hedge funds and are wealthy \npeople have called me and said: You are\n\n[[Page S5383]]\n\ndoing the right thing. There is no reason that we should pay a less \npercentage of our tax than somebody who draws minimum wage.\n  Those who want to create jobs and create the conditions for recovery \nwill vote yes. Those who want to kill jobs, want to stop our recovery \nin its tracks and want to keep things the way they are, will vote no. \nThose who want our economy to prosper and succeed will vote yes. Those \nwho want this Congress and this country to fail will vote no.\n  There are people betting on our country to fail. Maybe that will help \nthem in November. Those who put people first will vote yes. Those who \nput politics first will vote no.\n  The American people are watching and they are waiting for us to act. \nThey demand that their Senators understand what they are going through \nand how they are struggling.\n  I met a man who is back in Washington to attend seminary. He writes \ninsurance for small contractors. One problem. There are no contractors \nto write insurance for. There is no work.\n  The American people are watching and they are waiting for us to act. \nI do my very best to understand. I know what the people of Nevada are \ngoing through. I have heard from the Senator from Michigan what the \npeople of Michigan are going through. I have heard from the Senator \nfrom New York, the Presiding Officer, what the people of New York are \ngoing through.\n  But it is not just Nevada, New York, and Michigan; it is, with very \nfew exceptions, everyplace in America. I know how much good a bill like \nthis would help a family in Nevada, a family in Michigan, a family in \nNew York. We are not Senators from New York, Senators from Michigan, \nSenators from Nevada. We are United States Senators. We have an \nobligation to protect our States, and we do our utmost to do that. But \nwe also have to recognize national problems. That is why we are United \nStates Senators.\n  I do hope other Senators here, for the sake of those in Nevada and \nNew York and Michigan and States all around the country, for the sake \nof those in our States, for the sake of our Nation's economy will vote \nyes. For those who still do not see the value in creating jobs, cutting \ntaxes, and closing corporate loopholes, I hope they will take some time \ntoday to come to the floor and listen to their fellow Senators who \nbelieve in this legislation.\n  I hope they will listen with an open mind and with their \nconstituents' best interests in mind. The time to decide is closing in \non us. But it is not over yet. It is not too late to do what is right.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/24/senate-section/article/S5383-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, last night Senate Democrats \nintroduced their latest version of the deficit extenders bill.\n  It has one thing in common with every other version they have \noffered: it adds new taxes and over $30 billion to an already \nstaggering $13 trillion national debt despite consistent bipartisan \nrejection of that idea.\n  Both sides have offered ways to address the programs in this bill \nthat both sides agree should be extended. And now we even agree on \nredirecting untimely and untargeted money from the failed stimulus \nbill. The only difference is that the Republican proposal reduces the \ndeficit while the Democrat proposal adds to it.\n  So the only thing Democrats are insisting on in this debate is that \nwe add to the debt.\n  The principle they are defending here is not some program. The \nprinciple Democrats are defending is that they will not pass a bill \nunless it adds to the debt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/24/senate-section/article/S5383-3", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5383-S5384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              DISCLOSE ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, as I stand here this morning, House \nDemocrats are desperately trying to round up the votes they need to \npass Congress's latest effort to do what the first amendment \nspecifically says it cannot, namely, to make a law abridging the \nfreedom of speech.\n  The first thing to say about the so-called DISCLOSE Act is that it \nwas authored behind closed doors without even a flicker of sunlight. In \nother words, a bill that is purportedly about bringing transparency to \nthe electoral system was written without any. Just yesterday, a 45-page \namendment was proposed to the bill without any public oversight.\n  The second thing to say about this bill is that it was written by the \nHouse Democrats' campaign committee chairman, who has been out \ntrumpeting it as a ``response'' to the Supreme Court's recent decision \nin Citizens United.\n  As I noted yesterday, Democrats have done this before with free \nspeech rulings they have found to be politically inconvenient. In the \nmid-1990s, they did not like Justice Breyer's decision in Colorado \nRepublicans, so the Clinton administration and Elena Kagan set about \nfinding ways to benefit Democrats at the expense of Republicans. So \npast is prologue.\n  This bill is not about preserving any principle of transparency. It \nis about protecting incumbent Democrat politicians. As for the \nsubstance, a brief review of the bill itself shows that the DISCLOSE \nAct is about as ill-named as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act \nof 2009 and ensures as much freedom as the poorly named Employee Free \nChoice Act. But, of course, House Democrats have said they do not care \nwhat they pass. They just want to pass something. Now that is quite the \nway to legislate.\n  Supporters of the bill say it is needed to deal with special \ninterests. But the loopholes Democrats wrote into it show that they \nview some interests as more special than others. Take for example the \nspate of new speech prohibitions that did not exist prior to the \nCitizens United decision.\n  That is right, this bill goes far beyond what the court held to \nmuzzle the speech of some while granting a pass for others.\n  Expansive new restrictions on government contractors and TARP \nrecipients, but not their unions or government unions.\n  Expansive new speech restrictions on domestic subsidiaries which \nemploy Americans who pay American taxes, without restricting unions at \nthese same companies or international unions.\n  And that is just in the first few pages. Over the next few weeks I \nwill highlight more of these ``winners and losers'' provisions \nDemocrats are advocating in this bill.\n  If there were any doubt that this one-sided bill is not about \nprinciple but about changing the rules to the political game, just look \nat the special treatment House Democrats have been shopping around for \nweeks in an effort to sell this bill. They have engaged in a game of \nspecial interest carve outs which is the legislative equivalent of a \ngame of Twister.\n  For example, in drafting a bill that House Democrats say is designed \nto deal with special interests, they have deliberately exempted what \nthey have long called one of the biggest special interests of all: the \nNational Rifle Association.\n  So in writing a bill that is supposedly about diminishing the \ninfluence of special interests, Democrat leaders cut a deal to allow a \nchosen few to operate unfettered by its restrictions, thereby enhancing \nthe power of those chosen few. Apparently they did not learn their \nlesson from the reaction they got to the Cornhusker Kickback or the \nLouisiana Purchase.\n  What is transpiring in the House right now with this bill turns the \nfirst amendment on its head. Incumbent politicians are intentionally \nprotecting some large groups so they can muster the votes to restrict \nmany more citizens groups that have less political clout but whose \nparticipation in the political process the incumbent politicians find \ninconvenient.\n  Let me be clear. I support the second amendment, and I support the \nNRA's vigorous exercise of its first amendment rights in order to \ndefend the second amendment rights of its members. But this is not \nabout the Democrats' affinity for the second amendment. If it were, \nthey would have carved out an exception for the Gun Owners of America \nas well. As it is, the GOA vehemently opposes this bill. Why? Because \nthey know it restricts first amendment rights.\n\n[[Page S5384]]\n\n  This bill is opposed by over 350 groups ranging from the Sierra Club \nand the ACLU, to the Chamber, the NFIB, and National Right to Life.\n  That is right, Democrats have done a unique thing here: they have \nunited the left and the right in opposition to the effort to take away \npolitical speech from some and enhance it for others. These \norganizations, standing on firm first amendment principles, have been \nvigorously opposing this effort to stifle their speech.\n  And I stand with them in asking each and every one of my colleagues \nto join me in honoring the oath we took to protect and uphold the \nConstitution of the United States of America, and, in particular, the \nfirst amendment to free speech.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW.

Madam President, with all due respect to our Republican \nleader, I have to express concern on a couple of points. He was just \ntalking about court decisions, a court decision that said BP is a \nperson; that said all big corporations have the same rights as \nindividuals. What we are trying to do, both in the House and the \nSenate, is to make sure that, in fact, the democratic process can work \nand that huge corporate interests that have controlled too much of this \ncountry are not allowed to do even more in terms of overriding \nelections and putting money into elections.\n  I also have to disagree with our distinguished Republican colleague \nwhen he says this is all about the deficit. As we would say in \nMichigan, that is a bunch of bunk. This is about who we care about and \nhow we think we should move forward as a country in terms of what is \nbest for the majority of the American people. Very different views. \nVery different beliefs.\n  Our Republican colleagues have believed if we give tax breaks to the \nwealthiest Americans and wait for it to trickle down, things will get \nbetter. If we back up and let corporations police themselves, \neverything will be OK.\n  Well, we saw that for 8 years, 6 years of which they had control of \nthe whole system. I tell you what, it did not trickle down to the \npeople in Michigan. After the Wall Street collapse and what we saw with \nBP in the gulf and what we have seen with miners' loss of life, I would \nsuggest that view, that belief, has not worked for the majority of \npeople.\n  So we have a different view. We have a different view. It is one that \nactually worked in the 1990s under President Clinton when 22 million \njobs were created. Yes, we believe this is about jobs. This is about \nhow we get out of deficit.\n  I also find it amazing that the people who dug the hole, the deepest \nhole we have ever had in the history of the country, when they were \nhanded a surplus--they dug the hole--now want us to give the shovels \nback. They want more shovels to dig even deeper.\n  So this is a difference of opinion on how we believe we should move \nthe country forward and who we are trying to move it for--not the large \ncorporate interests that the Republican leader just talked about who \nwant to be able to give millions of dollars for elections and have no \nrules and regulations and be able to control the democratic process of \nelections in this country.\n  It is not about the folks who are concerned about paying their fair \nshare in this jobs bill, with the tax loopholes we want to close so \nthey cannot take jobs overseas and requiring people to pay their fair \nshare. That is not what we are about. What we are about is creating \njobs for the American people. The bill in front of us, the bill we are \ngoing to have a chance to vote on one more time, is all about jobs and \nwho we are fighting for. That is what it is about. It is about whether \nwe believe we should only invest in what the wealthy and powerful of \nthis country care about or should we invest in the majority of \nAmericans and create good-paying, middle-class jobs.\n  It really is a philosophy right now about how we get out of debt. \nThey say more tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans. We will have an \nestate tax fight where they say: Oh, we ought to be more and more for \nthe top few hundred families, billionaires in the country. Give them \nmore tax relief.\n  We say, in this bill, what we ought to be doing is focusing on \ncreating jobs to grow out of debt. We are all opposed to debt. I was \nopposed to the debt when I voted to balance the budget. I was opposed \nto debt when they got us into debt in the last 8 years, 10 years, when \nthey were focusing on racking up debt. I was opposed then.\n  Now the question is, How do we get out of debt? We say we have to \ncreate jobs, and we have to help the people who are out of work be able \nto get some help to be able to get some training to be able to keep a \nroof over their heads and food on their tables while they look for a \njob.\n  That is what we believe. That is what this is about. We believe we \nwill never get out of deficit with over 15 million out of work, having \nto ask for temporary assistance. We will never get out of debt unless \nwe are creating jobs. We have begun to do that. Our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle say: We want to stop that.\n  Let's look at what happened. I talk about the previous administration \nnot only to focus on the past, but these are the same ideas that are on \nthe floor today. They are promoting the ideas that got us into these \njob losses. When President Obama came into office, we were losing about \n750,000 jobs a month. That is what he inherited. We said: This hasn't \nbeen working for the majority of people. It didn't work for the \nmajority of people in Michigan. We want to go back to investing in \npeople and communities, helping businesses get the capital to grow, \nsupporting small businesses, focusing on manufacturing, making things \nin this country. Let's take away the incentives to take jobs overseas. \nWe are in a global economy, but we want to export our products, not our \njobs.\n  This bill takes away incentives to go offshore, overseas, keeps the \njobs here. It creates more capital for manufacturers. I was pleased to \ncraft a provision that will create the ability to buy more equipment \nand facilities to create jobs. It helps small businesses keep jobs. \nThat is what we believe. We have put in place the Recovery Act. We have \nbegun to climb out. We are not out. But these guys are going: Stop. Oh, \nmy gosh, it is beginning to work. This may affect the elections. Let's \ndo everything we can to stop the recovery. Let's take the resources \nthat have been used to invest in a battery manufacturing plant, private \nsector, in Midland, MI, where I attended a groundbreaking on Monday, \nDow Kokam. Let's take that money away now. We will say: We have too big \ndeficits. We can't invest in jobs. We can't invest in jobs.\n  They want to take that away and come over and say: We will take the \nmoney that is creating jobs and we will give it to people who don't \nhave a job.\n  Wait a minute. So you want to use the Recovery Act money that is \nbeginning to create jobs and put it over here to help people who don't \nhave a job, and then we will create more people who don't have jobs?\n  We say that is a bunch of hooey, that is a bunch of bunk. In \nMichigan, we have stronger words for that, but I won't say them on the \nSenate floor. My people in Michigan are sick and tired of this.\n  It is pretty bad when we have one side in this Chamber rooting for \nfailure\n\n[[Page S5385]]\n\nevery day. I have people in my State, Republicans who are out of work, \nsmall businesses that are Republican. They don't have capital, \nmanufacturers that are Republicans who want us to pass legislation to \ngive them more capital. This is not a partisan issue. This is about \nwhose side we are on in this country. It is about whether we embrace a \nphilosophy that will work for the majority of Americans or work for \nonly a few. That is what this is about.\n  What we have from the other side is a litany of no, no, no. We will \nbe yes, if you take away the money for the recovery, which they all \nvoted against--most, excuse me, not all but most--we will take away \nthose dollars because that will slow us down, that will make sure this \nPresident is not successful. God help us if this President is \nsuccessful and this majority is successful. Let's keep people hurting \nas long as possible, because maybe that will help us pick up some \nseats.\n  No wonder people are angry. No wonder people are cynical. I am pretty \nangry myself.\n  There are real people's lives at stake in all of this. All we get is \nno, no, no--cynical, political games on the other side. Even though \nthings are moving up slowly but surely--way too slow from my \nperspective but, thank God, they are not continuing to go down, it is \nbeginning to work. Instead of letting it work--and it certainly is not \neverything we want, but it is beginning, it is turning--instead, they \nwant to stop it. The election is coming up. Let's make sure people are \nas mad as possible, and then we will blame the people who were in the \nmajority, even though we are stopping them every day. We are stopping \nthem from doing things. We filibuster. The cynical view is that the \npublic won't understand that so we will keep making sure that nothing \nhappens so people are hurting. That is what is happening here.\n  Let's talk about unemployment benefits and the fact that we do have \npeople hurting. We do, in fact, have 3 million jobs available and 15 \nmillion people looking for work. Some say: Those folks are just lazy. \nGo get a job. I would like to show them the real world and what is \nhappening for too many families. The numbers are changing. When I first \nstarted coming to the floor, we were talking about six people out of \nwork for every one job opening. Now it is five. I don't celebrate that \nbecause I want to make it one for one. It is getting better. It is \ncreeping around. It is turning around. It is turning around because the \nRecovery Act incentivized people to buy a new home which, in this bill, \nwe want to extend for people, to get as many people who have benefited \nfrom that $8,000 tax credit as possible, or the $6,500. But our \ncolleagues on the other side say no.\n  Realtors tell me in Michigan things are turning around because of \nsupport from the Recovery Act. The stimulus has helped begin to turn \nthings. But, oh, my gosh, no, we cannot possibly continue to support \nsomething that is actually working, because it might have bad political \neffects. People might not be hurting as much or as mad, and that may \nnot help us in the election.\n  We have today people who are looking for work, have been looking for \nwork for months, some longer than a year--in some cases, 2 years. \nPeople did what we told them to do. They went back to school. They are \nliving off of unemployment for their family while they are going to \nschool. They are trying to do everything they can. These are people who \nhave done nothing but work hard and take care of their families and \nlove this country. They assume, just as in every other economic \ndownturn in the country, that we will understand, we will get it. The \nCongress will get it and support them to turn their lives around \nwithout losing their homes and the ability to care for their families.\n  I want to read a few letters from people in Michigan. We have \nthousands of e-mails and letters. It breaks our heart. People cannot \nbelieve what in the world is going on around here that we are not doing \neverything conceivable to create jobs. These artificial debates about \ndeficits--again, it is a very big issue, these deficits, but it is \npretty hard for us to be lectured by the people who created the \ndeficits who are now saying: We can't help people caught in this \neconomic recession because of deficits. It is pretty hard to accept \ntheir view, the way they would get us out, which didn't get us out, \nwhich created more deficit, that somehow we should go back to that \nrather than what has worked in the past which is putting people to \nwork, having people work so they can pay into the system and contribute \nand buy things. They become part of the economy. Then deficits begin to \ngo away. We begin to come out of the hole. That is what we believe, \nfocusing on people.\n  Kim from Flint says:\n\n       I am writing today to beseech you to urge Congress to act \n     quickly to extend federal unemployment benefits. In this \n     unprecedented economy, especially where I live in Michigan, \n     extra time is much needed to find employment. Many of my \n     family, friends and neighbors are in the same situation I am. \n     I personally was laid off from what I thought was a stable \n     position back in July and despite having experience and a \n     BBA, I have not been able to find comparable work. Our no \n     worker left behind program in Michigan is out of funding. My \n     college career services department has not been helpful. \n     While I'm trying to keep hope in pursuing job leads and even \n     looking at going back to school for an entirely different \n     field, I fear what will happen to me if these benefits are \n     not extended. I will lose everything. I am indeed writing \n     from my own self-interest but not only for my own interests. \n     With so many people in the same situation as I am, what will \n     happen to them? Will you have a large segment of your \n     constituent population suffer so, or will you have the \n     economic situation in Michigan worsen as many become unable \n     to even provide the bare necessities for themselves and \n     their families? Or will you act quickly to extend much \n     needed unemployment benefits?\n\n  Kim, we are trying to act as quickly as we can. We have been trying \nto. I know it is no consolation. It feels so frustrating and empty to \ntalk about differences between Republicans and Democrats when people \nare hurting. But the reality is, we don't have one Republican right now \nwilling to step forward, as one, and stop this filibuster that has been \ngoing on for weeks. We have been dealing with this now every time we \nbring up the extension. We don't have one colleague, people with whom \nwe work in good faith on so many different issues, not one has been \nwilling up to this point to step up and join us based on the larger \ngood, not the political pressure, not the partisanship but the larger \ngood of making sure somebody who is out of work knows that they have at \nleast the bare minimum so they can continue and not lose a house and be \nhomeless on top of job loss and then try to figure out what to do to \ntake care of the kids. We don't have one colleague who has been willing \nto do that, to step up and have the courage to join us in stopping this \nincredibly irresponsible filibuster that has been going on.\n  We will have an opportunity later today. We fully expect the same \nresult, unfortunately. The politics of the moment seem to be \noverwhelming. It is amazing to me. But I guess if it works, people will \nkeep doing it. That is the question, whether it will work with the \nAmerican people. With all of the mumbo-jumbo going on, numbers and so \non, the bottom line in the world in which I live and the world in which \nmy family lives in Michigan and the people I represent is a world that \nis very different from here. We in Michigan, Democrats and Republicans, \nare rooting for success as Americans. We want things to get better. We \nwant our country to be safe. We want it to get better for everybody. We \nwill go on, have another day to fight about differences, ideological \ndifferences on issues. But we are at least rooting for the country to \nsucceed, for the President, for the government to be working together \nto do the right thing so we can get out of this hole.\n  When we look at what is happening around the world, when we look at \nthe brink of disaster last year when President Obama came in and we \nwere on the edge of the cliff--some would say over the cliff--holding \non with our fingers, losing 750,000 jobs a month, we began to walk it \nback through some very bold things that had to be done at the time, \nsuch as investing in people and jobs.\n  In the previous administration, when they stepped up and did what was \ncalled the Wall Street bailout, a lot of folks in Michigan said: What \nabout us? Who is going to bail out us working people? Well, the \nRecovery Act, in my judgment, was that. It was the people's bail out. \nIt was focusing on people, jobs, and job training, and helping those \nwho are temporarily out of work while they get their lives together and \nfind another job, and investing in the future.\n\n[[Page S5386]]\n\n  That is what that was about. And that is what it is still about. It \nis a 2-year effort, and it is beginning to work. We can go back and \nlook at the numbers again. We are certainly not where we want to be, \nbut it is turning around. We are coming out of the hole. Step by step, \nwe are coming out of the hole. Now the folks who created the hole say: \nOh, give us more shovels so we can dig some more. We are saying: No, \nlet's keep it going. Let's give it a try. We can tinker with it. We can \nchange some things that we need to, but let's keep it going, let's give \nit a try here so we can keep this thing moving in the right direction. \nThese folks are saying no. In order to do the bill in front of us on \njobs, we want to take money away from jobs, slow this down in order to \nbe able to ``pay'' for the bill in front of us.\n  Well, what is in front of us? We have a bill today that provides tax \ncuts to businesses, tax relief to State and local governments to help \nthem invest and create jobs. The other side of the aisle has said no.\n  We have a bill in front of us to provide tax cuts that are going to \nput dollars back into the pockets of working families trying to make \nit. The other side has said no.\n  We have a bill that is going to help restore credit to small \nbusinesses. It is the one thing I hear over and over, and I want to \nthank our leader for keeping small businesses at the forefront, and we \nare working on additional legislation to help small businesses. We have \nto free up capital. Too many cannot get their line of credit or get the \nloan they need to operate or to be able to expand. That is certainly \ntrue in Michigan. But this bill has provisions to help small businesses \nexpand, hire new workers. The other side has said no.\n  It would expand career training so the people we want to be able to \nget off unemployment benefits and to be able to get into jobs will have \nan opportunity to focus on new careers. This bill includes provisions \nto help people get career training to get new jobs. The other side has \nsaid no.\n  It would extend help for people who are out of work right now, people \nwho have had the dignity of working their whole lives, breadwinners who \nare no longer bringing home the bread. It would help them keep a roof \nover their head and food on the table and maybe a little gas in the car \nso they can go look for a job while they are moving through this \ndifficult time and while we are focusing on job creation. The other \nside has said no.\n  This bill would ensure that senior citizens, military servicemembers, \nand Americans with disabilities would continue to have access to their \ndoctors. We did get agreement to pull out that one provision to be able \nto extend it for 6 months, which I hope will get done very quickly. But \nthe rest of this, frankly, is being held up, in my judgment, because--\neven though it is all paid for. None of this I have just talked about--\nother than unemployment benefits, which are always funded differently \nas an emergency because it is an emergency--the rest of this is \nentirely paid for, does not add a penny to the deficit. But I do think \nit then brings up the question: Why would they be objecting?\n  Well, we are paying for jobs and job training by closing some tax \nloopholes. You will no longer get tax benefits if you take the jobs \noverseas. We want the jobs in America. We want to stop that. The other \nside says no.\n  We want to make sure people who are very wealthy but whose income \ncomes in in a different way are paying their fair share, contributing \njust like middle-class people, low-income people. We close some \nloopholes to pay for this. They say no.\n  We also have in this bill a provision that would increase the \ndollars, by pennies--49 cents--on every barrel of oil to be able to \nclean up the spill in the gulf, to be able to add money to the Oil \nSpill Liability Trust Fund. In the past, oil companies only had to kick \nin 8 cents a barrel. Well, given what has happened in the gulf, that is \nnot enough. So we have said 49 cents for every barrel. A barrel of \noil--I do not know the price now but $70, $80 a barrel, whatever it is: \n49 cents.\n  The oil companies probably do not like that. So the other side said \nno. In fact, the day the distinguished Republican Congressman in \ncommittee was apologizing to BP on the House side--that same day--\nRepublican colleagues here were doing the bidding of the oil companies \nby voting ``no'' on increasing their contributions by 41 cents a barrel \ninto the liability trust fund to clean up the oilspills.\n  I think it is pretty clear whose side we are on, whose side they are \non, what is happening right now. We have a stalemate going on. We have \ntried and tried, and our leader and the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, who has worked and worked and worked and worked, as he \nalways does, in good faith to find some compromise, to be able to move \nthis jobs bill forward and help people who are out of work. It appears \nright now we do not have one Republican colleague willing to join us in \nthat effort. There have been discussions, but there has been no \nagreement.\n  So we have the votes. That is the darnedest thing about this place. \nWe have the votes. We just cannot stop a filibuster. Somehow in our \ndemocracy, with men and women fighting around the world for our \ndemocratic process of majority rule--when you win an election, you have \nto get one more than the other guy, one more vote than the other guy to \nwin the election. And here, instead of having majority rule, they are \nusing the political processes and tricks in a way so as to tie us up in \na pretzel like I have never seen before, unprecedented, using rules in \na way that is absolutely unprecedented so that the public shakes their \nhead and says: What is going on here? What are these people doing?\n  But they are doing this in a way so that instead of majority rule, \nyou have to get a supermajority. That is what we are talking about: \nTrying to get 60 votes, not 51, which is majority rule in every town \nand city and State and every Federal election; you have to get one more \nthan the other guy. But because of a gross misuse of the rules in the \nlast year and a half, we have to now get 60 for everything. And we \ncannot--up to this point--get even one Republican colleague to join us. \nSo that is where we are.\n  I would ask, Madam President, how much time is remaining on the \nmajority side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. One minute forty-five seconds.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I am sorry?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. One minute forty-five seconds.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you.\n  Let me indicate again, there is a huge difference in view as to how \nto get us out of the deficit hole. One side, with a set of policies--I \nam sure they were sincere--a set of policies that said: We will give it \nto the wealthiest Americans--tax cuts--and then it will trickle down, \ncoupled with 8 years of not paying for things--two wars and a whole \nseries of other things--created red lines down, job loss, so that \nPresident Obama came in at losing about 750,000 jobs a month.\n  We have tried a different view. We have said the only way to get out \nof deficit is to focus on jobs, putting money in the pocket of middle-\nclass families, and growing our way out by focusing on the middle \nclass, working people, the majority of people, small businesses, with \nmanufacturers making things again in this country.\n  We both care about deficits. We have different views about how we got \nto those deficits, and certainly different views about how to get out \nof deficit. What we will not support is taking money away from efforts \nthat have begun to get us on a road to recovery. We have a long way to \ngo, but it has begun to get us out of the ditch. We no longer \nare losing 750,000 jobs every month. We are now gaining jobs. It is not \nas even as we would like, but we are gaining jobs. The question is, do \nwe allow this to continue, while helping people who are out of work \nright now, and grow our way out of this deficit by creating jobs, or do \nwe go back to the old philosophy, the old beliefs that got us into the \nhole in the first place?\n\n  That is the basic debate on the floor of the Senate. That is the \ndebate. We have one view that worked in the 1990s, creating 22 million \njobs over the course of 8 years in the Clinton Presidency, and one view \nthat has lost us jobs. Now we are back again to that philosophy to \ncreate jobs, and that is what this is about.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. STABENOW. Thank you, Madam President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n\n[[Page S5387]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/24/senate-section/article/S5387-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5387-S5388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF ELENA KAGAN\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, next week the Judiciary Committee will \nhold its hearing on the nomination of Elena Kagan to replace Supreme \nCourt Justice John Paul Stevens. The Senate's role of advice and \nconsent, especially for Supreme Court Justices, is one of our most \nimportant constitutional duties. I wish to share a few thoughts about \nhow I will approach this task.\n  America's Founders designed the judiciary to be, as Alexander \nHamilton described it, the weakest and least dangerous branch of \ngovernment. Things have not worked out as planned. The judiciary today \nis, instead, the most powerful, and potentially the most dangerous, \nbranch of our government. Rather than being accountable to the people \nby being subject to the people's Constitution, activist judges often \nmake the people accountable to them by seeking to control the people's \nConstitution. My objective in this confirmation process is to find out \nwhich kind of Justice Ms. Kagan would be if confirmed to the Supreme \nCourt.\n  Judicial qualifications fall into two categories: legal experience \nand judicial philosophy. Legal experience is a summary of what a \nnominee has done in the past and can be described in a resume or on a \nquestionnaire. Judicial philosophy describes how a nominee will \napproach the task of judging in the future. It is harder to determine, \nbut I believe it is much more important.\n  Let me first look at Ms. Kagan's legal experience. I have never \nbelieved that judicial experience is necessary for Supreme Court \nservice or, to put it another way, I have never believed it to be a \ndisqualification if you do not have judicial experience. In fact, 39 \nSupreme Court Justices--about one-third--had no previous judicial \nexperience. What they did have, however, was extensive experience in \nthe actual practice of law, an average of more than 20 years. These are \nJustices such as George Sutherland, one of my predecessors as Senator \nfrom Utah, who practiced for 23 years, or Robert Jackson, who practiced \nfor 21 years and served as both Solicitor General and Attorney General. \nIn other words, Supreme Court Justices have had experience behind the \nbench as a judge, before the bench as a lawyer, or both.\n  Ms. Kagan has neither. She spent only 2 years as a new associate in a \nlarge law firm. She never litigated a case or argued before any \nappellate court before becoming Solicitor General last year.\n   And her work in the Clinton administration was focused on policy and \nlegistation. As the Washington Post described it recently, Ms. Kagan \nwould bring to the Court experience ``in the political circus that \noften defines Washington.'' Some people may see little difference \nbetween the legal and the political, but I do and am concerned about \nblurring the lines even further.\n  Last week, one of my Democratic colleagues with whom I serve on the \nJudiciary Committee talked about Ms. Kagan's qualifications and claimed \nthat some Senators question her fitness for the Supreme Court solely \nbecause she has never been a judge. No one has made that argument. This \nDemocratic colleague identified Justices Byron White, William \nRehnquist, Louis Brandeis, and Lewis Powell as among those with no \nprior judicial experience. These Justices had practiced, respectively, \nfor 14, 16, 37, and 39 years and Justice Powell had also been president \nof the American Bar Association. There really is no comparison.\n  So on this first element of legal experience, we have to be honest \nabout what the record shows. Unlike other Supreme Court nominees, Ms. \nKagan has no judicial experience and virtually no legal practice \nexperience. That leaves her academic and political experience. The \nDemocratic Senator I mentioned identified as among Ms. Kagan's \nstrongest qualifications for the Supreme Court her experience crafting \npolicy and her ability to build consensus. Judges, however, are not \nsupposed to be crafting policy, and consensus-building only begs the \nquestion of what a consensus is being built to support.\n  This relatively light record of legal experience only places more \nimportance on judicial philosophy, the other qualification for judicial \nservice. Frankly, finding reliable clues about judicial philosophy is \noften harder in an academic and political record such as Ms. Kagan's \nthan in a judicial record. This is especially true when, like Ms. \nKagan, a nominee has rarely written directly about the topic. This does \nnot mean that reliable clues do not exist, just that they are harder to \nfind. I have to take Ms. Kagan's record as it is because I have to base \nmy decision on evidence, not blind faith.\n  Judicial philosophy refers to the process of interpreting and \napplying the law to decide cases. That is what judges do, but they can \ndo it in radically different ways. Notice I said this is about the \nprocess of deciding cases, not the results of those cases. Many people, \nincluding some of my Senate colleagues and many in the media, focus \nonly on the results that judges reach, apparently believing that the \npolitical ends justify the judicial means.\n  That is the wrong standard for evaluating either judicial decisions \nor judicial nominees. Politics can focus on the results, but the law \nmust focus on the process of reaching those results. Rather than the \ndesirable ends justifying the means, the proper means must legitimate \nthe ends. It makes no difference which side wins, which political \ninterest comes out on top, or whether the result can be labeled liberal \nor conservative. If the judge correctly interprets and applies the law \nin a particular case, then the result is correct.\n  So I wish to pin down, as best I can, what kind of Justice Ms. Kagan \nwould be. Will the Constitution control her or will she try to control \nthe Constitution? Will she care more about the judicial process or the \npolitical results? As I said, those clues come primarily from her \nrecord, secondarily from next week's hearing. So let me briefly focus \non a few areas of Ms. Kagan's record and mention some questions that \nneed to be answered and some concerns that need to be addressed.\n  First, while in graduate school, Ms. Kagan wrote that the Supreme \nCourt may overturn previous decisions ``on the ground that new times \nand circumstances demand a different interpretation of the \nConstitution.'' Not a different application, mind you, but a different \ninterpretation. She wrote quite candidly that it is ``not necessarily \nwrong or invalid'' for judges to ``mold and steer the law in order to \npromote certain ethical values and achieve certain social ends.''\n  In a 1995 law journal article, she agreed that in most cases that \ncome before the Supreme Court, the judge's own experience and values \nbecome the most important element in the decision. In her words, ``many \nof the votes a Supreme Court Justice casts have little to do with \ntechnical legal ability and much to do with conceptions of value.'' \nThat sounds a lot like President Obama, who said as a Senator that \njudges decide cases based on their own deepest values, core concerns, \nthe depth and breadth of their empathy, and what is in their heart. If \nthat is too results oriented, Ms. Kagan wrote, so be it.\n  While Ms. Kagan has not herself been a judge, those judges she has \nsingled out for particular praise have this same activist judicial \nphilosophy. In a tribute she wrote for her mentor Justice Thurgood \nMarshall, for example, she described his judicial philosophy as driven \nby the belief that the role of the courts and the very purpose of \nconstitutional interpretation is to ``safeguard the interests of people \nwho had no other champion. The Court existed primarily to fulfill this \nmission. . . . And however much some recent Justices have sniped at \nthat vision, it remains a thing of glory.''\n  In 2006, when she was dean of Harvard Law School, Ms. Kagan praised \nas her judicial hero Aharon Barak, who served on the Supreme Court of \nIsrael for nearly 30 years. She called him ``the judge or justice in my \nlifetime whom I think best represents and has best advanced the values \nof democracy and human rights, of the rule of law, and of justice.'' \nThat is not simply high praise, but the highest praise possible, for \nshe said that Justice Barak was literally the very best judge anywhere \nduring her entire lifetime in representing and advancing the rule of \nlaw.\n  Who is this judge who, for Ms. Kagan at least, is literally the best \nrepresentation of the rule of law? Judge Richard Posner has described \nJustice Barak as ``one of the most prominent of the\n\n[[Page S5388]]\n\naggressively interventionist foreign judges'' who ``without a secure \nconstitutional basis. . .created a degree of judicial power undreamt of \nby our most aggressive Supreme Court justices.'' Judge Posner concluded \nthat to Justice Barak, ``the judiciary is a law unto itself.''\n  These and other examples, over a period of more than two decades, fit \nconsistently together. They indicate that for most of her career, Ms. \nKagan has endorsed, and has praised others who endorse, an activist \njudicial philosophy. She appears to have accepted that judges may base \ntheir decisions on their own sense of fairness or justice, their own \nvalues of what is good and right, their own vision of the way society \nought to be. This activist philosophy, she has said, is a thing of \nglory and best represents the rule of law. That is what her record \nshows, and we will have to see what next week's hearing uncovers on \nthis important subject.\n  There are also some specific subjects or controversies that must be \nexplored. These might have been less important if Ms. Kagan did not \nhave the record I just described. If she had not endorsed and praised \njudges making decisions based on their personal values and objectives, \nthen evidence of her own personal values or objectives would obviously \nbe less relevant. But as Ms. Kagan said in a 2004 interview, since a \njudge's personal attitudes and views make a difference in how they \nreach their decisions, ``the Senate is right to take an interest in who \nthese people are and what they believe.''\n\n  I wish to note two of the areas in which it appears Ms. Kagan's \npersonal or political views have driven her legal views. The first is \nabortion. When she clerked for Justice Marshall, she recommended \nagainst the Court reviewing the decision in a case titled Lanzaro v. \nMonmouth County Correctional Institutional Inmates. The U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Third Circuit held that prison inmates have a right to \nelective abortions and that by refusing to pay for them, the county \nviolated the Constitution's eighth amendment ban on cruel and unusual \npunishment. Ms. Kagan properly rejected this bizarre holding, even \ncalling parts of the analysis ludicrous. Yet she urged against the \nCourt reviewing this decision because, as she put it, ``this case is \nlikely to become the vehicle that this court uses to create some very \nbad law on abortion and/or prisoners' rights.'' Broader policy \nobjectives seemed more important than even reviewing a ludicrous \nconstitutional decision.\n  The record also shows that later Ms. Kagan was a key player behind \nthe Clinton administration's extreme abortion policy. In May 1997, \nafter President Clinton had vetoed the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act, \nMs. Kagan wrote a memo recommending that he support the substitutes for \nthe ban being offered by Senators Daschle and Feinstein. She \nrecommended this solely for political reasons, because it might attract \nsome votes from Senators who would otherwise vote to override his veto. \nHad that strategy worked, of course, the substitutes would not have \npassed and partial birth abortion would have remained legal. The \nbarbaric practice of partial-birth abortion would have remained legal.\n  Significantly, however, Ms. Kagan noted that the Office of Legal \nCounsel had concluded that these substitute amendments were \nunconstitutional under the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision. There \nis no indication that she disagreed with this conclusion. The point is \nthat Ms. Kagan urged a purely political position on abortion that was \nat odds with what the Clinton administration then believed the \nConstitution required. Once again, it looks as though politics trumped \nthe law.\n  Another controversy involved the military's ability to recruit at \nHarvard Law School during Ms. Kagan's tenure as dean. Ms. Kagan made \nher personal views and values as plain as anyone could make them, \nsaying repeatedly that she abhorred the military's policy with regard \nto homosexuals and calling it a profound wrong and a ``moral injustice \nof the first order.'' Federal law, known as the Solomon amendment, \ndenies Federal funds to schools with policies or practices that have \nthe effect of preventing military recruiters the same access to campus \nor to students that other employers have. A group called the Forum for \nAcademic and Institutional Rights, or FAIR, challenged the law in \ncourt.\n  Ms. Kagan first joined a legal brief filed in support of FAIR's \nchallenge with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Within \n24 hours of the court enjoining enforcement of the Solomon amendment, \nMs. Kagan again banned military recruiters from access to Harvard's \nOffice of Career Services. She was not required to do this because the \nThird Circuit does not include Massachusetts. She kept the ban in place \neven after the Third Circuit stayed its own injunction while it was \nbeing appealed to the Supreme Court. In other words, Ms. Kagan denied \nmilitary recruiters access even though the law still required access. \nShe could have opposed the military's policy in various ways, but chose \nto do so in a way that undermined military recruitment during wartime. \nAnd the recruitment ban was lifted only after the president of Harvard \nUniversity stepped in and overrode Ms. Kagan's decision.\n  Ms. Kagan then joined a group of law professors filing a brief with \nthe Supreme Court. To its credit, FAIR actually agreed with the \ngovernment about the proper reading of the Solomon amendment. But Ms. \nKagan and her fellow professors urged the courts to read the statute in \nan artificial and unnatural way that actually contradicted both the \nplain terms of the statute and the position of the very party on whose \nbehalf she had filed her brief. The statute required that the military \nbe treated the same as employers who are granted access to campus. Ms. \nKagan argued instead that the military be treated the same as employers \nwho are denied access to campus. Not surprisingly, the Supreme Court \nunanimously rejected Ms. Kagan's position, saying that her group of law \nprofessors simply misinterpreted the statute in a way that would \nliterally negate it and make it ``a largely meaningless exercise.'' She \ndid everything she could, including defying Federal law and making \nlegal arguments that even Justice Stevens could not accept, to pursue \nher political objective.\n  In closing, I wanted to come to the floor today to describe for my \ncolleagues the approach I am taking to evaluate Ms. Kagan's nomination \nto the Supreme Court. The most important qualification for the position \nis her judicial philosophy, the kind of Justice she will be. The \nevidence for her judicial philosophy comes primarily from her record, \nand I have touched on some areas of concern that must be examined more \nclosely.\n  This is a grave decision. It is about more than simply one person. \nThe liberty we enjoy in America requires that the people govern \nthemselves and that, in turn, depends upon the kind of Justices who sit \non the highest court in the land. George Washington said this in his \nfarewell address: ``The basis of our political systems is the right of \nthe people to make and alter their constitutions of government. But the \nConstitution which at any time exists, till changed by an explicit and \nauthentic act of the whole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all.'' \nJudges who bend the Constitution to their own values and who use the \nConstitution to pursue their own vision for society take this right \naway from the people and undermine liberty itself.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/24/senate-section/article/S5388-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5388-S5390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, last week the media reported that 17 \nAfghan military trainees had gone AWOL--absent without leave--from the \nDefense Language Institute at Lackland Air Force base in San Antonio, \nTX. The shocking thing about this is not that 17 Afghan trainees left \nthe military base without leave, but that we hadn't heard anything \nabout it. Even though these officers went missing over a period of 2 \nyears, neither the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Air Force, \nnor the Department of Defense notified me. No one advised the Congress \nor the American people, to my knowledge, that this had happened. \nObviously, it created a lot of consternation and concern.\n\n[[Page S5389]]\n\n  The fact is, this is just one example--really the tip of the \niceberg--of some of the problems with our broken immigration system--\nour inability to track individuals who come into the United States with \nvisas, whether it is a tourist visa, a student visa, or a visa like \nthose issued to the Afghan military officers. We have virtually no \nability to track individuals who overstay their visa and then simply \nchoose to melt into the great American landscape.\n  This is true in spite of the fact that in 2007, Congress passed on a \nrecommendation of the 9/11 Commission, which highlighted visa overstays \nas a potential national security threat to our country. All we have to \ndo is recall people like Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993 World \nTrade Center bombings, an example of people who came into the country \nand overstayed their visa. The recent attempt of a would-be terrorist \nto bomb a skyscraper in Dallas, TX, is another example of people who \nenter the country legally and do so with the clear intent to overstay \ntheir visa and do us harm.\n  Congress passed a law in 2007 that required the Department of \nHomeland Security to come up with a plan by June 2009 to track every \nentry into the country pursuant to a visa and biometrically track those \nindividuals who overstay their visas. Obviously, that has not happened \nyet or else the Department of Homeland Security would have been able to \ntrack the 17 Afghan military officers. As far as we have been informed, \nwe don't have clear information as to exactly where all of these \nindividuals are.\n  We have talked a lot about border security, and appropriately so, \nparticularly in light of the exploding violence in Mexico and the \ncartel drug wars that have killed 23,000 people since 2006. Many have \nexpressed concerns that our borders, which are still too porous, will \nallow people to come across but not just people who want to work. Our \nporous borders will allow people to enter who want to smuggle drugs, \nsmuggle weapons, and who potentially want to do us harm. Last year \nalone, about 50,000--or closer to 45,000 individuals from countries \nother than Mexico--so-called OTMs--have been detained coming across our \nsouthern border. These OTMs have come from countries such as Somalia, \nYemen, Afghanistan, Iran, China--you name it. The southern border is \nbeing used as a means to enter our country without detection and in \nviolation of our laws.\n  The problem I wish to highlight today is that apparently the \nAdministration is just now waking up to this danger along our border. I \nsay that because only in the last couple of days, the President has \nrequested an emergency supplemental appropriation of $600 million for \nsouthern border enforcement. Unfortunately, in spite of the fact that \nit is a large sum of money, it simply does not go far enough.\n  Recently, I introduced a border security amendment that was \ndefeated--even though it got a majority vote, but didn't get the 60 \nvotes it needed to pass. It was on the Defense supplemental \nappropriations bill. It would have been paid for; it was not deficit \nspending. It would have provided an additional $2 billion to make up \nfor shortfalls in funding to Federal, State, and local agencies that \nare on the front line and need that funding to get the job done.\n  Some critics have said that Members of Congress have focused too much \non border security and that the real solution is to pass a \ncomprehensive immigration reform bill. I disagree. Until we have \ncredible border security and a credible system of tracking visa \noverstays, the American people are simply not going to believe we have \neither the credibility or the competence to enforce whatever law we \npass. All you have to do is to look at where we find ourselves now. You \nalso need to look back to 1986, when President Ronald Reagan signed an \namnesty for 3 million people. He did so premised on the belief that we \nwere actually going to pass an immigration law that could be and would \nbe enforced. We know, from our sad experience, that even though an \namnesty was adopted, enforcement did not follow. That is why I say the \nAmerican people simply don't believe we have the credibility or even \nthe competence, as demonstrated so far, to get the job done.\n  I don't think the American people believe we have done a good job of \ncontrolling illegal immigration, let alone national and domestic \nsecurity. If Washington was doing its job, we would not see States such \nas Arizona and Nebraska passing laws trying to deal with immigration at \nthe State and local level. If Washington was doing its job, we would \nnot continue to hear about the many illegal immigrants who have \ncommitted heinous crimes in the United States and who have been \ndeported multiple times, only to reenter the United States and commit \nfurther crimes. If Washington had been doing its job, we would not \ncontinue to hear about terrorists exploiting our lax immigration \nenforcement--terrorists who are in this country right now trying to do \nus harm, such as the Christmas Day bomber, who had a valid visa--\namazing as it sounds--and the foreign national who overstayed his visa \nwho I mentioned a moment ago, who tried to blow up a Dallas skyscraper \nrecently--a plot foiled by the FBI.\n  I believe we need credible immigration reform, but first we need to \ndemonstrate to the American people that we are serious about border \nsecurity by making sure the resources--both the boots on the ground and \nthe technology--are in place to help, as a force multiplier, provide \nthe kind of border security that will allow us to know with a much \ngreater certainty who is coming into the country and why they are here.\n  The other component of our nation's security has to do with the visa \noverstay issue, which is a huge part of the problem. Put another way, \neven if we were able to secure the border today and know with certainty \nwho was coming across our southern or northern border and what their \npurpose was for entering, we would still have a huge, gaping hole in \nour immigration enforcement system because of the problem of visa \noverstays.\n  Most Americans probably don't realize that between 40 and 50 percent \nof the people who have come into the country and who are here without a \nvalid visa--an estimated 4.5 to 6 million people--are visa overstays. \nIn other words, they came in legally but simply ran out the clock and \noverstay their visa, and now they have attempted to just melt into the \nAmerican landscape.\n  Unfortunately, notwithstanding the recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission and Congress's mandate to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to come up with a way to biometrically track visa overstays \ncoming in through our airports--the Department of Homeland Security \nstill has yet to come up with a credible and workable solution to deal \nwith this very real problem. We know the visa overstays come from \ncountries all around the world, not just Mexico or countries to our \nsouth. These overstays come from places such as Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, \nAfghanistan, Syria, and Sudan.\n  It seems just as plain as the nose on my face to say that America's \nsecurity depends on our tracking not just people who illegally come \nover the border, but also those who come in legally and then illegally \noverstay their visas. Our failure to track visa overstays and enforce \nour immigration laws has already put our country in jeopardy.\n  I mentioned some of the examples a moment ago. The World Trade Center \nmastermind was a visa overstay. The 9/11 hijackers, lest we forget, \nwere visa overstays, people who came in under false pretenses as \nstudents, only to try to do our Nation harm and then killing thousands \nof people in the process. I mentioned the Dallas office tower attempted \nbomber, who was a visa overstay. Most recently, the 17 Afghan pilots in \ntraining at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, TX, my hometown. \nThese were visa overstays. Yet when you ask the Air Force, the \nDepartment of Defense, and the Department of Homeland Security where \nthey are now and what they are doing, we have yet to get a \ncomprehensive and complete report. Why? Because the U.S. Government \nsimply doesn't have a workable and effective and efficient means of \ntracking people who come into the country legally on a temporary visa \nbut then choose to overstay.\n\n  Foreign nationals overstaying their visas is not a new issue, but, as \nwe have seen, it can be a national security issue. Even the Department \nof Homeland Security, the Government Accountability Office, the Pew \nHispanic\n\n[[Page S5390]]\n\nCenter have highlighted the number of overstays in the United States.\n  Like its predecessor, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security has a real inability to track down and \nremove aliens who overstay their visas. Each year, approximately \n300,000 foreign nationals who come to the United States legally, \noverstay their visa. That is 300,000 a year.\n  My amendment, which was defeated last month by a narrow vote, would \nhave given the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement the personnel \nand money needed for additional investigators, detention officers, and \ndetention space.\n  We need a plan, our government needs a plan from the administration \nto enforce our immigration laws regarding visa overstays or the \nAmerican people will continue to see threats to our national security \nmaterialize before their very eyes.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord my letter to Secretary Napolitano at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, there are a number of think tanks--and I \nwill allude to just one--that have come up with a strategy to do what \nneeds to be done to deal with visa overstays. I refer to a \nBackgrounder, published by the Heritage Foundation, dated January 25, \n2010, entitled ``Biometric Exit Program Shows Need for New Strategy to \nReduce Visa Overstays.''\n  I think we need to put our best minds together and devote our efforts \nto dealing with this problem. Just like our broken border, unless \nCongress and the Administration come up with a credible plan to deal \nwith this problem of visa overstays, I don't think the American people \nwill have the confidence they demand and are entitled to when it comes \nto enacting a credible immigration enforcement program.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 22, 2010.\n     Secretary Janet Napolitano,\n     U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Nebraska Avenue \n         Complex, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Napolitano: Last week, the media reported \n     that 17 Afghan military officers had gone Absent Without \n     Leave (AWOL) from a Defense language training institute at \n     Lackland Air Force Base in Texas. Needless to say, I was \n     deeply disturbed by this report and by the fact that I had \n     not received official notification from either the \n     Departments of Defense or Homeland Security.\n       On Friday, I sent a letter to Secretary of the Air Force \n     Michael Donley requesting an immediate explanation and report \n     on how such a serious violation of security occurred, as well \n     as an assessment of the potential threat posed by these 17 \n     officers. In statements to the media, the Air Force stated \n     that they work in close coordination with DHS and ``[w]hen \n     the Defense Department learns an international student has \n     gone missing, DHS Immigration and Customs Enforcement is \n     immediately notified and appropriate action is taken.''\n       I have been informed by ICE the majority of these missing \n     Afghan officers have not been located. According to the \n     recent media reports, these Afghan officers disappeared over \n     a 2-year period. Two years is a significant period of time \n     and I find it alarming that we are still unable to locate \n     these officers in the United States.\n       I recognize that tracking visa overstays in the United \n     States is a challenge. However, I continue to see a \n     disturbing pattern that began with Ramzi Yousef and the 1993 \n     World Trade Center bombings, came to fruition with the 9/11 \n     hijackers, and has continued recently with Hosam Maher Husein \n     Smadi's planned attempts to bomb of a skyscraper in Dallas, \n     Texas--terrorists using legal visas to gain entry into the \n     United States with the clear intent to overstay and do harm. \n     The 9/11 Commission pointed out this area as a vulnerability \n     and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has echoed \n     concerns about visa overstays and our ability to track and \n     remove them from the United States.\n       According to one study, the number of current overstays in \n     the United States ranges anywhere from 4.5 million to 6 \n     million, approximately 40 to 50% of the total illegal \n     immigration population. Overstays come from every continent, \n     and from many nations known to harbor terrorists, including \n     Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria, and Sudan. Given \n     that this number is growing each year by approximately \n     300,000 additional aliens, it is imperative that your \n     Department make identifying and removing visa overstays a \n     national priority.\n       In a public statement, ICE indicated that they notified the \n     U.S. law enforcement community about the missing officers and \n     had ``no information that any of these individuals pose a \n     national security threat.'' As you can imagine, I am not \n     assured by this statement, especially given the fact that \n     these officers remain at large in the United States with \n     their whereabouts unknown to the U.S. government. I view this \n     situation as a clear security failure that needs to be \n     remedied immediately.\n       I would appreciate a response as soon as possible on how \n     you intend to locate these officers immediately and remove \n     them from the United States. I would also ask that you \n     provide me with the Department's strategic plan to deal with \n     visa overstays.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John Cornyn,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I wish to say a few words about an \namendment I had offered to the original tax extenders bill as No. 4324, \nwhich has also been offered as an amendment to the current package. It \nvery much appears that in the crucible of the pressures the bill has \nhad to go through in order to get to its present status, this amendment \nwill not succeed.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee is on the Senate floor. I thank \nhim for his persistent efforts to try to get it into the agreed package \nand for his patience with my even more persistent efforts to try to get \nit into the agreed package.\n  It is a bipartisan amendment. I thank the five Republican colleagues \nwho cosponsored it. I particularly thank Senator Sessions, who is the \nranking member on the Judiciary Committee. He was an early, initial \ncosponsor. We introduced it together in the Judiciary Committee. It \npassed out of the committee uneventfully. It was a pleasure to work \nwith Senator Sessions. I was delighted he was willing to not only \nsupport it as a bill on the Senate floor but also to cosponsor it as an \namendment to this tax extenders package. I extend a particular \nappreciation to him and to his staff for working with us on this \nlegislation.\n  Let me say briefly what it is about. If you are an American business \nand you are doing business in a different State, in a State in which \nyou are incorporated and domiciled, you would ordinarily have to file \nan agent for service of process in that State so that if your conduct \nor product injures somebody in that State, service can be achieved in \nthe place of the injury.\n  We have a world economy, and we are undoubtedly the world's greatest \nimporter of goods. Some of these goods are harmful. Most of them are \ngood for Americans, good for the economy, good for our consumers, but \nsome are not. The wallboard that came from China filled with sulfur so \nthat when it was installed in houses, the sulfur leached, corroded \npiping, made the occupants unhealthy, required a complete stripout and \nrebuild not only of the walls but also of plumbing and other fixtures \nand air-conditioning--that was a disastrous imported product.\n  Toys with lead that children could absorb: We all know what damage \nlead will do to developing brains of young children, particularly \nChinese toys with lead in them. Pharmaceutical products with \nunacceptable chemicals added to them: There have been a lot of products \nthat have come in from overseas and have harmed Americans.\n  If you are a big, legitimate foreign manufacturer, you probably have \nan office here. If somebody is hurt, it is not too hard for the person \nrepresenting you to find the office and file suit and seek recovery for \nwhatever injury was sustained. Many foreign manufacturers even have \nmanufacturing facilities in this country. That makes it very easy to \nlocate them. But some do not. Some live in a shadowy world where they \nsend their products into the United States, get the money out, but when \ntheir defective product injures an American, trying to find them is \nlike trying to grasp a handful of fog. They have disappeared, and they \nhide behind complicated international treaties and foreign laws in \ntheir home countries, making both service of process, getting the \npapers on the lawsuit to them, and actually getting your hands on them \nlegally under our due process--long-arm statutes--is very challenging \nand difficult.\n  We heard from people who spent literally tens of thousands of dollars \ntrying to have their pleadings translated\n\n[[Page S5391]]\n\ninto a foreign language, work their way through all the complex \nministries in the foreign country, all trying to find a company that, \nin many cases, simply reforms itself in a new corporate form and leaves \nthem with nothing at the end of the chase.\n  When that happens, it is a very unfortunate result for American \npeople, and it is a very unfortunate result for American businesses. \nThe unfortunate result for American people is that somebody who was \ninjured, whose child was lead-poisoned, for instance, has no one from \nwhich to seek recovery, and they lose the opportunity we ordinarily \nenjoy as Americans when we are injured by a product to get compensation \nfor the injury. It is the family who gets hurt in that circumstance. \nThat is one way it is bad.\n  The other way it is bad is because commerce is often a chain. When \nthe wrongdoing foreign manufacturer disappears, the other folks who are \nstill in the chain are still around to be sued. Under our theory of \njoint and several liability, the American company has to pick up the \nliability for the foreign company that absconded after it created the \ninjury.\n  We had a very good example in our committee of an Alabama contractor \nwho had a very good reputation, who built developments and homes. He \ngot caught with this Chinese drywall. There was no Chinese drywall \nmanufacturer to sue, but both for purposes of protecting his own \nreputation with the people for whom he had built these houses and \nbecause the liability now fell on him as the joint and several \nliability party, he had to go in and clean it all up. He had to put up \nthe people who were living in these houses. He had to rebuild their \nair-conditioning systems and their plumbing systems. He had to strip \nout all the drywall and rebuild it all back. It was an immense expense, \nand it fell on the American company because the Chinese company had \nabsconded and was not amenable to service and, consequently, to our \nlaws.\n  The very simple premise of this bill is, if you are a foreign \nmanufacturer that exports goods into the United States of America, with \nyour export has to come an agent for service of process. You have to \nfile agent of service for process. When that Chinese drywall, when that \ndefective pharmaceutical, when that lead-poisoned toy hits an American \nconsumer, hits an American home, hits an American family, they can go \nto that agent for service of process and find the wrongdoer, and they \nare amenable to justice in our courts.\n  It is from a competitiveness point of view wrong that foreign \nmanufacturers should be able to underprice American companies because \nthey know they can dodge liability, dodge the consequences for their \nactions, and have an American company have to charge more, knowing they \nhave to bear that liability.\n  Setting aside the whole public safety and consumer protection piece, \nit is a systemic disadvantage to American industry to not fill this \nloophole and make our workers' international competitors hit the same \nbar that American companies have to hit in terms of being available for \nsuit when their products create an injury.\n  Obviously, the tax extenders legislation has not proven to be the \nvehicle for this legislation. My contention for my colleagues is that \nbecause this is a bipartisan bill, because Senator Sessions and I \nworked so hard on it, because all of the initial concerns that were \nraised by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have been cleared and it is now \ngood to go with the Chamber of Commerce--which I know has a significant \nvoice in the views of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--and \nbecause this is a simple mechanism that will treat foreign companies no \ndifferently than American companies are treated and put them on a level \nplaying field and protect American jobs, as well as consumers, I look \nforward to continuing to pursue this legislation and look for further \nopportunities and further vehicles to find a way to remedy what is now \nan unjust situation for American consumers, an anticompetitive and \nunfair situation for American businesses, and a tilted situation \nagainst America's interests for the American economy.\n  I thank again the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee who \nI know is supportive of our efforts. As I said at the outset, the \nintensity of the crucible of the negotiations that finally appears to \nbe moving this tax extenders bill forward in an unfortunately \ndiminished way, but in the best way we have been able to do it, did not \npermit this particular amendment to proceed. But it was not for his \nlack of effort.\n  I appreciate his courtesy with my persistent lobbying and his \nsupport.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/24/senate-section/article/S5391-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the House message with respect to \nH.R. 4213, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate \n     amendment with an amendment to H.R. 4213, an act to amend the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986, to extend certain expiring \n     provisions, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid (for Baucus) motion to concur in the amendment of the \n     House to the amendment of the Senate to the bill, with Baucus \n     Amendment No. 4386 (to the amendment of the House to the \n     amendment of the Senate to the bill), in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Reid (for Baucus) amendment No. 4387 (to amendment No. \n     4386), to change the enactment date.\n       Reid motion to refer in the amendment of the House to the \n     amendment of the Senate to the bill to the Committee on \n     Finance, with instructions, Reid amendment No. 4388, to \n     provide for a study.\n       Reid amendment No. 4389 (to the instructions (amendment No. \n     4388) of the motion to refer), of a perfecting nature.\n       Reid amendment No. 4390 (to amendment No. 4389), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, we are on the message now.\n  First, I commend my colleague from Rhode Island for his efforts to \nenact legislation which will level the playing field. It is only proper \nthat foreign companies that operate in the United States have the same \nability of service of process that American companies have. I commend \nhim and tell my friend from Rhode Island that at the first opportunity, \nI will work hard to include his provision in an appropriate bill so it \ncan pass and be enacted into law.\n  I remind my colleagues that for several weeks now the Senate has been \nworking to pass this important bill that is before us, the so-called \nextenders bill. This week marks at least the eighth week the Senate has \nspent most of the week on this bill to extend current tax law and \nsafety net provisions.\n  This is a bill that would remedy serious challenges that American \nfamilies face as a result of this great recession. This is a bill that \nworks to build a stronger economy. Americans want that. It is a bill to \nput Americans back to work. Clearly, with national unemployment \nhovering around 10 percent, Americans want that, too.\n  With this bill, we have fought to pass policies to create jobs. We \nhave fought for tax cuts for businesses. We have fought for small \nbusiness loans. We have fought for career training programs, and we \nhave fought for infrastructure investment.\n  We have fought to pass tax cuts for families paying for college. We \nhave fought to pass tax cuts for Americans paying property taxes and \nsales taxes.\n  We have fought to extend eligibility for unemployment insurance, \nhealth care tax credits, and housing assistance for people who have \nlost their jobs.\n  As of this week, 900,000 out-of-work Americans have stopped receiving \nunemployment insurance benefits. Why? Because of the Senate's failure \nto enact this bill.\n  We have fought to help States cover the cost of low-income health \ncare programs so that families in need can continue to get quality \nhealth care.\n  Unfortunately, this has been a difficult fight. I don't know why, but \nit has been difficult. Those provisions I mentioned are clearly \nprovisions the American public would like.\n  For months now, we have been trying to address Senators' concerns. \nSenators expressed concern about the size\n\n[[Page S5392]]\n\nof the bill. So we cut the total size of the bill. We cut it from $200 \nbillion to $140 billion. Then we cut further to $118 billion, then to \n$112 billion, then to less than $110 billion today.\n  We cut spending on health care benefits to unemployed workers under \nthe COBRA program. We cut spending on the $25 bonus payments to \nrecipients of unemployment insurance. We cut spending on the relief to \ndoctors in Medicare and TRICARE. We have now cut spending on the help \nto States for Medicaid by one-third. We have provided additional \noffsets for the package. Senators requested that.\n  Since the first time the Senate passed this bill, we have sought and \nfound more than $75 billion in new offsets, and the bill is now more \nthan two-thirds paid for.\n  We have revised the carried interest provisions in at least eight \ndifferent ways to address concerns raised by Senators.\n  We have modified the S corporation loophole closer to limit its \neffect on firms with fewer than four partners.\n  We heard Senators express an interest in more spending cuts. The \nsubstitute before us today comes forward with additional spending cuts.\n  We have fought mightily to adjust the bill to address Senators' \nconcerns. But in the fight for this legislation, let's not lose sight \nof what the real fight is about. For many families, this is a fight for \nthe roof over their heads. This is a fight for the food on their \ntables. This is a fight for the jobs they desperately need. And this is \na fight for the opportunity they hope will come through.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to create jobs this \neconomy needs. I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment for \nthe families who are counting on us to come through. I urge my \ncolleagues, at long last, to pass this bill.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 2194\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that today at \n12:30 p.m., the Senate proceed to the consideration of the conference \nreport to accompany H.R. 2194, the Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions \nAct, notwithstanding receipt of the official papers from the House; \nthat debate on the conference report be limited to 2\\1/2\\ hours, with \nthe time equally divided and controlled between the leaders or their \ndesignees; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the conference \nreport be set aside and that the vote on adoption of the conference \nreport occur at a time to be determined by the majority leader, \nfollowing consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate having \nreceived the official papers from the House, and without further \nintervening action or debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for about 15 minutes. It might go to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             gulf disaster\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I come to the floor today to add some \ncomments to the Record about this horrendous environmental and economic \ndisaster unfolding in the gulf and to try to provide some additional \nperspective on behalf of the people I represent, the people of \nLouisiana. I have been proud to represent them over the last 14 years \nin the Senate, and in that capacity I have had the opportunity, on a \nvariety of occasions, to speak up strongly for our neighboring States, \nthe gulf coast, America's working coast--a coast that does the work of \nthis country in many ways. We produce most of the oil and gas off the \nshores of our Nation. We provide a great percentage of petrochemicals \nthat are relied on by men and women in every part of the world, \nincluding those in our own country.\n  I could go on and on, from agriculture, to seafood, to navigation of \nthe Mississippi River. We work hard down South, and we are proud of the \nwork we do.\n  We are extremely troubled, as you can imagine, by what is happening \ntoday. I would like to share just a few thoughts and potential \nsuggestions for a way forward.\n  It has been 66 days now since the tragic explosion of the Deepwater \nHorizon that unleashed one of the worst manmade disasters this Nation \nhas ever witnessed. Every day you can simply turn on the television or \nmany sites on the Internet and find pictures, disturbing pictures of \nthat well still gushing uncontrollably into the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Millions of Americans, including 105 million who call the Louisiana \ncoast home, watch, in some ways helplessly, as this brown sludge washes \nup onto our beaches and into our marshes. It is not only staining our \nlands but threatening our way of life. We must move decisively.\n  This is an emotional issue for me, for many people I represent, from \nthe broad political spectrum of liberals to conservatives, Democrats to \nRepublicans to Independents, from individuals to families, people of \nall ages. We try to debate the appropriate way forward.\n  It is important for us not to lose focus that 66 days ago our Nation \nlost 11 men. More importantly, more directly, 21 children lost their \nfathers, and hundreds of families lost members, friends, and coworkers. \nThey lost these men, and we will keep them forever in our memory.\n  We must also remember these 11 men were just like literally thousands \nof other men and women who put on their blue jeans and overalls and \nwork outside for a living on the land and on the water in Louisiana, \nMississippi, Texas, and all over the United States, who engage in \ndifficult work, and at times dangerous work, to produce what our \ncountry needs to operate--many of us can work in the comfort of air-\nconditioning in buildings like this.\n  In fact, in my State, there are more than 300,000 men and women \nworking in the oil and gas industry alone. Every day, they go to work \nwith the risk associated with offshore and onshore development, but \nthey understand what I understand, that this country needs to produce \nmore, not less, oil and gas domestically for our economy and, I would \ncontend, for our environment--and I will get to that point in a \nminute--and for our national security.\n  As I said on the floor of the Senate last week, I fully supported a \nthorough review of offshore drilling safety standards. Obviously, we \nneed them. Not only do we need new standards, we need to enforce the \nones we have. I have welcomed the efforts of Department of Interior \nSecretary Salazar to rewrite, reorganize, and retool an agency that has \nfallen down on the job, and in some ways been part of the disaster--in \nmany ways. We now have a new agency emerging, and we most desperately \nneed it.\n  However, if we are going to ensure that an incident of this magnitude \nnever happens again, this new agency--whatever it ends up being \ncalled--must train, recruit, and pay the most qualified people to carry \nout this new urgent mission. Robust oversight, greater transparency, \nstrong safety standards, and high ethical standards must be maintained.\n  This administration did not inherit, obviously, a perfectly well run, \nwell-tuned agency. It inherited a mess. I share their desire to see it \ncleaned up, retooled, and refocused. I commend the Secretary and the \nnew appointee, Michael Bromwich, whom I had the opportunity to meet for \nthe first time this morning, in their efforts to do so. That is an \nimportant step forward and one this Congress seems to be willing to \ntake, both from the Republican and\n\n[[Page S5393]]\n\nDemocratic sides of the aisle. I am looking forward to working in a \nnonpartisan way as we strive to find the right way forward.\n  But the President and his administration have imposed a very \narbitrary and, in my view, ill-conceived 6-month moratoria on new \ndeepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico--the only place in the country \nnow where we drill in depths, and one of the few places that allows \ndrilling off the coast at any depth of water. The first well was \ndrilled off our coast 12 feet off the shore many decades ago in just a \nfew feet of water. Now, as we know, we are drilling in thousands of \nfeet and have successfully done that, safely done that, for now 20 \nyears--until this undescribable blowout that has occurred.\n  In Louisiana, unfortunately, we are coming to terms with what a \nprolonged moratoria will mean for our families and our businesses, \nlarge and small, and it is not a pretty picture. It is painful, it is \nfrightening, it is upsetting, and it needs to be told.\n  A 6-month moratoria on all of these 33 rigs that operate in the Gulf \nof Mexico will wreak economic havoc on this region. Right now, there \nare thousands of people out of work--fishermen, oystermen, boat \ncaptains, recreational. They cannot fish. It is not safe. No one is \ncoming down to Louisiana. They are going to Florida. They are going to \nMississippi because there are actually beaches that are still clean and \navailable for people.\n  But in Louisiana, we do not have that many beaches actually. We have \nAmerica's great wetlands. These boat captains have--I have met with \nthem on many occasions. As to these people, their clients contract with \nthem months in advance. They do not come down to sunbathe and take \ntheir kids on a few little rides here and there and then occasionally \nrent a boat. They come down to rent the boats to fish in some of the \ngreatest, most wonderful fishing places in the world. They are closed \ndown.\n\n  In addition to them being closed down and not being able to work at \nall in many instances--these are small businesses that can generate \nanywhere from a few thousand dollars a month to millions of dollars a \nmonth, and companies worth millions of dollars--the President and the \nadministration have slapped down an ill-conceived 6-month moratoria \nwithout any real timeframes.\n  I am encouraged that just this morning--I came to the floor right \nafter the energy hearing--Ken Salazar, who continues to have my great \nrespect and support despite my differences of opinion with him on some \nof these issues, spoke before our committee and said that based on the \njudge's decision, with which I agree, and comments made by the \nSecretary's own experts that ``a blanket moratorium is not the answer. \nIt will not measurably reduce risk further and it will have a lasting \nimpact on the nation's economy which may be greater than that of the \noil spill. . . . We do not believe punishing the innocent is the right \nthing to do''--these are not Mary Landrieu's words. These are not words \nfrom the congressional delegations that represent the gulf coast. These \nare words from the Secretary's own experts.\n  We urge--I urge--the Secretary and the President to listen to these \nmen who submitted the first report and try to find a better way \nforward.\n  Marty Feldman--a judge I know well--I hold in the highest esteem. He \nis more conservative than some Members here but, nonetheless, has \nserved with distinction. He said the moratorium was arbitrary and \ncapricious. He said:\n\n       [A] blanket, generic, indeed punitive, moratorium on \n     deepwater oil and gas drilling is not the way to go.\n\n  He said:\n\n       The blanket moratorium, with no parameters, seems to assume \n     that because one rig failed and although no one yet fully \n     knows why, all companies and rigs drilling new wells over 500 \n     feet also universally present an imminent danger.\n\n  He goes on to a well-reasoned argument that has been well published \nand well debated.\n  I hope, as the Secretary said this morning, he and the President are \ntrying to find the way forward that would involve reaching very high \nsafety, more certification of the engineers and managers on these rigs. \nThat is obvious since this looks like, in many instances, it might be \nmore human error than equipment error that caused this. So I think we \nshould focus on the humans in charge and try to make sure they are up \nto the task on all of these 33 rigs. That could be done well within 6 \nmonths.\n  There needs to be, in other words, some more urgency to find the \nsafety level that is now being demanded by the American people, and \nrightly so. No one wants it more than the women who lost their \nhusbands. They sat with me at my kitchen table just 2 weeks ago and \nsaid those words to me: Senator, no one in America could want this to \nbe more safe than we do. But they also said: We believe the moratorium \nis wrong. We cannot stand by and not say this because our neighbors, \nthe husbands of our best friends, are being laid off. People we know in \nour community are being irreparably harmed. They said: We told this to \nthe President. Do you think, Senator, he will listen?\n  I have assured them that the President is listening, that the \nPresident is a man with a great mind and a great heart. I have assured \nthem that Secretary Salazar could not be a more honest broker. He has \nbeen beat up on both sides. The environmentalists do not think he is \ntough enough. The oil and gas industry beats him up all the time. So \nthat convinces me he is probably the right person for this job.\n  But this moratorium that idles these 33 rigs is dangerous, and I will \ntell you why. These rigs can move, and they will move. There is more \noil to be found in this world. There are reserves off many coasts, and \nthere is more oil than there are rigs able to drill. Since the world is \na thirsty sponge, it just continues to need billions and billions of \nbarrels of oil to operate.\n  In the United States, we use 20 million barrels a day. We used 20 \nmillion barrels yesterday. We will use 20 million barrels today. None \nof that is changing. So the world is needing this oil. There are fewer \nrigs than there is oil. They cannot and will not sit idly in the Gulf \nof Mexico while we try to decide what to do. They will leave, and they \nwill not then be coming back any time soon.\n\n  I will submit for the Record--because it really got me upset this \nmorning, and it should get everyone upset who reads it--a very moving \narticle in the New York Times about what is happening in the Niger \nDelta, a delta we don't pay a lot of attention to here. Why would we? \nThere are just a lot of poor people who live there, and we don't \nrepresent them here. But in the Niger Delta, I read this morning, they \nhave to put up with a spill equal to the Valdez. They put up with it, \nthe size of it, every year. The mangroves that I read about--the \nmangroves I can imagine in my mind because we have them in Louisiana \nand in Florida and in places I have been--are destroyed. The swamp is \nlifeless.\n  Madam President, I tell my Democratic colleagues: If you drive this \noil drilling off our shore, you will simply drive it to places with \ngreater environmental degradation than either you or anyone you know \ncould probably imagine.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. That is what is going to happen. This is not Mary \nLandrieu's opinion; this is just the nature of this business. They \ndon't have to stay in the gulf. They can break these contracts. They \nare doing that as I speak. There are lawsuits being filed from Houston \nto Mobile to New Orleans. This is a great boon for lawyers, a bad day \nfor people, and a terrible day for our environment.\n  I am begging this administration to look worldwide. We are a world \nleader. We are up to the task of finding out what happened quickly, \ngetting these rigs back drilling, and setting an example for the world \nand showing some sympathy for people who are much less powerful than we \nare. I would like to hear a leader stand up and say: I am concerned \nabout Niger. I am concerned about Africa. I am concerned about Brazil \nand South America and what happens off the coast, even in places we are \nnot very happy with right now such\n\n[[Page S5394]]\n\nas Venezuela or Cuba. Cuba is only 90 miles from Florida. Do you think \nwe can control what Cuba does in offshore drilling? No, ma'am. All we \ncan do is try to do the best we can in America, as we have done for \ndecades and decades and generations and generations, and lead by \nexample and show the world the technology that can work. We can make \nrational and reasonable decisions in a public arena such as this--very \ntransparent, as corruption-free as possible, as rational and as \neducated as possible. That is what the world expects of us.\n  I am not going to stand here and let this Congress run with its tail \nbetween its legs and overreact to a situation, as horrible as this one \nis. We most certainly know; we are swimming in the oil.\n  I will come down several times in the next week to try to make as \nclear an argument as I can that there must be a better way forward than \nshutting down this industry so that they move to places that have less \nprotection and less ability, while we guzzle most of the oil. What a \nhypocritical situation this puts us in. I don't know what to tell the \npeople of Niger. I don't even know what to tell the people of \nLouisiana. I am going to think about it and come back.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/24/senate-section/article/S5394-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5394-S5409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMPREHENSIVE IRAN SANCTIONS, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND DIVESTMENT ACT OF \n                        2010--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n2194, the Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions Act.

Madam President, I was a member of the conference that \ndealt with the bill that is now before the Senate, and I wish to make a \nfew remarks in favor of the conference report.\n  Iran poses an interesting threat to the United States and to our \nallies in the Middle East. The Iranian regime is arguably the most \nanti-American regime in the world. There may be some who would put \nforth North Korea or some other countries, and I won't debate with them \nwhere on the list they would be, but Iran is very much at the top of \nthe list of regimes that hate America. Ironically, every indication is \nthat the Iranian people do not support the position of their government \nand that the Iranian people, if they had a legitimate government; that \nis, one that was chosen by a legitimate election, would be strongly \npro-America. So we have this very challenging dichotomy here of a \nregime that is bent on mischief or worse throughout the region, and a \nvery clear hatred for America, presiding over a population that is \nstrongly in favor of America.\n  I make that point because many people will say: Well, it is the \npeople of Iran who will be punished if this sanctions bill goes \nforward.\n  I say it is the people of Iran who are desiring relief from their own \ngovernment, and anything we can do to punish that government, make the \nsituation more untenable, and ultimately help bring it down will be for \nthe benefit of the people of Iran. So I am standing here as an advocate \nin favor of the Iranian population even as I have harsh things to say \nabout the Iranian Government.\n  There are those who say: Well, the Iranians have every right to a \nnuclear capability. They are a sovereign nation. They have the right to \nbuild a nuclear plant within their borders so they can have the \nbenefits of nuclear power. And you, Senator Bennett, are a supporter of \nnuclear energy, so why do you oppose the Iranian effort with respect to \ntheir nuclear program?\n  I do not oppose a program that would move toward peaceful \nexploitation of nuclear power. Indeed, I would welcome it and support \nit. In the world today, it is certainly possible, and, indeed, many \ncountries do have nuclear capability without creating the capacity to \nproduce a nuclear weapon. The two are not necessarily simultaneous and \ncoterminous. A nuclear capacity to provide electricity, to provide \npower for the populous as a whole, is a good thing, a benign thing, and \nsomething I support.\n  The Iranians oppose any kind of effort to put limits on their plan, \non their program. They say: We are doing this just for domestic power \npurposes. But they refuse to take the kinds of steps other nations have \ntaken that will allow them to have all of the benefits of a domestic \nnuclear plant and none of the challenges that go with the creation of a \nnuclear weapon.\n  There was a time--the Cold War and shortly after the Second World \nWar--when nuclear weapons were seen as a very viable part of the \nmilitary arsenal. We have such an arsenal. The Soviet Union did. Some \nof our allies joined us, and nuclear weapons were seen in the classic \npower struggle between nation states. Today, however, the situation has \nchanged, and a nuclear weapon is seen primarily as a blackmailing \ndevice for one nation to threaten another nation in a circumstance \ndifferent from the kind of confrontation we had with the Soviet Union. \nIf Iran got a nuclear weapon, they would use it as a destabilizing \ninstrument throughout the Middle East, which is already one of the \nleast stable portions of the world, and other countries all around Iran \nwould say: Well, if they are going to have a nuclear weapon for \nblackmail purposes within foreign policy discussions, we will have to \nhave one too. And if Iran is allowed to get a nuclear weapon, the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons in the region will be enormous.\n  As long as they just use it as a blackmail weapon and talk about it, \none could say it is really not that big of a deal. Inevitably, the \ncreation of such weapons, the proliferation of such weapons in an area \nas unstable as the Middle East runs a very high risk that one of those \nweapons will be used. Then we will see the opening of a nuclear \nholocaust the likes of which we have not seen before. The last time a \nnuclear weapon was used was when we were in the midst of a horrendous \nwar where the projections were that if we stayed in a conventional \npattern and invaded Japan in a conventional way, the casualties would \nbe overwhelming on both sides. And by using a nuclear weapon to bring \nthe Second World War to an end, we tragically cost tens of thousands of \nlives in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but we saved millions of lives on the \nbeaches and in the streets of Tokyo and in the other places that would \nhave been lost if the war had continued with conventional weapons.\n\n  We cannot do anything that would encourage Iran with respect to its \nnuclear program, and that is why this act is so important.\n  People will say: Well, it is economic sanctions, it is financial \nsanctions, things of that kind. Yes, it is all of those things, but it \nis aimed primarily at and focused entirely on Iran's efforts with \nrespect to the creation of a nuclear weapon.\n  Iran could get out from under these sanctions immediately if they \nwould say: We will follow the pattern of other peaceful nations and \npursue a nuclear domestic program for energy purposes in such a way \nthat it will not lead to the creation of a capability for nuclear \nweapons. I stress again the division between the two: You can have \nnuclear power for energy and electricity without producing the kinds of \nthings that are necessary to produce a nuclear weapon. Iran could go \ndown that road if they choose to, and if the Iranian regime were to \nmake that very wise decision--wise for themselves and their own ability \nto remain at the head of a country whose population hates them; wise \nfor the region; wise for the world as a whole--I would be one of the \nfirst to stand and say that this bill of sanctions for Iran should be \nwithdrawn. The initiative rests with them, not with us, as to what will \nhappen in the Middle East.\n  All right. Some specifics about the legislation. If it is \nimplemented, it would dramatically raise the price Iran will have to \npay for their activities because it will increase the scope of \nsanctions already authorized under the Iranian sanctions act by \nimposing sanctions on foreign companies that sell Iran goods, services, \nor know-how that would assist in its nuclear sector. It includes a \nprovision with respect to refined petroleum being exported to Iran.\n\n[[Page S5395]]\n\nIt is interesting that Iran is one of the major sources of crude oil, \nbut they do not have refined petroleum available to them in the \nquantities they need within their own shores.\n  So they import it and this sanctions act will seriously hamper the \nimportation of refined products. The legislation mandates that in order \nto do business with the U.S. Government, a company must certify that \nit--or its subsidiaries--does not engage in sanctionable activities \nwith respect to Iran.\n  Financial. The conference report imposes severe restrictions on \nforeign financial institutions that are doing business with key Iranian \nbanks, and it bans U.S. banks from engaging in financial transactions \nwith foreign banks doing business with the IRGC, the Islamic \nRevolutionary Guard Corps.\n  In effect, the act says to foreign banks doing business with the \nblacklisted Iranian entity that you have a stark choice: Cease your \nactivities, or be denied access to the American financial system.\n  There are other provisions, which I will not take the time to \noutline. I close by making it clear, once again, that this is not a \nknee-jerk reaction on the part of Americans in a fit of pique with \nrespect to the Iranians because the Iranian President says stupid \nthings in international fora. This is a deadly serious attempt to see \nto it that a significant threat in the region does not go forward. In \nthe end, this is an attempt to help free the Iranian people from the \ntyranny of one of the most repressive and difficult governments that \nany country is forced to abide by in the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Commending John Isner\n\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, it is appropriate that the occupant of the \nChair and I are here at the same time.\n  I rise to congratulate North Carolina native John Isner for not only \nsurviving the longest tennis match in Wimbledon history but for \nemerging victorious over Nicolas Mahut of France. Clocking in at over \n11 hours, this first round match was historic in its length and its \nnumber of games--138 in the fifth set alone.\n  Picking up this morning at 59-59 in the fifth set, the match \ncontinued with no break points until John hit a final backhand to \nfinish the match in front of a packed, standing-room only crowd of \namazed fans. Throughout that grueling competition, Isner maintained an \nimpressive sense of calm under pressure, serving his opponent a record-\nbreaking 112 aces.\n  In addition to impressive play, John showed great respect and honor \nfor his opponent after the match, and he displayed the kind of \nsportsmanship and chivalry that are often forgotten in today's sports \nworld.\n  This extraordinary match will not only be remembered in the history \nbooks but by all sports fans who witnessed the incredible competitive \nspirit of these two great athletes.\n  John, congratulations to you, and we are pulling for you in the next \nround.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, before the Senator leaves the floor, I \ndidn't watch the match. I am in a conference committee, and that \nprocess has gone on for about a year and a half--for years--which may \nbe a record as well. I also commend that young man from North Carolina. \nI congratulate the Presiding Officer and the other Senator from North \nCarolina--the young man, more importantly, who went through the \ngrueling process of a lengthy tennis match.\n  Mr. BURR. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMikulski be recognized after I complete my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, as chairman of the Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs Committee, and as the cochair of the conference \ncommittee, along with Howard Berman, the Congressman from California, I \nwant to begin by thanking my fellow conferees.\n  You have heard from Senator Bennett of Utah, a conferee; Senator \nMenendez, of New Jersey; John Kerry, of Massachusetts; my colleague \nfrom Connecticut, Joe Lieberman; Senator Shelby of Alabama; Senator \nLugar, the former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee--\nJohn Kerry is currently the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, and Senator Lieberman is the chairman of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee. So we have had some very active members, along with \nthe House conferees. Numerous members in the House, as well, have \nplayed a significant role in the development of this conference report.\n  I also commend the administration, and particularly the Secretary of \nState, our former colleague, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and \nher staff for the remarkable job they have done over these many weeks, \nwhen we have tried to craft this very important piece of legislation. \nThey were excellent in their work and did a wonderful job.\n  Obviously, the President, first and foremost, deserves credit for \ninsisting upon a multilateral approach, which they, to a large extent, \nachieved.\n  This legislation complements that international effort. Three decades \nago, when I was serving in the other body--with a full head of black \nhair in those days, so that is going back in time--the House \nInternational Relations Committee collaborated with the Senate Banking \nCommittee to produce what was called landmark legislation in 1977. It \nwas called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, known as \nIEEPA, which is how I will refer to the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act.\n  To this day, IEEPA empowers Presidents of the United States to apply \nstrong sanctions against any nation, organization, or person that poses \nan ``unusual and extraordinary threat'' to the United States. It is \nwith these authorities that American Presidents, over the years, have \neffectively enforced trade embargoes against, in this case, Iran, \nbanning exports and imports, and freezing key Iranian assets.\n  While IEEPA authorities have kept the U.S. businesses from entering \nIran, years ago, it had become very clear--abundantly clear--that much \nmore was needed to be done, not only in the case of Iran but other \nnations as well.\n  That is why, in 1996, the Senate Banking Committee and the House \nForeign Affairs Committee once again collaborated to develop new \nsanctions on non-U.S. businesses investing in Iran's energy sector.\n  Oil and gas was providing Iran's terrorist regime with key sources of \nrevenue, and action was needed to be taken. In those days, the \nresulting Iran-Libya Sanctions Act--later named the Iran sanctions act \nbecause Libya complied with the concerns we had at the time. As a \nresult of them stepping forward and renouncing terrorism, we were able \nto drop Libya from the title of that bill. As I heard Senator Bennett \nsay--and I think other colleagues would join in this--there is no great \njoy in crafting this bill. We are doing so out of defense of our Nation \nand over a threat being posed by the Government of Iran. We hope that \nthey will understand the seriousness of this endeavor, the \ncollaborative nature of our efforts, and we hope they will see the \nlight as Libya did, and we urge them to take the proper steps to remove \nthe threat they are presently posing.\n  Regrettably, despite a very clear mandate, American Presidents have \nfailed to comply with the law, ISA legislation, adopted back in 1996, \ndespite billions of dollars in oil and gas investments.\n  How have administrations avoided complying with the law we passed in \n1996? Frankly, that has been the subject of considerable discourse \nwithin the Banking Committee over the last number of years.\n  First, when the Iran sanctions act mandates that American Presidents \n``shall'' impose two out of a menu of six penalties on sanctionable \nforeign companies, it only says that Presidents ``should'' investigate \ncredible evidence of energy investments and ``should'' make \ndeterminations that they have, in fact, engaged in sanctionable acts.\n  Thus, administrations since 1996 have simply avoided launching \ninvestigations and making those determinations.\n\n[[Page S5396]]\n\n  Executive branch officials of both parties have conceded that they \ndid not even want to waive sanctions. Waiving imposition of sanctions, \nthey have contended, is an admission of a foreign company's guilt. If \nwe are, in effect, imposing a sanction on a company, and then \nofficially relieving them of U.S. penalties, we are impinging on those \ncompanies' reputation and implying that the companies outside the U.S. \njurisdiction are nonetheless in violation of our laws.\n\n  Such extraterritorial provocations might be grounds for retribution--\neither through reciprocal sanction or trade barriers. Thus, \nadministrations--Democrats and Republicans--have avoided even launching \nthe ISA investigations called for in 1996 or, of course, making any \ndeterminations so as not to resort to sanctions waivers.\n  Administrations have certainly used the threat of imposing these \nsanctions to some effect. But as multiple reports by the Congressional \nResearch Service and the GAO have indicated, investments in Iran's \nenergy sector have continued, and the regime in Iraq has benefited from \nthose revenues.\n  This measure that I am today managing, along with others, marks a new \nchapter in Congress's long history of confronting the Iranian threat. \nBut far more importantly, the conference report, which we will be \nvoting on later this afternoon, we are considering makes profound \nchanges to the law, which, if implemented correctly, will bring about \nstrong pressure to bear on Tehran in order to combat its proliferation \nof weapons of mass destruction, support for international terrorism, \nand gross human rights abuses.\n  The act says, in no uncertain terms, that Presidents shall be \nrequired, if they have established that credible evidence of a firm \nengaging in ISA-sanctionable activity exists, to launch investigations, \nmake determinations, and ultimately impose sanctions on those companies \ninvesting in Iran's energy sector.\n  Moreover, it imposes new sanctions on companies providing refined \npetroleum products or helping to build Iran's domestic refineries.\n  In response to Tehran's terrible abuses of its own people--Senator \nLieberman has gone on at some length about this, and he is absolutely \ncorrect, a major part of the report focuses on the Iranian people and \nwhat they are subjected to on an hourly basis by a government which the \nmajority of people in that country abhor. In the wake of what they have \nbeen doing and Iran's fraudulent presidential election, the conference \nreport and the act imposes visa, property, and financial sanctions on \nIranians the President determines to be complicit in serious human \nrights abuses against other Iranians on or after the date of Iran's \nelection.\n  The conference report and the act imposes a U.S. Government \nprocurement ban on foreign companies doing energy business in Iran or \nhelping the Iranian Government to monitor and jam communications among \nits people. No longer will U.S. taxpayers' money be used to support \nIran's corporate sponsors.\n  The act further codifies trade restrictions in law and ends the few \nremaining Iranian imports allowed into the United States.\n  Similarly, the legislation also allows States, local governments, and \nprivate investors to exercise their own right to divest from companies \ninvesting in Iran's energy sector.\n  The act explicitly states the sense of Congress that the United \nStates should support the decisions of State and local governments to \ndivest from these firms and clearly authorizes divestment decisions \nmade consistent with the standards of the act.\n  Elsewhere in the act and the conference report legislation is a \nprovision cracking down on the international black market weapons \ntrade, which rogue countries, such as North Korea and Iran, have long \nexploited. Under this act, the United States will identify countries \nthat are allowing sensitive U.S. technology that can be used for \nweapons of mass destruction or terrorism to be transshipped into Iran, \nand it will force these countries to cooperate in establishing \nappropriate customs, intelligence gathering, and trade restrictions. If \nthey refuse to cooperate with the United States, the act requires \nimposition of severe export restrictions on those countries.\n  Finally, the act establishes a very strong new banking section to be \nundertaken by the Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and \nFinancial Intelligence, Stuart Levey, and his colleagues. Stuart Levey \nhas worked in two administrations now and should be highly commended, \nby the way, for the remarkable work he has done over the years. This is \nan official of the Treasury Department who is so knowledgeable on this \nsubject matter and was invaluable in helping us craft this legislation. \nI especially mention him and thank him for his contribution.\n  This new section takes aim squarely at Iran's powerful Revolutionary \nGuard Corps--or the IRGC, as it is known--and attempts to choke it off \nfrom an increasingly important source of power--international financial \ninvestment.\n  Section 104 of the act has two principal parts. First, the Treasury \nwill direct American banks to prohibit or impose strict conditions on \ncorrespondent or payable-through accounts of any foreign financial \ninstitutions working with key Iranian entities.\n  For example, foreign banks conducting substantial business with the \nIRGC, its front companies or affiliates, will be cut off from its \nAmerican accounts. Hypothetically, then, if an Asian or Latin American \nbank were to provide services to an IRGC-owned construction company, \nfor instance, building a major gas pipeline, that bank would be shut \noff from U.S. correspondent banking.\n  In addition, foreign banks servicing the various Iranian banks \nblacklisted by the Treasury Department and the UN Security Council will \nalso be targeted under this section.\n  Section 104 directs the Treasury to restrict correspondent banking \nfor foreign banks directly involved in Iran's weapons of mass \ndestruction proliferation and terrorist financing, as well as money \nlaundering toward those aims.\n  In the end, the act presents foreign banks doing business with \nblacklisted Iranian entities a very stark choice: Cease your activities \nor be denied critical access to America's financial system.\n  The second part of section 104 would hold U.S. banks accountable for \nactions by their foreign subsidiaries. Under IEEPA, which I described \nearlier, U.S. companies have long been banned from doing business with \nIran. Now under this act, this conference report, foreign entities \nowned or controlled by U.S. banks will also be prohibited from doing \nbusiness with the IRGC. If their foreign subsidiaries continue to do \nso, the U.S. parent companies will be subjected to severe penalties--\ncivil fines amounting to twice the value of the transaction or $250,000 \nand criminal fines if there is proven willful intent, up to $1 million, \nand 20 years in jail.\n  To be sure, we have included waivers in the act. We believe that the \nPresident of the United States must have flexibility in executing \nforeign policy. We all agree with that point. As I mentioned before, \nforeign nations consider ISA waivers to have extraterritorial impact on \ncompanies in their jurisdiction.\n  For the most part, waivers of the sanctions in this act may only be \nexercised if they are deemed necessary to the national interest or, in \nthe case of energy investment and refined petroleum sanctions, if the \ncompanies are from nations cooperating in multilateral efforts against \nIran. Reports to Congress are to be detailed about the particular \ninvestments or transactions considered sanctionable, as well as why \nthese waivers are invoked.\n  Only in the case of refined petroleum sanctions do we allow for some \nadditional flexibility. In that case, the President of the United \nStates may delay making determinations about the sanctionability of \nspecific transactions every 6 months if the President can demonstrate \nprogressively greater reductions in refined petroleum transportations \nin Iran.\n  These are very tough unilateral measures, but Congress does not \nexpect them to effect change in a vacuum. Unilateral sanctions are but \none tool of statecraft available to American Presidents to effect such \nchange. In my view, they are less likely to be effective than tough, \ncoordinated, multilateral sanctions.\n  All of us recognize that acting alone we may achieve some results. \nActing\n\n[[Page S5397]]\n\ntogether, we have the opportunity to truly bring about the desired \nchange we all seek.\n  These unilateral sanctions must be exercised as part of a \ncomprehensive, coordinated diplomatic and political effort conducted in \ncooperation with our allies and designed to achieve the real results we \nall seek.\n  I believe President Obama has been both thoughtful and deliberate in \nhis approach to pressuring Iran to change its conduct. Having just this \nmonth achieved UN Security Council approval of Resolution 1929 and \nEuropean Union endorsement of additional energy and financial measures \non Iran, the President of the United States is clearly setting the \nstage for what we all hope is strong, targeted, and effective \nmultilateral and multilayered pressure on Tehran.\n  These measures are not ends but merely a means to an end, first and \nforemost, to suspend Iran's illicit nuclear program, to protect Israel \nand our other friends and allies, to combat Tehran's proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction, and express support for human rights in \ntheir country.\n  I see my colleague from Arizona. I believe it was his suggestion that \nthe human rights effort be part of this legislation. I did not have a \nchance to mention him earlier in my remarks. I thank my colleague for \nthis proposal which includes very strong language and a message to the \nIranian people that this is not about them, this is about their \ngovernment. It is very important that all of us in our remarks today \nmake it clear that we are tremendously sympathetic to what they are \ngoing through and, therefore, part of our proposal has strong language \nthat allows us to address--at least to try to address--the issue of \nhuman rights abuses in Tehran. Again, I appreciate all the hard work.\n  I mentioned the conferees earlier: my colleague from Connecticut, \nSenator Lieberman, Senator Menendez, Senator Kerry, Senator Shelby, \nSenator Bennett, and Senator Lugar, from the Senate perspective who \nwere part of drafting this bill, as well as our House conferees, led by \nHoward Berman of California. I extend a special thank you to all of \nthem for their leadership.\n  I also thank Senator Reid, the majority leader, and Senator \nMcConnell. None of this ever happens without the majority leader of the \nSenate taking a leadership role and insisting this matter move forward, \ninsisting it be addressed before we break for the July 4 recess period \ncoming up next week and in the midst of all the other things in which \nwe have been involved. My colleagues know we have been involved in a \nvery lengthy conference regarding financial reform. I am delighted to \ntake some time out from that effort to address this particular proposal \nand urge our colleagues to be supportive of this proposal.\n  I also want to support what I mentioned earlier--President Obama's \napproach--and I appreciate his team's work in helping us improve this \nimportant legislation. I mentioned earlier our Secretary of State and \nformer colleague. We had extensive meetings with her, National Security \nAdviser, General Jones, Deputy Secretary of State Steinberg, Under \nSecretary of the Treasury Levey--I mentioned the tremendous work he has \ndone, Stuart Levey in the Department of Treasury--Assistant Secretary \nof State Verma, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Cohen, and Office \nof Foreign Assets Control Director Adam Szubin. All of these people, \nand many others, along with our staffs--and I am particularly grateful \nto my staff for the work they have done, led by Colin McGinnis of my \noffice, who did a remarkable job in pulling this together to see to it \nthat we worked with our counterparts, and there are many others on my \nstaff as well I should mention.\n  Neal Orringer from my office deserves great credit for his work as \nwell. It has been a great pleasure working with Rick Kessler, Shanna \nWinters, Alan Makovsky, and Daniel Silverberg.\n  Additionally, I thank Ranking Member Richard Shelby, along with his \ntalented counsel, John O'Hara.\n  I also thank Margaret Roth-Warren, our brilliant, detail-oriented \nlegislative counsel who spent weeks on end working with my staff and me \nand others to make this, hopefully, the most comprehensive and \neffective sanctions legislation that we can include.\n  I have hopefully mentioned all the appropriate members of the staff. \nThere is always a danger of leaving someone out. I do not want to do \nthat. They work very hard. These are the unknown people we do not \nalways get to recognize. They spent countless hours pulling this most \ncomprehensive sanctions conference report together. We are very \ngrateful to all of them and the tremendous work they do every single \nday.\n  I know my colleague from Maryland wishes to be heard. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to support the passage of the \nComprehensive Iran Sanctions conference report.\n  Mr. President, you know me. I am a plain and a straight talker, so I \nam not going to use the flowery language of diplomacy or Senate speak \non a lot of the language. I am going to say this in plain English.\n  Today, if you want to improve the safety and security of the United \nStates of America, you want to pass this bill. If you want to make sure \nwe ensure the safety and security of our allies in the Middle East, you \nwant to pass this bill. If you want to identify who is one of the major \nenemies of the United States and our allies, it is Iran.\n  If one looks at the world, peace in the Middle East lies not through \nJerusalem but lies through Tehran. What does Tehran do? Tehran funds \nHamas, which is causing untold heartbreak and bloodshed in Gaza. No. 2, \nit funds Hezbollah, funding untold terrorist activity in the north of \nIsrael and in Lebanon. No. 3, it is also working to develop nuclear \nweapons. We do not want Iran to have nuclear weapons.\n  What has Iran been doing over the last several years? They have had a \nrecord of denial and deception in developing nuclear weapons, in \nprocessing weapons-grade uranium. They have also been developing the \nmethod for delivering nuclear weapons, the so-called Shahab-3 ballistic \nmissile. It is capable of striking Israel, U.S. troops in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, and even parts of Europe. We do not want Iran to continue \nto develop nuclear weapons.\n  We have been down this road before. And people say: Right, let's stop \nthem, let's go to the U.N., hoo-ha for the U.N. We have done hoo-ha \nwith the U.N. We have had several sanctions. We had one most recently \npassed that our administration worked very hard on, and we thank our \nallies for that. But the U.N. sanctions, though a good first step, are \nquite tepid. They are tepid because there are other members of the \nSecurity Council who want to keep doing that business with Iran. You \nmight want to do business with Iran, but Iran has no business \ndeveloping nuclear weapons.\n  The United States, therefore, has to pass these unilateral sanctions. \nThat is why I support them. It is the United States, the indispensable \nNation, that can come up with the muscle to be able to do this.\n  This is a very serious matter. If Iran continues to develop these \nweapons, it is going to destabilize the world. First of all, it \nemboldens the regime that is currently in power. That regime is no \nfriend to peace, it is no friend to stability, it is no friend to us or \nour allies.\n  Second, a nuclear Iran would destabilize pro-western Arab states. \nThose states with strong ties to the United States are apprehensive \nabout Iran continuing to develop nuclear weapons capability.\n  Also, nuclear arms and missiles could pose a major threat to the \nUnited States. A nuclear Iran would spur in the region a nuclear arms \nrace, and it would end a lot of our antiproliferation efforts.\n  These sanctions are absolutely important. I think they are very \ncreative, and I think they go right to the heart of the Iranian \nleadership's pocketbook.\n  One of the most creative aspects of this legislation is the sanctions \non Iran's petroleum industry. Iran has oil wells, but it does not have \na major refining capacity. It imports over 40 percent of its gasoline.\n  This legislation in this bill that targets refined petroleum products \nI believe could have a crippling effect. With its importation of 40 \npercent gasoline and the need for them to have enormous subsidies to \nkeep gasoline low with their population will be very effective.\n\n[[Page S5398]]\n\n  It also targets Iran's banking system. Essentially, it says it \nrequires foreign financial institutions to choose between doing \nbusiness with Iran or doing business with U.S. banks. Make your choice. \nIf you think the future lies with doing business with Iran, that is one \nview. But if you see your future doing business with U.S. banks, I \nthink the path is clear, and they will choose the safety and security \nand reliability of doing business in the United States. I also like the \nfact that it strengthens the prohibitions on activities on the nuclear \nprogram.\n\n  What was also spoken about--and I salute my colleague from Arizona \nfor also insisting on this--is the support for human rights in Iran.\n  We all remember that awful day when this wonderful, heroic young \nwoman who wanted to engage in the civic activities in her own country--\nNeda--was gunned down in her own country by her own people. Recently, I \nwatched a very telling and poignant documentary about Neda and the \ndissidents in Iran. What a wonderful group of young people there is in \nthat country. Wow, wouldn't we like to see them flourish? Wouldn't we \nlike to see a modern Iran that joins the community of nations, \npromoting peace, stability, increased literacy, and opportunity in that \ncountry?\n  I am for those human rights' people. I am not only going to mourn \nNeda as a symbol, but I think the way we can mourn Neda is to back the \npeople like her in Iran. And I really do support this human rights \nactivity by imposing travel restrictions and financial penalties on \nthose who crack down on human rights in Iran.\n  Some countries on the Security Council, as I said, are more concerned \nabout their relationships with Iran for investment purposes. We have to \nstart thinking about investing in the safety and stability of the \nworld.\n  I urge the passage of this Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Act, and I \nsay this is a good and important step. And those who vote for it--and \nwe are going to do it on a bipartisan basis because when we do that, we \ngovern the best--are also going to have to stand ready to really have a \nvery muscular and aggressive approach to the enforcement of these \nsanctions.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to minimize the opportunity for Iran to continue to get its \nnuclear weapons and to practice its denial and deception, to promote a \nfree and open Iran, to stand with the dissidents, and to promote human \nrights. Let's look for a more modern Iran in the 21st century. They \nhave a great history. I want them to have a great future and to join \nthe community of nations in a nonproliferation environment and work for \nthe good of us all.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Maryland \non her good remarks and her continued advocacy for human rights \nthroughout the world.\n  I rise to speak on behalf of the legislation before us--the Iran \nSanctions Accountability and Divestment Act. It has been a long time in \nthe works, and a lot of Members and staff have put a tremendous amount \nof work into it, and I appreciate that commitment. This is an important \npiece of legislation. It comes at a critically important time.\n  Despite a year and a half of engagement, the Iranian Government \ncontinues to respond to the President's outstretched hand with an \nunclenched fist. The regime continues to support terrorism and violent \nIslamic extremist groups that are destabilizing governments and \nsocieties in the region. It continues to race toward a nuclear weapons \ncapability, in full violation of its international agreements and \ncontrary to the repeated demands of the community of civilized nations. \nBeyond all of this, the Iranian regime, now more than ever, continues \nto brutalize and oppress its own people, denying them their most basic \nhuman rights.\n  This bill represents the most powerful sanctions ever imposed by the \nCongress on the Government of Iran. It will target industries--\nespecially Iran's energy sector--that help to sustain the Iranian \nregime's pursuit of nuclear weapons. The bill will create significant \nnew incentives for multinational companies to divest from the Iranian \neconomy. Because of this legislation, we will be posing a choice to \ncompanies around the world: Do you want to do business with Iran or do \nyou want to do business with the United States? We don't think that is \nmuch of a choice, but we will force companies to make it. They can't \nhave it both ways.\n  I didn't wish to confine our sanctions efforts only to those persons \nin Iran who threaten our security and that of our allies. I also wanted \nto bring the full force of America's economic power to bear against \nthose in Iran who threaten that country's peaceful human rights and \ndemocracy advocates. That is why, earlier this year, my good friend \nSenator Joe Lieberman and I joined with a broad bipartisan group of \nSenators to cosponsor legislation to create a new regime of targeted \nsanctions against human rights abusers in Iran. The provisions of our \nlegislation have been included in this comprehensive sanctions \nlegislation, and I would like to thank the conferees and the leaders of \nboth parties for agreeing to include it.\n  Our part of this comprehensive sanctions bill has two parts:\n  First, it will require the President to compile a public list of \nindividuals in Iran who--starting with the fraudulent Presidential \nelection last June--are responsible for or complicit in human rights \nviolations against Iranian citizens and their families no matter where \nin the world those abuses occur. It doesn't matter whether these \nindividuals are officials in the Iranian Government or serving as their \nagents in paramilitary groups and other bands of thugs; we will find \nand uncover them all. I want to stress that this will be a public list, \nposted for all the world to see on the Web sites of the State \nDepartment and Treasury Department. We will shine a light on Iran's \nhuman rights abusers. We will publish their names and their faces, and \nwe will make them famous for their crimes.\n  Second, this bill will then ban these Iranian human rights abusers \nfrom receiving visas and impose on them the full battery of sanctions \nunder the International Emergency Economic Powers Act--that means \nfreezing any assets and blocking any property they hold under U.S. \njurisdiction and ending all of their financial transactions with U.S. \nbanks and other entities. These provisions mark the first time the U.S. \nGovernment has ever imposed punitive measures against persons in Iran \nbecause of their human rights violations. In short, under this \nlegislation, Iranian human rights abusers will be completely cut off \nfrom the global reach of the U.S. financial system, and that will send \na powerful signal to every country, company, and bank in the world that \nthey should think twice about doing business with the oppressors of the \nIranian people.\n  It also sends an unequivocal and powerful message to the people in \nIran who are demonstrating and working peacefully for their human \nrights that we share their interests and their struggles. We are not \nsimply focused on the regime's nuclear program, although that remains a \nkey concern, nor are we solely focused on the regime's support for \nterrorism, although that too remains a high priority. We are also \nmaking the human rights of Iran's people an equal priority of our \ngovernment.\n  Now more than ever, it is urgent and essential that we support the \npeaceful aspirations of the Iranian people. One year ago, the \nconventional wisdom in the West held that the prospect for political \nevolution in Iran was dim and distant. But, as it often is, that \nconventional wisdom was utterly wrong. After the Iranian people were \ndenied their right to a free and fair election, the world watched in \nawe as a sea of protestors--by some estimates, as many as 3 million \nIranians--swelled in the streets all around the country. Ordinary \nIranians realized they could not remain neutral in the struggle for \nhuman rights in their country, and they became part of it. As a result, \nhistory was made before our very eyes. One year ago, democratic change \nin Iran looked rather improbable. Just 1 week later, it looked \nvirtually inevitable.\n  Unfortunately, the ensuing crackdown has been and continues to be as \nswift as it is brutal. Peaceful protestors have been attacked in the \nstreets by masked agents of the Iranian regime, then dragged away to \nthe\n\n[[Page S5399]]\n\ndarkest corners of cruelty. Many have been raped and worse. Many of \nIran's best and brightest have been forced to flee in fear from the \nland they love and to seek asylum in places such as Iraq and Turkey, \nwhere they remain today as refugees. We have all read the desperate \npleas of terrorized Iranians as they shout for help through whatever \ncracks they continue to try to make in Iran's government-censored \nInternet. And, of course, on June 20 of last year, the entire world \nwatched as a young woman named Neda bled to death in the streets of \nTehran. On that day, I believe we witnessed the beginning of the end of \nthis offensive government in Iran.\n  The past year's events have demonstrated the true character of Iran's \npeople: proud, talented, the stewards of a great culture, eager to \nengage with the world, and relentless in their quest for justice--and a \nnation that should be a natural ally of the United States.\n  The past year's events have also highlighted the true character of \nthe Iranian regime: a violent and militarized tyranny, self-serving and \nunconcerned with the welfare of Iran's people, with no shred of \nlegitimacy left to justify its rule.\n  Anymore, we cannot separate the behavior of Iran's government from \nits character. After all, is it any wonder that a regime that has no \nregard whatsoever for the rights, the dignity, the very lives of its \nown people would also show the same blatant disregard for its own \ninternational agreements, for the sovereignty and security of its \nneighbors, and for the responsibilities of all civilized nations? And \nis it any wonder that this Iranian regime has been and will always be \nuncompromising in its pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability--not just \nbecause it would be a source of power in the world but perhaps more \nimportantly because it would be a source of safety and survival for its \ncorrupt, unjust system at home.\n  My friends, I believe that when we consider the many threats and \ncrimes of Iran's Government, we are led to one inescapable conclusion: \nIt is the character of this Iranian regime, not just its behavior, that \nis the deeper threat to peace and freedom in our world and in Iran. \nFurthermore, I believe it will only be a change in the Iranian regime \nitself--a peaceful change, chosen by and led by the people of Iran--\nthat could finally produce the changes we seek in Iran's policy.\n  Even now, though, we hear it said again that Iran's democratic \nopposition has been beaten into submission. And I would not deny that a \nregime such as this one, which knows no limits to its ruthlessness, \nwill achieve many of its goals for now. But when Iran's rulers are too \nafraid of their own people to tolerate even routine public \ndemonstrations on regime holidays, as they recently have been, that is \nnot a government that is succeeding. It is a cabal of criminals who \nunderstand that their morally bankrupt regime is now on the wrong side \nof Iranian history.\n  The question we must answer is, What side of Iranian history are we \non? We must also ask ourselves another question: Is the goal of our \nsanctions and those of our friends and allies to persuade Iran's rulers \nto finally sit down and negotiate in good faith, to stop pursuing \nnuclear weapons, supporting terrorism, and abusing their own people? I \ntruly hope this is possible, but that assumption seems totally at odds \nwith the character of this Iranian regime.\n  For that reason, I would suggest a different goal: to mobilize our \nfriends and allies and like-minded countries, both in the public sphere \nand the private sector, to challenge the legitimacy of this Iranian \nregime and to support Iran's people in changing the character of their \ngovernment--peacefully, politically, on their own terms, and in their \nown ways.\n  Of course, the United States should never provide its support where \nit is unrequested and unwanted, but when young Iranian demonstrators \nwrite their banners of protest in English, when they chant ``Obama, \nObama, are you with us or are you with them?'' that is a pretty good \nindication that we can do more, and should do more, to support their \njust cause.\n  We need to stand up for the Iranian people. We need to make their \ngoals our goals, their interests our interests, their work our work. We \nneed a grand national undertaking to broadcast information freely into \nIran and to help Iranians access the tools to evade their government's \ncensorship of the Internet. We need to name and shame, pressure and \neven penalize any company that sells Iran's government the tools it \nuses to oppress its people and block their access to information. We \nneed to let the political prisoners in Iran's gruesome gulags know they \nare not alone, that their names and their cases are known to us and \nthat we will hold their torturers and tormenters accountable for their \ncrimes.\n  Finally, we need the administration to use the new authorities this \nbill creates to impose crippling sanctions on Iranian human rights \nabusers--to go after their assets, their ability to travel, and their \naccess to the international financial system.\n  If there were ever any doubt, the birth of the Green Movement over \nthe past year should convince us that Iran will have a democratic \nfuture. That future may be delayed for a while, but it will not be \ndenied. Now is the time for the United States to position ourselves \nsquarely on the right side of Iranian history. The Green Movement lives \non. Its struggle endures, and I am confident that eventually--maybe not \ntomorrow or next year or even the year after that--eventually Iranians \nwill achieve the democratic changes they seek for their country. The \nIranian regime may appear intimidating now, but it is rotting inside. \nIt has only brute force and fear to sustain it, and Iranians won't be \nafraid forever.\n  I am pleased we have finally finished this important piece of \nlegislation. I am pleased it contains tough, targeted human rights \nsanctions. I urge my colleagues on a bipartisan basis to pass this \nbill.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the Senate has now turned its attention \nto the conference report on the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions \nAccountability and Divestment Act of 2010.\n  It is a very significant piece of legislation, an excellent \nconference report that holds some hope of being effective and as \nimportant as anything. It is totally bipartisan which, as we know, does \nnot happen here every day. It speaks to the unity of Members of \nCongress and the American people on the threat represented by the \nnuclear weapons development program of Iran.\n  More than a year ago, Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, Senator Evan Bayh, \nand I joined to introduce the Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions Act. \nOver the course of last year, more than three-quarters of the Members \nof the Senate decided to cosponsor our bill. The core provisions of \nthat legislation have now been incorporated into this conference \nreport. To me that means that today, as a body, we have the opportunity \nto reaffirm the overwhelming bipartisan support for Iran sanctions that \nexists in Congress and, by doing so, send an unambiguous and united \nmessage of determination and strength to the fanatical anti-American \nregime in Tehran.\n  It was my privilege to serve on the conference committee that \nproduced the legislation that is before us. This bill, when enacted, \nwill be the most powerful and comprehensive package of sanctions \nagainst the current regime in Iran that has ever been passed by \nCongress. I am tremendously grateful to the leadership of the \nconference cochairs, beginning with my senior colleague and dear friend \nfor so long, Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and, on the House \nside, a great legislator and leader, Congressman Howard Berman of \nCalifornia. These two guided this critically important legislation to \nthe point we are at now, which is the verge of passage by both Houses \nof Congress.\n  I also want to say how grateful I am to the majority and Republican \nleaders of the Senate, Senators Reid and McConnell, for their steadfast \nbipartisan leadership in ensuring we adopt this time-sensitive \nlegislation as soon as possible. Particularly, the goal was before July \n4. I hope and believe the Senate will pass this legislation today, and \nthe House of Representatives will do the same shortly thereafter, maybe \neven before. I also hope and believe President Obama will then sign the \nbill into law.\n  Just as importantly, it is critical that the Obama administration \nforcefully and proactively implement the provisions of this legislation \nonce it becomes law. The measures imposed by\n\n[[Page S5400]]\n\nthis conference report, together with the sanctions adopted at the \nUnited Nations and by like-minded nations, including particularly our \nallies in Europe and around the world, offer our last best hope of \npeacefully preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability \nand thereby making our world much more dangerous than it is today. The \nstakes for our security are great, and time is of the essence.\n  It is also critical that the Obama administration quickly makes use \nof these new authorities provided by this legislation, particularly the \nnew authority to cut off foreign banks from the U.S. financial system, \nif they continue doing business with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard \nCorps, its front companies, and designated Iranian banks. We are, in \nthis legislation, when implemented, giving foreign banks a choice. Do \nthey want to do business in the United States or do they want to \ncontinue to do business with the fanatical regime in Iran? Our \ngovernment must investigate and then impose sanctions--and I will use \nSecretary Clinton's words, ``crippling sanctions''--on those foreign \ncompanies that prop up the Iranian regime by continuing to invest in \nits energy sector or by exporting refined petroleum products to Iran.\n  This legislation gives the administration a strong new opportunity to \nmake clear also that America is on the side of the Iranian people, the \nbrave Iranian people who are struggling against the repressive regime \nin Tehran. What the administration can do is use the new authority it \nis given in this legislation to publicly identify those individuals in \nthe Iranian Government responsible for perpetrating human rights \nviolations in Iran since the June 12, 2009 election and holding those \npeople accountable for those abuses through targeted sanctions.\n  It is always important to remember--and we have seen this throughout \nhistory--that a nation that represses the rights of its own people is \nmuch more likely to be a nation that will be a danger to the people and \ncountries in its neighborhood and, with modern weapons, \nintercontinental ballistic missiles, nuclear weapons, ultimately, the \npeople of the entire world.\n  I am pleased that this provision on human rights in Iran is in this \nsanctions legislation, because I believe history has shown that \nAmerica's foreign policy is always at its best and most effective when \nwe are true to the fundamental human values that defined our Nation at \nits birth and at our best ever since--the self-evident truth that all \npeople are created equal and endowed by our Creator with those equal \nrights to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The people of \nIran are denied those rights by their own government. We are saying in \nthis legislation that that ought to be also, as well as the support of \ntheir nuclear weapons program, a sanctionable offense.\n  I hope and pray the combined sanctions--U.N., EU, and now U.S.--will \nchange the mindset, the calculations of the Iranian regime. But we must \nalso recognize that every day that passes brings Iran closer to the \npoint of nuclear no return and greatly increases the danger and \ninsecurity throughout the Middle East and throughout the world. With \nevery day that passes, the Iranians enrich more uranium and their \nstockpile of fissile material grows. Ultimately, we must do whatever is \nnecessary to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons capability.\n  Almost everybody--really everybody I have heard speak on this \nsubject--regardless of party or position in the American Government, \nmakes that statement. It is unacceptable to the United States and the \nworld for Iran--this fanatical state, this rogue state--to acquire \nnuclear weapons capability, and we must do whatever is necessary to \nprevent this from happening--through peaceful and diplomatic means, if \nwe possibly can; through military force, if we absolutely must.\n  Iran must not be allowed to become a nuclear power. That is the \nbottom line. That is precisely why I am so grateful and proud and \nhopeful, as we take up and--I am confident--adopt this conference \nreport and this legislation today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the conference report before us today \nattempts to deal with one of the most important and difficult national \nsecurity challenges we face: the Islamic Republic of Iran--a country \nwhose leaders disregard international norms, abuse the rights of their \nown people, support terrorist groups, and threaten regional and global \nstability.\n  Iran's continued refusal to be open and transparent about its nuclear \nprogram jeopardizes the security of its neighbors and other countries \nin the Middle East. There is a strong, bipartisan determination in this \nCongress to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. President Obama \nhas focused considerable effort towards that goal. He has said ``the \nlong-term consequences of a nuclear-armed Iran are unacceptable'' and \nthat he doesn't ``take any options off the table with respect to \nIran.'' I support that view, and if Iran pursues a nuclear weapon, all \noptions, including military options, should be on the table.\n  The United States and the international community remain committed to \ntrying to solve these especially difficult problems peacefully. The \nadministration has sought through a variety of means to engage the \ngovernment of Iran and make clear the benefits to their nation and its \npeople if Iran complies with international norms. Through six U.N. \nSecurity Council resolutions, the latest passed just this month, along \nwith numerous U.S. laws and executive orders, the United States has \nsought, unilaterally and with our international partners, to persuade \nIran to abide by its international obligations. The goal of all these \nactions has been to make Iran understand in practical terms the \nconsequences of its actions.\n  So far, Iran has refused to listen. That is why the conference report \nwe consider today is so important. If we are to resolve our differences \nwith Iran, hopefully without resorting to military action, we must \nexhaust every opportunity to make clear, without any room for doubt, \nthe price Iran will pay for its continued violations of U.N. \nresolutions.\n  The measure before us will sanction Iran for its willful misbehavior, \nand it will penalize multinational firms that support Iran. More \nspecifically, it will sanction firms that sell Iran refined petroleum \nor refining products, or goods, services or information that help it \ndevelop its energy sector; ban U.S. banks from transacting with foreign \nfinancial institutions that do business with Iran's Islamic \nRevolutionary Guard Corps, an organization that combines a key \ncomponent of Iran's military establishment with an extensive business \nempire that represses Iran's citizens; broaden sanctions available \nunder the Iran Sanctions Act by adding to the menu of available \nsanctions a ban on access to foreign exchange in the United States, a \nban on access to the U.S. financial sector and a ban on U.S. property \ntransactions; ban companies that assist Iran in blocking the free flow \nof information or restricting its citizens' freedom of speech from \ncontracting with the U.S. Government, and require that companies \nbidding on U.S. Government contracts certify that they and their \nsubsidiaries do not engage in sanctionable conduct; and strengthen the \nU.S. trade embargo against Iran by putting into law longstanding \nexecutive orders and limiting the goods exempted from the embargo.\n  While passage of this conference report--just like the U.N. Security \nCouncil's passage of Resolution 1929 on Iran--is important, it is \ncritical that this law be implemented vigorously. It also will be \ncritical that the U.N. panel created by Security Council Resolution \n1929 is active in its efforts to identify non-compliance of any U.N. \nmember states. Iran's continued unwillingness to disclose fully and \ncompletely information about its nuclear program surely means that Iran \nis either pursuing a nuclear weapon or preserving options to develop a \nnuclear weapon. It is only from full implementation of this law and \npressure from the international community that Iran may be dissuaded \nfrom this course.\n  The measures contained in this conference report would exact a real \nprice from Iran for its continuing threats to international peace and \nsecurity. Only by forcing Iran to pay such a price, and by penalizing \nthe abettors of Iran's actions in violation of U.N. resolutions, can we \nbring Iran into compliance with its responsibilities under \ninternational law and human rights standards.\n\n[[Page S5401]]\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today, Congress takes an important and \nforceful step to address one of our most serious national security \nchallenges to America and our allies. A nuclear armed Iran would pose \nan intolerable threat to our ally Israel, risk igniting an arms race in \nwhat is already one of the world's most dangerous regions, and \nundermine our global effort to halt the spread of nuclear weapons.\n  These steps to increase pressure are necessary because Iran continues \nto defy the international community, the International Atomic Energy \nAgency, and the U.N. Security Council. Iran's publicly disclosed stocks \nat its Natanz enrichment facility now include more than 2,400 kilograms \nof reactor-grade low enriched uranium. It is especially troubling that \nIran has recently begun enriching small quantities of uranium to a \nconcentration of around 20 percent, crossing yet another nuclear \nthreshold.\n  That is why, as part of a comprehensive and international effort to \npersuade Iran to alter its current dangerous course, we in Congress \nhave worked together to pass tough new sanctions that will increase the \ncost that Iran must pay for its continued defiance. In particular, this \nlegislation targets businesses involved in refined petroleum sales to \nIran, support for Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, and Iran's nuclear \nprogram. It imposes strong penalties on those in the Iranian government \nwho have abused the rights of their own people. It tightens the \nenforcement of those sanctions already on the books. And it takes \nimportant steps to ensure that companies receiving U.S. Government \ncontracts are not also doing business that enables, directly or \nindirectly, Iran's nuclear program.\n  This cannot be an American effort alone and, thankfully, it isn't. \nOur own efforts are now joined by U.N. Security Council Resolution \n1929, as well as a range of follow-on efforts from European and other \nallies. It is very important that we work to ensure that all of these \nefforts are coordinated into a comprehensive strategy--and I am \nconfident that we have done so.\n  As we implement these new sanctions, expanding and preserving a \nmuscular international effort must remain a priority. The joint \nexplanatory statement accompanying the act suggests that, before \nexercising the 4(c)(B) waiver, a determination of sanctionability must \nbe made. We understand that some may believe that the closely \ncooperating waiver may be available without a determination having been \nmade. While different from the views in the joint explanatory \nstatement, we accept that this may be a fair reading of the obligations \nunder section 4(c)(B).\n  In the face of a serious threat, Congress has put aside bipartisan \ndivisions to act decisively. Even as we negotiated the details, we were \nunited by a common goal: to bring maximum leverage to bear on Iran to \nchange its behavior and abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions.\n  It is important to note that the President's willingness to explore a \ndiplomatic solution is a crucial reason why today it is Iran--not those \nwho seek to pressure Iran--who is isolated. Recent experience suggests \nthat neither sanctions nor engagement alone will convince Iran to \nabandon its nuclear program. Only by combining both pressure and \ndiplomacy into a comprehensive and coordinated strategy will we have a \nchance at altering Iran's behavior.\n  Finally, we do not seek to punish the people of Iran, but to persuade \nthe Iranian regime to do what is in their best interests and the \nworld's. These sanctions bring us one step closer to peacefully \nresolving this grave threat.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nconference agreement on H.R. 2194, the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, \nAccountability, and Divestment Act of 2010.\n  Through both its actions and statements, the government of Iran has \nproved itself to be a destabilizing and dangerous regime in an already \nvolatile region. The Iranian government's ongoing uranium enrichment \nprogram, its deplorable human rights record, and its material support \nof terrorist organizations dictate that we confront the threat it poses \nto the world.\n  Two weeks ago, the United Nations Security Council voted to approve a \nfourth round of sanctions against Iran, and I commend President Obama \nand his Administration for working with our partners at the U.N. to \nsend a powerful message about the willingness of the global community \nto stand firmly in the face of Iranian aggression. However, the specter \nof an Iran which has the fissile materials necessary to fuel a nuclear \nweapon is too great a threat to leave entirely to multilateral \ninstitutions. The United States and other concerned nations must \nbuttress the U.N. Security Council's actions individually to ensure \nmaximum pressure on the Iranian government.\n  That is why I am proud to vote today in support of the conference \nagreement on the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and \nDivestment Act. The bill before us would impose new economic penalties \nagainst foreign companies that sell Iran goods and services that assist \nit in developing its energy sector, and it would give the President the \ntools to hold accountable those entities linked to Iran's brutal \nIslamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, its illicit nuclear program, or its \nsupport for terrorism.\n  By broadening the categories of transactions that trigger sanctions \nand increasing the number of sanctions available to the President, this \nlegislation will bolster our diplomatic efforts by targeting the \nIranian regime at its weakest point: its economy, which is still highly \ndependent on its petroleum sector.\n  Lastly, while this legislation represents a vital step forward in our \nefforts to constrain the Iranian government's hostile policies, it is \nabsolutely crucial that this Congress work closely with the \nadministration to make certain these new tools are implemented and \napplied effectively to achieve our objectives. Many of our global \npartners maintain trade and investment ties with the Iranian regime, \nand I implore the President and the Secretary of State to utilize this \nmonth's growing momentum to ensure the global community is speaking \nwith one voice when it comes to preventing the rise of a nuclear Iran.\n  I am proud to join my colleagues in the Senate in passing the \nComprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act, and I \nam hopeful this will send a compelling message to the rest of the world \nas the global community works together to halt Iran's uranium \nenrichment program.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in strong support of \nthe conference report to accompany the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, \nAccountability, and Divestment Act. I want to thank my colleagues, \nChairman Dodd, and House Foreign Affairs Chairman Howard Berman and \nRanking Member Ileana Ros-Lehtinen for working cooperatively to \ncomplete work on this conference report.\n  There is general agreement that the existing Iran Sanctions Act has \nnot worked either in practice or in its intent to stop Iran's nuclear \nprogram or its support of terror. Iran, today, is a more dangerous \nrogue state than ever before.\n  Though not a silver bullet, the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, \nAccountability, and Divestment Act is undoubtedly one of the toughest \nsanctions measures that Congress has produced and promises to be more \neffective than current law.\n  The act continues to prohibit investments of $20 million in Iran's \nenergy sector, but now we have closed an earlier investment loophole \nthat allowed for sales of petroleum-related goods, services, and \ntechnology to Iran.\n  The act also broadens the categories of transactions that trigger \nsanctions to include sales to Iran of refined petroleum products and \nprohibits any assistance to Iran to either increase or maintain its \ndomestic refining capacity.\n  In addition to the existing menu of six sanctions, we have \nestablished three new sanctions on foreign exchange, access to the U.S. \nbanking system, and against property transactions. Under current law, \nthe President must choose two from a menu of six sanctions. He now must \nimpose at least three of the nine sanctions.\n  Despite dozens of credible reports of investment violations over \nsuccessive administrations, there has been but one Presidential \ndetermination of a violation made 12 years ago. In that particular \ninstance, the President waived the imposition of sanctions.\n\n[[Page S5402]]\n\n  This act will put an end to that practice. The sanctions regime will \nnow require the President to investigate a report of sanctionable \nactivity and make a determination whether a violation has occurred. \nThat determination must be reported to Congress and if a violation has \noccurred, the President must impose sanctions or give the specific \nreasons why a waiver of the sanctions is necessary. Prior law merely \nauthorized a President to investigate. It did not require a President \nto investigate or make a determination if he chose to investigate.\n  A brand new mandatory financial sanction imposes severe restrictions \non foreign banks doing business with Iranian banks or the IRGC--Iranian \nRevolutionary Guard Corps--and its affiliates, which are increasingly \nseen to command vital sectors of the Iranian economy.\n  The act also establishes a legal framework for States and local \ngovernments and a safe harbor for fund managers to divest their \nportfolios of foreign companies involved in Iran's energy sector. We \nhave also created a system to address black market diversion of \nsensitive technologies to Iran through other countries.\n  In order to accommodate the President's constitutional authorities in \nthe conduct of foreign affairs, we have had to preserve the prior \nconstruct of waivers and exceptions to these sanctions throughout the \nact. We have tried, however, to give the President as narrow an opening \nas possible for diplomatic delays. Even though the window for delay \nremains slightly open, this legislation is a vast improvement over \nprior law, and ensures that the President must make a determination to \nimpose sanctions or provide Congress with a timely and written \nrationale for any delays or waivers.\n  During the conference process, the administration insisted that we \ninclude a so-called closely cooperating countries exemption. Such an \nexemption would spare a country and its firms from any public risk to \nreputation and imposition of sanctions because an exemption, as opposed \nto a waiver, allows the country in question to avoid the specter of an \ninvestigation altogether.\n  Instead, an already existing waiver for countries that cooperate with \nthe United States in multilateral efforts to prevent Iran from \nacquiring nuclear weapons technology was modified to give a country and \nits firms, on a case-by-case basis, more time to cure their behavior.\n  This waiver for cooperation can only be used, however, after the \nPresident first initiates an investigation, makes his determination \nwhether sanctionable activity exists, and then certifies to Congress \nwho would get the waiver. He must then explain exactly what actions \nthat particular government is taking to cooperate with multilateral \nefforts and why the waiver is ``vital to the national security \ninterests of the United States.''\n  Once enacted, this law will allow the Treasury Department to put key \ncompanies and countries on notice that the clock is running, \ninvestigations are to begin immediately, and there is little room to \navoid determinations of potential violations. In other words, there is \nno place left to hide.\n  Once again, nothing that we have done in this conference report will \ncurb Iran's nuclear ambitions. But, targeting Iran's oil and gas \nsectors will certainly raise the stakes for Iran's leaders, perhaps \nenough for them to consider confining their nuclear ambitions to \npeaceful uses.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe conference report on the Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions Act.\n  This conference report expands sanctions authorized by the Iranian \nSanctions Act of 1996 to foreign companies who sell Iran refined \npetroleum, support Iran's domestic refining capacity or sell Iran \ngoods, services, or know-how that assist it in developing its energy \nsector; bans U.S. banks from engaging in financial transactions with \nforeign banks who do business with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards \nCorps or facilitate Iran's nuclear program and its support for \nterrorism; establishes three new sanctions the President may impose on \nviolators of the Iranian Sanctions Act and requires the President to \nimpose at least three of nine possible sanctions authorized by that \nact; bans U.S. government procurement contracts to companies that \nexport technology to Iran that inhibits the free flow of information; \nand authorizes States and local governments to divest from companies \ninvolved in Iran's energy sector.\n  The sanctions will terminate when the President certifies to Congress \nthat Iran is no longer a state-sponsor of terrorism and has ceased \nefforts to acquire nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and \nballistic missiles and technology.\n  Let me be clear: I am deeply concerned about Iran's uranium \nenrichment program and its refusal to abide by United Nations Security \nCouncil resolutions calling on Tehran to cease its activities and, once \nand for all, come clean about its nuclear program.\n  A nuclear Iran would represent a serious threat to the security of \nthe United States, Israel, and the international community.\n  The question is, What is the best way to convince Iran to abandon its \nuranium enrichment program?\n  During the previous administration, the United States sat on the \nsidelines and refused to talk to Iran.\n  We let the United Kingdom, France, and Germany do the hard work of \nnegotiating with Tehran as we remained silent.\n  And it got us nowhere. Iran's uranium enrichment program accelerated \nand became more advanced.\n  We had to try a different approach.\n  I strongly supported the Obama administration's decision to break \nwith this past and pursue a robust, diplomatic initiative with Iran.\n  I am disappointed we have not made more progress. Indeed, Iran has \ntaken steps in the wrong direction.\n  A new, secret enrichment facility at Qom was uncovered.\n  Iran refused to accept a U.S.-Russian proposal to ship its low \nenriched uranium to Russia and France for further processing for \nmedical isotopes.\n  And it continues to drag its feet on revealing to the International \nAtomic Energy Agency the full extent of its nuclear program.\n  But the commitment this administration made to diplomacy gave us the \nleverage we needed to secure the backing for a fourth round of \nsanctions at the United Nations Security Council.\n  There was no question that China and Russia were skeptical about \nadditional sanctions.\n  Securing their support and maintaining the support of our allies \nrequired principled, sustained, and deft diplomacy and I congratulate \nthe administration for its success.\n  Yet I recognize that the U.N. resolution could have been stronger and \nthat unilateral action, such as the sanctions included in this \nlegislation, will complement the U.N. efforts.\n  And that is why I support passage of this legislation.\n  Nevertheless, I believe it is critical for the United States to \ncontinue to pursue the diplomacy track.\n  We must develop a ``Plan B'' to deal with the possibility that Iran's \nnuclear ambitions progress.\n  Iran has been able to withstand previous sanctions initiatives and \nthere is no guarantee that this latest round will be more effective.\n  We know that China and Russia are unlikely to support tougher \nmeasures at this time.\n  Military action is not a ``Plan B''. A strike would likely only \ndelay, not destroy, Iran's nuclear program and lead to more violence \nand instability in the region.\n  In my view, we must use the passage of the latest U.N. Security \nCouncil resolution and passage of this legislation as an opportunity to \nreach out to Tehran again on a fresh diplomatic initiative, not just on \nthe nuclear program but on other issues where we can find some level of \ncommon ground and avenues of cooperation.\n  Two months ago I had lunch with Iran's ambassador to the United \nNations, Mohammad Khazaee, and I was struck by the lack of trust and \nunderstanding between our two countries.\n  If we can find ways to build that trust, we may be able to secure \nprogress on the most intractable issues.\n  As chair of the Caucus on International Narcotics Control, I strongly \nsuggest that cooperation on counternarcotics efforts is a good place to \nstart.\n  For example, Iran has suffered greatly from the influx of Afghan \nopium:\n\n[[Page S5403]]\n\nbased on U.N. Office of Drugs and Crime annual assessments, \napproximately 140 tons of Afghan heroin enter Iran each year from \nAfghanistan--105 tons--and from Pakistan--35 tons; the estimated heroin \nuser population in Iran is around 400,000 individuals, consuming, at a \nrate of about 35 grams per year, almost 14 tons of heroin annually; \ndrug trafficking is considered such a major security threat that the \ngovernment has spent over US$600 million to dig ditches, build barriers \nand install barbed wire to stop well-armed drug convoys from entering \nthe country; and more than 3,500 Iranian border guards have been killed \nin the past three decades by drug traffickers.\n  Given that the Iranian drug use epidemic is providing funding for the \ninsurgency in Afghanistan, it seems logical to begin a cooperative \ndialogue with Iran on this area of mutual concern to build trust \nbetween both sides and promote progress on other matters, particularly \nIran's nuclear program.\n  I am hopeful that the passage of this legislation will not cease \nefforts on a diplomatic solution, but open the door to finding new ways \nto build trust and understanding between Iran and the international \ncommunity.\n  There is no guarantee that we will be successful in convincing Iran \nto suspend its uranium enrichment program but we have to explore every \npossible avenue.\n  I firmly believe that we can still find a solution and work out our \ndifferences.\n  I am hopeful that this legislation will bring us closer to that goal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of this \nconference report for robust sanctions against Iran. I was proud to \nserve with, among others of my colleagues, Senator Dodd, on the \nconference committee. I want to recognize the hard work he has done to \ncreate a strong sanctions bill.\n  These sanctions, I believe, will deter the threat Iran poses to U.S. \nnational security because of its suspected nuclear weapons program. A \ncountry that has huge oil reserves clearly does not need nuclear power \nfor nuclear energy. Therefore, the difference between its stated goals \nand its actions creates, I believe, a threat to the national security \nof the United States.\n  I have been eager for today's vote. During the process of the \nconference committee, I have advocated for the strongest sanctions \npossible.\n  I believe deeply that we must apply maximum pressure to the Iranian \nregime, that it is a growing threat to the region, the world, and a \nthreat to its own people. In my view, tightening the screws on the \nIranian regime genuinely advances the cause of stability and peace in \nthe Middle East as well as our own national security. These sanctions \nare an essential means to that end.\n  I have seen what the United Nations has done, and I am glad we got \nsome multilateral response. But, in my view, they are not strong \nenough. That is why I think it is essential that we continue to lead \nmany of our allies, who will be more robust in their actions if we pass \nthis legislation today.\n  In my view, it is essential that we freeze the assets of Iranian \nofficials who have supported terrorism--with this legislation we will \ndo that--that we impose sanctions against companies that engage in oil-\nrelated business with the Iranian regime--and with this legislation we \nwill do that--that we monitor Iran's usage of energy-related resources \nother than refined petroleum, especially ethanol, to ensure Iran is not \nallowed to replace its current petroleum needs with ethanol which \nwould, in essence, severely undercut the intent behind these sanctions. \nSo I am glad we have pushed for language that will follow that.\n  We need the ban on trade with Iran to be strong, to be significant, \nand to be airtight. We need to press the Iranian Government to respect \nits citizens' human rights and freedoms, to identify Iranian officials \nresponsible for violating those rights and impose financial penalties \nand travel restrictions on these human rights abusers.\n  We need to prohibit the U.S. Government from contracting with those \ncompanies that export communication-jamming or monitoring technology to \nIran. We simply cannot allow the regime to restrict communications \nbetween Iranians and between Iran and the outside world as happened \nduring the postelection protests.\n  We clearly see there is a desire among the average Iranians to be \nable to change the nature of their lives. We saw those willing to risk \ntheir freedom, willing to risk their lives. We cannot have the U.S. \nGovernment contracting with those companies that export communication-\njamming or monitoring technology to Iran that in essence allows the \nregime to do exactly that.\n  We need to ban trade with Iran with exceptions for the export of \nfood, medicines, humanitarian aid, and the exchange of informational \nmaterials.\n  There is something I included in the Senate bill before it went to \nconference, and I am glad to see it is largely still in the legislation \nwe will vote on today. We needed targeted sanctions against the Iranian \nRevolutionary Guard Corps, its supporters and affiliates, and any \nforeign governments that provide the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps \nwith support.\n  I am pleased to see this report will ban U.S. banks from engaging in \nfinancial transactions with foreign banks that do business with the \nRevolutionary Guard or facilitate Iran's illicit nuclear program. The \nRevolutionary Guard has now spread like a cancer throughout Iranian \nsociety, and it is involved in almost everything in Iran. We need to \nspecifically target the IRGC, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, \nand this legislation does that.\n  The robust sanctions against the Iranian regime that I will vote for \ntoday, and that I helped fashion, are a positive and necessary step to \nincrease pressure on Iran so the regime fully understands the world \nwill not only not tolerate its deceit and deception any longer, but it \ncannot tolerate its march to nuclear power and ultimately nuclear \nweapons. I will vote for these sanctions because they are robust, \nbecause they are in our national security interests and in the \ninterests of the region and the world.\n  I hope my colleagues, on a strong bipartisan basis, will join in \ncasting similar votes because when we do, we send a message, No. 1, to \nthe administration that there is, I hope, near unanimous support for \nthe type of sanctions we are advocating that strengthens the hand of \nthe President as he deals with other countries in the world, as he \ndeals in the international forum, and it sends a clear message to \nAhmadinejad that the United States is serious about stopping its march \nto nuclear weaponry.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to share my concerns as \nwell about Iran and to express my support for tough sanctions against \nIran. Iran poses a threat to the United States as well as to the \ninternational community. It continues to support terrorist \norganizations around the world, including Hamas and Hezbollah. Iran has \nalso called for the destruction of the democratic State of Israel. \nThese actions illustrate Iran's destructive intentions.\n  Iran continues to pursue nuclear capabilities. While Iran claims its \nnuclear programs are intended for civilian use only, this is very \ndifficult to believe. In fact, reports from the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency of February of 2008 and May of 2010 question Iran's claim \nof pursuing nuclear capabilities for purely peaceful purposes. Nuclear \ncapabilities and proper management of these capabilities is a serious \nresponsibility. Iran has neither earned the right nor the trust for \nthis nuclear responsibility.\n  Iran continues to develop its nuclear programs without giving the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency sufficient access, access to and \ninformation regarding its nuclear program. I understand the need for \nenergy and the complexities surrounding the dual use nature of nuclear \ntechnology. However, Iran placed itself under obligations to the \ninternational community and agreed to comply with international \nsafeguards and inspections.\n  Iran has not fulfilled its commitments. It has not fulfilled its \ncommitment to be transparent with the International Atomic Energy \nAgency or to maintain obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation \nTreaty.\n  Iran does not want to join the international community efforts on \ncurbing\n\n[[Page S5404]]\n\nthe development of nuclear weapons. I believe without serious \nconsequences for the proliferation activities there is little if any \nincentive for Iran or any other country considering nuclear weapon-\nrelated activities to refrain from doing so. So I believe it is \nimperative that the United States work to increase comprehensive \neconomic sanctions on Iran.\n  The United States and the international community continue to \nthreaten Iran with more sanctions. On June 9, the U.N. Security Council \nadopted resolution 1929. This represents the fourth round of sanctions \nagainst Iran from the international community. It is past time that \nthis Congress act, act to put teeth into our threats of additional \nsanctions. I believe it is time today to implement economic sanctions \nto the full extent possible.\n  Iran's leaders must be forced to realize that while they may be able \nto survive political isolation, they cannot ignore the adverse \nconsequences to their ability to function in a global economy.\n  I believe the status quo is not working in our dealings with Iran. I \ndo not believe Iran is a country that we can quietly watch and hope \nthat nothing serious is happening behind closed doors. Terrorism does \nnot allow anyone to do so. It is time to act, and I call upon this \nCongress to support economic sanctions against Iran.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent that the time in the quorum \ncall be equally divided between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I think I have 10 minutes. Is that right? \nWould the Chair advise me when 10 minutes expires?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I take the floor today in support of the conference \nreport that has been agreed to by the conferees regarding Iran \nsanctions. I wish to compliment Senators Dodd, Shelby, Lugar, Kerry, \nLieberman and others who were involved in negotiating this compromise.\n  The Iranian sanctions bill will give the President tools he does not \nhave today that will allow us as a nation to be more forceful when it \ncomes to trying to alter Iranian behavior. I think most people in this \nbody see the Iranian regime up to no good, that the Iranian regime has \nbeen oppressing its own people, and they present a great threat in \nterms of the region and the world at large. They are one of the \ngreatest sponsors of terrorism of any nation in the world. This \nsanctions legislation, which is bipartisan, will allow the President \nmore tools. It will prevent access to foreign exchange in the United \nStates. It will prevent access to our banking system by people who do \nbusiness with Iran in unhealthy ways, and it will prevent the purchase \nof property in the United States in case the Iranians are looking for a \nplace to put their money. We are going to take our banks and our real \nestate off the table so they cannot use us to profit from their brutal \nbehavior.\n  It gives the ability to the President to waive these sanctions when \nit comes to countries that are cooperating with us. The whole goal of \nthis legislation is to empower the administration and our Nation with \ntools that would create a downside for the Iranian Government to \ncontinue to try to develop a nuclear weapon and support terrorist \norganizations.\n  I am hopeful this will have some deterrent effect. The United Nations \nis beginning to act. The European Union, Russia, and China seem to be \nmore helpful to the Obama administration. Anything we can do to help, \nwe will. The idea of trying to get Iran to change its behavior through \ninternal cooperation is a worthy idea to pursue. I hope it works.\n  Senator Schumer and I offered legislation not long ago that would \nprohibit companies that do business with the Iranian regime in the area \nempowering the regime in terms of technology to interfere with the \nInternet and stop the people of Iran from communicating with each \nother. That made it into the bill. I want to thank the conferees. What \nSenator Schumer and I came up with months ago, right after the massacre \nof the students by the Iranian regime, one of the things that led to \nthis people's revolt in Iran, was the ability to Tweeter and talk to \neach other, use the Internet. The Iranian regime has been trying to \nsuppress the ability of the Iranian people to talk to each other, and \nwe created legislation that told the international community: Any \ncompany that empowers this regime to suppress the free flow of \ninformation among the Iranian people would lose business when it came \nto American business. That made it in the bill. I hope that will help.\n  The Iranian people have had a very difficult time. The election, as \nseen by the Iranian people and the world at large, of Ahmadinejad has \nbeen, quite frankly, a fraud and a joke. About a year ago, a little \nover a year ago, a young lady captured international attention and the \nhearts and minds of the world--I think her name was Neda--who was \nkilled in the streets of Tehran. She was a beautiful young girl who had \ntaken to the streets to try to defy this regime's oppressive behavior.\n  So as we look at the world here in the middle of June regarding Iran, \nthere is a lot of hope I have that the Iranian people have turned the \ncorner in terms of what they want for their future. We need to be their \npartner in a constructive way. It is one thing to empower the people, \nit is another thing to empower the regime that oppresses the people. \nSome of the sanctions we are proposing would make life difficult for \nthe every-day Iranian, but I think they would welcome that, if it would \ngive them the ability to weaken the regime they no longer tolerate or \nsupport.\n  The sanctions route with Russia and China has potential. If the world \nwill speak with one voice and support President Obama in terms of \nmaking the consequences that the Iranian nuclear program is a support \nof terrorism unacceptable economically, including refined petroleum \nproducts, it would be good for the world at large.\n  Our friends in Israel are very concerned, as they should be, about \nthe way Iran is moving toward supporting Hezbollah and Hamas and other \norganizations that are bent on the destruction of Israel. A nuclear \nweapon in the hands of this regime would be a nightmare for the world \nat large, but it would be horrible for the State of Israel. It is my \nhope we can avoid that. I hope sanctions work. However, the world must \nunderstand that sanctions is a tool to change behavior. It is worthy of \nour time to try to change behavior with these sanctions.\n  What is unacceptable is to practice a policy of containment, to \naccept a nuclear-armed Iran and hope that we contain it. To me that is \na folly. That is a scenario that would lead to the unthinkable. If Iran \never does acquire a nuclear weapon, you are not going to contain it. \nYou are going to have a Mideast where other people want a nuclear \nweapon to hedge their bets against Iran. You will have a world where a \nregime has a nuclear weapon and could be no better friend of the \nterrorists than Iran. I think President Clinton, when I was in Israel \nwith him, spoke well of this.\n  He talked about his biggest fear if Iran got a nuclear weapon. It \nwould not be so much an attack against Israel or our allies as would be \nit falling into the hands of a terrorist organization that would use it \nagainst Israel or our allies. I think President Clinton is correct in \nbeing worried about that.\n  So this is a good day. We cannot agree on much here in Congress. We \nare in a pretty partisan environment right now. I hope that will pass \none day. But when it comes to Iranian sanctions, we\n\n[[Page S5405]]\n\ncame together as a body. We are giving tools to the administration to \nhopefully change the behavior of this regime. I am proud of our \ncolleagues who negotiated this deal with the House. I am hopeful it \nwill help.\n  I will conclude with one final thought: Whatever tools it takes to \nchange the behavior of the Iranian Government we need to keep on the \ntable, and the best tool is a peaceful tool. But if military force is \never required to change Iranian behavior, I hope that will be at least \nconsidered as the last option, not the first option. I hope we never go \ndown that road. But it may be a road you have to explore if all this \nfails.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RISCH. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncalls be equally divided between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RISCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the Iran sanctions \nconference report which I assume we will be approving in a matter of a \nfew minutes. This is a very important event in the Congress and could \nplay a very significant role in the history of our country. I support \nthe conference report. It is designated as H.R. 2194. I reiterate, I \nbelieve it is crucial that the Senate approve the conference report and \nthat the President sign it into law as soon as possible. I fully \npredict both of those things will occur.\n  Let me mention three of the most important provisions of the bill so \nwe know what it does. It deals with sanctions against Iran. There are \ntwo reasons: No. 1, to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear \ncapability, and No. 2, to support the aspirations of the people of Iran \nfor a more representative government.\n  What the bill does first is to expand the scope of existing sanctions \nagainst companies that invest in Iran's energy sector, and it includes \nmeasures to punish firms that export gasoline to Iran. We would think a \ncountry such as Iran would have plenty of gasoline, but they do not \nhave refinery capacity to create the finished product which their \npeople must use. So something on the order of at least 40 percent of \ntheir gasoline has to be imported. Because of this heavy dependence on \nimported gasoline, it is vulnerable to outside pressure, and that is \nwhy this particular sanction is an important step. By putting a squeeze \non Iran's gas supplies and dissuading energy firms from investing in \nthe country, we can hopefully force the Iranian regime to make \ndifficult decisions about its finances, thereby further increasing its \nunpopularity.\n  Second, the bill limits nuclear cooperation agreements between the \nUnited States and countries which sell illicit materials to Iran. It \nalso limits licenses under any such current agreements. A country that \nallows its citizens or companies to provide equipment or technologies \nor materials to Iran that make a material contribution to its nuclear \ncapabilities should not benefit from nuclear cooperation with the \nUnited States, and we make it clear that won't be permitted under this \nprovision.\n  The third thing the bill does is it includes the so-called McCain \nlanguage that requires the President to compile a list of Iranian \nofficials, specific people who have brutalized the Iranian people, and \nto impose sanctions against those particular individuals identified as \nhuman rights violators. The administration can use the new authority it \nis given in this legislation to publicly identify those people in the \nIranian Government who are actually responsible for perpetrating human \nrights violations in Iran since the fraudulent elections in June of \n2009. It can hold these people accountable through these targeted \nsanctions. The measure also requires that such persons be subject to \nrestrictions on financial and property transactions. It also makes such \npersons ineligible for U.S. visas.\n  We can see there is a broad array of targeted kinds of sanctions \nthat, combined, could have a significant impact on our policy with \nIran.\n  While I am pleased that the conferees concluded their work and the \nlegislation is here on the floor, I do wish to note in passing that it \nis long overdue. At the request of the administration, Congress has \nrepeatedly delayed action on bilateral sanctions legislation. Because \nsanctions take time to work, we have given up some time here.\n  In some respects, we have wasted too much time waiting for the United \nNations to finally act, as it eventually did earlier this month. The \nU.N. Security Council resolution, however, will do very little to slow \ndown or stop Iran's nuclear weapons program or even prevent its support \nfor terrorism around the world. Its provisions--the bulk of them--are \nvoluntary. They don't deal with Iran's energy sector. This is primarily \nbecause of the demand of the Chinese Government. It also excludes \nRussia's cooperation with Iran on the Bushehr powerplant as well as the \nsale by Russia of the S-300 missile system to Iran, a very modern and \neffective anti-aircraft system which could certainly play a role in \ndefending Iran against an attack on its nuclear facilities.\n  In addition, the divided vote of the Security Council displays to \nIran that the world is not united in dealing with its illicit conduct. \nIn fact, I argue that, in a way, we are in a worse position than we \nwere 18 months ago when the President started his diplomacy in dealing \nwith Iran. Up to then, all of the resolutions that had been passed \nagainst Iran had been unanimous. This one was not unanimous. In some \nrespects, we have lost ground.\n  It is clear that the President's effort to get the Iranian regime to \nnegotiate for that 18-month period did not achieve anything except \nallow the Iranians more time to develop their weaponry. The U.S. \nsanctions resolution is not going to be very effective in going any \nfurther than that, in my view, nor will the European Union add much to \nthe U.N. resolution, although they will add something.\n  Before I conclude, let me ponder for a second a question others have \nasked, which is, How important is it that we do everything we can to \nprevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon? What would happen if it \ndid acquire a nuclear weapon? What would be the big deal?\n  Imagine a world in which Iran does have a nuclear weapon. Lay aside \nthe fact that we have a picture of the Iranian leader, Ahmadinejad, \nwith a nuclear weapon and just imagine what he would do with that. \nWould it really be possible to contain a nuclear Iran using \nconventional deterrence mechanisms?\n  Some would say: We lived with a nuclear-armed Soviet Union for four \ndecades. It worked with Moscow; why would it not work with Tehran? To \nsome extent, it depends on the definition of ``work.'' Will it work?\n  Remember that while the Soviets never actually used their nuclear \nweapons, the fact that they possessed the weapons made a big difference \nin political events over those 40 years. It allowed them to subjugate \nEastern Europe, and we had no way of responding. Had we tried to \nrespond, there was the nuclear threat against us. It allowed them to \nfoment a Communist revolution around the world and to sponsor a range \nof international terrorist groups during this period of time. When the \nSoviets invaded Hungary in 1956 in order to crush a democratic \nuprising, they knew the risk of a nuclear exchange would prevent the \nUnited States from responding with military force. I remember at that \ntime the disappointment of the Hungarians who thought the United States \nhad led them to think we would be supportive. In effect, there was \nnothing we could do that wouldn't potentially provoke a nuclear attack \nby Russia, and nobody wanted that. In other words, Moscow's nuclear \narsenal served as the ultimate deterrent. It allowed the Kremlin to\n\n[[Page S5406]]\n\nundermine U.S. interests across the globe without fear of an American \nreprisal. The Soviets didn't need to use their nuclear weapons in order \nto achieve results; the mere fact that it had nuclear weapons \ndramatically increased both its strategic power and its leverage over \nforeign policy and, to some extent, over the United States.\n\n  The same would be true if Iran acquired nuclear weapons. Even if the \nmullahs never actually detonated a nuclear bomb, their acquisition of a \nnuclear capability would forever change Iran's regional and global \ninfluence, and it would certainly forever change the Middle East. If \nIran went nuclear, its neighbors--thinking particularly of Egypt, Saudi \nArabia, and Turkey--might feel compelled to pursue their own nuclear \narsenals. Tehran could easily trigger a dangerous chain reaction of \nnuclear proliferation. Once they had nuclear weapons, the Iranians \nwould be much more aggressive in supporting terrorist organizations \nthat are killing even American troops, for example, in Iraq. The \nIranians would also ramp up their support for Hezbollah and Hamas and \npossibly provide them with nuclear materials. They would be emboldened \nto conduct economic warfare against the West, for example, by \ndisrupting oil shipments traveling through the Straits of Hormuz. Iran \nwould also be more confident about expanding its footprint in Latin \nAmerica, where it has established a close working relationship with \nVenezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez. Governments around the world would \nlose faith in America's reliability as a strategic partner. U.S. \ncredibility would be irrevocably weakened.\n  Remember, this is not the worst-case scenario. We are assuming that a \nself-preservation instinct would dissuade the Iranians from ever \nlaunching nuclear weapons against our allies or even the United States. \nBut then again, is this really a safe assumption? Iranian leader \nAhmadinejad has repeatedly expressed his desire to destroy the State of \nIsrael, and given his radical, millenarian religious views and the \nviciously anti-Semitic ideology espoused by the Iranian theocracy, we \ncan't simply dismiss the idea that Iran would attack Israel with \nnuclear weapons.\n  Because the United Nations took so long to act and because its \nsanctions are relatively weak, there is also the possibility, as the \nJerusalem Post pointed out in an article entitled ``Too Little, Too \nVery Late,'' that U.N. sanctions could lull the international community \ninto a false sense of security. That is where the action we take today \ncould really help.\n  Here is what the Post wrote:\n\n       Breaking and evading these sanctions--\n\n  Talking about the U.S. sanctions--\n\n     ought to be a breeze for Ahmadinejad. A full year after \n     Iran's deceptive elections, which spurred countrywide \n     demonstrations, he may be less popular but his position is \n     stable. After the regime brutally quashed his opposition, it \n     is very doubtful that stunted sanctions will destabilize his \n     hold on power. . . . [The U.N.] sanctions . . . are not the \n     antidote to the Iranian nuclear threat that Israel had hoped \n     for and that the free world so badly needs. In some ways, \n     they may even exacerbate Israel's predicament. They will lend \n     the appearance of an international mobilization to curb \n     Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions, but in actuality will \n     achieve nothing--the worst of all worlds.\n\n  That is why I think the United States separate sanctions authorized \nby the legislation we will vote on shortly are so important to come in \nbehind the United Nations sanctions and what the European Union might \ndo to supplement those actions in a way that will truly be meaningful.\n  Finally, I want to note something that, frankly, is as important as \neverything else I have said and should be seen as part and parcel to \nour action in adopting this sanctions legislation. It has nothing to do \nwith nuclear weapons, but it has everything to do with human rights. We \nneed to make it very clear to the Iranian people that we care about \nthem, we care about their aspirations for more freedom, for more \nrepresentative government, and for the ability to take advantage of the \nopportunities their country should be presenting for them.\n  We can help the people of Iran achieve those aspirations by putting \npressure on the people who prevent that from occurring, the regime in \nTehran, the mullah-led government. These sanctions can have an impact \non those mullahs and, in turn, help the Iranian people achieve their \ngoals.\n  We need to be lending moral and rhetorical support to the Iranian \nactivists. These are the people who poured into the streets last summer \nin protest of a fraudulent election. Just as we championed the cause of \nSoviet and Eastern European dissidents during the Cold War, I believe \nwe should promote the efforts of Iranian freedom fighters and, frankly, \nshine a spotlight on the regime's brutal repression. That can be done \nespecially through the McCain provisions that are part of the Iran \nsanctions legislation we are considering.\n  Had the United Nations imposed strong sanctions on Iran a long time \nago when it was first found to be in violation of the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty, I would be more optimistic about our chances of \nsuccess. Iran's economy would have been under severe strain for an \nextended period, and the government would have had fewer resources to \nfund its nuclear program and less power to repress its people.\n  As I said, there is still time, and because we are able to approve \nthis conference report today and send it to the President for his \nsignature, we are able to add to the sanctions that the rest of the \nworld is willing to impose in such a way as to not only have an \nopportunity to dissuade the Iranian leaders from pursuing their nuclear \nprogram but, as I said, just as importantly, to demonstrate to the \nIranian people we aim to support them in their quest for greater \nfreedom.\n  So I hope my colleagues will send a very strong message with a \nunanimous vote for the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, \nand Divestment Act of 2009. I hope the President will sign this \nlegislation immediately and begin to implement its provisions.\n  Mr. President, there is a long list of folks to thank: \nRepresentatives Berman and Harman and Cantor in the House of \nRepresentatives are just some who come to mind; Senator Lieberman and \nSenator Bayh, colleagues in the Senate; the leaders, Leader Reid and \nLeader McConnell, who have worked to bring this report to us for a vote \ntoday in an expedited way. I think this is a very good example of \ncooperation both between the House and the Senate and between Democrats \nand Republicans to accomplish something that is not just good for the \npeople of the United States of America but people around the world--in \nthe Middle East, and in particular the people of Iran.\n  So I urge my colleagues to unanimously support the conference report \nwhen we have an opportunity to vote on it shortly.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nconference report for the Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions Act.\n  First, I would like to commend Senator Dodd for putting forth a \ncomprehensive plan to arm the administration with the tools they need \nto put a stop to Iran's rogue nuclear program.\n  I believe when it comes to Iran, we should never take the military \noption off the table. But I have long argued that economic sanctions \nare the preferred and probably the most effective way to choke Iran's \nnuclear ambitions.\n  The Obama administration initiated direct diplomatic negotiations \nwith Iran, but that government, led by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, \nstubbornly refused to suspend their nuclear program despite President \nObama's genuine attempts at diplomacy.\n  Iran's nuclear weapons program represents a severe threat to American \nnational interests because their acquisition of nuclear weapons could \nlead to the proliferation of nuclear weapons throughout the Middle East \nand beyond, ending any hopes for a nuclear weapons-free world.\n  Make no mistake, a nuclear Iran would be destabilizing to its \nneighbors, encourage terrorism against the United States and Israel, \nand the risk of both conventional and nuclear war in the Middle East \nwould rise considerably.\n\n[[Page S5407]]\n\n  President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has already threatened to ``wipe Israel \noff the map,'' so we know for a fact that a nuclear Iran would pose a \npotential threat to our closest ally in the region, the State of \nIsrael.\n  These tough new sanctions have such overwhelming support because \nMembers of the House and Senate, Democrat and Republican, are united in \ndoing what is necessary to stop Iran's drive to obtain a nuclear \nweapons capability.\n  It will also impose sanctions on financial institutions doing \nbusiness with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps or with certain \nIranian banks blacklisted by the Department of Treasury.\n  The bill sanctions companies that export gasoline to Iran. This is \none of the few pressure points where we can act unilaterally and have a \nreal effect. The world knows Iran does not currently have the refining \ncapacity to meet its domestic gasoline needs and is dependent on \nimported gasoline. So now is the time to reduce Iran's energy supply if \nit fails to suspend its nuclear enrichment program.\n  I am also glad we will be strengthening export controls to stop the \nillegal export of sensitive technology to Iran. During the recent \nIranian elections, we witnessed the Iranian regime go so far as to \nblock the Internet and mobile phone communications of their own \ncitizens.\n  That is why Senator Lindsey Graham and I introduced the Reduce \nIranian Cyber Suppression Act, or RICA, a bipartisan bill that would \nbar companies that export sensitive communications technology to Iran \nfrom applying for or renewing procurement contracts with the U.S. \nGovernment. I am pleased these provisions have been preserved in the \nconference.\n  I also applaud the conferees for not carving out companies from \ncountries that are U.S. allies. There must be one standard when it \ncomes to punishing companies that continue to invest in Iran.\n  So, in conclusion, Chairman Dodd has done an excellent job crafting a \ncomprehensive plan to arm the administration with the tools it needs to \nput a stop to Iran's rogue nuclear program. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to support this plan, and I look forward to the President \nsigning this important legislation. It is a tremendous accomplishment \nfor Congress, and it is going to go a long way to address the real \nsecurity threat that Iran poses to the United States and our world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \ncomprehensive Iran Sanctions Accountability and Divestment Act of 2010. \nI wish to particularly thank my colleagues on the Banking Committee for \nworking to bring this conference report to the floor.\n  I have said many times before that we don't have a moment to waste \nwhen it comes to Iran. We must focus like a laser beam on Iran's \ndangerous refusal to cease uranium enrichment in defiance of the \nNuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and multiple United Nations Security \nCouncil resolutions, because we know that Iran could not only use any \nweapons it acquires, but it could proliferate nuclear material and \ntechnologies to terrorist groups and rogue regimes around the world. We \nmust act today. Iran is a threat to the security of the United States, \nthe Middle East, and the rest of the globe.\n  Let me list a few of the many important provisions of this bill. \nFirst, it would specifically target companies involved in refined \npetroleum sales to Iran and those who are supporting Iran's domestic \nrefining efforts. This is critical, because countless experts have told \nus that the way to pressure Iran is to target its oil and gas sectors. \nI have believed this for a long time, and I have been pushing for this \nbill for a long time.\n  According to the Government Accountability Office:\n\n       In recent years, oil export revenues have accounted for 24 \n     percent of Iran's gross domestic product and between 50 and \n     76 percent of the Iranian government's revenues.\n\n  So we need to go after their revenues, because they are being used to \npush forward their nuclear program, which is so dangerous. We have to \ntake away those resources, and this sanctions bill is a very good way \nto do that.\n  Second, this bill would also prohibit U.S. banks from engaging in \ntransactions with foreign financial institutions that continue to do \nbusiness with Iranian banks and Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard \nCorps. I think Chairman Dodd and Chairman Berman captured best what \nthis provision means:\n\n       Cease your activities or be denied critical access to \n     America's financial system.\n\n  Third, the bill would also place significant penalties on Iran's \nhuman rights abusers. I don't think I have to explain why this is \nessential. Like many of my colleagues, I have watched human rights \nviolations inside of Iran, including the brutal suppression of the \nopposition ``Green Movement'' that has sought to have its voice heard.\n  Fourth, I am especially pleased that the bill includes a provision \nrequiring companies bidding on a U.S. Government procurement contract \nto certify that they are not engaged in sanctionable conduct. This is \nso important, because a recent GAO study found that the U.S. Government \nawarded $880 million to seven companies between fiscal years 2005 and \n2009 that were also doing business in Iran's energy sector. Taxpayer \ndollars from hard-working Americans must never be used to purchase \ngoods or supplies from companies who are working to develop Iran's \nenergy sector or who are engaged in any behavior that is prohibited by \nsanctions.\n  Finally, this bill codifies in law longstanding Executive orders that \nprohibit American companies from doing business in Iran. American \nfirms, including through their subsidiaries, must never be allowed to \nvalue a quick profit over the national security of America.\n  I know we are going to pass this conference report today, and I know \nit will have strong support in the Senate. But what we must do next is \nbe vigilant in ensuring that the new sanctions created by this bill are \nenforced to the fullest extent possible. I asked the administration if \nthey are ready to enforce this law should it pass, and they said \nabsolutely.\n  The situation is grave. We must send a clear and resounding message \nto Iran that it will pay a very heavy price for its continued defiance \nof international law and its reckless behavior which, again, threatens \nthe Middle East and threatens the entire world.\n  So I am looking forward to voting for this and making sure as a \nmember of the Foreign Relations Committee that this sanctions act is \nenforced.\n  Thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the world has watched as Iran has oppressed \nits own people, violated United Nations resolutions, challenged \nAmerica, and threatened Israel.\n  The Senate is taking an important step forward today as we pass the \nconference report that will impose tough new sanctions on Iran. We are \npassing these sanctions because we believe we must stop Iran from \ndeveloping a nuclear weapon--a weapon that would surely threaten the \nnational security of the United States and Israel. Our goal is to \ntarget Iran where it would hurt the regime the most. These new economic \nsanctions are related to Iran's refined petroleum sector and \ninternational financial institutions that do business with Iran's \nIslamic Revolutionary Guard and Iranian banks.\n  The Senate has worked hard to pass this legislation. I thank Senator \nDodd, who worked tirelessly with Senator Kerry and the other conferees \nto get the final version of the bill completed. I also thank a man who \ncame to the House of Representatives with me years ago, Howard Berman, \nchairman\n\n[[Page S5408]]\n\nof the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who led the effort on the other \nside of the Capitol.\n  Once these sanctions become law, they will expand the multilateral \nsanctions passed by the United Nations and the new sanctions the \nEuropean Union is discussing.\n  The Senate has a critical role to play by taking clear and decisive \naction to get the Iranian regime to change its behavior, and we have \ndone that with passage of this conference report. I look forward to its \npassing later today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend withhold for a brief minute?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nremarks of the Republican leader, the Senate vote on adoption of the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 2194, the Iran Refined Petroleum \nSanctions Act, with the previous order remaining in effect; provided \nfurther that upon conclusion of the vote, the following Senators be \nrecognized to speak or engage in colloquies: Senators Cornyn and \nBingaman for a total of 10 minutes, Senator Dorgan for up to 15 \nminutes, and Senators Murray and Bond for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to briefly comment on the Iran \nsanctions conference report, which we will be voting on shortly.\n  I am pleased with the bill before the Senate, as I have been urging \nenactment of this legislation for some time. I brought it up with the \nPresident on numerous occasions over the last 6 to 8 months. I \ncosponsored it in the last Congress and in the current one.\n  Congress has been slow to act as the Iranian program to enrich \nuranium has progressed.\n  Iran has also taken advantage of the delay to blunt the impact of \nthis measure.\n  Just today a headline in the Washington Post read that ``Iran is \nprepared for fuel sanctions.''\n  But this legislation should be viewed as only a part of a broader, \ncomprehensive effort by the U.S. to harness the various means of \nnational power to ensure that Iran does not secure a nuclear weapon.\n  As President Obama has stated, Iran's ``development of nuclear \nweapons would be unacceptable''.\n  We must work with our allies in the gulf to make clear to Iran that \nthe cost of developing a weapon exceed the prestige they think they \nwould gain from acquiring this capability.\n  First and foremost, the sanctions in this legislation need to be \nimplemented and implemented quickly, not waived.\n  The time for further delay is past.\n  The collective strength of the recent U.N. Security Council \nresolution and this conference report must be combined to strike at \nIranian shadow companies and the regime's leaders.\n  The need for urgency should be obvious because the threat posed to \nthe U.S. and its allies by the revolutionary Iranian regime is grave. \nIts president has called for Israel to be wiped off the map. An Iranian \nnuclear weapon threatens to set off an arms race in the Middle East, \nand embolden the regime in its support of terrorist groups.\n  Passage of Iranian sanctions is an important first step, but only a \nfirst step.\n  I agree with the President that the U.S. and our allies must make \nclear to Iran that the development of a nuclear weapon is unacceptable.\n  That is why I urge passage of this conference report and all other \nnecessary measures to deter the Iranian regime.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, please report the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the conference report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 2194) \n     to amend the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 to enhance United \n     States diplomatic efforts with respect to Iran and by \n     expanding economic sanctions against Iran, having met, have \n     agreed that the House recede from its disagreement to the \n     amendment of the Senate and agree to the same with an \n     amendment, and the Senate agree to the same.

Mr. President, the terrorist group Hamas, which is \nsupported by Iran, took control of the Gaza Strip in 2007. When Hamas \ndid so, Israel put in place a legitimate and justified blockade of Gaza \nout of concern for the safety of its citizens. Hamas and its allies \nhave fired more than 10,000 rockets and mortars from Gaza into Israel \nsince 2001, killing at least 18 Israelis and wounding dozens of others. \nThe Israeli defense minister said this week that Israel considers the \nGaza Strip to be essentially an Iranian military base, just 3 \nkilometers from an Israeli town and 60 kilometers from Tel Aviv, \nIsrael's second largest city.\n  The Israeli blockade has been effective in reducing the flow of \nweapons into Gaza and the firing of rockets from Gaza into southern \nIsrael. Were Iran and other supporters of Hamas allowed access to the \nports of Gaza, the people of Israel would be put directly in harm's \nway.\n  On May 27, the Israeli Navy, maintaining the integrity of the \nblockade, intercepted the so-called ``Free Gaza'' flotilla and \npeacefully boarded five of the six ships. The sixth ship was filled \nwith extremists whose stated intent was martyrdom. Those extremists \nbrutally attacked members of the Israeli Navy, who were forced to act \nin self-defense and, in some instances, use lethal force. Although \nIsrael was exercising its right to self-defense, which every nation is \nentitled to do, the incident raised an international outcry, just as it \nwas designed to do.\n  Some even condemned the actions of the Israeli Navy. The ``Free \nGaza'' flotilla was a disgraceful and premeditated attempt to break the \nblockade and provoke a violent confrontation with Israel, hidden under \nthe cloak of a humanitarian relief effort. This type of despicable \nconduct must be condemned, especially by friends and allies of Israel.\n  Every country has the right to defend itself, and Israel is no \ndifferent. The calls from United Nations leaders and others for an \ninvestigation into the actions of Israel have been troubling. In my \nview, these calls have served only to question Israel's right to self \ndefense.\n  To its credit, Israel has unilaterally established a five-person \npanel to conduct an investigation into the flotilla incident, and its \nwork will be monitored by two foreign observers. Yet U.N. officials are \nnot satisfied and continue to push for a separate, international probe \ninto the incident. As such, I believe the U.N. is unfairly singling out \nIsrael for criticism and using a double-standard.\n  According to news reports, there may be new flotillas literally \nlooming on the horizon, preparing to challenge Israel's legitimate sea \nblockade of Gaza. Iran's ``Children of Gaza'' flotilla may set sail for \nGaza as soon as this weekend, according to the spokesman for the \nIranian Red Crescent. Iran has directly bolstered Hamas' ability to \nstrike Israel, and its leaders have repeatedly called for the \ndestruction of Israel. Now, they may be sending ships. No good can come \nfrom this.\n  Furthermore, another group in Lebanon has announced its intention to \nsail its ships toward the Gaza blockade soon. Hassan Nasrallah, the \nleader of the terrorist group Hezbollah, has called on Lebanese \ncitizens to help break the blockade of Gaza. So, Israel has legitimate \nconcerns that this flotilla might be used to smuggle weapons into Gaza. \nI only hope the Lebanese government will do the right thing and put a \nstop to it.\n  At a time of great instability in the Middle East, these flotillas \nserve only as additional destabilizing forces. The Middle East does not \nneed further violence. Israel has the solemn right to defend itself and \nits citizens against these flotillas and any other security threats, \nwhich continue to gather. Israel needs friends more than ever right \nnow.\n  Mr. President, I have offered a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which \ndoes a number of things: First, it reaffirms the United States' strong \nsupport of Israel, our friend and steadfast ally. It expresses the \nsense of the Senate that Israel's right to self-defense is inherent and \nundeniable. It condemns the violent attack and provocation by the \nextremists aboard the Mavi Marmara and any future attempts to break \nIsrael's legal blockade of Gaza. It condemns Hamas for its failure to \nrecognize Israel's right to exist, and the Government of Iran for its \nsupport of Hamas and its undermining of Israel's security.\n  This resolution also encourages the Government of Turkey to recognize \nthat continued strong relations with Israel are of the utmost \nimportance. The resolution supports our friend and ally, Israel, and it \ndoes so unequivocally. By passing this important resolution, the Senate \nwill help remind the world that the United States stands with our \nally--Israel.\n  Mr. President, there are 14 Senators who have cosponsored this \nresolution, and at this point I ask unanimous consent that the Foreign \nRelations Committee be discharged from further consideration and the \nSenate now proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 548.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 548) to express the sense of the \n     Senate that Israel has an undeniable right to self-defense, \n     and to condemn the recent destabilizing actions by extremists \n     aboard the ship Mavi Marmara.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, several colleagues had some constructive \nsuggestions about amendments to this measure, and there were two \namendments that we modified the original resolution with. At this \npoint, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment at the desk be agreed \nto, and I urge adoption of the resolution, as amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4396) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       On page 7, strike lines 22-24\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the resolution, as \namended?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, before the Senate votes on Senate \nResolution 548, I wish to speak briefly in opposition to it.\n  This resolution speaks to this so-called ``flotilla incident'' that \noccurred a few weeks ago near Gaza. I am concerned that this resolution \ndoes not help either the United States or Israel. I support Israel. I \nhave done so during all my years here in the Senate. But I also believe \nthat the only way to ensure Israel's long-term security is to have a \ngenuine peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. This \nresolution does not bring us closer to that peace.\n  No one questions Israel's right to defend itself. I know that \nquestions have been raised about the relationship between the \nHumanitarian Relief Foundation and Hamas, and I am concerned about \nthose questions and they need to be answered. But I am also concerned \nthat Israel's response to the flotilla and the deaths onboard the Mavi \nMarmara once again shows to Israel's enemies that they can provoke \nIsrael into taking actions that undermine international support for \nIsrael.\n\n  Israel was able to board five of the ships with no loss of life, as \nmy colleague from Texas indicated, and that needs to be acknowledged. \nBut this incident has distracted the attention of the international \ncommunity away from the peace process. It has overshadowed the \nkidnapping of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, which occurred nearly 4 \nyears ago today--in fact, on June 25, 2006. Hamas should immediately \nrelease Gilad Shalit. Unfortunately, I do not believe this resolution \nwill help to make that happen.\n  Nor does this resolution talk about the humanitarian situation in \nGaza. Israel has allowed humanitarian supplies into Gaza, but it is \nevident from the conditions in Gaza that those supplies have not been \nsufficient. One U.S. charity estimates that 400 trucks of basic food \nsupplies are needed in Gaza\n\n[[Page S5410]]\n\nevery day, but on average only 171 trucks of basic nutritional aid \nenter Gaza each week.\n  Israel has a right to prevent arms from entering Gaza, but I do not \nsee a reason for the Senate to pass a resolution supporting a policy \nthat has the effect of restricting humanitarian supplies. Moreover, \nIsrael itself has decided to change that policy. I am encouraged by \nIsrael's decision last week to ease the restrictions on the flow of \ngoods into Gaza. I agree with the White House that this new policy, \nonce implemented, will significantly improve the conditions for the \nPalestinians in Gaza. As Prime Minister Netanyahu told the Knesset:\n\n       This new policy is the best one for Israel because it \n     eliminates Hamas' main propaganda claim and allows us and our \n     international allies to face our real concerns in the realm \n     of security.\n\n  The resolution the Senate is considering at this point would put the \nSenate on record in support of a policy that Israel itself has \ndetermined to change.\n  One more obvious point is the Senate has not fully debated this \nresolution. There have been no hearings on the flotilla incident or any \nversion of this resolution in either the Senate or in the House. To my \nknowledge, the administration has not expressed its views on this \nresolution either. I believe with regard to foreign policy matters, the \nadministration should always be consulted.\n  Let me close by saying no one should question the U.S. support for \nIsrael. I do not believe anyone seriously questions that. I say again \nthat I do not believe this resolution furthers the effort to bring \npeace between Israel and the Palestinians, which is the only way to \nensure Israel's long-term security.\n  For those reasons I would like to be recorded in opposition to \nenactment of the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I reiterate my unanimous consent request \nthat the amendment at the desk be agreed to and urge adoption of the \nresolution as amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has been agreed to. Is there \nfurther debate? If not, the question is on agreeing to the resolution, \nas amended.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 548), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent the amendment to the preamble be \nagreed to, the preamble as amended be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4397) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       Strike the 14th clause in the preamble.\n\n  The preamble, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n  (The resolution will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, my friend and colleague from North Dakota \nhas been kind enough to allow me to speak because of some scheduling \nconcerns, and I ask unanimous consent when I complete my remarks he be \nrecognized for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bond pertaining to the introduction of S. 3538 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                    Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, on occasion there are some things that \nhappen in this Chamber that get precious little attention but represent \nvery good news. Last evening, with virtually no attention, a piece of \nlegislation was passed by the Senate unanimously, a piece of \nlegislation, called the Tribal Law and Order Act, affecting Indian \ntribes across this country. It was bipartisan. My colleagues and I, as \nchairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, working with Republicans and \nDemocrats, Senator Barrasso, and Senator Jon Kyl especially was helpful \nin recent days, and on our side, Senator Tester and Senator Udall and \nso many others--have gotten a piece of legislation through the Senate, \nwhich we hope will get through the House and be signed by the \nPresident, dealing with law and order on Indian reservations.\n  Lewis and Clark spent the winter in North Dakota on their expedition \nin 1805. When they came through North Dakota, there were Indian \nvillages and settlements in North Dakota that had been there a long \ntime. They were farming on the banks of the Missouri River. That is \ntrue all across the country. When new people exploring our country came \nupon Indian tribes, they had been there for a long while. They were the \nfirst Americans, and we displaced them, and we have sad chapters in \nAmerican history that are described as ``Trail of Tears,'' the \n``Massacre at Wounded Knee,'' and I could go on for a great length of \ntime.\n  Native Americans were, in many cases, rounded up, placed on \nreservations, and then the Federal Government, for taking their \nproperty away from them, said: We will sign agreements with you. We \nwill make deals with you. We will have treaties. We will accept a trust \nresponsibility. We will educate you. We promised that since we have \ntaken your land away, we will provide for your children's education, we \nwill provide for your health care, and we will provide for your law \nenforcement.\n  It is what the Federal Government signed to do in treaties and the \nGovernment has systematically avoided the responsibility of meeting \nthose conditions ever since.\n  I have talked at length on this floor about Indian health care and \nIndian education and Indian housing. In many areas on Indian \nreservations, it mirrors what we consider Third World-country \nconditions: people living in overcrowded housing, if they have housing \nat all; sending kids to schools whose desks are 1 inch apart, with 30 \nkids to a classroom, in a dilapidated building; people going hungry; \npeople having very serious health care problems and not able to get \nadequate health.\n  We passed in this Chamber the Indian Health Care Improvement Act as a \npart of the health care reform bill. I am enormously proud of having \ndone that. It is the first time in 17 years this Congress did something \non the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. We worked and worked and \nworked. I am proud it is done.\n  This is another significant piece of work. We have had I believe 14 \nhearings on this subject in the Indian Affairs Committee. Twenty-two \nSenate colleagues cosponsored my legislation, Republicans and \nDemocrats.\n  If anyone doubts the need for this legislation, let me demonstrate \njust in this week with three headlines, one in Indian Country Today. \n``Rape on the Rez'' is the title.\n\n       The mother tries to be strong, looking at the photos of her \n     dead daughter's beaten and bruised face. She tries not to \n     cry, but eventually the images prove too much. ``That's what \n     they did to her,'' the mother says.\n       Marquita Marie Walking Eagle died November 1, 2009, the \n     victim of a violent sexual assault. The 19-year-old Rosebud \n     Sioux woman's alleged killer: a 17-year-old classmate from \n     St. Francis High School in South Dakota.\n\n  Just one headline, but, we also have studies. One in 3 American \nIndian and Alaska Native women will be raped and sexually assaulted in \nher lifetime--1 in 3; not 1 in 10, 1 in 3. Think of that. Think of the \nviolence on too many of these Indian reservations.\n  Another headline from this week: ``Addicted On The Rez,'' about drug \nabuse and crimes that are infiltrating the reservation. Another \nheadline this week: ``Indian reservations on both U.S. borders are \nbecoming drug pipelines,'' conduits for Mexican drug cartels and others \nto move drugs into this country and particularly addict young Indian \nchildren on those drugs and have them become carriers. Those are three \narticles from this week sitting on top of a mountaintop of other \narticles.\n  In my home state of North Dakota right now, on the Standing Rock \nIndian Reservation that actually is on the border of North and South \nDakota--it is an area the size of the State of Connecticut. They had \nnine law enforcement officers for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week \ncoverage. Well, that means\n\n[[Page S5411]]\n\nthat very often there would be no more than one law enforcement officer \npatrolling an area the size of the State of Connecticut. So a women \nbeing raped, sexually assaulted, a burglary or a robbery in progress, a \nviolent crime, a gun crime, and a plea and a call, a frantic call, \nmight mean that 3 or 4 hours later--maybe not until the next day would \nsomeone in a police car show up to investigate that crime. That is what \nthey have been facing.\n  On the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, the year before last, the \nrate of violent crime wasn't double what most Americans experience; it \nwasn't triple; it wasn't quadruple; it was eight times the national \naverage--eight times the rate of violent crime on the Standing Rock \nReservation. There has been some improvement. In 2009 it was simply \nfive times worse than what most Americans experience.\n  The question is, What can we do about those things? One Bureau of \nIndian Affairs officer on the Standing Rock Reservation--again, as I \nindicated, an area the size of the State of Connecticut, with nine law \nenforcement officers--what he said was: ``I felt like I was standing in \nthe middle of a river trying to hold back a flood.'' He said they were \nforced to ``triage'' rape cases. He said: We only took a rape case if \nthere was a confession; if not, didn't happen. This is not a Third \nWorld country. This is in America on Indian reservations.\n  Last summer, the Department of Justice issued a report to our \ncommittee. I am quoting now:\n\n       Native gangs are now involved in more violent offenses like \n     sexual assault, gang rapes, home invasions, drive-by \n     shootings, beatings, and elder abuse on Indian reservations.\n\n  This is on the Pine Ridge Reservation, a photograph that was brought \nto a hearing I held on increased gang activity on reservations. This is \nanother photo from the same hearing. These are very serious problems.\n  We have a war on terror and a war on drugs, and all too often across \nthis country, Indian reservations are left to their own, told ``you do \nit,'' despite the fact that this country promised to provide law \nenforcement assistance. This entire system isn't working. It is the \ncourts, the jails, law enforcement--it doesn't work.\n  That is why, with 22 colleagues, we introduced this legislation and \nnow last night, thankfully, have passed it through the Senate. This \ndoes a number of very important things. It forces the BIA to consult \nwith tribal leaders on joint law enforcement.\n  It says to the U.S. attorneys--by the way, U.S. attorneys are the \nones who are relied upon to prosecute felonies on Indian reservations, \nand all too often it is part of the back room of the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice: You know what, we don't have time; we are not going to do it. \nThe declination rate--that means declining to prosecute--the \ndeclination rate for murders is 50 percent, according to Department of \nJustice information we received in the committee. The declination rate, \nthat is, declining to prosecute, for rape and sexual assault is 70 \npercent. So 70 percent of the time, they don't prosecute because they \nare working on something else. It is on an Indian reservation. Hard to \ninvestigate, they say. Well, this legislation will change that.\n  This legislation will add the necessary tools to enable tribal \ngovernments to better fight crime locally. It will give police improved \naccess to national criminal databases. Judges on reservations will have \nadded authority to sentence violent offenders in tribal courts. Can you \nimagine that judges in tribal courts, under current law, can sentence \nto no more than 1 year for an Indian offender? No more than 1 year. \nRape, murder, armed robbery--1 year. That is absurd.\n  The fact is, we have put together a bill that finally offers the \ntools to strengthen this justice system, that also works to cross-\ndeputize Indian police in the Federal criminal system so that Indian \nreservations and those who patrol on the reservations can work hand-in-\nhand with those in the adjacent counties, the county sheriffs, police \nchiefs, and others.\n\n  This bill will reauthorize and improve existing programs designed to \nstrengthen the tribal justice systems, prevent alcohol and substance \nabuse, which is the No. 1 cause of violence on reservations, and \nimprove opportunities for youth on the reservations.\n  I am very pleased and proud that we have been able to get this done. \nWe have worked long and hard. If this Congress completes its work \nhaving done the Indian Health Care Improvement Act and now the Tribal \nLaw and Order Act, if in one Congress we will have made that kind of \nstride to address the issue of health care and crime and justice on \nIndian reservations, we will have done something very significant.\n  I ask people who think, well, this is just something that is out of \nsight, out of mind: Go to an Indian reservation and take a look at the \ncondition of the housing. Go visit with the kids in school. I have done \nthat. Go sit around, if you can, with 10 or 12 kids and ask them about \ntheir lives. Where do they get hope and inspiration and belief that \nthey can be part of something bigger than themselves, that they can get \neducated, that they have an opportunity to do whatever they want to do? \nWhere do they get that? The fact is, we have created circumstances, \nabysmal circumstances and broken promises, and it has lasted for a \ncouple of centuries.\n  You know, we have been trying now for almost 6 months to get the \nCobell settlement through the Senate. The Cobell settlement is a group \nof plaintiffs who are Indians whose property and land and resources \nfrom that land have largely been stolen from them for a couple of \nhundred years. The Interior Department has been managing the trust of \nthese Indians for well over 100, 150 years.\n  The other day on the floor of the Senate, I showed a picture of a \nwoman who had six oil wells on her land, and she lived in a little \nbungalow and never had anything all of her life. Well, why didn't \nsomeone who had six oil wells on her land have anything? Because the \nU.S. Department of the Interior was managing it, and she never got the \nmoney. That has been going on for 150 years. And now there is a court \naction that has gone on for 14 years and finally an agreement to settle \nthe court action, and the judge gave us 30 days in Congress to settle \nthis after it had been agreed to by the Interior Secretary, by the \nplaintiffs. Finally some justice after 100, 150 years, and the judge \nhas had to extend that deadline now three or four times and we have \nstill not gotten it done. It is in this underlying bill, the one that \nis being objected to by the minority.\n  The reason I mentioned that is there are so many injustices in this \ncountry to the people who were here first. The first Americans deserve \nbetter. The first Americans deserve to have this government keep its \npromise at long, long last. And this is but one: the providing of law \nenforcement. How many Americans would like to live in an area where the \nrate of violent crime is 5 times, 8 times, or 10 times the national \naverage? Well, there are a whole lot of young men and women, young boys \nand girls, and elders living exactly in those circumstances in this \ncountry. And that violence exists every day.\n  We need to do something about it.\n  One final point. I have talked to the BIA at great length. There are \nsome things happening right now experimentally to try to move some \nadditional resources into tribal lands to promote greater law and \norder. It is true on the Standing Rock Reservation and others as well. \nBut the Tribal Law and Order Act, which I have reason to believe will \nnow be passed by the House as well, is a big step forward. We not only \nnegotiated that in the Senate, but we worked very hard with Members of \nthe House as we put this legislation together with their ideas as well. \nIf we do this, we will be able to say this country, at long last, on \nthis issue at least, kept its promise and began the long effort to make \nsure we are meeting our trust responsibilities to those who were the \nfirst Americans.\n  I thank many of my colleagues who helped us achieve this goal, and \nend as I began, by saying there is plenty of reason to be concerned \nabout the lack of getting things done in this Chamber, but this is a \ngood piece of legislation. Good news doesn't sell quite as well as bad \nnews these days in our system. I hope all of us will be able to take \nsome satisfaction in doing something that represents the public good \nfor people living in this country who certainly deserve it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                         Criminal Jurisdiction\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on S. 797, the Tribal Law \nand\n\n[[Page S5412]]\n\nOrder Act of 2010. I offered the text of this bill to H.R. 725, the \nIndian Arts and Crafts Act Amendments, and last night, the Senate \npassed this bill as amended by unanimous consent.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, I have presided over \n14 hearings relating to public safety on our Nation's tribal lands over \nthe past three years. These hearings revealed a longstanding crisis of \nviolence in many parts of Indian country. Indian reservations on \naverage suffer rates of violence more than 2.5 times the national rate. \nIn my home State of North Dakota, the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation \nsuffered 8.6 times the national rate of violence in 2008. In early \n2008, there were 9 police officers patrolling this 2.3 million acre \nReservation, which meant at times there was no 24-hour police response \nservice. As a result, victims of violence reported waiting hours and \nsometimes days before receiving a response to their distress calls. \nWith this level of response, crime scenes can become compromised, and \njustice is not served to the victims, their families, or the community.\n  Our hearings found that violence against Indian women has reached \nepidemic levels. The Justice Department and the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention report that more than 1 in 3 American Indian and \nAlaska Native women will be raped in their lifetime and more than 2 in \n5 will be subject to domestic or partner violence.\n  The broken and divided system of justice in place on Indian lands \nthat was devised by dozens of Federal laws and Federal court decisions \nenacted and handed down over the past 150 years is not well-suited to \naddress the violence in Indian country. Because of these laws and \ndecisions, responsibility to investigate and prosecute crime on the \nreservation is divided among the Federal, tribal, and in some \nlocations, state governments.\n  Based on this authority, these governments should be diligent in \npreventing and prosecuting these crimes. Thus, one of the primary \npurposes of the bill is to ensure that the United States upholds its \ntreaty promises and legal obligation to investigate and prosecute \nviolent crimes on Indian lands. Our Nation made treaty promises, and \nenacted laws--specifically the General and Major Crimes Acts--that \nprovided for Federal criminal jurisdiction over Indian lands. At the \nsame time, the United States limited tribal government authority to \npunish offenders in tribal courts to no more than 1 year for any one \noffense.\n  The Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 takes steps to hold the United \nStates to these solemn promises, and will address the restriction on \ntribal court penal authority over defendants in tribal court where \ncertain protections are met.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank my colleague from North Dakota for his work on this \nimportant bill. We held a field hearing in my State of Arizona on an \nearly version of this bill. There we heard from tribal leaders about \nviolence in their communities. In 2009, the Bureau of Indian Affairs \nreported that in my home State of Arizona the San Carlos Apache Tribe \nendured a violent crime rate that is more than six times the national \naverage and the White Mountain Apache Tribe suffered a violent crime \nrate more than four times the national average. On the southern border, \nthe Tohono O'odham Nation needs assistance in addressing the onslaught \nof Mexican drug and human traffickers that exploit the sprawling \nreservation, which is the size of the State of Connecticut.\n  I would like to address changes made to section 201 of the Tribal Law \nand Order Act that concern Public Law No. 83-280, commonly known as \nPublic Law. 280. This law was enacted on August 15, 1953. Public Law \n280 removed the Federal Government's special Indian country law \nenforcement jurisdiction over almost all Indian lands in the States of \nAlaska, upon statehood, California, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oregon, and \nWisconsin, and permitted these States to exercise criminal jurisdiction \nover those lands. The act specifically provides that these states \n``shall have jurisdiction over offenses committed by or against Indians \nin the areas of Indian country . . . to the same extent that such State \n. . . has jurisdiction over offenses committed elsewhere within the \nState . . . and the criminal laws of such State . . . shall have the \nsame force and effect within such Indian country as they have elsewhere \nwithin the State.''\n  Public Law 280 has been a mixed bag for both tribes and States. The \nStates that are subject to Public Law 280 possess authority and \nresponsibility to investigate and prosecute crimes committed on \nreservations, but, because of subsequent court decisions that sharply \nlimited the extent of Public Law 280's grant of civil jurisdiction to \naffected states, these states have almost no ability to raise revenue \non Public Law 280 lands. And to the extent that tribal governments \nretained concurrent jurisdiction over crimes committed by Indians on \nthese lands, such authority is currently limited, as my colleague from \nNorth Dakota states, to no more than 1 year for any one offense. Thus, \nresidents of reservations subject to Public Law 280 have to rely \nprincipally on sometimes underfunded local and state law enforcement \nauthorities to prosecute reservation crimes.\n  Section 201 of the Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 allows the \nFederal Government to reassume criminal jurisdiction on Public Law 280 \nlands when the affected Indian tribe requests the U.S. Attorney General \ndo so. If the Attorney General concurs, the United States will reassume \njurisdiction to prosecute violations of the General and Major Crimes \nActs, sections 1152 and 1153 of title 18, that occur on the requesting \ntribe's reservation.\n  The bill makes clear that, once the United States reassumes \njurisdiction pursuant to this provision, criminal authority on the \naffected reservation will be concurrent among the Federal and State \ngovernments and, ``where applicable,'' tribal governments.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask the sponsor of the bill to make \nclear that nothing in the Tribal Law and Order Act retracts \njurisdiction from the State governments, and nothing in the act will \ngrant criminal jurisdiction in Indian country to an Indian tribe that \ndoes not currently have criminal jurisdiction over such land.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is correct. The phrase that jurisdiction ``shall be \nconcurrent among the Federal Government, State governments, and, where \napplicable, tribal governments'' is intended to clarify that the \nvarious State governments that are currently subject to Public Law 280 \nwill maintain such criminal authority and responsibility. In addition, \nthis provision intends to make clear that tribal governments subject to \nPublic Law 280 maintain concurrent criminal authority over offenses by \nIndians in Indian country where the tribe currently has such authority. \nNothing in this provision will change the current lay of criminal \njurisdiction for state or tribal governments. It simply seeks to return \ncriminal authority and responsibility to investigate and prosecute \nmajor crimes in Indian country to the United States where certain \nconditions are met.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I concur with the interpretation of this \nprovision expressed by my colleague from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/24/senate-section/article/S5412-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5412-S5430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     AMERICAN JOBS AND CLOSING TAX LOOPHOLES ACT OF 2010--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington State is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to express my disappointment that \nwe have gotten to this point on this very important piece of \nlegislation that is before us, the tax extenders bill, the jobs package \nwe have been trying to get passed. We have worked very hard to put \ntogether a bill that will provide much needed help to families and \ncommunities across the country. It is a bill that will make sure our \nrecovery is not jeopardized. It is a bill that would extend tax credits \nto individuals and small businesses that both of our parties think are \nimportant. It provides incentives for clean energy companies to expand \nand create jobs at a time when we need them. It allows families in \nStates such as mine to deduct local sales tax from their Federal \nreturns, an important boost to the economy. It provides critical \nsupport for States that are struggling today to provide health care for \ntheir families in these very tough economic times. And it will extend \nunemployment benefits to support those in our communities who,\n\n[[Page S5413]]\n\nthrough no fault of their own, have lost a job and now, as the economy \nis getting back on track, need support for a few months longer so they \ncan get a job and go back to work. It is a commonsense bill to help our \neconomy get back on track. When we originally brought this bill to the \nfloor, every single Republican said no to supporting our communities. \nInstead of walking away on this side, instead of furthering their goal \nof partisan gridlock, we extended a hand to our minority colleagues and \nworked with them. We trimmed sections they wanted trimmed. We reduced \nthe support we thought was important for our families, but we reduced \nit in order to get their support and brought it back to the floor \nagain. But once again, they said no to American families. So we went \nback and a third time trimmed it back even further. We did exactly what \nthey asked us to do.\n  Now I am saying to our Republican colleagues, it is time to stop \nsaying no. It is time to stop saying no to clean energy companies in my \nhome State and across the country that depend on these tax credits to \nstay competitive. It is time to say stop saying no to the thousands of \npolice officers and corrections officers and so many others who will \nlose their jobs in my home State and everywhere if this bill does not \npass and our State has to further slash its budget. It is time to stop \nsaying no to the men and women across the country who are desperately \ntrying to find work today but need a little more help to keep their \nheads above water in these tough economic times. It is time to stop \nsaying no to middle-class families across Washington State who depend \non that sales tax deduction that would be extended in this underlying \nbill to help. They will be out hundreds of millions of dollars if this \nbill continues to be blocked.\n  We have tried very hard. Senator Baucus, chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, deserves our gratitude for reaching across the aisle time \nand time again to work with the other side. We have compromised, and \nthen we compromised again and then again. It is disheartening that the \nother side has refused to work with us. I say enough already. I go back \nhome to Washington State every weekend. I talk to my constituents. I \ntry to explain what we are doing here in Washington, DC. To be honest, \nI am having a heck of a lot of trouble explaining why when big banks \nand Wall Street were on the brink of failure and threatening to blow up \nour economy, Republicans immediately came together with us to help step \nus back from the brink. But now that Wall Street is fine, regular \nfamilies and communities are continuing to struggle, those same \nRepublicans are nowhere to be found. I don't have an answer for the \nfamilies at home who ask me about this. Quite honestly, I don't get it \nmyself. Because the fact is, we have had put together a bill that is \nfully paid for with the exception of unemployment benefits, that is a \ndirect stimulus to the economy, that has been passed as emergency \nspending time and time again under both Democratic and Republican \ncontrol, because that is exactly what it is. We have done all we can. \nIf those on the other side say no again, it is pretty clear to me they \nare putting their interests before the interests of our hard-working \nfamilies who are struggling today.\n  I know in the State of the Presiding Officer and in my State families \nare hurting. They are fighting every day to stay on their feet. I am \nnot going to stop fighting to be on their side. There is a tremendous \nlot at stake in this bill.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to follow our example and put families \nand communities and States above partisan politics and goals and work \nwith us to pass this bill so hundreds and thousands of American \nfamilies can wake up tomorrow and know the Senate was on their side.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Nomination of Elena Kagan\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly on the \nupcoming hearings the Judiciary Committee will hold on President \nObama's nomination of Elena Kagan to be a Justice on the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. I am not a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and I do \nnot envy the difficult task before the committee members. However, I \nwould like to highlight a few things I will be watching, as a Member of \nthis body with the constitutional duty to advise and consent, and \nlistening for as Ms. Kagan's nomination hearings begin on Monday.\n  First and foremost, I will be listening for indications on how \nclosely Ms. Kagan will adhere to the Constitution and the laws of our \nNation as written. The judicial oath requires judges to apply the law \nimpartially to the facts before them--without respect to their social, \nmoral, or political views.\n  Although Ms. Kagan certainly has an impressive resume in academia and \nas a political adviser in the Clinton and Obama administrations, she \nlacks key courtroom experience as either a judge or as a private \nlawyer. Therefore, it is appropriate and vitally important that members \nof the committee perform their due diligence to question her judicial \nphilosophy.\n  This is a line of questioning that Ms. Kagan herself has endorsed. In \na 1995 University of Chicago Law Review article, she wrote:\n\n       The kind of inquiry that would contribute most to \n     understanding and evaluating a nomination is . . . discussion \n     first, of the nominee's broad judicial philosophy and second, \n     of her views on particular constitutional issues. By \n     ``judicial philosophy'' . . . I mean such things as the \n     judge's understanding of the role of courts in our society, \n     of the nature and values embodied in our Constitution, and of \n     the proper tools and techniques of interpretation, both \n     constitutional and statutory.\n\n  I could not agree more with Ms. Kagan. I hope she will live up to her \nown measuring stick and provide the Senate with the open and \nconstructive answers which she has herself advocated.\n  In addition to her general judicial philosophy, I hope my colleagues \non the Judiciary Committee will question Ms. Kagan on two specific \nissues important to many Americans and many of my constituents in the \nState of Mississippi; that is, her views on abortion and the second \namendment.\n  I am concerned that many of the documents from Ms. Kagan's service as \na law clerk for the late Justice Marshall and as a political adviser \nduring the Clinton administration reflect a troubling bias.\n  Two years ago, the Supreme Court ruled, in District of Columbia v. \nHeller, that the second amendment guarantees an individual's right to \nkeep and bear arms. Ms. Kagan has said publicly that she views Heller \nas settled precedent of the Court. But as a law clerk for Justice \nMarshall, Ms. Kagan wrote a strikingly personal memo on gun rights.\n  The case in question on that earlier occasion challenged the District \nof Columbia's handgun ban that was markedly similar to the Heller case. \nIn her 1987 memo urging Justice Marshall to vote against hearing the \ncase, Ms. Kagan stated:\n\n       [The petitioner's] sole contention is that the District of \n     Columbia's firearm statutes violate his constitutional right \n     ``to keep and bear arms.'' I'm not sympathetic.\n\n  The recommendation itself is troubling, but the personal note she \nemployed is even more disturbing. Rather than pointing to text and \nprecedent, rooting her analysis in law or looking to the Constitution, \nMs. Kagan chose the personal pronoun saying: ``I'm not sympathetic.''\n  This should concern Senators because it seems to indicate a personal \naversion to the right to bear arms. I hope members of the committee \nwill question Ms. Kagan on this issue.\n  Ms. Kagan's work in the Clinton administration raises further \nquestions about her views of the second amendment. According to records \nat the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock, Ms. Kagan was a key \nadviser to President Clinton on gun control efforts. She drafted an \nExecutive order restricting the importation of certain semiautomatic \nrifles and was involved in the creation of another order requiring all \nFederal law enforcement officers to install locks on their weapons.\n\n[[Page S5414]]\n\nShe advocated various other gun control proposals, including gun \ntracing initiatives, legislation requiring background checks for all \nsecondary market gun purchases, and efforts to design a gun that would \nautomatically restrict the ability for most adults to use it.\n  In a May article, the Los Angeles Times put it this way:\n\n       As gun rights advocates viewed it, there was one clear \n     message: The Clinton White House wanted to remove as many \n     guns from the market as it could.\n\n  Records show that Ms. Kagan was a key player in this effort.\n  I believe the upcoming hearings present an opportunity to hear more \nabout Ms. Kagan's views on the second amendment--a right clearly \nenumerated in the Bill of Rights--and whether she views it as binding \non all levels of government. I am confident I will not be the only one \nfollowing her answers closely.\n  With regard to the second issue, with regard to abortion, Ms. Kagan, \nhaving neither served as a judge nor spent any significant time in a \ncourtroom, lacks a judicial record to give us insight into her views on \nabortion. But there are several red flags that show the need for \npointed questions from Judiciary Committee members on this issue.\n  First, Ms. Kagan has extensively criticized the 1991 Supreme Court \ndecision Rust v. Sullivan, where the Court upheld the constitutionality \nof the Department of Health and Human Services' regulations that \nprohibit title X family planning funds from being ``used in programs \nwhere abortion is a method of family planning.''\n  The rulings in that case and others like that case are absolutely \nvital to protecting the unborn. Congress has the constitutional duty to \nmaintain the power of the purse. If, as Ms. Kagan argues, that \nauthority should be limited in the name of free speech, then the \nAmerican people will lose the ability for their elected Representatives \nto prohibit abortion funding and provide any balance to the executive \nbranch.\n  One of the most noteworthy issues on which Ms. Kagan advised \nPresident Clinton during her time at the White House was partial-birth \nabortion--a truly reprehensible procedure. Memos from Ms. Kagan to \nPresident Clinton indicate she believed partial-birth abortion is \nconstitutionally protected. I have profound concerns about that point \nof view and believe this raises serious questions about how she would \ninterpret the Constitution if confirmed to the Supreme Court.\n  In closing, there is no doubt these are important issues deserving \nlengthy and deliberate consideration by the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nparticularly for a lifetime position on the highest Court in our \nNation.\n  I hope Ms. Kagan will adhere to her own advice and be open and \nforthright with the committee as to her judicial philosophy and views \non the specific constitutional questions I have mentioned. I look \nforward to joining many Americans in closely following Ms. Kagan's \nresponses.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, today I rise to express my concerns about \nthe pending tax extenders legislation that we are debating and will be \nvoting on in the Senate shortly. As you know, we have had a series of \nvotes on this particular question, to no avail. There is no substantive \nreason for the impasse at which we have arrived on this package. It \ncertainly could have been different. I have been involved in a number \nof discussions over the last 2 weeks with respect to how we could reach \na resolution on some of these questions, so I think it is important to \nset the record straight.\n  Frankly, I think it is the result of the yawning chasm that exists \nbetween the artificially generated political landscape in Washington \nand the actual real-world state of our economy that Americans have been \nexperiencing on a daily basis beyond the Capital Beltway.\n  If we are serious about creating jobs, we absolutely could identify a \npathway to extend the expiring tax provisions in this legislation which \nare important to America's job generators, without simultaneously and \ninexplicably raising taxes on our small businesses--the very entities \nwe look to in order to lead us out of this recession--in the name of \nincreased spending and a more expansive tax extenders package. This \napproach simply makes no sense and lays bare the stark disconnect \nbetween Washington and the entire rest of the country.\n  We hear the mantra of ``jobs, jobs, jobs'' as our No. 1 priority, as \nit should be. Concerns about the economy are foremost on the minds of \nthe American people, rightfully. That is why there is so much anxiety \nacross America today on Main Street. They do not think it is being \nreplicated in the Senate and the overall Congress with respect to the \nactions we should be taking.\n  Yet what is proposed for legislation today--which highlights the \ndisconnect between here and the rest of America--is ``taxes, taxes, \ntaxes'' and ``spending, spending, spending,'' which will do nothing to \ngrow our economy. In fact, we still have not considered a small \nbusiness jobs package, and it is now almost July.\n  What is it that we do not understand? What is happening on the \neconomic landscape and among small businesses upon whom we depend to \ncreate jobs? It is not exactly that we are mass producing jobs in \nAmerica's economy today. In fact, I met yesterday with the president of \nthe Boston Federal Reserve, Eric Rosengren, and as he pointed out, the \ngrowth the economy has demonstrated thus far is, for the most part, in \ninventory. This is not exactly real growth. It is drawing down \ninventory. But the economy has not demonstrated an ability to create \njobs and real economic growth because there is uncertainty among the \nbusiness sector and, in particular, small businesses that do not want \nto take the risk of investments or hiring additional people because of \nthe uncertainty of the policies that are emanating from Washington.\n  Last month, as we discovered with the unemployment numbers: of the \n431,000 jobs that were created, 411,000 were due to temporary \ngovernment workers--that is why our national unemployment rate is not \nworse than it is. So, ultimately, our government is the only real \ngrowth industry in this country, and I challenge anyone to seriously \nargue that is a sustainable path to a brighter economic future.\n  The fact is, growth is not occurring in our economy. I have heard \nthat time and time again. I have heard that from small businesses, \nmedium-sized businesses, large businesses, every organization that \nrepresents businesses in America. They are saying there is no real \ngrowth in our economy, and they are not going to be hiring, they are \nnot going to be making the investments necessary because of the \nuncertainty coming from Washington with respect to taxes, with respect \nto regulation, with respect to the health care legislation that became \nlaw this year.\n  So what will it require? In the Federal Reserve's analysis, it will \nrequire, in terms of reducing the unemployment rate in this country--\njust in order to reduce the unemployment rate to, let's say, 5 percent \nby 2012--in the charts they gave me yesterday, it would require at \nleast a 6-percent annual growth rate in GDP in order to equalize the \nlosses in jobs we have already experienced and suffered.\n  That rate would be slightly higher than the level of growth we \nexperienced during the recovery from the 1982 recession and \napproximately double the growth following the 1991 and 2001 recessions.\n  So when you think about it, in order to achieve a 5-percent \nunemployment rate by 2012, it would require approximately a 6-percent \nannual growth rate in 2011 and 2012. Would it be possible under the \nscenario that is occurring? Probably not because the growth is not \noccurring, and job creation certainly is not. That is disturbing, and \nit is deeply troubling.\n  In fact, I was talking to someone today who is in the business \ncommunity who said small businesses are not going to take those risks. \nYou will not see the kinds of startups in America because of the state \nof the economy, because of the policies that are coming out of \nWashington that mean more taxes and more spending, which gets to the \ntax extenders package that is before us today. And that is my concern, \nwith the detachment we have between what is happening in America on \nMain Street and what is happening in Washington, DC, in the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate. There isn't that\n\n[[Page S5415]]\n\nreality check, and that is obviously exemplified by the kind of \nlegislation we are trying to ram through the Congress, once again, that \nmeans more taxes and more spending and that is going to cost more jobs. \nIt is going to provide more risk in the economy. Therefore, we are not \ngoing to see the kind of economic growth the American people deserve.\n\n  Somehow, we think there is not a cause and effect and a correlation \nbetween what we do here and what happens across America. I know that in \nspeaking to my constituents and to small businesses, I hear it day in \nand day out. I go home and I talk to them and I listen, more \nimportantly, and I hear what they are saying. They are uniformly saying \nthe same thing: that the policies coming out of Washington cause them \ngreat pause. It causes them alarm. Therefore, they will not take the \nrisk. They will not make the investments to increase the number of \nemployees and to add to their personnel or to make the capital \ninvestments, because they do not know how much the Federal Government \nis going to cost them with respect to taxes, with respect to regulation \nand, of course, the new health care law, as well as all of the other \ntax consequences that have now resulted in this legislation that is \npending before the Senate. Somehow, people think it won't matter.\n  Then I am beginning to think that maybe people haven't read these \nprovisions to understand exactly how they work, and that is why there \nis so much concern and apprehension across America. That is why \nCongress has such a low approval rating that has certainly crossed the \nhistoric thresholds in terms of how low it is, and understandably so, \nbecause there is no connection. There is no correlation between what we \nare doing and what is happening in America and in small businesses and \nin family households which have lost their jobs and are enduring \nanxiety and apprehension about where the next job is going to come from \nand how they are going to make ends meet.\n  So we truly have our work cut out for us when we look at the low \neconomic growth, the inability to create jobs and, frankly, the fear. \nWhen we think about what has been created in this economy, from their \nstandpoint, it isn't so much the problems we are dealing with today, it \nis the direction Congress is taking with respect to the issues that \nmatter most to them in order to take the risks we need them to take in \norder to reverse this economic cycle.\n  Also, when we think about the projections for economic growth, this \nbill doesn't take into account the potential effects of what is \nhappening in Europe and the economic turmoil that certainly could \nengulf our own economy or the potential fallout from the BP disaster in \nthe gulf. That has not manifested itself in the unemployment numbers or \neconomic growth. It is a travesty what is happening there, and it \ncertainly is devastating a way of life and so many small business \nowners. So that is another dimension and component we will have to \nincorporate in our calculations for the future. Certainly, that will \nhave an impact on the bottom line with respect to job creation and our \nability to see the kind of growth we require in order to reverse the \ndeclining growth in America.\n  We certainly have our work cut out for us. That is what makes me \nwonder exactly what world we are living in here in Congress as we pay \nlip service to job creation, when in reality we are instead on a \nglidepath toward higher taxes on America's job generators and at \nprecisely a moment in time when we should be providing the kind of \nrelief I have been advocating for through small business legislation. I \nhave been championing it for 6 months now--6 long months. I started in \nJanuary. I thought it was going to be on the front burner. It is still \nlanguishing on the back burner. So much for jobs being a priority. So \nmuch for depending on small businesses to create those jobs. So we have \npaid no deference to the greatest issue that is facing America today, \nand that is job creation and the economy. That is the No. 1 priority of \nthe American people. But here we are approaching July and it is yet to \nbe on the legislative calendar, even though I have been promised. I \nknow the Presiding Officer, who serves on the Small Business Committee, \nhas been a great advocate and a champion for small business tax relief \nand creating jobs and how vital it is. We have had numerous hearings on \nthat question before our committee which underscores the imperative of \npassing a small business tax relief program so they can generate jobs \nbecause they are the one entity that creates jobs in America. But we \nhave yet to consider the small business tax relief jobs package. It is \napproaching July. I had a package prepared in mid-March and I was asked \nto defer because we were promised that we will be considering a small \nbusiness jobs package before the April recess. Well, April has come and \ngone. May has come and gone. June has come and gone. Obviously, July \nwill come and go, before it becomes law--so it is regrettable.\n  It is a red herring to suggest that a potential $12 billion small \nbusiness jobs bill might mitigate the damage of some of the initiatives \nthat are incorporated in this tax extenders bill that is now pending \nbefore the Senate and that we will vote on shortly with respect to \ncloture. That is my point here today. Because when we do consider a \nsmall business jobs relief package, and we provide the billions of \ndollars that are necessary to jump-start our economy to small \nbusinesses with tax relief, at the same time we are imposing additional \ntaxes on small businesses in the tax extenders package, that will not \nneutralize the circumstances for small businesses. It only makes it \nworse. So on one hand we could provide some benefits and on the other \nhand we take them away.\n  Let us remember that those increases will be in addition to the tax \nincreases on the small business flow-through income that is expected to \nincrease from the current rate of 35 percent to 39.6 percent, as well \nas a tax on capital gains that is scheduled to rise from 15 percent to \n20 percent at the end of this year. Astoundingly, the tax rate on \ndividends 6 months from now will rise from 15 percent to as high as \n39.6 percent, which is a 264-percent increase. That is not even taking \ninto account some of the marginal tax effects such as the phaseout of \nitemized deductions that will raise the rate even higher, or the tidal \nwave of uncertainty headed toward the business community as they \nevaluate and grapple with, as I said earlier, the health mandates \nresulting from the legislation that was passed in December. It doesn't \neven incorporate the Medicare payroll taxes that were imposed on small \nbusiness in the health care reform law: $210 billion worth of taxes \nthat were inserted in the health care legislation that became law in \nDecember, that imposes a payroll tax on small businesses. It also taxes \nunearned income and investments for the purposes of the Medicare \npayroll tax that also will affect small businesses to the point that \nthere will be a net increase of 67 percent in capital gains on small \nbusinesses as a result of that legislation that became law in December.\n  So the cumulative effect of all of these tax increases is going to be \npronounced on the ability of small business to create jobs, let alone \nmake investments in equipment that is so essential to expanding and to \ngrowing.\n  As my colleagues see on this chart I have on display that was issued \nin May of 2010 by the National Federation of Independent Business, the \nforemost organization that represents small businesses in America, \nsmall business optimism at an unprecedented low. It is not surprising, \ngiven the status of the economy today. In fact, there is virtually no \neconomic growth occurring, because we don't have a growth strategy. We \nhave a tax strategy, we have a spending strategy, but we don't have a \ngrowth strategy. The administration doesn't have a growth strategy. \nCongress doesn't have a growth strategy. There has been no regard or \ndeference to a growth strategy that ultimately would encourage small \nbusinesses, or any size business in America today, to take the risks to \nmake those investments, because there is too much uncertainty, in \naddition to all of the potential tax increases that will occur at the \nend of this year, not to mention those that have already occurred and \nthe ones that are pending in this tax extenders legislation we will be \nvoting on shortly with respect to cloture.\n  In the tax extenders bill, we are imposing a $9 billion tax on small \nbusinesses and $13 billion of retroactive new taxes on global \nbusinesses. On\n\n[[Page S5416]]\n\ncompanies that do business abroad, there are retroactive taxes as well. \nRetroactive tax increases are a bad habit. It is a bad practice. It is \nbad policy to reach back and now tell businesses: Oh, by the way, we \nhave changed our mind. Let's reach back and tax you. You might ask: \nWell, how far back? Because that is the question I have asked. How far \nback do you tax? Well, guess what. Back to the first event that \nrepresents a capital gains event, as far back as it goes because we \nhave changed our mind.\n  Well, it is very difficult, when you have to meet a bottom line--\nwhich is anathema to Congress because we don't have to meet a bottom \nline. We don't have to balance our budgets. We don't have to worry \nabout how much we spend and how much we tax, because we don't have to \nbalance it out, but businesses do, in a very challenging and fragile \neconomy. Yet we are suggesting, oh, by the way, let's have retroactive \ntax increases.\n  It is regrettable that we have to go that far, exhibiting a total \ndisregard for the effect it is going to have ultimately on the average \nperson in America who is seeking to get a job and can't find one \nbecause businesses aren't hiring. They are virtually at a standstill, \nand rightfully so, in their hesitancy and their reluctance, because \nthey don't know what is coming next out of Congress. We don't even \nknow, because a lot of these provisions were sort of dumped in there \nthat we didn't have hearings about. So by the way, we have changed our \nmind and we are going to reach back and tax you. Maybe it is a year, \nmaybe it is 2 years. Whenever you have that first event that is taxable \nunder this provision, we will reach back and we will tax you.\n  The tax offsets in this bill are worse than the lack of an extension \nof the existing policy. That is why the provisions in the bill are too \nhigh a price for any major business or organization, from the Chamber \nto NFIB to Business Roundtable, to support it in its current form.\n  It didn't have to be this way. I certainly laid out a blueprint. I \nwant to be very clear about this. I laid out a blueprint of how we \ncould proceed to a consensus solution to passing a responsible tax \nextenders package. I worked diligently. I answered every call. I went \nto every meeting for the last few weeks since this became an issue, in \ngood faith, to attempt to extend the unemployment benefits that I think \npeople rightfully deserve, as well as to help with the reimbursement \nfor doctors that, by the way, we have known has been a problem for more \nthan a year. I know I stood on this floor last fall, during the time we \nwere considering the health care bill that was pending before the \nSenate, and after which $210 billion worth of Medicare taxes were \ninserted in the health care bill--$210 billion that was a tax on small \nbusinesses.\n  I said: If you are going to take that route, if that is the policy \nyou are going to embrace, then why not defer it and pay for the doctors \nreimbursement to avert the 21-percent reduction. Why not use it for \nthat purpose? If you are going to raise Medicare payroll taxes, at \nleast use the revenues from Medicare, within the Medicare system--\nknowing this was a serious problem.\n  With a 21-percent reduction in doctors reimbursements in the Medicare \nProgram that was scheduled for January, we knew we had a problem. Yet, \non one hand, we raised Medicare taxes on small businesses, and we used \nit for other purposes--to expand other programs--rather than targeting \nit to the very problem and issue that existed in the Medicare Program \nthat we knew about. How practical is that? Of course, it is not \npractical.\n  We knew with that $210 billion we could have arrived at a permanent \nsolution at least for 10 years on the doctors reimbursements--for 10 \nyears. We would have had a decade solution, rather than this ad hoc \napproach, where we are reconsidering it every 6 months or every year \nand putting the patients as well as the doctors through this endless \ncycle, which has almost become perpetual, as to whether we are going to \nprovide for the reimbursements or allow the cuts to go forward. It \nbecomes gamesmanship that is, unfortunately, at the expense of Medicare \npatients, because they hear from the doctors: We don't know what we are \ngoing to be able to do. We hear it from the providers who are \nchallenged, because Medicare rates are hardly reflective of the true \ncost of delivering that care. My State has the second lowest rate of \nMedicare reimbursements in the country. We know doctors are dropping \nMedicare patients. So it has a pernicious effect. We could have taken \ncare of that proactively and done something reasonable and pragmatic. \nWe could have funded a 10-year solution that we knew was in the area of \n$200 billion, because we had another bill on the floor that said let's \ndo the doctor fix but let's not pay for it. It was in the approximately \n$200 billion range. But that wasn't to be. It certainly didn't have to \nbe this way.\n  I have sought to balance the necessities by identifying tax offsets, \nurging that the stimulus money be reprogrammed so these funds are spent \nin a timely manner, as was the intention when this body passed the \nstimulus bill.\n  With respect to the unemployment benefits extension in this \nlegislation, I have long advocated for this, and I voted for them in \nthe past, obviously. I think we have a responsibility to pass \nextensions until the economy improves and until we can demonstrate that \nthe economy can create jobs. I understand and appreciate some of my \ncolleagues who believe these extensions should be fully offset. I just \ndon't happen to be in that category, until we can turn the economy \naround and produce jobs--particularly at this time of high \nunemployment, which is at the rate of 9.7 percent, and that has been \nthe status quo with minimal changes. That means Congress has to enact \neconomic policy to foster job creation. I would not impede unemployment \nbenefits by insisting they are not emergency spending and should be \nfully paid for. I believe there is a majority that supports that \npolicy.\n  I recommended, why not separate the unemployment benefits and move \nthat along? Why put people at risk who are unemployed? We could have \ndone that and separated this out several weeks ago, which I proposed \nand recommended, and we could have separated the doctor fix and paid \nfor it. Actually, we ended up doing that. That is what we did 2 weeks \nlater. We could have done the same with unemployment benefits--\nseparated it and moved it along, assuming that, of course, we had \nunanimous support on the majority side for that. We could have done \nthat. I certainly would have supported that.\n  It is important so that people aren't kept in turmoil, wondering \nwhether they are going to have additional benefits. I thought we should \nhave addressed it as a separate matter, rather than entangle it with \nother muddled policies being swallowed up in this legislative morass \npending today.\n  I supported State aid for Medicaid. As I said, this program should be \noffset by unobligated stimulus funds. In the stimulus bill, we provided \nfor additional funding for Medicaid. Had we known then what we know \nnow, we could have provided an additional year, instead of lower \npriority, longer term, less effective spending. After all, stimulus is \nsupposed to be timely, targeted, and temporary. If the money hasn't \nbeen obligated, obviously, it is none of those things at this point. So \nwhy not redirect it for more stimulative purposes? And certainly doing \nit for the Medicaid Program is highly stimulative, along with \nunemployment benefits. That is the maximum stimulus you can provide in \nthe economy today. I said let's redirect those funds and spend them on \nFMAP.\n  In the substitute extenders package proposed last night there was a \nbreakthrough on that issue that became a consensus item for a brief and \nshining moment. Apparently, some on the other side objected to the \noverall package on several of the other issues I will get to in a \nmoment. I have had some serious concerns with some of the proposals \nthat small businesses in this legislation have, particularly when it \ncomes to subchapter S corporations. There was an indication that, as I \nwas told last week, those new taxes would be removed because of the \npunitive effect they would have primarily on small businesses, again, \nthe group we are depending on to create jobs. Yet, last night, the tide \nturned again, and I was informed that they would in fact remain in the \ntax extenders legislation.\n  These revenue provisions that have never been the subject of \nhearings,\n\n[[Page S5417]]\n\nhave never been seen by the public, would significantly damage the \nbusiness environment for businesses both large and small, just at a \ntime we should be creating businesses, not curtailing them. The \negregious provision regarding subchapter S corporations would harm \nmillions of small businesses in their ability to create those jobs. \nUnder section 413, a new burdensome payroll tax of 15.3 percent is \nimposed on subchapter S corporations on the dividend distributions paid \nto employee owners, to family members, who are shareholders or \npartners, and unbelievably, retained earnings in the business when \ndistributions are kept in the business for reinvestment. At a time of \nfestering high unemployment, this is exactly the wrong prescription for \njob creation.\n  The provision is aimed, as I have been told, at a specific abuse of \nthe S corporations wrapped in a partnership, which is a business format \nthat allows a business owner to inappropriately divert more money than \nis justified to nonsalary distributions that are not subject to payroll \ntaxes. Unfortunately, in order to prevent this specific abuse, the \nauthors had to write a very expansive anti-abuse provision causing \ncollateral damage to taxpayers who are not abusing the system and \nimposing payroll taxes on retained earnings on small businesses. This \nis a job killer, because retained earnings are the most reliable form \nof capital available to small businesses. While there have been clear \nabuses of existing law regarding reasonable compensation, it should be \nnoted that the IRS successfully prosecutes cases where business owners \ninappropriately divert salary income to dividend distribution.\n  In fact, the ruling as recent as May 27 of this year in David E. \nWatson PC v. United States proves that the ``reasonable compensation'' \nstandard can be workable. Yet, it is not a clear bright line test that \nis either easy for the IRS to enforce or for taxpayers to understand.\n  That is why I worked diligently, along with my staff, to find a way \nto address this abuse and agree that if we could find a way to improve \nupon and make clearer the ``reasonable compensation'' standard, we \nshould do so. In fact, my staff, last week, was at Joint Tax to do just \nthat. Then I was informed that the subchapter S provision would be \nremoved in its entirety from the tax extenders bill, so we didn't \nproceed any further, because I was told it was not going to be in this \nlegislation. Obviously, that all changed last night when it summarily \nwas reinstated.\n  Unfortunately, the new regime that would be created in this \nlegislation is less effective for either compliance by taxpayers or \nenforcement by the IRS; it is the current reasonable compensation \nstandard.\n  One week ago, the majority leader offered to remove the provision \nfrom the bill and I accepted this. Unfortunately, negotiations must not \nhave been as clear, because last night that offer to drop that \nprovision was fully rescinded. The provision in S. 4213 replaces 20 \nyears of law with wholly untested, expensive, very difficult to \nadminister new standards that attempt to address situations that, under \ncurrent law and practices, are already not permitted. Specifically, \nthis provision would impose Medicare and Social Security taxes at a \nrate of 15.3 percent on the first $106,800 of both wages and dividends, \nas well as 2.9 percent on amounts retained in the business, even when \ndistributions are kept in the business for reinvestment. Retained \nearnings are the most reliable form of capital for a small business \nbecause the owner doesn't need to go to a bank to apply for a loan or \nto investors to seek infusion of equity.\n\n  This tax would appreciably reduce that capital at a time when other \nsources remain exceedingly difficult to access. At a time of high \nunemployment, this is exactly the wrong direction for job creation. In \nfact, this new levy would kill jobs and discourage hiring throughout \nthe economy.\n  While I commend the authors of the bill for attempting to rein in the \ngame playing that can take place, this bill is extraordinarily more \nbroad than addressing just that problem. Unfortunately, in their \ncritique of my efforts to address these problems, neither the \nWashington Post nor the New York Times editorial pages have taken into \naccount anything but a pithy one-line description of the effects of \nthese provisions. It is unfortunate because this new tax on small \nbusinesses and medium-size businesses is a broadside attack on what has \nbeen for decades a job-creating engine of the economy.\n  The substitute pending before the Senate would create vague new terms \nand tests for the IRS interpretation and taxpayer confusion as to \nwhether payroll taxes are owed. These new terms and tests would replace \nthe reasonable compensation standard for a list of specific service-\nbased businesses. The new test would impose payroll taxes on certain \nprofessional service businesses, if 80 percent of the income of the \nbusiness is attributable to three or fewer shareholders of the firm. \nWhile these terms are certainly less onerous than an earlier version of \nthe substitute, each of these new terms will be subject to IRS rulings \nand inevitable litigation.\n  I will start outlining my concerns with the ``attributable'' to \nshareholders'' concepts. This standard is no easier for the IRS to \ninform or taxpayers to understand than is the current ``reasonable \ncompensation'' standard. Does ``attributable'' mean that if a law firm \npartner brings another partner and an associate to meet with a \nprospective client, that the income generated is ``attributable'' three \nways? Or does it depend on who performs the most billable hours? If the \nassociate performs the majority of billable hours with only sign-off \nfrom the partner, to whom is this income ``attributable''?\n  Frankly, this new proposed standard is no clearer than the current \n``reasonable compensation'' standard that is also very dependent upon \nspecific ``facts and circumstances.'' Why would we replace one standard \nwith something no more enforceable by the IRS and is just a trap for \ntaxpayers?\n  Another component of the bill that is no clearer than ``reasonable \ncompensation'' is the test of ``substantially all of the activities'' \nof the firm. Two issues arise with respect to this phrase. First, this \nis clearly not an objective revenue test; it is a subjective \n``activity'' test, meaning that these employers would now be required \nto keep timesheets of all their employees, even if a firm or profession \ndoesn't currently track billable hours. This would create a whole new \nexpensive paperwork morass with no point other than compliance with \nmindless tax rules.\n  Further, whether ``substantially all'' means more than half, three-\nquarters, or 90 percent of ``activities'' is not defined in the \nstatute. We simply do not know the definition of ``substantially all.'' \nNeither would the IRS or the business owners. This doesn't advance \ncompliance or enforcement to a level any better than the existing \n``reasonable compensation'' standard.\n  Turning now to the additional provisions, I want to point out that \nthe list of ``professional service businesses'' in the legislation is \nat best obtuse, and at worst, it is simply a quagmire for litigation. \nProfessions targeted for this tax include services ``in the fields of: \nhealth, law, lobbying, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial \nscience, performing arts, consulting, athletics, investment advice or \nmanagement, or brokerage services.''\n  While it is sometimes clear which businesses are included, for other \nbusinesses and professions the new definition is not so clear-cut. We \ncan only assume that with the expansive regulatory authority granted in \nthis bill that other service providers would be ensnared. Years of \nregulatory effort and litigation will eventually sort out whether the \nfollowing would be subject to this provision: Web designers, who are \nnot software ``engineers;'' interior designers, who are not \n``architects;'' tax preparers, who are not ``accountants;'' real estate \nor insurance agents, who are not ``brokers;'' writers, who are not \n``performers;'' beauticians, who are not in ``health.''\n  Then there are other service providers who would be ensnared the next \ntime Congress is seeking additional revenues, including plumbers, \nelectricians, hairdressers, construction contractors, heating oil \ndistributors, car mechanics, recruiting and staffing firms, and \nprofessional fundraisers, just to name a few.\n  Every day this provision has been public--and that is a total of only \n1 month 4 days--we seem to find another\n\n[[Page S5418]]\n\nunintended consequence of the provision. Five days from now, we are \nlikely to find five more unintended consequences.\n  I wish to specifically raise two additional unintended consequences \nthat have been brought to my attention. The first of these, of which my \ncolleagues may be unaware, is that this provision would reduce the \nSocial Security benefits of early retirees who invest in a family \nmember's business. This issue was raised by the American Institute of \nCertified Public Accountants and results because the shareholder would \nbe deemed to have additional wages through the proposal's family \nattribution rules, which then reduces Social Security early retirement \nbenefits. I am disappointed that the sponsors of this provision have \nnot addressed this problem despite having known about it for at least \ntwo iterations of their bill.\n  If a parent invests as a shareholder in the business being set up by \ntheir adult child, then this legislation would count the dividend \ndistributions as earned income subject to a payroll tax, which reduces \nthe early retirement benefit of the parent. This tax would either be a \nshock to investors who had no idea about this complication or \ninvariably, to the extent it is known, it would reduce investment by \nfamily members in entrepreneurial businesses. Of course, this would \nreduce a critical form of capital for startup businesses. Why does the \nmajority feel the need to starve young entrepreneurs of the ability to \nget startup capital from their parents?\n  A second specific unintended consequence concerns the complex web of \nanti-abuse rules that is created to prevent ``leakage'' from the S corp \nshareholder provision. It ensnares limited partners of partnerships. \nThe bill imposes payroll taxes on the limited partnership income of \nemployees for whom these limited partnership shares are like an \nemployee stock purchase plan. Employees are not subject to payroll \ntaxes on stock purchase plans distributions. Further, limited partners \nare not subject to payroll taxes because this is investment income. But \nto combine the two and for some reason to impose a 15.3-percent payroll \ntax on the investments of middle-income employees is inexplicable. \nDespite this known problem, it was not addressed even in the version of \nthe bill that was released last night and pending before the Senate.\n  I want to be clearly understood that this provision was publicly \nreleased on May 20 and was adopted by the other body on May 28 with \nvirtually no debate on an $11 billion tax hike. There have been no \nhearings on this proposal in either the House or the Senate. While the \nchairman has modified his initial proposal and it is now a $9 billion \ntax, significant concerns remain. Notably, the number of groups that \nare supporting my amendment to strike this provision sent a letter to \nboth the chairman of the committee and the ranking member about that \nearlier version, emphasizing that ``this new tax is an excellent \nexample of what happens when the legislative process is short \ncircuited.''\n  This chart is an illustration of the number of organizations that \nhave written letters to Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley of \nthe Senate Finance Committee about this legislation. It says new taxes \nwould hurt job creation, would reduce the capital these employers have \nto create jobs and invest in their businesses--an excellent example of \nwhat would happen when you short-circuit the legislative process.\n  That is exactly the end result of this legislation. It is ill-timed, \nand it is poorly targeted. I appreciate the support from Senators Enzi \nand Ensign, who joined me in offering an amendment--unfortunately, we \nhave not had the ability to offer it--to strike it in its entirety so \nwe can take a step back and address only the abusive situations without \ncapturing everybody else. That is going to affect job creation in small \nbusinesses and entrepreneurs in America at a time when we desperately \nneed them.\n  We are now making a broadside attack on job generators. Regrettably, \nthis will affect small and medium-size businesses. They are not in a \nposition to shoulder this enormous burden as we look to them to create \nthe jobs our economy so desperately requires right now.\n  I have been asking for months on end, as I said earlier in my \nstatement, for a small business tax relief and jobs package that is so \ncentral to what we require in our economy today because of virtually no \neconomic growth, no job creation. We are nearly into July, so 6 months \ninto this legislative calendar and there is no legislative package on \nsmall businesses yet. What are we doing? More taxes and more spending--\nthat is exactly what is represented in the tax extenders bill.\n  I attempted to address these issues over the last few weeks and to \nreach a consensus and solution. As I said, removing the doctor fix and \npaying for it separately--eventually that happened, and that was \nimportant; removing unemployment benefits to move that along so people \ncan get their unemployment benefits without having them lapse and \nexpire during this challenging economy; and then, of course, address \nall the other issues to make sure we are getting it right. That is what \nit is all about.\n  It is a matter of practicality and reasonableness that we get it \nright and not force more taxes on the very entities we depend on to \ncreate the jobs people deserve in America today to go back to work and \nto support their foundation of financial security rather than removing \nit.\n  At a time when we should be encouraging and nurturing small \nbusinesses, we are stifling the entrepreneurial spirit by adding $9 \nbillion more in taxes with an ill-conceived provision that has had no \nhearings, no examination, no evaluation. It is a terrifying template \nfor additional taxes on small businesses when they are already facing \nmore taxes as a result of the health care bill. No wonder small \nbusinesses are bewildered and are unwilling to hire new employees.\n  In the final analysis, America's small businesses would benefit \ngreatly from the extension of myriad tax provisions, but they do not \nwant this bill at any cost, not when they are going to have to be \npaying some very onerous and punitive taxes under this legislation. \nBecause it will be virtually all small businesses that are going to \nface and bear the brunt of the consequences of this legislation and the \ntaxes it represents. It is going to continue the stagnation with \nrespect to job creation. It is going to further that and the \ndeteriorating trend within our economy with respect to job creation and \nwith the lagging economic growth that is reflected in today's economic \nenvironment.\n  For all those reasons, I will not be voting for the tax extenders \npackage. I regret it because I thought we had reached a consensus. \nObviously, that was not to be. Hopefully, we can continue our \ndiscussions at a time when we can reach a consensus.\n  But I think it is important in the final analysis to state the fact \nthat these impasses and the stalemate and the deadlock that result time \nand time again that require cloture votes are really not necessary if \nwe are willing to listen to one another, to reach across the political \naisle, and to build a consensus on the issues that are so important to \nAmerica and so crucial to reversing the economic direction of our \ncountry, where more than 70 percent of the American people believe \nAmerica is moving in the wrong direction with respect to the economy \nand yet we have failed to address it satisfactorily because we are not \nwilling to listen, not willing to work, not willing to do the things \nnecessary to create the right kind of legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I have a unanimous consent request which \nthe Senator from Arizona will appreciate. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe cloture vote on the Reid motion to concur in the House amendment to \nthe Senate amendment to H.R. 4213 with the Baucus amendment No. 4386 \noccur at 5:14 p.m. today, with Senator Kyl recognized to speak for up \nto 2 minutes and Senator Baucus recognized to speak for up to 2 minutes \nprior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I will not take 2 minutes.\n  First let me say that I associate myself fully with the remarks of my \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Maine.\n\n[[Page S5419]]\n\nHer analysis and criticism of the so-called S corp provision and \nretroactive tax provisions should be heeded by all of us.\n  I thank my colleague from Maine for her indefatigable work on this \nbill and her leadership to reduce its costs and fix its bad policy. She \nhas spent countless hours working in a bipartisan way to develop an \napproach that will extend unemployment benefits, ensure physicians are \npaid properly for caring for Medicare patients, and reduce the fiscal \nimpact of the bill. It is certainly through no fault of her own that \nthe product before us remains unsupportable. No one has fought harder \nto support the small businesses that create jobs in America than \nSenator Snowe.\n  We need to extend the tax provisions in this bill and achieve its \nother objectives. Like my colleague, I hope we can reach the right \nresult, one that responds to our constituents' pleas that we stop \nspending and taxing and focus on job creation and economic growth.\n  The other side has offered several versions of the so-called tax \nextenders legislation. Unfortunately, each version has had at least two \nthings in common with the previous versions--an increase in taxes and \nspending that leads to increased deficits. The provisions raising taxes \nare permanent changes even though they are being used to offset short-\nterm tax cuts. I would like to focus on one of these tax increases that \nwill be particularly harmful to many of our Nation's small businesses, \nwhich are incorporated as S corporations.\n  Currently, limited partners pay payroll and other employment taxes on \npayments received for the services that they provide. Partners in small \nbusinesses organized as S corporations pay employment taxes on their \ncompensation even if the earnings are not distributed. The Baucus \nsubstitute filed last night would essentially require partners \nproviding ``professional services'' to pay payroll taxes on their \ninvestment income as well.\n  The intent of the provision is to prevent cases of abuse as when \nformer Senator John Edwards used the organization of an S corporation \nto avoid paying the 2.9 percent Medicare tax he owed as a lawyer on his \nwages. Edwards earned $26.9 million during the late 1990s while only \nreporting $360,000 in salary.\n  However, the IRS has the ability to go after firms and individuals \nwho do not pay themselves a reasonable wage using the reasonable \ncompensation test. The service has already successfully litigated cases \nwhere compensation was considered less than reasonable. A few examples \nare Radtke v. US, 712 F.Supp. 143 (7th Cir., 1990) and Spicer \nAccounting v. US, 918 F.2d 90 (9th Cir., 1990).\n  Furthermore, Congress just gave the IRS another anti-abuse tool when \nit codified the economic substance doctrine as part of the healthcare \nbill. Consequently, if the structure of the business is designed solely \nwith the intent of avoiding the Medicare payroll tax, it would lack \neconomic substance and the IRS could disallow it.\n  Not only does the IRS already have the ability to go after those who \ntry to avoid paying taxes through S corporation revenue abuse, but the \nprovision as it is currently drafted will create uncertainty, cause \nadditional compliance problems and unfairly hit those it is not \nintended to impact.\n  One problem with the current proposal is that it will be very \ndifficult to trace the hours of work for certain shareholders and link \nit back to the firm's revenues. Lawyers and CPAs can track their hours \nbecause that is how their businesses operate, but other service \nprofessionals such as engineers and architects do not.\n  As such, this will be especially burdensome for a number of the \ncovered businesses at a time when we are counting on these same small \nbusinesses to generate jobs.\n  The provision also does not define what amount of participation in \nprofessional services activities determines if one must pay the new \ntax. The House version says ``substantially all.'' The Senate version \nseems to suggest that even very limited participation in any of the \nactivities listed under the new definition of professional services \nwould be subjected to the tax. Is that the intention?\n  Finally, the family attribution rules would appear to hit inactive \nfamily members who are solely shareholders and do not actively \nparticipate in the day-to-day operations of the business by subjecting \ntheir investment income to payroll taxes.\n  The bottom line is that this provision unnecessarily treats the \nincome of 4 million small businesses organized as S corps all as wages, \nwhich undermines the entire rationale for having flow-through entities: \nto avoid the double taxation of entrepreneur's income. How are small \nbusinesses suppose to grow and hire more workers to get us out of this \nrecession if we keep creating impediments to expanding investment \nopportunities?\n  The most galling aspect of this debate is that if the extenders bill \npasses with this roughly $10 billion tax increase on small business, \nthe next tax bill we expect to consider is a bill to help small \nbusinesses with just $5 billion in tax relief. So the net effect of \nthese two bills would amount to a $5 billion tax increase on small \nbusiness. I just don't understand the logic. Of course, the real logic \nis simple: Supporters of the bill need more offsets to pay for the \nincreased spending. I support the efforts of the senior Senator from \nMaine to strike this tax on small businesses, and I commend her for \nleading the effort to solve this problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, let us remember what this bill is all \nabout. This bill will help American families face this great recession. \nThis bill works to strengthen our economy and put Americans back to \nwork. This bill would create jobs. That is what people want. It would \ncut taxes for businesses. That is what people want. It would facilitate \nsmall business loans. It would foster investment in highways and other \ninfrastructure. This bill would cut taxes for families paying for \ncollege. It would cut taxes for teachers. It would cut taxes for \nAmericans paying property taxes and sales taxes. It would extend \nunemployment insurance, health care tax credits, housing assistance for \npeople who have lost their jobs. It would help States cover the cost of \nlow-income health care programs.\n  This week, 900,000 out-of-work Americans have stopped receiving \nunemployment insurance benefits. Why? Because Congress has failed to \nenact this bill.\n  This has been a difficult fight, but it does not have to be \ndifficult. In previous recessions, in previous Congresses, it was not \nthis hard. But for months now, we have addressed Senators' concerns.\n  Senators expressed concern about the size of the bill. So we cut the \ntotal size from $200 billion, then down to $140 billion, then down to \n$118 billion, now less than $110 billion. We cut spending on health \ncare benefits to unemployed workers under COBRA. We cut spending on the \n$25 bonus payments to recipients of unemployment insurance. We cut \nspending on the relief to doctors in Medicare and TRICARE. We cut \nspending on help to States for Medicaid by one-third. Senators asked \nfor more spending cuts. We came forward with more spending cuts. Since \nthe first time the Senate passed this bill, we found $77 billion in new \noffsets. This bill is now 70 percent paid for.\n  I just want to say that there is a great need for this bill. \nAmericans want this bill passed, and, frankly, I very much hope this \nbill does pass. We do need the 60 votes.\n  We do not need the 60 votes; the American people want us to pass this \nlegislation.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, pursuant to rule XXII, \nthe Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. \n     4213, the American Jobs and Closing Tax Loopholes Act, with a \n     Baucus amendment No. 4386.\n         Harry Reid, Max Baucus, Patrick J.

On this vote the yeas are 57, the nays are 41. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I indicated to my friends on the \nother side of the aisle I would be propounding a consent agreement. Let \nme make a few brief observations and then I will do precisely that.\n  The majority wants to make this debate about Republicans opposing \nsomething. Let me be perfectly clear: The only things Republicans have \nopposed in this debate are job-killing taxes and adding to the national \ndebt. We have offered ways of paying for these programs and we have \nbeen eager to approve them.\n  What we are not willing to do is to use worthwhile programs as an \nexcuse to burden our children and our grandchildren with an even bigger \nnational debt than we already have. So the biggest reason the cloture \nvote we just had failed is because Democrats simply refused to pass a \nbill that does not add to the debt. That is the principle we are \nfighting for in this debate, and let me suggest that I can prove it. In \na moment I will offer a 1-month extension of the expired unemployment \ninsurance benefits, COBRA subsidy, flood insurance program, small \nbusiness lending program, and the 2009 poverty guidelines. This \nextension would be fully paid for using the very same stimulus funds \nthat our friends on the other side just voted--almost unanimously--to \nredirect for these purposes. Let me repeat that. We would pay for the \nextension with a Democratically approved stimulus offset.\n  If the Democrats object to extending these programs using their own \nstimulus offset to pay for them, then they will be saying loudly and \nclearly that their commitment to deficit spending trumps their desire \nto help the unemployed.\n  Let's be clear about the principle that is at stake here. Are our \nfriends on the other side willing to extend these programs without \nadding to the debt? That is the real question in this debate.\n  So, in that regard, I ask consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 4853; that all after the enacting \nclause be stricken and the McConnell amendment at the desk be agreed \nto; that the bill as amended be read a third time and passed and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, Madam President, for 8 \nweeks Senator Baucus and Senator Reid have negotiated with Republicans \nin an attempt to pass this important jobs bill. They have been asked to \nmake the package smaller, which they did. They have been asked to pay \nfor portions of the package, which they did. And still Republicans \ncontinue to filibuster and stop this bill.\n  What the Senator from Kentucky wants to do would be virtually \nunprecedented, that we would pay for the emergency spending for \nunemployment compensation by removing money from our jobs program, the \nstimulus program. So he is going to kill jobs on one side to pay for \nthe unemployed on the other side. It makes no sense economically and it \nis certainly not within the tradition of the Senate, and I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I would only briefly offer that the \noffset I offered was one that the majority just voted for. Obviously \nthey did not find it offensive in the context of the measure that was \ndefeated.\n  We will continue to work on this in the hopes that we can pass this \nworthwhile measure without adding to the national debt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The filibuster that has been waged by the Republicans in \nthe Senate has gone on now for 2 months to stop unemployment benefits. \nWhat the minority leader just offered was a 1-month extension. We have \nbeen limping and dragging our way from one short extension to another, \nand that is not fair.\n  It is not fair to 80,000 people in Illinois, unemployed, who just \nlost their unemployment benefits because of the Republican filibuster. \nWhy do the Republicans oppose this bill? Well, the good reason they say \nis the deficit. But let me tell you the real reason. The real reason is \nbecause this bill pays for virtually all of the programs except \nunemployment by making changes in the Tax Code, changes to which the \nRepublicans object.\n  Let me give you an example. One of the changes would eliminate the \nloopholes in the Tax Code which allow American businesses to relocate \nAmerican jobs overseas. We know what that means to manufacturing in \nthis country. We are losing good-paying jobs right and left, and the \nTax Code rewards the companies that make those bad decisions. We want \nto eliminate that, and the Republicans want to protect it.\n  Secondly, this bill provides help to small businesses across America, \nand we pay for it. Third, this bill will provide money to governments \nso we would not have to lay off teachers, policemen, firefighters, and \nnurses. That is going to happen. We are trying to send emergency money \nback to the States to avoid that.\n  The Republicans continue to filibuster it and to say no--no to \nplugging up the loopholes so jobs will not move overseas, no to the \nassistance for small businesses so they can create jobs, and, no, so \nthat we can help to protect the jobs of the people who protect us in \nour homes and communities and schools.\n  I do not understand the Republican sentiment. There used to be a \nbipartisan sentiment that when America faced a disaster, we would pull \ntogether, whether it was the flooding and hurricanes in Louisiana or \nthe disastrous situation in the Gulf of Mexico. We have a national \nemergency with this recession and 14 million Americans out of work.\n  We are asking only--only--to extend them an unemployment check so \nthey can feed their families--literally feed their families for the \nnext few months. The Republicans continue to filibuster and continue to \nsay no.\n\n[[Page S5421]]\n\n  The record is clear. It is a party of no which is hoping the voters \nwill vote yes in November. I hope they will remember that the \nRepublicans had no alternative when it came to this disastrous economic \nsituation, and we are doing our best to create jobs and help those who \nhave lost their jobs through no fault of their own.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                             Gulf Oil spill\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I want to show the Senate \nPensacola Beach yesterday. It has hit us full force. That white is the \nnatural sugary sand of the northwest Florida beaches. You can see as \nfar as the eye can see down to the beach. It is covered with this black \ntar-like sludge.\n  This was yesterday. More rolled in last night. There have been \nattempts to get out and scoop this up. This, as you can see, is not the \ntar balls, the little quarter-sized or dime-sized tar balls that have \nhit the beaches before. No. What this is showing is when you have \n60,000 barrels a day gushing into the Gulf of Mexico now for more than \n2 months, and that very likely will continue to gush for the rest of \nthe summer--that is another 2\\1/2\\ months. It shows you what is the \npotential that is being portended.\n  Another picture here from yesterday, Pensacola Beach. This is where \nthe pier is. Here is the gulf. Here are the waves crashing in. This is \nfar over this sugary white sand that you can see how much oil has \ncollected.\n  In the middle of the day when the Sun is beating down, it stays \nalmost fluid like this. As the Sun goes down and it cools, this will \nstart to become a more viscous consistency. As much as we want the \npeople to come and enjoy our beaches--and this is the height of the \nseason on the world's most beautiful beaches--is this going to be an \nincentive for them to come? You can imagine the lost income from the \nhotels, the restaurants, and all of the ancillary businesses.\n  So this is a saddening reality, but it is a glimpse of what it is yet \nto become with that much oil out there in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Let me just give you a couple of iterations. They have said by \nputting this top hat--that is like a funnel to siphon off a lot of it \nuntil they can finally kill the well. They are saying it is going to be \nthe end of August, the first part of September before they can get down \nto the bottom, the 18,000 feet below the seabed, intercept the well \npipe, and then put cement down in it to kill the well.\n  Until that point, they are trying to siphon it off at the well head, \nwhich is where the blowout preventer failed. Remember, they went in \nwith one of those big shears and they clamped off the pipe called the \nriser pipe, and they put this kind of funnel over it called a top hat, \nand they are siphoning off.\n  They said they have been able to siphon off 25,000 barrels a day. \nWell, that is very good, except 60,000 barrels a day are gushing. So as \nmuch as they can continue to siphon that off, at least maybe, certainly \nnot half but at least some is being siphoned off and taken up to a \ntanker on the surface 5,000 feet above the seabed.\n  But you know, check the Weather Channel. There is a tropical wave \nthat is now developing in the South Caribbean. If you look at the \nNational Weather Service projection of where it is going to go, it is \ngoing to intensify. It is going to become a tropical depression. Then \nit is going to likely become a tropical storm. Who knows, it may be a \nhurricane. And its projected path is to go right up in the Gulf of \nMexico toward this damaged well. What happens? The ships cannot stay \nout there if a hurricane is coming. They have to go in and find safe \nport. So some 5 days before the arrival of the hurricane, the ships \nwould have to decouple, stop the siphoning off of the 25,000 barrels, \nand, therefore, the entire 60,000 barrels a day would be gushing.\n  Well, for how long? It would be 5 days before the hurricane and \nanother 5 days after the hurricane passes before they can get back out \nthere, reposition their ships, reattach the top hat. We are talking \nabout a total of 10 days with no siphoning that 60,000 barrels a day \nand 600,000 barrels will have gushed into the gulf. That is three times \nthe amount of oil that was spilled by the Exxon Valdez just in that 10-\nday period.\n  So, of course, what I am asking is that the U.S. Navy preposition \nships so we can have a surge of ships to come to the site after a \nhurricane has passed, so that extra 600,000 barrels of oil that has \ngushed from when they had to shut down would be skimmed.\n  Now, let me tell you about the skimmers. Still today there is not a \nsufficient command-and-control structure as much as this Senator has \ncontinued to ask the incident command and the unified command: How many \nships do you have out there? What kind are they? What are their \npositions? I still cannot get a straight answer to that. What is more \nis that the Navy has a series of smaller boats that are skimmers in \nport. That is pursuant to the law. Where you have a port, under the \nClean Water Act and under the Oil Spill Act, and all of those existing \nlaws, you have to have the capability, if there is a spill in port, to \ngo in and clean it up. The Navy has some 45 vessels that can do that.\n  Out of those, only six have been deployed to the gulf. These are \nboats that are basically 30 feet long. We cannot use them out in the \ngulf, but we can sure use them in the bays. When the oil goes through \nthe pass or the inlet into the bays, we can have those additional \nsmaller boats that skim up the oil before it gets into the bays.\n  Out of those 40 boats, the Navy has identified another 27. Would you \nbelieve that until 2 days ago they still had not approved getting those \n27 boats which the Navy has identified that they can put on trailers \nand bring to the gulf coast to preposition them in those bays to \nprotect the estuaries?\n  This Senator has called the head of the EPA, Lisa Jackson. \nFortunately, on that very afternoon, she had approved the EPA signing \noff with a waiver for those boats, to allow those boats to leave those \nports to get to the place where the big oilspill is. It has only been \ngoing on for over 2 months now. But at least that approval is in.\n  But as of this afternoon--that was over 2 days ago. But as of this \nafternoon, this Senator cannot get those boats on trailers and on their \nway.\n  Let me give an example. All along this beautiful beach there are \nseveral passes. Others call them inlets. At the State line, the \nAlabama-Florida State line, is Perdido Pass. That goes into Perdido \nBay. That is shared by Alabama and Florida.\n  Further to the east is Pensacola Pass. That goes into Pensacola Bay, \nthe cradle of Naval aviation, at Pensacola Naval Air Station. It is \nright there on Pensacola Bay. That is where 2\\1/2\\ years ago, in a Fish \nand Wildlife boat in Pensacola Bay, that orange mousse that looked so \nawful was flowing in and flowing right toward downtown Pensacola. We \ngave a longitude and latitude position, and I think somebody got it \nbefore it got downtown. That is where the smaller boats can help and \nneed to be prepositioned.\n  Go further east. We have an interesting different kind of pass. It is \ncalled Destin Pass. It is the only inlet going into a huge bay that \nborders Eglin Air Force Base, called Choctawhatchee Bay. It is huge, \nwith a lot of wetlands.\n  This pass, unlike Pensacola Pass, is shallow. But because it is \nshallow, the incoming tide rushes through. You can imagine the force of \nthat current, that once the oil gets to that point it is going to carry \nit into the bay. It is all the more reason we need the small Navy boats \nin the bays to skim it up before it gets into the wetlands.\n  Because of all of the booming we have done--and I was just there \nMonday inspecting the booming--when that tide comes rushing in, a lot \nof those booms are not going to hold it. They even have sophisticated \nsystems that we are trying to get. Since it is a shallow pass, you put \non the bottom a pipe that shoots air up and therefore would get oil \nsuspended below the surface, shoot it to the surface so you could \ncollect it with booms, if the booms will hold in that onrushing high \ntide.\n\n  Go further to the east, it is the pass going into Panama City, St. \nAndrews Bay, again, a deepwater pass, a similar situation. We need the \nskimmers in there. And then go further to the east, to a place where my \ngrandfather came on a boat, my great-great-grandfather, 181 years ago, \nwhen my family came to Florida in 1829 to Port St. Joe, inside a \nnatural bay that is created because of the arm of a cape called Cape \nSan Blas.\n\n[[Page S5422]]\n\nFrom the tip of that cape to the mainland is only about a mile and a \nhalf. It is hard to boom that. There, again, is why we need additional \nskimmers in that bay. If the skimmers out in the gulf can't get it \nall--and with so much oil in the gulf, that is going to be a chore--\nthen at least we have a fighting chance of getting it in the bay.\n  It is with a heavy heart that I show a picture from yesterday in \nPensacola Beach. It is a fact. This isn't the only time. We are going \nto be faced with this for months, indeed, probably for years. It is not \nonly going to be the gulf coast, because when this oil shifts to the \nsouth and gets in a current called the Loop Current, that will carry it \nsouth to the Florida Keys, which becomes the gulf stream, which will \ntake it up the east coast of not only Florida but the eastern seaboard \nof the United States.\n  I remember after Hurricane Andrew that valiant emergency operations \ncenter director who said, when there was no Federal resources coming \nin: Where is the cavalry?\n  I am asking now: Where is the cavalry? The cavalry is all these extra \nskimmers for the bays. The cavalry is the extra surge capacity of \nadditional skimming, when a hurricane comes through and all that extra \noil is gushed out. I am asking for the cavalry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom Florida, for his comments, bringing the proper focus to the issue \nof skimmers. It is something I have been talking about for weeks. I \nhave been coming to the floor for the past week to talk about the lack \nof response from the Federal Government in keeping oil off our beaches, \nout of our intercoastal waterways, out of our estuaries in Florida. I \nsaid earlier this week that I would come to the floor every day until \nwe had good answers as to where the skimmers are. It makes absolutely \nno sense that we do not have a more robust effort from the Federal \nGovernment to keep the oil from coming onshore. Right now we have not \nonly tar balls on our beaches, we have large swathes of brown oily slop \nthat have come ashore in Pensacola. It breaks one's heart to see it.\n  When I was there last week meeting with the President, I talked to a \nwoman who was working at the dock, right on the pier. She is a woman \nwho sells food to folks coming to the pier. I asked her: Are people \ncoming out since we have had the oilspill to see the beach?\n  She said: Yes. The folks who are coming haven't seen the beach in a \nlong time. They are coming to see the beach one last time, as if they \nare visiting a family member who is on his or her deathbed.\n  We know BP is responsible. We know they cut corners. We know they are \nresponsible for ultimately paying for all of the economic damages. But \nthere is another part of this equation, and that is the Federal \nGovernment. The Federal Government is here to do what local and State \ngovernments cannot do at a time of disaster, and that is to marshal \nunbelievable resources to prevent harm to the people, to the \nenvironment, and to the economy.\n  As I have come to the floor over the past week, I have talked about \nthe fact that we can't get a straight answer as to how many skimmers \nare actually off the coast of Florida. These are ships that suck the \noil off of the water and keep the oil from coming onshore. Today we \nstill don't have a straight answer. The Federal Government tells us in \ntheir shore operations report from the National Incident Command that \nthere are 118 skimmers. But yesterday they told us these reports are \nnot accurate and that there are, in fact, 86 skimmers. So we have the \nnumber 118 and we have the number 86. We have a number from the State \nof Florida that is different. The number from the State of Florida was \n31, 25 plus 6 additional skimmers that the State of Florida had to go \nout on their own and get. They took the initiative to get the skimmers \non their own because they were not getting them from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Today the report is different. It is shown in a different way. When \nwe called to ask the State of Florida, they couldn't tell us how many \nskimmers there were. Yesterday it was 31. The Fed said 118. But then \nthey say the number is really 86. Whether it is 31, 86, or 118, it is \nnot enough.\n  Why is it not enough? There is a huge area between Pensacola and \nPanama City that needs to be treated by the skimmers, let alone the \nrest of the area that goes all the way over to Louisiana. We know there \nare about 400 skimmers in the Gulf of Mexico, but there are 2,000 \nskimmers in the United States.\n  Before I talk about domestic skimmers, I want to talk about the \noffers of assistance that have been made by foreign countries to help \nus. We are the greatest country in the world. When there are disasters, \nwhether they be in Southeast Asia with the tsunami or Haiti with an \nearthquake or Central or South America with an earthquake, we send \nresources, volunteers, teams of people, aid. We are there to help them. \nThe world community has been offering us assistance--some of it free, \nsome of it they want paid for, but assistance nonetheless. We are \ncoming to find out that we are not responding to their offers of help. \nThe State Department has reported as of last week that we had 56 offers \nof assistance from 28 countries or international groups. But we have \nonly accepted 5 of these offers, 5 offers of assistance out of 56. We \nhave a lot of great skimmers that are working in the Gulf of Mexico, \nbut some of them are pretty small, to be honest. We are happy they are \nthere. A small skimmer is better than no skimmer.\n  But let me show a skimmer that was offered to the United States that \nis not a small skimmer. In fact, it is a huge vessel. This was offered \nto us by a Dutch company called Dockwise. This ship is called the Swan. \nIt could be outfitted with skimming arms. It was available to go to the \ngulf. The U.S. Government didn't return the call. It was offered on May \n6. Now some 50 days later, it still has not been responded to. It is \nstill under consideration. This ship is able to take up 20,000 tons of \nmaterial, whether it be oil, or an oil/water mixture, 20,000 tons. This \nis not some skimmer that can go on the back of a train or on a boat or \nan airplane and be flown down to the gulf or trucked or trained down to \nthe gulf. We are happy to get those too. This is a serious piece of \nship equipment. We haven't called them back.\n  Guess what. This is no longer available. Instead it was replaced by a \nship with one-twentieth of the capacity, a U.S. ship. I am all for \nAmerica first. I am all for using U.S. assets. But this is not an \neither/or situation. We should be using American ships and \ninternational ships. We gave up a ship with 20 times the capability \nthat could be out there in the gulf sucking up this oil, perhaps \nkeeping it off the beaches of my State, off the beaches of Pensacola, \nand we didn't return the phone call. Nor did we return the phone call \nto the other 51 offers of assistance. It is beyond belief.\n\n  Let me go back a second and talk about the domestic skimmers. This \nmap I have in the Chamber is going to be a little hard for you to see, \nbut I want to walk through it. This shows different parts of the \ncountry, broken up by districts. In each of these districts, there are \nskimmers.\n  Where did we get this information? We got this information from the \nU.S. Government, from the Coast Guard because Admiral Allen said, a \nweek ago, there are 2,000 skimmers in the United States.\n  Why are not the vast majority of those skimmers in the gulf right \nnow? What is the holdup? We hear about legal entanglements. Is it the \nJones Act, is it Federal law, is it local law, is it EPA restrictions \nthat are keeping skimmers in different parts of the country in case \nthere is an oilspill?\n  I asked the President of the United States about this last week in \nPensacola, and he said: Well, we are trying to get all the skimmers we \ncan. Obviously, Admiral Allen wants to get all the skimmers we can, but \nsome of those skimmers need to stay in place in case there is an \noilspill.\n  Well, Mr. President, there is an oilspill. It is in the Gulf of \nMexico. And saying we are not going to bring skimmers because of legal \nentanglements or constraints from other parts of the country because \nthere might be an oilspill there is like me saying we are not going to \nsend the fire engine to your house that is on fire because there might \nbe another fire someplace else.\n\n[[Page S5423]]\n\nThis is the worst environmental disaster in the history of this country \nand every available resource should be used.\n  As shown on the map, this is district 8 right here, which is the \nTexas area. This is district 7, which is Florida, Georgia, South \nCarolina. The number of skimmers in the Texas area is 599. The number \nof skimmers in the Florida district is 251. So between these two areas, \n850 skimmers, just between Texas and all the way up to South Carolina.\n  How can it be that there are 850 skimmers in, basically, the Gulf of \nMexico States--with the exception of going around to South Carolina; \nbut we are talking about Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, \nLouisiana, Texas--how can there be this many skimmers--850--but we only \nhave 400 in the gulf right now, if that number is correct? How can that \nbe? How can we be 65-plus days into this and not have those skimmers in \nthe Gulf of Mexico, when they are virtually there anyway, according to \nthis report, or right next door?\n  Beyond this 850 in the district that encompasses all the way from \nNorth Carolina up to the mid-Atlantic, we have another 157 skimmers. Up \nhere, in the New England area, there are another 160 skimmers. Up near \nMichigan, there are 72 skimmers. If you go over to California--and we \ncan bring these things through the Panama Canal or, if they are \nsmaller, they can be flown in--in this California district, there are \n227.\n  So we are literally talking about more than 1,000 skimmers that are \navailable, but we only have 400, if this number is correct, at work. It \nis hard to believe the response is this anemic. It is hard to believe \nthere is this lack of urgency or sense of purpose in getting this done.\n  I see my colleague from Louisiana is in the Chamber. Her State has \nbeen impacted worse than any other so far, and I know she wants every \navailable resource off the coast of Louisiana to stop this oil from \ncoming ashore, just as our friends in Mississippi, in Alabama do, and \njust as we do in Florida.\n  This is not a partisan issue. I want the President to succeed. I want \nthe Coast Guard to succeed. But right now it is not just oil washing up \non the shore of Florida, it is failure. We have to do more. We have to \nget focused and get passionate and get something done about this issue.\n  I will keep coming to the floor to talk about this issue as long as \nit is a problem, as long as we keep refusing foreign help, as long as \nwe have thousands of available skimmers in this country to do the job \nthat should be done. I should look off the coast of Pensacola and see \nan armada of skimmers doing the job that needs to be done to keep this \noil off our beaches, out of our waterways, and out of our estuaries. So \nI promise to be back until the problem is solved. I hope I do not have \nto come back because I hope I can report in a positive way that the \nFederal Government has gone into action and we are doing what we should \nbe doing for our people and for our environment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, before I speak briefly about the subject \nI came to the floor to speak about, which is small business--I am chair \nof the Small Business Committee--I want to thank our colleague from \nFlorida for his advocacy for the gulf coast, as we struggle as to how \nto stop this gusher in the gulf and to clean up what has been done.\n  We have recently seen some terrible photographs from the beaches of \nFlorida. We have photographs equally as troubling from the marshes of \nLouisiana. I want to thank the Senator for his leadership, and we are \nall going to double our efforts to get this job done, and to do it in a \nbalanced way.\n  As upsetting as this oil is, in trying to clean it up, and keep it \nfrom our shores--both the beaches and the marshes--we also have to find \na balance as to how to let this industry at some point move forward \nwith these 33 rigs or we are going to lose the entire deepwater gulf \ndrilling, which will put thousands--tens of thousands--of people out of \nwork, some of whom live in Florida; and some of the businesses benefit, \nas well as so many in Louisiana.\n  But I thank my colleague for his continued effort, and we will look \ninto some of the issues he has raised and push as hard as we can from \nLouisiana as well.\n  Mr. President, I know my colleagues are on the floor to speak about \njob creation. That is why I am here as the chair of the Small Business \nCommittee.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, you have had a great deal of \nexperience in your own role, before being a Senator, as a bank \npresident and as a lender for small business. You know how important it \nis.\n  I start by sharing this graph I have in the Chamber that shows that \nfrom 1993 to 2009, 65 percent of the net new jobs created were created \nby small firms with 1 to 500 employees--65 percent of the jobs. Large \nfirms created 35 percent of the jobs. So I suggest this is a very \nimportant topic for us to be discussing, and I am very pleased the \nleader wants to bring this small business bill to the floor next week.\n  We have been--many of us--clamoring to get to this debate, and I want \nto see this bill move forward if we can work out a few minor \ndifferences. This package has been put together with very good \nbipartisan cooperation, from my view as the chair of the Small Business \nCommittee, both from our committee and then the Finance Committee has \ndone its part as well. But there are a few items I wish to highlight \nbecause there are some agreements that must be reached and some points \nI wish to make briefly.\n  First of all, let me briefly describe the small business provisions. \nOne is the increase in 7(a) loans from $2 million to $5 million; 504 \nloans from $1.5 million to $5.5 million; and microloans from $35,000 to \n$50,000. If I could, I would lay an amendment down to raise that to \n$100,000.\n  We have had testimony from business advocates--from conservative to \nmoderate to liberal advocates--saying this is one of the most important \nthings we need to do to stimulate lending to small businesses through \nthe Small Business Administration, to give capital, to give credit to \nthese small businesses that can create the jobs I am talking about. We \nmust get credit into the hands of small businesses from Maine to \nCalifornia to Texas to Louisiana to Washington State, and these small \nbusinesses, if we can strengthen the SBA programs, can, in fact, begin \nto turn this recession into a job creation era and opportunity. That is \nin the bill. It passed our committee 17 to 1--a great bipartisan vote.\n\n  The Small Business Export Enhancement and International Trade Act, \nwhich Senator Snowe has worked so hard on--and I want to commend her \nfor her work; and I have worked with her on this as well--this is a \nchallenge for us. Less than 1 percent of small businesses in America \nare exporting. I want to say that again. Less than 1 percent of \nAmerica's small businesses are exporting.\n  The market is overseas. The population growth is overseas. If we do \nnot help our small businesses with technical assistance and support to \nbe able to allow them to position to market, particularly with the \nability of the Internet today--an extraordinarily exciting tool--with \nbroadband, high-speed Internet, there are opportunities for a person, \nwhether they are in Chicago, IL, or in New Orleans, LA. If they have a \nproduct, they can go on the Internet, show the product, and it can be \nshipped to China or India or any other country in the world, and the \nprofits can come home right here and jobs can be created. That is in \nthis bill, and it is extremely important we move to it and figure out \nthe few problems we have with it.\n  There is the Small Business Contracting Improvement Act that has not \nbeen completely worked out, but I want to take a moment to speak about \nit. The Federal Government is one of the largest purchasers of goods \nand services in the world. If we are going to try to help businesses, \nwe most certainly, in my view, should strengthen the opportunity to \ncontract with small businesses so the Federal Government can purchase \ngoods and services. We want to allow small businesses to do that. There \nis a problem we are trying to work out that Senator Thune has raised, \nand I look forward to working with him over the weekend to work through \nthat.\n\n[[Page S5424]]\n\n  The fourth section of the bill is the Small Business Community \nPartner Relief Act. This would allow SBA, upon request by a woman \nbusiness center or a microloan intermediary, to waive or reduce the \nnon-Federal share. Why is this important? We have also added $50 \nmillion to the small business development centers. Small businesses \ncannot necessarily create the jobs they want to create without help and \nsupport. We have a great network. We have a great backbone, a great \nreach through women business centers, through university-based centers, \nand this bill we are going to bring to the floor next week has support \nfor them so they can then reach out and help small businesses on Main \nStreet.\n  This bill is not about Wall Street. I have heard as much about Wall \nStreet as I want to hear and so have the people in my State. We want to \nstart hearing about Main Street at home, businesses that are struggling \nand need our support and our help.\n  We also have some additional sections for the 8(a) improvements, and \nI have offered a section of the bill that I think is very important to \nhelp the 11,700 businesses that, unfortunately, on the gulf coast are \nstill paying off loans from the last disasters 5 years ago, Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita.\n  As you heard Senator LeMieux from Florida and as you have heard \nSenator Nelson from Florida, now we have another catastrophe along the \ngulf. I have asked, in this bill, for some interest relief for these \nbusinesses. Some of these businesses are paying $1,000 a month--$700 in \ninterest, $300 on principal. And that is the example that Jaimie \nBergeron of Fleur de Lis Car Care in New Orleans presented to our \ncommittee. This bill would allow the owners, the Bergerons, right now--\nwhere their sales are down; the region is threatened--to go from paying \n$1,100 a month down to $300 or $400 a month.\n  We can afford to do this now. We have to be able to give these small \nbusinesses some relief. There is some opposition to this provision. I \nhope people will think about how important this is for these gulf coast \nbusinesses. We have had support not only from our local newspaper, the \nTimes-Picayune, but even the New York Times has said the people of the \ngulf coast deserve a break. We need a little help, and we need it now. \nGiving these small businesses some interest relief would be a great \nhelp.\n  Finally, in this bill, the White House has put forward, and I \nsupport, $30 billion for small business lending. We have the estate \nsmall business credit initiative developed by Senator Warner, Senator \nLevin, and others. We have $1 billion going to community development \nfinance institutions that are not banks but lend money to neighborhood-\nbased, grassroots organizations that then turn around and lend money to \nsmall businesses. So there are some great provisions to include in this \nbill.\n\n  We have a few things to work out over the weekend with my colleagues \nfrom the other side. I just want to say that no one could be working \nharder than our committee, both Democrats and Republicans, to try to \nbring a consensus to this floor.\n  In good faith, I come to ask my ranking member, Senator Snowe, please \nlet's work hard over the weekend to work these final provisions out so \nwe can provide to the American people not only a bill that works for \nthem--and Senator Stabenow helps us grow small business--but a bill we \ncan actually enthusiastically support in a bipartisan way. I think the \nAmerican people deserve our best efforts. I am going to work double-\ntime over the weekend, even doing some other things I need to do in my \nhome State to get this work done, and I look forward to being here on \nMonday to see if we have been able to achieve that.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, would my friend be willing to yield for \na question?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. First, if I might, I wish to take a moment to say thank \nyou to the senior Senator from Louisiana for her leadership on small \nbusiness. Her efforts in terms of job creation and availability of \ncapital and so on is right on point.\n  My question would be, is it the Senator's desire to have this done by \nthe end of next week so we can move this forward and hopefully have \nthese benefits take place as quickly as possible for our small \nbusinesses?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Absolutely. It is my desire to have many conversations \nover the weekend. There are just a few points that need to be worked \nout. The Finance Committee has done its portion of the work, and I \nthank Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley. Senator Snowe and I have a \nfew other things to work out.\n  The Senator from Michigan is correct. This effort on the part of the \nSmall Business Administration is crucial to change these programs, to \nlift their limits, provide some support for them to be able to help \nreach out and support our small business growth throughout the country.\n  The White House has worked very hard on this $30 billion capital \ninfusion to the banks. The Independent Bankers of America supports the \n$30 billion in additional capital that would be available to them, \nagain, not for lending on Wall Street or Fancy Street but on Main \nStreet where the Senator from Michigan and I come from, to get money \ninto the hands of small businesses. It is imperative particularly for \nwomen-owned and minority-owned businesses that have been particularly \nhard hit by this recession. Some of the provisions reach right to those \ndisadvantaged neighborhoods in our country that need the most help \nright now in creating jobs for people of every different walk of life.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from \nLouisiana again because she is focusing on jobs. That is what we are \nfocusing on every day here, with every bill: jobs, putting people to \nwork, supporting small businesses, supporting manufacturers, and \ngetting this economy going. So I thank her for her leadership.\n\n\n         AUTHORITY TO SIGN ENROLLED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nmajority leader be authorized to sign any duly enrolled bills and joint \nresolutions on today, June 24.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, this evening we had a vote that I find \nto be extremely concerning. Once again, after 8 weeks of trying to work \nout some kind of an agreement with our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle to overcome a Republican filibuster--changing our jobs bill \nover and over and over again, and every time there was a change, then \nthere was something else and something else--we finally hit a brick \nwall tonight, when we didn't know what else to do. Once again, we did \nnot have one Republican colleague willing to vote with us to overcome a \nfilibuster. We have the votes on the floor to pass this jobs bill, \nwhich includes incredibly important benefits for people who are \ncurrently out of work, to extend unemployment benefits.\n  People who have worked hard all of their lives, through no fault of \ntheir own, find themselves in this situation, and they are asking us to \nsimply help them be able to keep a roof over their head and food on the \ntable for their families and maybe a little bit of gas in the car so \nthey can go look for work, while we can continue to focus on creating \njobs in what has been a terrible economic crisis for our country.\n  We have the votes. If we were doing a majority vote, we would have \nthe votes. We have more than enough votes, but what we don't have is \nenough votes to overcome a filibuster. That takes at least one \nRepublican colleague, and we don't have that. We don't have any at this \npoint. So, therefore, it is estimated that by the end of this month, \nover 87,000 people in my great State of Michigan will lose their \nunemployment benefits, the little bit of help they get to be able to \nhelp them keep going. A lot of people are going back to school, but \nunemployment benefits are paying for the rent or food. People are \ntrying desperately not to lose their houses on top of losing their \njobs. This is a desperate situation for almost 1 million people across \nthis country.\n\n  All we get over and over again is, no. We are creating jobs in this \nbill, putting money and partnerships in with manufacturers to create \ncapital for manufacturers, and all we hear is no; capital for small \nbusinesses to be able to invest and grow their businesses and hire \npeople, and all we are getting is no; the ability for States and local \ngovernments to keep police officers and\n\n[[Page S5425]]\n\nteachers and firefighters on the job, and all we hear is no.\n  The resounding no has been to help anyone who currently finds \nthemselves out of work because of no fault of their own and needs to \ncount on the ability for us to have unemployment benefits. This is an \noutrageous situation.\n  Before turning it over to my colleague from Ohio, who I know shares \nmy deep concern about what has been happening, let me remind people \nthat despite the fact that we are beginning to grow the economy, we \nhave turned the corner. When President Obama came into office, we were \nlosing 750,000 jobs a month. With the Recovery Act, we got that down to \nzero. We are turning the corner, but we still have five people out of \nwork for every one job opening. What happens to them, while we are \nworking as hard as possible to turn this economy around? What happens \nto them? Those are the people we are fighting for every single day. \nThey are the people we care about here on the floor of the Senate, and \nwe are going to keep coming back and fighting because they deserve to \nknow there are people here who understand what they are going through.\n  I will now turn it over to my colleague from Ohio for a few moments. \nThen I will make a few more comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan. \nI think the Senator said it exactly right. She talks about statistics \nand so many people being laid off. Yes, 750,000 people a month were \nlosing their jobs when President Obama started in office. We are seeing \njob growth now but not as much as we would like.\n  In Ohio, in April, we had the largest job growth in the country, with \n37,000, which is not great, but it is better than when President Obama \ninherited this economy from President Bush. I think when you speak to \nindividual people, you understand it.\n  I want to share a handful of letters from constituents. I know \nSenator Stabenow gets letters like this from Lansing, Grand Rapids, all \nover Detroit, and everywhere in her State, from people who have been \naffected by the failure of the Republicans to want to extend \nunemployment benefits.\n  It seems to me that our Republican colleagues--the people who \nconsistently voted no on something as simple as extending unemployment \nbenefits--some of them view unemployment as welfare, when it is called \nunemployment insurance not unemployment welfare. When you have a job, \nwhether you live in Detroit or Columbus or whether you live in Dayton \nor Toledo, you pay into the unemployment insurance fund when you are \nworking, and you get assistance when you are not. That is the whole \npoint of unemployment insurance. You hope you never need it, like you \nhope you never need your car insurance, to cash in your car insurance, \nor you hope you don't need your health insurance. You want it to \nprotect yourself. That is what unemployment insurance is. I think some \nof my colleagues, who are so ultra conservative, think it is welfare. I \ndon't understand that because very few people in the public think that.\n  Too many colleagues--the people who vote no on extending unemployment \ninsurance--don't know anybody who lost their job or they don't know \nanybody who has lost her insurance or anybody who has lost their home.\n  Senator Stabenow is out all the time in Michigan. She is all over the \nState. I will be in Columbus tomorrow, and I will also be in Lorraine \nand Cleveland tomorrow. I think a lot of colleagues who vote no on \nextending unemployment insurance simply don't meet with people who \nmight have lost their job. They hang around with other Senators and \nwith people who are pretty privileged. Do they look somebody in the eye \nand say: What is it like to lose your insurance or your home?\n  Try to imagine somebody--a parent or a husband and wife or a mother \nand father--who lost their job and lost their health insurance and are \nabout to lose their home, and they have to explain to their 12- or 13-\nyear-old child: We are going to have to move and don't know where we \nwill be living, and I don't know what school district we will be in \nyet. Just think of the uncertainty and sadness of that. I don't think \nthey think about that.\n  Maybe we can help by sharing a few real letters from people in Akron \nand Lima and Cleveland and Urbana, around Ohio. I will share these.\n  Ellen from Summit County, in Akron, writes:\n\n       I am writing to make you aware of my situation, which I \n     fear is very similar to that of many other people.\n       If an unemployment insurance extension is not passed, it \n     will in essence destroy my family. We are struggling to keep \n     our bills paid and have come to the point of alternating \n     months on paying our mortgage and utility bills.\n\n  Think of that--one month you pay your mortgage and the next month you \npay your utility bills, hoping that neither will your utilities be cut \noff nor your home foreclosed on.\n\n       We need this extension. Until my husband lost his job, he \n     worked over 20 years in the banking industry--he has more \n     than paid into the system to receive his fair share of \n     compensation.\n       We are nine years into our 30-year mortgage and are at risk \n     of losing our home. We are fighting just to stay above water.\n       A UI extension will in no way guarantee our future, but it \n     will at least give us a chance.\n\n  Like most people who have worked for years, people don't ever choose \nto lose their jobs. They are not getting rich on unemployment. It is a \nbridge until they find a job. As you know, unemployment insurance \nallows you to receive the benefits you need to keep looking for work. \nYou send in resumes. I get letters from people all the time saying: I \ndrive in a five-county area looking for a job, I apply more, and I send \nin resumes and nobody answers half the time because they are buried \nwith resumes.\n  Aaron, from Allen County, near the Indiana border in Lima, writes:\n\n       I worked at a company for 19 years before it was closed and \n     moved to Mexico.\n       Since then, I went back to college to earn a mechanical \n     engineering degree, while working part-time.\n       But I recently lost my unemployment benefits, which means I \n     won't be able to support my family.\n       There are so many people in my situation. If unemployment \n     benefits are extended, it would help thousands of dislocated \n     workers and their families.\n\n  Mr. President, it is not just the individual help for these families, \nit is their next-door neighbor because if Aaron's house is foreclosed \non, the next-door neighbor's home drops in value. If he gets his \nunemployment, the local hardware store will get some of that money, as \nwill the local clothing store and the local restaurant or grocery store \nwhere they are spending this money. The unemployment insurance that \npeople receive--according to former Presidential candidate, John McCain \nand one of his top economic advisers--has the biggest multiplier effect \nof any stimulus. It doesn't stay in the pockets of the unemployed \nworkers very long. It immediately goes into the community and is spent \nand respent.\n  Here are the last two letters I will read. This is from Elizabeth \nfrom Cuyahoga County, the Cleveland area:\n\n       I turned 60 this year and have spent the last 30 years as a \n     computer programmer. Since losing my job, I have tried to \n     learn new programming skills to make me a stronger applicant.\n       In the meantime, I apply for every single job that I can \n     possibly perform. I have hoped beyond hope for jobs at \n     grocery stores, home health care agencies, and retail stores.\n       I am now at the end of my rope. I don't have any other \n     ideas of what to do. I have worked for 42 years, since high \n     school, and even full-time while attending college.\n       Those who are not unemployed or have no one in their family \n     who is unemployed, don't understand what it feels like. I \n     have other friends who are losing their unemployment benefits \n     now and in the coming weeks. I am not out here by myself.\n\n  I simply cannot imagine someone voting against extending unemployment \nto Elizabeth or Aaron or Ellen or if they know people who have lost \ntheir benefits, who have lost their jobs, their health care, or their \nhomes. I cannot imagine anybody standing on the floor of the Senate, \nwhen their names are called, saying Mr. Burris, Ms. Stabenow, or Mr. \nBrown, and saying no.\n  Lastly, Jane, from Champaigne County, west of Columbus near Dayton, \nin Urbana:\n\n       I am an unemployed mother of two children. I will lose my \n     unemployment benefits by the end of the month.\n       I go above and beyond the minimum requirements to receive \n     unemployment benefits. I apply to 4 to 10 jobs per week.\n       It's not that I don't want to work, as some people are \n     implying. I worked in the same job for ten years, since I was \n     19 years old.\n\n[[Page S5426]]\n\n       I lost that job through no fault of my own, which is the \n     story of most unemployed Americans today.\n       I have lost my house and my car. My family's American dream \n     has been crushed. If this bill doesn't pass, my family's \n     nightmare will be just the beginning.\n       Please do whatever you can to urge your fellow Senators \n     that this extension is needed. This vote shouldn't be about \n     anything else except the American people.\n\n  Mr. President, they could not have said it better. I can read their \nletters and meet with people like this, but I cannot understand because \nthat has never happened to me. I wish my colleagues--those people who \nwalk down in this well when their name is called and vote no on \nextending unemployment benefits to these workers--these people live in \nevery State and, frankly, they should be ashamed of themselves for \nvoting no.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Ohio. There are \nmany things we share in common: a love of the Great Lakes, and we have \na rivalry in football and baseball and our great universities, and so \non. But we also share a tremendous passion for what is happening to our \npeople. I thank Senator Brown for his fight on behalf of manufacturers \nand the people who, in fact, need a voice. I thank him very much for \nthat.\n  It is so hard to know what to say when you read these letters or e-\nmails or take phone calls. Most people cannot understand what in the \nworld is going on around here. But what is going on? Don't we get it? \nWhat is going on here?\n  Unfortunately, I think the Senator from Ohio, when he says that maybe \nit is that folks have never met someone who lost their job or had it \nhappen in their families--it has happened in my family. About half of \nthe families in Michigan have somebody who has lost their job. We \ncertainly get it, and we understand what is going on now. We know \npeople are lining up for work. Whenever there is an announcement for \njobs, 50 jobs are hiring at a business or 100 jobs, literally I have \nseen people lined up around the block--hundreds and thousands of \npeople--because people want to work.\n  The people who are out of work now are people who have worked all \ntheir lives. They have played by the rules. They are now trying to \nfigure out what happens and how they can turn it around for their \nfamilies and keep going.\n  The bill in front of us, like many things we have put forward in the \nSenate this year, has been all about jobs. That is where we are. It is \nnot a slogan to say jobs, jobs, jobs. That is what we are focused on. \nNext week, we are going to focus on small business jobs. We will see \nwhat happens in the Senate.\n  The jobs bill that we have been focused on for 8 weeks has major \nprovisions to help manufacturers. I was pleased to include provisions \nthat helped manufacturers be able to get some refunds on their taxes if \nthey put it back into equipment and hiring people, and there are other \nprovisions in the bill. It is about jobs.\n  Frankly, we have two different views of the world, two different \nbeliefs that I think are reflected in what has happened to our country. \nI look back only because we are debating the same values, the same \nchoices that got us where we were and where we are today. Those are the \nsame kinds of choices that our friends on the other side of the aisle \nare suggesting we make for the future.\n  It is important to look at what has worked and what has not worked. \nUnder the previous administration, they looked at the world very \ndifferently. They said: All right, we are going to stimulate the \neconomy and keep things going by focusing on the wealthiest Americans. \nWe are going to give them big tax cuts and it will trickle down and \neveryone will benefit and there will be jobs.\n  Well, it didn't work. It didn't work. If it had worked, I would be \ncelebrating because an awful lot of people in my State would be doing \nmuch better than they are today. What we saw was an economic policy \nthat said we are going to focus on the privileged few, and then it will \nhelp everybody else; it is going to trickle down.\n  What we saw was--these are job loss numbers--down, down, down under \nthat policy.\n  I will also say those job numbers come from the fact that the same \npeople said: You know what. We believe corporations, corporate \ninterests can police themselves. So we are going to back up. We are \ngoing to let Wall Street go to town. They are going to make a lot of \nmoney, and it is going to be good for the economy.\n  They backed up. They let Wall Street police itself. They let mining \nfirms police themselves and oil companies police themselves. We lost \nlives. We lost 8 million jobs because of what happened on Wall Street. \nPeople lost their savings, 401(k)s, their pensions because of a set of \nideas, because of what they believed. They believed that by backing up, \ncorporate America would police itself and everything would be OK: Let's \ngive to those at the top. It will trickle down, and we will get jobs.\n  Those two things combined to create the largest number of crises that \nI certainly have seen in my lifetime that have brought down the middle \nclass of this country. We saw jobs go down, down, more and more job \nloss. When President Obama came into office, about 750,000 jobs a month \nwere being lost. It was an economic tsunami. If that is not a crisis \nand an emergency, I don't know what is. If over 15 million people being \nout of work right now is not an emergency, I don't know what is.\n  We went to work and we focused on a different set of ideas, a \ndifferent approach. Where they were focusing on the privileged few, we \nsaid we are going to focus on middle-class Americans, on working \npeople, on investing in manufacturing jobs.\n  I am very pleased to say we are beginning to feel that in Michigan. \nSixteen companies have benefited from the battery manufacturing money \nwe put into the Recovery Act, the stimulus. I was at an opening on \nMonday in Midland, MI, a new manufacturing facility, that is going to \nput 1,000 people to work in construction and 800 people to work at the \nfacility. That is a different approach. We said: We are going to invest \nin America, invest in the American people. We are going to invest in \nopportunity, and we are going to help the people who are out of work \nbecause we know we are not talking about people who are lazy. We are \ntalking about people who lost their jobs, a lot of them because of \neither lack of accountability and oversight of what was going on on \nWall Street or people not paying attention when our jobs were going \noverseas.\n  Through no fault of their own, people were caught in this economy. We \ndecided on a different approach. President Obama came in and the \nnumbers began to change. I would prefer they were much faster, but they \nare moving in the right direction. We have gone to zero job loss into \nthe positive column. We are gaining jobs every month.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are saying: Wait, stop, \nstop. I know if things are going to turn around, maybe in an election \nyear people do not like that and they want to be sure things continue \nto be bad, that somehow it benefits them. That is a pretty cynical \nview.\n  These folks who are gaining jobs, as well as the people who lost \njobs, are Republicans, Democrats, and Independents. This is not a \npartisan issue. We ought to be rooting for America and rooting for what \nis getting people back to work instead of fighting along partisan \nlines. The policies we put in place are beginning to do that. They are \nnot done. They are beginning to do that. We are putting back the \noversight and the accountability and commonsense regulation on Wall \nStreet and on the oil companies and the miners. We are putting back in \nplace middle-class tax cuts instead of just the privileged few. We are \nfocusing on jobs, investing in private sector jobs, partnering with the \nprivate sector, with businesses to help create investment in \ninnovation, and we are beginning to turn things around.\n  The problem we have is, we still have too many people caught because \nthe changes we have been able to make have not caught up to them, and \nthere is much more to do.\n  The bill that was on the Senate floor, the bill we are going to \ncontinue, we are going to put it aside. We are going to be ready if one \nor two Republican colleagues say: Yes, we want to stop a Republican \nfilibuster. We can come back to it and get this done.\n  But what we have seen is a continual effort for 8 weeks to block us \nfrom the\n\n[[Page S5427]]\n\nnext step in the recovery, from investing in jobs, from keeping people \nemployed--police officers, firefighters, teachers--and from focusing on \nthose who have lost their jobs, to be able to help them keep a roof \nover their heads and food on their tables until they can get that next \njob.\n  I see my friend from Rhode Island on the Senate floor, and I will \nturn to him in a moment. He has been a real champion and fighter on \nthis issue. We should also know that in this bill there are some \nimportant provisions that have been opposed by the other side of the \naisle to make sure wealthy investors actually pay their fair share--not \nsomebody who is middle class but wealthy investors pay their fair \nshare.\n  We also put in place provisions to take away incentives for shipping \nour jobs overseas. I could go on for an awful long time about why we \nhave lost a lot of jobs in Michigan because of unfair trade practices \nand losing our jobs overseas. This bill takes away incentives to ship \nour jobs overseas.\n  This bill also added a few more cents to an oilspill trust fund to \nmake sure the oil companies are actually paying for the cleanup in the \ngulf.\n  On one side we have jobs, investing in jobs and partnering with \nmanufacturers and small businesses and helping people who are out of \nwork to keep things going. That is our side. On the other side we have \nwealthy investors who do not like this, and oil companies that do not \nlike another 41 cents on every barrel of oil to be put toward the \ncleanup. We have people who ship jobs overseas who do not want us to \nclose those loopholes. That is on the other side.\n  Which side did our Republican colleagues pick? They picked the \nwealthy investors, the oil companies, and the people who ship jobs \noverseas.\n  The American people are counting on us to understand what is going on \nin their lives, to get it, to be willing, as in any other time in our \nhistory--Republican or Democratic President, any other time in our \nhistory when unemployment has been this high; this Congress has stepped \nforward to extend unemployment benefits for people who were temporarily \nout of work, Democratic or Republican Presidents. Now we have a \nsituation where after 8 weeks, we cannot get even one of our colleagues \nfrom the other side of the aisle to come forward and help us break this \nfilibuster.\n  I don't know what to say beyond the fact that we are going to keep \nfighting. We are going to keep doing everything we can to get through \nthis logjam. We are going to keep doing everything we can to keep this \neconomy recovering and keep creating jobs. But there is something wrong \nwith the system right now that has gotten so divided, so warped, so \npartisan that we cannot come together on behalf of almost 1 million \npeople in this country who are counting on us right now because they \nmay have no other option for themselves and their families.\n  There is one job for every five people who are unemployed. Prior to \nthe Recovery Act, that number was six people. It is a little bit \nbetter. There is a lot more to do, but we cannot just say to somebody: \nWhy don't you get a job, when there are five people out there for every \none job opening.\n  I see my friends on the floor. I see my partner from Michigan on the \nfloor. I will turn to him if he wishes to say a few words because he \nand I understand what we have been through in Michigan. We have been \nhit harder, longer, and deeper than anyplace else in this country. When \nwe look at the fact that over 87,000 people in Michigan will lose their \nunemployment insurance benefits by the end of this month because of \nwhat has happened--inaction, the constant naysayers blocking, \nobstructing, saying no--it is more than I can tolerate.\n  I yield to my friend from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I thank Senator Stabenow for her \ntenacity and her efforts. I join them with a full heart at a very sad \nmoment when we see an unconscionable Republican filibuster succeed \nagain today against the extension of unemployment benefits and the \nother parts of this American jobs bill.\n  I asked Senator Whitehouse if he would yield to me for a moment. He \nwas on the floor before me. I will not take advantage of his good \nnature and good grace other than to say we are not going to abandon \nthis effort. We are going to proceed with every tool we have at our \ndisposal to make sure people who desperately need the extension of \nthese benefits are protected, as intended by this program.\n  The financial crisis and resulting recession that continue to trouble \nour Nation have called for sustained action on the part of the \nCongress. From passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to \nthe Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act to the Wall Street \nreform legislation now taking its final shape, we have sought to reduce \nthe harm this recession has caused our fellow citizens. Passage of the \nlegislation that we were denied the chance to consider today would have \nbeen another significant step in fulfilling that task.\n  The legislation we failed to take up would extend unemployment \nbenefits through November of this year. For the more than half a \nmillion residents of my State who are receiving unemployment benefits, \nand millions more across the country, this extension is crucial. For \nmany families, these benefits are all that is keeping food on the table \nand a roof over their head. The income they provide is important not \nonly to families receiving the benefits, but to the communities in \nwhich they live and to the businesses for whom those families are \ncustomers.\n  But now opponents of extending unemployment insurance are, once \nagain, filibustering this legislation. So under Senate rules, 60 votes \nare required to invoke cloture and bring an end to debate.\n  The opponents of this extension say they are concerned about deficit \nspending. This would be more convincing if not for two factors. First, \nmany of these same opponents were in favor of massive, unpaid-for tax \ncuts benefiting the wealthiest Americans, tax cuts which, according to \nindependent analysts, made a far greater contribution to our deficit \nthan any of the measures we have taken to address the financial crisis \nand recession.\n  Second, concern about long-term deficits in the middle of a continued \nrecession is the equivalent of pulling out fire hoses in the middle of \na flood. The catastrophe we face today is that millions of Americans \nare without work and will not be able to find work until we can \ngenerate real growth in our economy. The danger to them and to our \neconomy today is not deficit spending; it is recession. It is the fact \nthat factory floors remain silent, that shops lack shoppers, that \nbusinesses are without customers. Failure to pass this measure does \nnothing to address that shortfall.\n  Surely my colleagues understand that assistance to families in need \nis not just an aid to those families. It helps all of us by helping us \npull out of the recession. Direct assistance to Americans in need is \nthe single most effective tool we have in boosting our economy. Aid \nsuch as unemployment assistance has a greater bang for the buck than \nany other stimulus effort we can make. If we abandon the drive to \nextend these benefits, we abandon a key effort to strengthen our \neconomy.\n  The stakes are enormous. The people who need these benefits are not \nabstractions. They are real people, flesh and blood, who are paying the \nprice, who have been paying the price for months and months, for a \ncrisis bred on Wall Street. More than half a million of them live in my \nState, which was suffering in recession even before the crisis hit. \nThese are people who desperately want to work, who want to provide for \ntheir families, who want to give a better life to their children. They \nhave done so in the past. They want to do so again. What they ask from \nus is a small measure of assistance so they can continue to feed and \nshelter their families while they search for work.\n  Literally thousands of emails and letters have flowed into my office \nfrom people asking us to extend these benefits. One from Waterford, MI, \nfrom a worker whose benefits expired in April, reads: ``Our life \nsavings are gone! At some point we will be homeless, no doubt about it. \nWe need help from Washington.'' Another, from Burton, MI, wrote to me: \n``I know things will get better but we need help to make ends meet \nuntil then.''\n  Those stories, those pleas, have come in by letter and email by the \nthousands. The many months of on-again,\n\n[[Page S5428]]\n\noff-again extensions of unemployment benefits have added painful \nanxiety and uncertainty to what is already a tragedy for hundreds of \nthousands of Michigan families. Time and again, we have delayed and \ndebated on whether to extend these benefits. On more than one occasion, \na single Senator--just one--has obstructed our consideration of \nlegislation to extend them. Now it appears that our colleagues across \nthe aisle, despite enormous effort by the majority leader and Senator \nBaucus and others, have decided they simply will not allow an up-or-\ndown vote on the extension.\n  We will have failed a basic responsibility to our constituents if we \nabandon the effort to approve an extension of unemployment benefits. \nMillions of Americans ask only that their government provide the safety \nnet that keeps them from falling deeper into tragic uncertainty and \ndebt. The Republican filibuster of that help is unconscionable. It \nleaves millions of families all across this country without help in \ntheir hour of need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, we lost this important vote today 57 \nto 41. For people who are watching who may not be familiar with the \npeculiarities of the Senate, you might think to yourself: How on Earth \ndid you lose 57 to 41? It sounds to the ordinary person like you won by \n16. What do you mean you lost 57 to 41? How could that have happened?\n  That happened because the other party, as it has done throughout the \nObama administration, has used an arcane Senate procedure called the \nfilibuster more times than ever in the history of this country to block \nprogress for this administration.\n  The rule requires that the majority get to 60 when the minority so \ndemands, and they have been demanding that 60 on everything over and \nover. There have been years when it was almost never used. There have \nbeen years when it was used two or three times. In really bad years, it \nmight have been used 14, 15 times. This group of Republican colleagues \nhas set the record. They use it on everything.\n  I think we are over 100 acts of obstruction and delay around this \nfilibuster rule as a result. If one is wondering why we lost 57 to 41--\nif that sounds strange--we got the 57 votes, they got the 41, and we \nlost--it is because they are pulling out of the rule book this \nprocedural trick so that the majority does not rule, so they can block \nprogress.\n  They are doing it for what they claim is concern about deficits. I \nhave to say, being lectured by our Republican colleagues about deficits \nand debt is like being lectured by Evel Knievel about safe driving. \nThey should have a little sense of, at minimum, irony about that.\n  They say the past is prologue. Let me review a little bit of the \npast.\n  When George Bush took office, President Clinton, a Democrat, and the \nDemocratic Congress at the time had left an annual budget that was in \nsurplus. It was returning more money to the Federal Government than we \nwere spending. It was an annual budget in surplus. We had a national \ndebt at the time, but with the annual budget in surplus, our \nCongressional Budget Office--the nonpartisan, not Republican, not \nDemocratic, professional Congressional Budget Office--had estimated \nthat, when George Bush took office, we would be a debt-free nation by \n2009. We would be a debt-free nation by 2009. That was the trajectory \nthat Democratic President Bill Clinton and the Democratic Congress \nleft, along with those annual budget surpluses, when George Bush and \nthe Republicans took office.\n  So 2009 came and went. How did we do? Did we get to a debt-free \nnation? Are we at zero debt? No. Something changed when the Republicans \ntook power, and when the Bush administration left, it left $9 trillion \nin debt--not a debt-free nation but $9 trillion in debt and an economy \nin which Americans were losing 700,000 jobs a month. They left $9 \ntrillion in debt and families losing 700,000 jobs a month. That is the \nsituation President Obama inherited--a little different from what \nPresident Bush inherited.\n  So have we spent since then? Yes, because every economist worth their \nsalt knows that when family spending is contracting, when business \nspending is contracting, when municipal and State spending is \ncontracting, the entire economy can contract to the point that it \nseizes up unless the Federal Government does what an economist would \ncall countercyclical spending. If the economy is dying for lack of \nspending, if it is seizing up, the Federal Government can put money \nback into it to try to bring it back to life. As Senator Stabenow's \ngraph has shown, it has brought it back to life. We have gone from \nlosing 700,000-plus jobs a month to losing no jobs a month--actually \ngaining a few. So it worked.\n  In that context, to say to the people who are still out of work--the \nones who lost their jobs back when 700,000 jobs a month were out the \nwindow and going overseas; the Bush legacy--to say that we can't help \nthose people any longer, to say that we are cutting off their \nunemployment insurance, their lifeline, because we are concerned about \nthe debt, I have to ask: Where was the concern about the debt when they \nwere taking a trajectory toward a debt-free America and turning it into \na $9 trillion debt? Where was the concern then? Where was the concern \nwhen it was tax breaks for billionaires?\n  We just had our first billion-plus-dollar estate pass under the Bush \ntax cuts, where the estate tax was eliminated. As a result, a $9 \nbillion estate of a Texas tycoon went to his heirs tax free. How much \ntax? Zero dollars. Zero dollars. At the prevailing tax rate that has \nstood for most of this time, you would have paid $4 billion in estate \ntaxes and your heirs would have had to suffer through with only $5 \nbillion to divide amongst themselves. That $4 billion in lost revenue \nadded to our debt and deficit doesn't bother our friends on the other \nside at all. They couldn't be happier. That is their plan. Those are \nthe Bush tax cuts. America loses $4 billion, and they smile. It is \ntheir plan. But when we are talking about people who lost their jobs \nbecause of those very policies, because of letting Wall Street run \nunregulated and having that financial meltdown, and now regular \nfamilies across this country who got hit by that tsunami of misery are \nout of work, now they are concerned about the debt. Now they are \nconcerned about the deficit. They were OK with the billion-dollar \nfamily passing its estate tax free, but they can't have ordinary \nworking Americans keep that unemployment insurance lifeline.\n  I think those are backward policies. I think those are upside-down \npolicies, and they hit very hard in my home State. My home is Rhode \nIsland. For over a year, we have had double-digit unemployment. We have \nbeen in the top three or four States every month for unemployment. I \nknow Michigan has suffered immensely, and that is why Senator Stabenow \nand Senator Levin were here. But I have to say that my small State of \nRhode Island, with only 1 million people, is not far behind. We have \n70,000 families out of work, and because it has been a long recession \nin Rhode Island, those families--all their assets, everything they had \nsalted away, they have gone through that. What is left is the \nunemployment insurance lifeline. It is the basic lifeline. To cut that \noff, frankly, I think it is disgraceful.\n  This is a low moment in this body--70,000 families missing a \npaycheck, 70,000 families with a provider who is out of work, 70,000 \nfamilies with kids wondering where the income for mom and dad is coming \nfrom. This money would go right into the economy. It would be spent \ninstantly. It would be spent on shoes. It would be spent on food. It \nwould be spent on paying the electric bill. It would be spent on \nputting some gas in the car to get out to the job interviews. It would \nhave been spent immediately on the necessities of life.\n  But that is not good enough. That is not good enough. Those are the \nfamilies in the toughest circumstances whom our friends want to cut off \nbecause of the debt, because of the deficit. The billionaires can go \nuntaxed, but the working families who have lost jobs through no fault \nof their own are the ones who have to bear the brunt of this. And it \nhits home to real people, real families, with real fears, who, late at \nnight, sitting at the kitchen table, with the bills laid out in front \nof them and the kids asleep upstairs, are adding them up--adding up \nwhat they have and what is coming in--and realizing\n\n[[Page S5429]]\n\nthey are not going to make it that month, that something is going to \nhave to go. That is a cold and lonely moment for a family. When \nfamilies are having that cold and lonely moment, that late night at the \nkitchen table with the bills they can't pay, that is the time when we \nare supposed to provide the insurance to protect them against \nunemployment. That is the policy of this Nation.\n  It is discouraging. It is discouraging to Dan, a Rhode Islander, in \nEast Greenwich. He has worked in sales. He has been unemployed since \nApril of 2009. His wife is disabled. He is looking for work, but in \nRhode Island, as in Michigan, people can look as hard as they like and \nthey are lucky to find a job because there are more people looking than \nthere are jobs. The jobs just aren't there, and Dan has not been able \nto find one. Without unemployment insurance, he has let my office know \nthat he and his wife are likely to be evicted from their apartment. \nThat is the human consequence of today's decision for one person in \nRhode Island--Dan.\n  Bill, from North Kingstown, contacted us. He is 56 years old. He has \nbeen unemployed for a while now--since January of 2009. This has been a \npersistent recession in Rhode Island. He used to work in the \nengineering field. He is a talented man, but he has been twice faced \nwith eviction as his unemployment insurance has been put at risk. He \nreceived only $200 over the last 3-week period, as his benefits have \nexpired. He is in that first leading group for whom the benefits have \nexpired. He has lost his COBRA benefits. He needs heart medication. \nWithout COBRA benefits, how can he pay for his health insurance that \nwill provide the heart medication? The real cost of today's shameful \ndecision comes home hard to somebody like Bill.\n  Nancy, in Portsmouth, RI, is 59 years old. She has been unemployed \nfor a while, too--21 months. She has been looking for work for 21 \nmonths, looking through the classifieds, going online, reaching out to \nall her friends and contacts to try to find somebody who has a job for \nher. She has a bachelor's degree, she has several different industry \ncertifications, and she has an extensive background in sales and \nmarketing. She is somebody who, in an ordinary economy, would have no \ntrouble finding a job. But after the Wall Street meltdown sent that \ntsunami of misery across our country, she got caught in it. For 15 \nyears, she worked in the insurance industry, and now she can't find a \njob. She will soon lose her unemployment benefits if we don't continue \nto fight for it.\n  So behind all the big brave talk about how we have to fight the \ndeficits--ironic talk coming from the people who were responsible for \nvirtually all of these debts and deficits--are the human stories that \nare just being ignored here, and it is wrong. We have to change our \ndirection and start putting people first instead of the big \ncorporations.\n  Let me mention one other topic. There were winners today and there \nwere losers today. The people who lost today were Dan and Bill and \nNancy and many, many others like them in Rhode Island and across the \ncountry. The people who won today--among them--were the big Wall Street \nfinanciers, the hedge fund hotshots, the ones who have been earning \nmillions of dollars every year and through clever legal tricks have got \ntheir million-plus-dollar salaries treated as if they were capital \ngains. So the hedge fund superstar out there in his private jet, \ngetting ready to fly down for a weekend in the Caribbean in the private \njet, looking out the window at the fellow stuffing his luggage into the \nhold of the private jet, the guy in the jet is paying a lower tax rate \nthan the guy outside with the earmuffs on and the jumpsuit stuffing the \nluggage in the hold. The guy in the private jet is paying a lower tax \nrate than the guy outside working day-to-day and putting his luggage in \nthe hold. The guy being driven around in his car is paying a lower tax \nrate than the man behind the wheel who is driving him around.\n  Who is the biggest, best, most prominent capitalist in America? I \nwould submit that it is Warren Buffett. Warren Buffett is a legendary \ninvestor, a spectacular investor. He is one of the great success \nstories of American capitalism. He has come to lobby us about this \nissue. He has come to lobby us about the fact that he pays a lower tax \nrate than his secretary. He has come to lobby us about it because it is \nwrong, because he finds it embarrassing that, in a country like ours, \nsomebody who has been as successful as he has, who has received such \nremarkable benefit from his talent and his energy, ends up paying a \nlower tax rate than the secretary who does his mail and takes his phone \ncalls. He knows that is wrong and we should know that is wrong.\n\n  We could have corrected that. That was one of the ways that the \nbenefits for regular working folks in this bill could have been paid \nfor.\n  That is who won and that is who lost: Dan and Bill and Nancy lost. \nTonight when they get word about this they are going to sit in their \nhomes and they are going to worry. They are going to be anxious. They \nare going to be heartsick. They are going to be looking at a future \nthat is filled with uncertainty.\n  Our friends on the other side will say no, once they get off \nunemployment insurance that is just a spur, that is an incentive to get \nout and find a job; get off the dole and get back out in the workforce. \nNot in Rhode Island, not with a 12.3-percent unemployment rate. At a \nrate like that Dan, Bill, Nancy--the three of them might go out looking \nfor a job, but there will only be one for the three. These are people \nwho have been looking for work for over a year. These are people who \nhave had a lifetime of work experience. These are people who want to be \nback to work. Their character, their sense of self is that they are \npeople who work and support themselves. They want to be back to work. \nThe argument that they are going to fritter away their time on \nunemployment insurance until it ends and then they will get serious and \nget back to work is nonsense. It is nonsense. The suffering they are \ngoing to face as a result of this is real.\n  Those are the people in the column who lost today. In the column of \nthe people who won is Warren Buffett. Based on what he said when he has \ncome here to lobby us, I will bet you dollars against Dunkin' Donuts \nthat he is embarrassed to be in the winners column. But he knows that \nit is not right, in this great country of ours, for the people who have \nbeen most successful, who have earned financial rewards beyond what \nordinary people can dream of, to be able to pay a lower tax rate than \nthe regular working people who come to their offices everyday and serve \nin their businesses. It is wrong. It is topsy-turvy.\n  I cannot tell you how discouraging a day it is. First in the real \nregular world you would have thought we had won today, 57 votes to 41. \nBut, no, there is this procedural trick. So because we did not get to \n60, we lost. Because we lost, Dan and Bill and Nancy lost. And the \nwealthiest people in our country won in a way that embarrasses probably \nAmerica's greatest capitalist, Warren Buffett.\n  I see the majority leader is on the floor. I will inquire to see if \nthe majority leader desires the floor? If so, I will gladly yield.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves the floor, I so \nappreciate his advocacy for the people of Rhode Island, but in speaking \nfor the people of Rhode Island he is speaking for the people of this \ncountry. We are United States Senators. The States of Rhode Island and \nNevada are having a very difficult time.\n  As I heard my friend say when manipulation of Wall Street finally \ncaught up with them, it wrecked our two economies. I have so admired my \nfriend and his colleague, the other Reed in the Senate, Jack Reed, and \ntheir wonderful presentations explaining that these are not just \nnumbers that we talk about. These are people who have no jobs.\n  I was looking at the headlines from the Boston newspaper a few \nminutes ago in the cloakroom, after this failed vote. One man said: I \nhope politicians understand what I'm going through. My unemployment \nbenefits will run out in 2 weeks. I have a wife who is working part \ntime. I have two children. I lost my job 2 years ago.\n  These are not deadbeats out there looking for a handout. These are \npeople who are desperate, looking for a job. So I do say to my friend, \nI appreciate his speaking--I repeat, not only for the\n\n[[Page S5430]]\n\npeople of Rhode Island but for the people of Nevada and the rest of the \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I was going to ask consent that we proceed to the \nSmall Business Lending Fund Program but I have been told by my friends \non the other side of the aisle are not here and they would object \nanyway, so there is no need that I propound that request.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/24/senate-section/article/S5430-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SMALL BUSINESS LENDING FUND ACT OF 2010--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. REID.

In closing, I wish to take a few more minutes to stress \nagain how disappointing and, frankly, outrageous I find what happened \ntonight to be as it relates to the continual 8 weeks of blocking the \njobs bill in front of us, for the ability for people who are out of \nwork to be able to get some temporary help just to be able to keep \nthings going for their family while they are looking for that next job. \nThere are almost 1 million people who find themselves in a situation \nnow where they have lost their jobs and have lost their insurance \nbenefits, insurance benefits paid in when they were working to then be \nable to get help when they are not working, as any of us would want for \nourselves and our families.\n  We are in a situation where we cannot get beyond--we cannot get even \nbeyond one, and we need two Republican colleagues--we cannot even get \none to be able to join with us to overturn this filibuster. We have a \nbill, a jobs bill in front of us that would provide tax cuts to \nbusinesses, provide help to State and local and municipal governments \nto keep police officers, firefighters, and teachers on the job in our \ncommunities for our children, and the other side has said no.\n  Time after time, no. We are putting much needed tax cuts, money back \ninto the pockets of middle-class families. The other side has said no. \nWe wanted to help small businesses be able to restore credit to create \njobs. They said no. We want to help people who are going back to school \nto start a new career, people who have been looking for work, and they \nhave said no. And we want to make sure we are investing in the kinds of \njobs that are going to rebuild America--roads and bridges, other kinds \nof construction efforts, good-paying jobs for engineers, construction \nworkers. Those provisions were in this bill, and they have said no. For \npeople who are out of work, they have gotten a great big no, no way, \ntime and time again from colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  We know that for every $1 we put into unemployment insurance \nbenefits, we get, according to Mark Zandi, an economist, and certainly \nmany other economists, at least $1.40 back in investment. Why? Because \nsomebody goes to the store and buys some food with that $200 or $300 a \nmonth in unemployment benefits. They go buy some shoes for the kids. \nThey put gas in the car. They keep the lights on. They are able to pay \ntheir rent or the mortgage or do other things we all want to be able to \ndo for our families, for our children. So when you give unemployment \ninsurance benefits to someone who is out of work, they, unfortunately \nfor themselves, have to turn right around and spend it. But from an \neconomic standpoint, that is stimulus, which is why that is viewed as \none of the best economic stimuli you can have, to be able to provide \nassistance for people who are going to turn around and spend it in the \neconomy.\n  We are struggling now. Even though we have the majority in the \nSenate, we do not have a supermajority, enough to stop filibusters. And \nwe are struggling with a perversion of the Senate rules that has taken \nplace. I think, frankly, our forefathers would be rolling over in their \ngraves to see the perversion that has gone on here. Instead of using a \nmajority vote like any of us would use if we were in an election--one \nmore vote than the other guy wins the election--here one more vote than \nthe other guy does not get us moving forward because of the efforts to \nblock, obstruct, and filibuster that go on every single day and require \n60 votes in order to overcome.\n  So what are they saying no to? Why are they blocking and stopping? \nWhy do we see this continual effort to go back to the way it was, to go \nback to the policies that got us where we are today? We are in a \nsituation now where we want to go forward. We want to change things. We \nwant to go forward. And all we get are efforts to take us back.\n  Well, what was happening then? What was happening at the place they \nwant to go? Well, in the last Presidency, when they were in charge, we \nsaw us lose jobs, more and more jobs throughout the 8 years of this \nformer President. And there were a number of reasons: wrong economic \npolicies; wrong investments; investing in people who were very wealthy \nhoping that it would trickle down; not enforcing our trade laws; not \nstopping the incentives to ship our jobs overseas; not paying attention \nto manufacturing and making things in this country; and, frankly, not \npaying for things; two wars, not paid for; Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit, not paid for--nothing was paid for. Everything was put on the \ncredit card. And now the people who got us into this ditch, amazingly, \nare arguing for policies to take us back into the ditch. They dug the \nditch, and now they want us to give them back the shovel and get more \nshovels to dig a bigger one.\n  We have a very different view and, frankly, a different set of \npriorities on whom we are fighting for. We are losing the middle class \nof this country. We are losing the middle class of this country because \nof the policies that have focused not on jobs, not on things that \nmatter to middle-class families, working-class families, but on what \nthe privileged few care about.\n\n[[Page S5431]]\n\n  The philosophy that got us where we are, which this President \ninherited, President Obama, was a philosophy that said that a tax cut \nto the wealthy solves every problem and, by the way, step back and let \ncorporate America regulate themselves, police themselves, and \neverything will be OK.\n  Well, we saw what happened on Wall Street--millions of jobs lost, \n401(k)s gone, pensions gone, savings gone. We have seen what happened \nin the gulf when the oil companies policed themselves. We saw what \nhappened in West Virginia, where the miners lost their lives because \nthe mines were policing themselves. And we saw what happened \neconomically in terms of job loss.\n  This really is a bigger fight than just the jobs bill in front of us. \nIt is about whose side you are on. It is about what your values and \npriorities are. And I can tell you, just as a practical matter, I am \ngoing to support whatever works for the people I represent, whatever \nworks for the people in Michigan.\n  This did not work, this red ink getting longer and longer and longer. \nPresident Obama comes in; 750,000 jobs lost a month. We put in a jobs \nbill, a Recovery Act to focus on manufacturing and small businesses, \njob training, to help the people who lost their jobs. It has been slow \nbecause the hole was so deep, but we have begun to turn it around. By \nthe end of the year, we got it to zero jobs lost, and now we are \ngaining jobs. Now we have to keep gaining jobs. We are returning \naccountability and commonsense regulation to Wall Street, to the oil \nindustry, and to other areas where lives could be lost and there is a \npublic interest.\n  So we are in the middle of a major debate in this country. And what I \nfind most disturbing is that too many on the other side of the aisle \nare rooting for failure. They want the President to fail. They want our \nmajority to fail. But in the process of that, we all will fail. The \ncountry will fail if we do not have a set of economic policies and \ninvestments and partnerships that work, if we do not focus on the \npeople who need temporary help and support right now while they hold \ntheir family together and look for a job.\n  When I think about the men and women fighting overseas, fighting in \ntwo wars around the world for our great democracy, they want to know \nthat they are coming home to a job; that their family has a house; that \nthe kids are going to be able to go to college; that they are going to \nbe able to breathe fresh air and drink clean water; and that somehow \nthat they were fighting not for some craziness, some crazy political \nbattlefield here, but for a sense of love and thought about our country \nand the people in our country.\n  Patriotism really is, when it comes to our country, against other \ncountries in the world, it is fighting for our side--not our side of \nthe aisle but our country, not rooting for people to fail just so you \ncan get a short-term political advantage. I hope that does not work. \nObviously, you could say for personal reasons, we do not want it to \nwork, but I hope it does not work for our country because we have to \nget beyond this and be able to work together because too many people \nare counting on us.\n  In closing this evening, I want to express an apology to everyone who \nis caught in this economic tsunami.

Mr. President, the oilspill in the gulf looks \nto become one of the greatest environmental disasters in our lifetime. \nThis accident, which has been brought on by our addiction to oil, is \nanother tragic reminder--as if we needed one--of the sad inevitability \nof human error. This spill in the gulf is also a reminder of the \nfragile balance we must maintain between the development of resources \nand protecting the environment from which they spring. It puts me in \nmind of our generation's responsibility to our children and the \nchallenge of fueling prosperity with newer, cleaner, and more \nsustainable energy sources.\n  As the world watches our efforts to contain this disaster, I cannot \nhelp but think about how another generation of Americans might have \nresponded. In particular, I have one man in mind.\n  A few months ago--March 10, to be precise--my family mourned the loss \nof a great and good man who was beloved by everyone in our clan, from \nthe eldest to the youngest among us. On that day, we lost my uncle, \nStewart Udall, at the grand age of 90. Of course, our family is no \ndifferent from any other American family. Death occurs every day, every \nhour, and every minute, and families cope with the loss, however it \ncomes. It harkens us to cherish those all-too-brief moments we have \nwith the people we love.\n  I would not take to the floor of the Senate to discuss personal loss, \nbut I hope my colleagues will indulge me in taking a few moments to \nhonor Stewart Udall, not because he was a member of our family and \nbecause we loved him dearly but because his contributions to America \ndeserve our recognition. So it is not my uncle I wish to recognize; it \nis Stewart Udall, Secretary of the Interior, Stewart Udall the \nconservationist, Stewart Udall the civil rights activist, author, \nhistorian, and public servant I wish to honor today.\n  Stewart never confused power with greatness. He was quoted saying as \nmuch. He knew that the power given to him by the people of Arizona to \nrepresent them in Congress, the power President John F. Kennedy \nbestowed upon him as Secretary of the Interior, and the power he \nsubsequently had in private life as a man whose words and opinions \nmattered in the public arena--all of these manifestations of power \nwere, for him, fleeting and not of deep consequence, except for the \nopportunity it gave him to make a difference in the world. And he did \nmake a difference, a very big difference.\n  Under his leadership in the Kennedy-Johnson years, the Department of \nInterior was a beacon of conservation, wildland preservation, and \nenvironmental stewardship. As the New York Times recently noted, ``Few \ncorners of the Nation escaped Mr. Udall's touch.''\n  For the wildlife, lands, and water of this country, his touch was a \nMidas touch. He added 3.85 million acres to the public lands inventory, \nincluding 4 national parks, 6 national monuments, 9 national recreation \nareas, 20 national historic sites, 50 wildlife refuges, and 8 national \nseashores.\n  While serving as Secretary of Interior, he also found time to write \nthe first of many books in his long career as an author. His book ``A \nQuiet Crisis'' is considered a landmark work. His words provided a \nmanifesto to an emerging public movement on behalf of the environment. \nBefore Stewart Udall's time at Interior, the term ``environmental \npolicy'' was not even a part of the public debate. By the time Stewart \nleft public service, no politician in the country could run for office \nwithout addressing environmental concerns and issues.\n  While Stewart is deeply associated with the cause of conservation, \nhis conscience was broader than the landscapes he helped protect. He \ncared deeply about the environment, but he cherished human beings. That \nis why he said:\n\n       Plans to protect air and water, wilderness and wildlife \n     are, in fact, plans to protect man.\n\n  That is also why he took up the cause of Native Americans and why he \nwas an early champion of civil rights and an unrelenting opponent of \nracial segregation.\n  Friends and colleagues noted that he had a rare reputation in \npolitical life. It has been said that he ``never advanced his own \nambitions by tearing down a fellow human being.'' I know this is true \nof Stewart Udall because\n\n[[Page S5432]]\n\neven his fiercest political opponents respected his sense of fairness \nand welcomed his friendship.\n  Mark Twain said:\n\n       The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who \n     lives fully is prepared to die at any time.\n\n  Stewart Udall was a man who lived life fully. He had a zest for life \nand a thirst for knowledge and experience that was truly without \nbounds. I cannot say where this enthusiasm for experience was rooted, \nbut it must have been nourished by the intimate and painful memories \nfrom no less than 50 missions as a tail gunner during the Second World \nWar. I still marvel at this feat of endurance and bravery. The average \nlife expectancy for a B-17 crew in the European theater was allegedly \n14 missions. He flew 50. It was something he rarely spoke about.\n  I know if he were here with us today, Stewart would be in the thick \nof our debate about energy, the threat of climate change, and lessons \nto be drawn from our painful experience in the gulf. In a moving letter \nhe drafted for his grandchildren, Stewart anticipated the challenges of \nour time and acknowledged the mistakes of his own. To that end, he \nwrote:\n\n       Operating on the assumption that energy would be both cheap \n     and superabundant led my generation to make misjudgments that \n     have come back and now haunt and perplex your generation. We \n     designed cities, buildings, and a national system of \n     transportation that were inefficient and extravagant. Now, \n     the paramount task of your generation will be to correct \n     those mistakes with an efficient infrastructure that respects \n     the limitations of our environment to keep up with damages we \n     are causing.\n\n  I cannot improve on words Stewart spoke in defense of conservation \nsome years ago. Given the challenges we face today, I believe they \nstill ring true, and I wish to close my tribute to his public service \nby recalling them now.\n  He said:\n\n       Over the long haul of life on this planet, it is the \n     ecologists, and not the bookkeepers of business, who are the \n     ultimate accountants.\n\n  Our progress as a society cannot be measured solely or even in part \nby the output of our economy, the number or complexity of our machines, \nor the brilliance of our technology. Our progress and success as human \nbeings cannot be defined by gross domestic product, billions expended \nor invested, profit margins, trade balances, or numbers of hits on a \nWeb page. In the end, our progress in any category of endeavor depends \non our survival, and our survival is tied to the health and well-being \nof the planet we share. Stewart Udall illuminated this simple truth and \nmade it the centerpiece of his public service. I am proud to have known \nhim, I am honored that he was my uncle, and grateful, as are so many, \nto have been his pupil. His voice will be missed, but his wisdom \nendures.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from \nColorado for that beautiful and meaningful tribute to Stewart Udall and \nthe lessons he has given us through his life and through this wonderful \ntribute. We very much appreciate it this evening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/24/senate-section/article/S5432-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5432-S5433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONVENTION AGAINST TORTURE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this week, we commemorate the United \nNations International Day in Support of Victims of Torture. June 26, \n2010, marks the 23rd anniversary of the day on which the Convention \nAgainst Torture--CAT--took effect. I am proud that the United States is \na signatory to this important Convention and defends human dignity by \ncriminalizing acts of torture. Along with the other 75 nations that \nhave ratified the Convention, we affirm our commitment to hold those \nresponsible for torture accountable for their actions.\n  I have worked hard for many years to improve the investigation and \nprosecution of international human rights abusers. I worked for several \nyears to develop and secure passage of the Anti-Atrocity Alien \nDeportation Act. This act, which became law in 2004, expanded the \nmission of the Office of Special Investigations at the Department of \nJustice from denaturalizing Nazi war criminals, to investigating, \nextraditing, or denaturalizing any alien who participated in genocide, \ntorture, or extrajudicial killing abroad. It has prompted, among other \naccomplishments, the deportation of a former Ethiopian official, \nKelbessa Negewo. Negewo was accused of abuse and torture during the \nperiod of the Red Terror in Ethiopia in the mid-1970s. He is now \nserving a life sentence for torture and multiple killings in Ethiopia. \nThis case proves that those who have committed reprehensible acts of \ntorture and seek safe haven in the United States will not find refuge \nhere.\n  In order to further improve our ability to identify and prosecute \nhuman rights abusers, I am proud to have cosponsored the Human Rights \nEnforcement Act of 2009. Signed into law at the end of last year, this \nlegislation created a new section within the criminal division of the \nDepartment of Justice with responsibility for prosecuting serious human \nrights offenses. Additionally, it amends a section of the Immigration \nand Nationality Act to prevent those who have ordered, incited, \nassisted, or otherwise participated in genocide from obtaining \neligibility for protection under our asylum laws.\n  In addition to strengthening our ability to investigate and hold \nhuman rights violators accountable, I have worked hard to ensure that \nvictims of atrocity can find protection here in the United States. In \nMarch of this year, I introduced S.3113, the Refugee Protection Act. \nThis law will renew America's commitment to the ideals embodied in the \nRefugee Convention and eliminate cumbersome procedural delays currently \nfaced by refugees who flee persecution or torture.\n  For those who have suffered mental, physical, and emotional harm as a \nresult of torture, I have consistently supported funding for \nrehabilitation and treatment. In my work on the State and Foreign \nOperations Appropriations Subcommittee, we secured $7,100,000 in the \nfiscal year 2010 Omnibus Appropriations Act for the United Nations \nVoluntary Fund for Victims of Torture and an additional $13,000,000 for \nVictims of Torture programs and activities at U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development. In order to help these victims heal, we must \ncontinue to provide resources to aid physical and psychological \nrecovery.\n  Vermont has also become home to many resettled refugees who have been \nvictims of torture. A group called New England Survivors of Torture and \nTrauma--NESTT--has been established by the Department of Psychology at \nthe University of Vermont and the Vermont Immigration and Asylum \nAdvocates to offer medical, psychological, legal and social services in \nan effort to help address the needs of this community.\n  As we mark this year's United Nations International Day in Support of \nVictims of Torture, we must acknowledge that the United States has not \nalways lived up to its ideals. Under the previous administration, \nabhorrent acts were authorized by a series of Office of Legal Counsel, \nOLC, memoranda, and a dark chapter in American history was written. \nUnder questionable legal guidance that failed to meet ethical \nstandards, acts occurred in the interrogation of terrorist suspects \nthat failed to reflect the fundamental American ideals of justice, \ndignity, and human equality. Nothing has done more to damage our world \nstanding and moral authority than this revelation. It is vital that the \nUnited States reclaim its historic role as a world leader on issues of \nhuman rights.\n  The claim by some that there is a necessary choice between ensuring \nsecurity and upholding liberty is a falsehood. Until we understand what \nled to the production of the OLC memos and the acts that followed, we \ncannot move forward with a clear moral conscience. The imperative to \ndiscover what led to these events is stronger than ever. I remain a \ncommitted advocate of the establishment of an independent, nonpartisan \nCommission of Inquiry to gather facts about how we arrived at this \nplace. We must understand the mistakes of the previous administration \nto ensure that they never happen again. We cannot, and we must not \nignore this chapter in the history of our Nation.\n  As we mark the Day in Support of Victims of Torture, we can begin to \nright these wrongs by renewing our commitment to recognize those who \nhave suffered atrocities but fight on with enormous courage. To those \naround the world who have endured the unspeakable, we remember you. To \nthose who have survived torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment at the\n\n[[Page S5433]]\n\nhands of their government, we call upon your voices to help end these \nreprehensible acts. And as the United States, we call upon every nation \nto join us in the fight to eradicate torture in all of its forms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/24/senate-section/article/S5433-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5433-S5434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             BLOODY SUNDAY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the people of Great \nBritain and Northern Ireland for taking another step down the long road \ntowards peace. Last week the Saville Inquiry, the result of a 10-year \ninvestigation into the ``Bloody Sunday'' tragedy in Northern Ireland on \nJanuary 30, 1972, was finally made public.\n  The inquiry definitively concluded that British Army soldiers were \nresponsible for the shooting deaths of 14 pro-Catholic marchers. The \nterrible events, which took place against a backdrop of years of \nrioting, paramilitary violence and police brutality, contributed to \nincreased hatred and mistrust on both sides, and led to over two more \ndecades of violence and terror for the people of Northern Ireland.\n  The findings reversed those of a 1972 commission which had laid blame \nfor the killings on the victims themselves. Parents passed away without \nthe knowledge that their children killed that day were not at fault.\n  Upon the release of the new report, British Prime Minister David \nCameron publicly accepted responsibility for the killings and \napologized on behalf of his country for the unjustified actions of the \nArmy. He acknowledged the great complexity engrained in the dozens of \nyears of fighting in Northern Ireland--thousands of people were killed \nand terrible atrocities committed by all parties. But he also stated \nthat the facts in this report cannot be overlooked: British Army \nsoldiers unjustly took the lives of innocent civilians.\n  Self-reflection is an indispensable quality in a democracy. It is \ndifficult for a nation to admit that the men and women protecting us \nare responsible for reprehensible acts, but it is undeniable that, in \nfurtherance of truth and justice, no one in our society can be above \nthe law.\n  Lasting peace comes about through the hard work, honesty and patience \nof those on all sides.\n  I extend my deepest condolences to the families of the victims and am \ngrateful to them for their years of patience during the investigation.\n  I commend the people of Northern Ireland for their continued \ncommitment to resolving their differences through the political \nprocess, as challenging as it often is, and working to leave behind the \nviolent divisions of the past.\n  And I also applaud Prime Minister Cameron, the Inquiry, and the \nBritish people for acknowledging a painful truth after 38 years, and, \nin doing so, helping to further the cause of peace in Northern Ireland.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Prime Minister's statement be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Statement to the House of Commons on the Saville Inquiry\n\n  (By the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon David Cameron MP on 15 June 2010)\n\n       With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a \n     statement.\n       Today, my Rt Hon Friend, the Secretary of State for \n     Northern Ireland is publishing the report of the Saville \n     Inquiry . . .\n       . . . the Tribunal set up by the previous Government to \n     investigate the tragic events of 30th January 1972--a day \n     more commonly known as ``Bloody Sunday''.\n       We have acted in good faith by publishing the Tribunal's \n     findings as quickly as possible after the General Election.\n       Mr Speaker, I am deeply patriotic.\n       I never want to believe anything bad about our country.\n       I never want to call into question the behaviour of our \n     soldiers and our Army who I believe to be the finest in the \n     world.\n       And I have seen for myself the very difficult and dangerous \n     circumstances in which we ask our soldiers to serve.\n       But the conclusions of this report are absolutely clear.\n       There is no doubt. There is nothing equivocal. There are no \n     ambiguities.\n       What happened on Bloody Sunday was both unjustified and \n     unjustifiable.\n       It was wrong.\n       Lord Saville concludes that the soldiers of Support Company \n     who went into the Bogside ``did so as a result of an order . \n     . . which should have not been given'' by their Commander . . \n     .\n       . . . on balance the first shot in the vicinity of the \n     march was fired by the British Army . . .\n       . . . that ``none of the casualties shot by soldiers of \n     Support Company was armed with a firearm'' . . .\n       . . . that ``there was some firing by republican \n     paramilitaries . . . but . . . none of this firing provided \n     any justification for the shooting of civilian casualties'' . \n     . .\n       . . . and that ``in no case was any warning given before \n     soldiers opened fire''.\n       He also finds that Support Company ``reacted by losing \n     their self-control . . . forgetting or ignoring their \n     instructions and training'' with ``a serious and widespread \n     loss of fire discipline''.\n       He finds that ``despite the contrary evidence given by the \n     soldiers . . . none of them fired in response to attacks or \n     threatened attacks by nail or petrol bombers'' . . .\n       . . . and that many of the soldiers ``knowingly put forward \n     false accounts in order to seek to justify their firing''.\n       What's more--Lord Saville says that some of those killed or \n     injured were clearly fleeing or going to the assistance of \n     others who were dying.\n       The Report refers to one person who was shot while \n     ``crawling . . . away from the soldiers'' . . .\n       . . . another was shot, in all probability, ``when he was \n     lying mortally wounded on the ground''. . .\n       . . . and a father was ``hit and injured by Army gunfire \n     after he had gone to . . . tend his son''.\n       For those looking for statements of innocence, Saville \n     says:\n       ``The immediate responsibility for the deaths and injuries \n     on Bloody Sunday lies with those members of Support Company \n     whose unjustifiable firing was the cause of the those deaths \n     and injuries'' . . .\n       . . . and--crucially--that ``none of the casualties was \n     posing a threat of causing death or serious injury, or indeed \n     was doing anything else that could on any view justify their \n     shooting''.\n       For those people who were looking for the Report to use \n     terms like murder and unlawful killing, I remind the House \n     that these judgements are not matters for a Tribunal--or for \n     us as politicians--to determine.\n       Mr Speaker, these are shocking conclusions to read and \n     shocking words to have to say.\n       But Mr Speaker, you do not defend the British Army by \n     defending the indefensible.\n       We do not honour all those who have served with distinction \n     in keeping the peace and upholding the rule of law in \n     Northern Ireland by hiding from the truth.\n       So there is no point in trying to soften or equivocate what \n     is in this Report.\n       It is clear from the Tribunal's authoritative conclusions \n     that the events of Bloody Sunday were in no way justified.\n       I know some people wonder whether nearly forty years on \n     from an event, a Prime Minister needs to issue an apology.\n       For someone of my generation, this is a period we feel we \n     have learned about rather than lived through.\n       But what happened should never, ever have happened.\n       The families of those who died should not have had to live \n     with the pain and hurt of that day--and a lifetime of loss.\n       Some members of our Armed Forces acted wrongly.\n       The Government is ultimately responsible for the conduct of \n     the Armed Forces.\n       And for that, on behalf of the Government--and indeed our \n     country--I am deeply sorry.\n       Mr. Speaker, just as this Report is clear that the actions \n     of that day were unjustifiable . . . so too is it clear in \n     some of its other findings.\n       Those looking for premeditation, those looking for a plan, \n     those looking for a conspiracy involving senior politicians \n     or senior members of the Armed Forces--they will not find it \n     in this Report.\n       Indeed, Lord Saville finds no evidence that the events of \n     Bloody Sunday were premeditated . . .\n       . . . he concludes that the United Kingdom and Northern \n     Ireland Governments, and the Army, neither tolerated nor \n     encouraged ``the use of unjustified lethal force''.\n       He makes no suggestion of a Government cover-up.\n       And Lord Saville credits the UK Government with working \n     towards a peaceful political settlement in Northern Ireland.\n       Mr Speaker, the Report also specifically deals with the \n     actions of key individuals in the army, in politics and \n     beyond . . .\n       . . . including Major General Ford, Brigadier MacLellan and \n     Lieutenant Colonel Wilford.\n       In each case, the Tribunal's findings are clear.\n       It also does the same for Martin McGuinness.\n       It specifically finds he was present and probably armed \n     with a ``sub-machine gun'' but concludes ``we are sure that \n     he did not engage in any activity that provided any of the \n     soldiers with any justification for opening fire''.\n       Mr. Speaker, while in no way justifying the events of \n     January 30th 1972, we should acknowledge the background to \n     the events of Bloody Sunday.\n       Since 1969 the security situation in Northern Ireland had \n     been declining significantly.\n       Three days before `Bloody Sunday', two RUC officers--one a \n     Catholic--were shot by the IRA in Londonderry, the first \n     police officers killed in the city during the Troubles.\n       A third of the city of Derry had become a no-go area for \n     the RUC and the Army.\n\n[[Page S5434]]\n\n       And in the end 1972 was to prove Northern Ireland's \n     bloodiest year by far with nearly 500 people killed.\n       And let us also remember, Bloody Sunday is not the defining \n     story of the service the British Army gave in Northern \n     Ireland from 1969-2007.\n       This was known as Operation Banner, the longest, continuous \n     operation in British military history, spanning thirty-eight \n     years and in which over 250,000 people served.\n       Our Armed Forces displayed enormous courage and \n     professionalism in upholding democracy and the rule of law in \n     Northern Ireland.\n       Acting in support of the police, they played a major part \n     in setting the condi-\n     tions that have made peaceful politics pos-\n     sible . . .\n       . . . and over 1,000 members of the security forces lost \n     their lives to that cause.\n       Without their work the peace process would not have \n     happened.\n       Of course some mistakes were undoubtedly made.\n       But lessons were also learned.\n       Once again, I put on record the immense debt of gratitude \n     we all owe those who served in Northern Ireland.\n       Mr. Speaker, may I also thank the Tribunal for its work--\n     and all those who displayed great courage in giving evidence.\n       I would also like to acknowledge the grief of the families \n     of those killed.\n       They have pursued their long campaign over thirty-eight \n     years with great patience.\n       Nothing can bring back those that were killed but I hope, \n     as one relative has put it, the truth coming out can set \n     people free.\n       John Major said he was open to a new inquiry.\n       Tony Blair then set it up.\n       This was accepted by the then Leader of the Opposition.\n       Of course, none of us anticipated that the Saville Inquiry \n     would last 12 years or cost K200 million.\n       Our views on that are well documented.\n       It is right to pursue the truth with vigour and \n     thoroughness . . .\n        . . . but let me reassure the House that there will be no \n     more open-ended and costly inquiries into the past.\n       But today is not about the controversies surrounding the \n     process.\n       It's about the substance, about what this report tells us.\n       Everyone should have the chance to examine the complete \n     findings--and that's why the report is being published in \n     full.\n       Running to more than 5000 pages, it's being published in 10 \n     volumes.\n       Naturally, it will take all of us some time to digest the \n     report's full findings and understand all the implications.\n       The House will have the opportunity for a full day's debate \n     this autumn--and in the meantime I have asked my Rt Hon \n     Friends the Secretaries of State for Northern Ireland and \n     Defence to report back to me on all the issues that arise \n     from it.\n       Mr Speaker, this report and the Inquiry itself demonstrate \n     how a State should hold itself to account . . .\n        . . . and how we are determined at all times--no matter \n     how difficult--to judge ourselves against the highest \n     standards.\n       Openness and frankness about the past--however painful--do \n     not make us weaker, they make us stronger.\n       That's one of the things that differentiates us from \n     terrorists.\n       We should never forget that over 3,500 people--people from \n     every community--lost their lives in Northern Ireland, the \n     overwhelming majority killed by terrorists.\n       There were many terrible atrocities.\n       Politically-motivated violence was never justified, \n     whichever side it came from.\n       And it can never be justified by those criminal gangs that \n     today want to drag Northern Ireland back to its bitter and \n     bloody past.\n       No Government I lead will ever put those who fight to \n     defend democracy on an equal footing with those who continue \n     to seek to destroy it.\n       But neither will we hide from the truth that confronts us \n     today.\n       In the words of Lord Saville--\n       ``What happened on Bloody Sunday strengthened the \n     Provisional IRA, increased nationalist resentment and \n     hostility towards the Army and exacerbated the violent \n     conflict of the years that followed. Bloody Sunday was a \n     tragedy for the bereaved and the wounded, and a catastrophe \n     for the people of Northern Ireland.''\n       These are words we can not and must not ignore.\n       But what I hope this Report can also do is to mark the \n     moment when we come together, in this House and in the \n     communities we represent.\n       Come together to acknowledge our shared history, even where \n     it divides us.\n       And come together to close this painful chapter on Northern \n     Ireland's troubled past.\n       That is not to say that we must ever forget or dismiss that \n     past.\n       But we must also move on.\n       Northern Ireland has been transformed over the past twenty \n     years . . .\n        . . . and all of us in Westminster and Stormont must \n     continue that work of change, coming together with all the \n     people of Northern Ireland to build a stable, peaceful, \n     prosperous and shared future.\n       It is with that determination that I commend this statement \n     to the House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/24/senate-section/article/S5434-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5434-S5435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ANGOLA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the National Security Strategy released \nlast month rightly states:\n\n       [d]ue to increased economic growth and political stability, \n     individual nations are increasingly taking on powerful \n     regional and global roles and changing the landscapes of \n     international cooperation. To achieve a just and sustainable \n     order that advances our shared security and prosperity, we \n     are, therefore, deepening our partnerships with emerging \n     powers and encouraging them to play a greater role in \n     strengthening international norms and advancing shared \n     interests.\n\n  The strategy goes on to note that expanding our partnerships with \nemerging powers includes a number of African nations, specifically \nSouth Africa. Indeed, I have great respect for South Africa's \nleadership on the continent and internationally and am glad that we are \nseeking to deepen our bilateral relationship. From peace and security \nto climate change to nuclear nonproliferation, we should continue to \nlook for areas where we can team up with the South Africans.\n  I would also like to highlight another emerging power in Sub-Saharan \nAfrica that we should not ignore: Angola. Many of my colleagues will \nrecall the brutal civil war that devastated Angola. In my first trip as \na Senator to Africa, in 1994, I traveled with Senator Reid and Senator \nPaul Simon to Angola to observe the tragic consequences of this \nconflict. Decades of war left an estimated 1 million people dead, a \nthird of the country's population displaced, and millions of landmines \nlittered throughout the countryside.\n  Yet since the war ended in 2002, Angolans have made tremendous \nstrides to secure the peace and rebuild their country. According to a \nrecent UNICEF study, since 2002 the percentage of children attending \nprimary school has increased from 56 to 76 percent and infant mortality \nhas fallen by 22 percent. At the same time, Angola's economy has \nregistered double-digit GDP growth over recent years, mostly driven by \nincreasing oil production. Angola's future growth prospects, however, \nare more diverse than just oil. According to the September 15, 2009, \nNew York Times article, ``Angola is poised to become a hub of liquefied \nnatural gas and diamond exports.''\n  With its economic growth and stability, Angola is also poised to play \na greater role on regional, continental, and international issues. It \nhas already become a major player in the Organization of Petroleum \nExporting Countries, OPEC, and although it is not a member of the G-20, \nPresident Dos Santos has been invited to some G-20 meetings. Angola has \nalso become involved in critical issues relating to the Gulf of Guinea, \nwhich sits to its north. It supported the launch of the Gulf of Guinea \nCommission in 2006 to resolve maritime disputes and ensure regional \ncooperation and hosted a summit for heads of the state of the \ncommission in 2008. Finally, Angola has the potential to play a much \nmore active future role on issues facing the Southern African \nDevelopment Community, SADC.\n  For all these reasons, the United States has a strong interest in \ndeepening and broadening our relationship with Angola. Secretary \nClinton's visit to the country last year--in which she became the first \nU.S. Secretary of State to stay overnight in the country--was a major \nstep to that end. She committed to developing a ``comprehensive \nstrategic partnership'' with Angola and to expanding our engagement in \nthe areas of trade, agriculture, health, and education.\n  To follow through on this commitment, we now need to ensure that our \nEmbassy in Luanda has the necessary programs and tools to pursue such a \npartnership. We need to ensure there are sufficient incentives and \nencouragement to attract Foreign Service officers to Angola given the \ninordinately high cost of living and other hardships. And we should try \nto ensure that we have the right staff, including representatives from \nother agencies that can bring expertise on issues of commerce and \nagriculture.\n  But expanding our engagement with Angola should not mean ignoring or \ndownplaying troubling issues of human rights and governance. In fact, \nit should be quite the opposite; we need to actively encourage reform \nin these important areas if we are going to pursue a truly \ncomprehensive and long-term partnership with Angola.\n\n[[Page S5435]]\n\n  According to the State Department's 2009 Human Rights Report for \nAngola, ``The government's human rights record remained poor, and there \nwere numerous, serious problems.'' Last weekend, the Wall Street \nJournal reported that there continue to be abuses and killings by \nsoldiers and private security guards around diamond mines in Angola. \nThe international community should investigate these reports and ensure \nthat Angola is fully living up to its commitments in the Kimberley \nProcess. If it is not, there should be serious consequences.\n  More broadly, we should also consider whether certain gaps in the \nKimberley Process, such as promoting greater protection for human \nrights, can be incorporated into the oversight procedures of \nparticipating countries. We need to be realistic about what is possible \nwith a voluntary organization, but we cannot allow ongoing human rights \nabuses involving diamonds to be ignored.\n  Issues of governance are also especially important for Angola's \ndevelopment prospects. While the country has seen tremendous overall \neconomic growth in recent years, most Angolans have seen little, if \nany, direct benefit. Corruption remains a serious and deep-seated \nproblem in Angola, including in the oil sector. For 2009, Transparency \nInternational ranked Angola 162nd out of 180 countries in its annual \nCorruption Perceptions Index. A report released in February by the \nSenate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations documented how \ncertain Angolan officials have sought to use U.S. banks and financial \ninstitutions to conceal funds acquired through corruption.\n  The Angolan Government has acknowledged that it needs to improve its \nfiscal management and practices, and President Dos Santos has called \nfor a ``zero tolerance'' policy against corruption. I am pleased that \nthe President has said this, and we should look for ways to help the \ngovernment give real meaning to such a policy. At the same time, we \nshould explore ways that we and our international partners can put \npressure on corrupt officials in Angola to cease their illicit actions, \nincluding travel bans and assets freezes, and more.\n  In terms of governance, it is also important that the Angolan \nGovernment create the space for a strong civil society to develop--one \nthat allows for the free flow of information and includes independent \nwatchdog institutions that can demand accountability and transparency. \nWe should seek to expand our engagement with civil society \norganizations and, as is appropriate, to help strengthen their capacity \nand amplify their voices in policy debates.\n  Within the government, Angola's National Assembly has the potential \nto play a strong oversight role, and I am pleased that Secretary \nClinton met directly with the National Assembly during her visit to \nLuanda last year. We should look for ways, such as technical assistance \nand parliamentary exchanges, that we can support and strengthen the \nNational Assembly's oversight roles.\n  Mr. President, none of this will be easy. Some in the Angolan \nGovernment are still unwelcoming toward the United States because of \npositions we took during their civil war. Many Angolans are also \nskeptical about whether we genuinely have interests beyond accessing \noil. We need to take these perspectives seriously. But I believe we can \nbreak through the suspicion and mistrust by demonstrating--through \ngreater resources and a more visible presence--that we seek a mutually \nbeneficial, long-term partnership with the people of Angola. In the \nmonths and years ahead, I look forward to working with the \nadministration to that end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/24/senate-section/article/S5435-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING JUDGE GERALD W. HEANEY\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, today I note with sorrow the passing of \none of America's great jurists, Judge Gerald W. Heaney. Judge Heaney \ndied Tuesday in Duluth, MN. Judge Heaney served with distinction and \nhonor for 40 years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. \nHe played a leading role in enforcing Brown v. Board of Education by \ndesegregating schools in, among other places, Kansas City, Omaha, and \nSt. Louis. A giant of the law, Judge Heaney will be remembered as not \nonly a brilliant jurist but a judge who helped make the promise of \nequality under the law a reality for many Americans.\n  Judge Heaney received both a bachelor's and law degree from the \nUniversity of Minnesota. During World War II, Judge Heaney served with \ndistinction in the Army, landing on Omaha Beach on D-day and staying in \nGermany after the war to help reform local labor laws. After returning \nfrom the war, Judge Heaney practiced labor law for 20 years. He \nnegotiated the contract that made Duluth public schools the first in \nthe State to adopt equal pay for women.\n  Judge Heaney's civic accomplishments before joining the Eighth \nCircuit are a testament to one of Minnesota's most public-spirited \nsons. He was instrumental in creating Duluth's Seaway Port Authority \nand the local public broadcasting station. He also served as a regent \nfor the University of Minnesota and was a lifelong champion of the \nUniversity of Minnesota Duluth.\n  As an appellate judge, Judge Heaney was devoted to enforcing the \nConstitution's promise of equal protection and expanding equality to \nall citizens, regardless of race, sex, religion, age, or disability. On \nthe occasion of his retirement 4 years ago, Minnesota Public Radio \ninterviewed Latonya Davis, a former student in the St. Louis public \nschools. Because of Judge Heaney's desegregation orders, Ms. Davis had \nthe opportunity to attend a suburban school that she says changed her \nlife:\n  ``I didn't even expect to go to college,'' she recalls. ``My junior \nyear in high school, I had a teacher say, `So what college you going \nto?' and I was like, `I'm not going.' Because I just knew it was \nexpensive, and I didn't think to go. I had bunch of teachers push me, \nand help me find ways to pay for it. They really wanted me to succeed \nin life.''\n  Ms. Davis is now a teacher herself with an advanced degree.\n  For Judge Heaney, equality of opportunity was also personal: he hired \nthe Eighth Circuit's first African-American and female law clerks.\n  Judge Heaney was a leading jurist on criminal justice issues. His \nopinions on the fourth amendment were exceedingly influential, \nincluding an argument in dissent concerning probable cause for a \nwarrant that later was adopted by the Supreme Court. Judge Heaney's \nscholarship on Federal sentencing was an impassioned plea for humanity \nand decency in sentencing.\n  Judge Heaney is survived by Eleanor, his wife of 64 years, his \ndaughter Carol, son Bill, sister Elizabeth, six grandchildren, and \neight great-grandchildren. I offer my deepest sympathies to all who \nknew and loved him. Vice President Mondale said it best when he said \nthat Judge Heaney was ``a great and decent human being, a superb judge \nand a really caring human being.''\n  Fittingly, the Federal courthouse in Duluth, MN, is named for Judge \nHeaney. It stands as a lasting monument to the cause of Judge Heaney's \nlife--providing equal justice under the law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/24/senate-section/article/S5435-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5435-S5436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           WING, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I recognize a community in \nNorth Dakota that will be celebrating its 100th anniversary. On July 16 \nto 18, 2010, the residents of Wing will gather to celebrate their \ncommunity's history and founding.\n  Wing, a Northern Pacific Railroad town site, was founded in 1910, and \nnamed after Charles Kleber Wing, who plotted many town sites, including \nMcClusky, Wing, Pingree, Robinson, and Regan. Leslie B. Draper \nestablished the first post office on April 15, 1911. Wing was later \nincorporated as a village in 1921.\n  Today, Wing's school and residential market continue to prosper. The \nrural area remains rich in wildlife, attracting many out-of-state and \ninstate hunters. The residents of Wing place great importance on \ninvolvement within the community. A strong Wing fire and ambulance \nservice exists in town, with many local residents and farmers \nvolunteering to perform much needed services.\n  Citizens of Wing have organized numerous activities to celebrate \ntheir centennial. Some of the celebratory festivities include socials, \na class parade, pitchfork fondue, a concert, and a street dance.\n\n[[Page S5436]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Wing, \nND, and its residents on the first 100 years and in wishing them well \nthrough the next century. By honoring Wing and all the other historic \nsmall towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier \nspirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Wing that \nhave helped to shape this country into what it is today, which is why \nthis fine community is deserving of our recognition.\n  Wing has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/24/senate-section/article/S5436-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO SUE FELLEN\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I offer tribute to a true \nleader and advocate for the rights of women and children in my home \nState of Idaho who deserve protection from abusive relationships. Sue \nFellen has been executive director for the Idaho Coalition Against \nSexual and Domestic Violence for more than a decade. She is announcing \na well-deserved retirement at the end of this month. Her work on behalf \nof Idaho women, children and family protection is one well worth noting \nby all Americans who cherish family and personal security and freedom.\n  Sue Fellen's track record of service on behalf of Idahoans will \nremain long after she leaves active service. While she has headed the \nstate's largest advocacy program to stop violence for 16 years now, she \nhas been working nearly twice that long in other capacities to stop \ndomestic violence and protect families, women and children across \nIdaho.\n  Sue Fellen began her career to stop domestic violence in the \ntrenches. She was a shelter manager and director for the Women and \nChildren's Association from 1982 through 1993. When she went on to head \nthe Idaho Coalition, she built a statewide network of more than 80 \norganizations, including law enforcement, prosecutors, health care \nproviders, victim advocates, victim witness coordinators, universities, \nand other professionals dedicated to preventing domestic violence and \nassisting victims of violence.\n  She is a trailblazer for Federal legislation protecting women. I know \nbecause I worked directly with Sue to pass the first-ever Federal law \nthat recognizes the rights of dating partners in abusive relationships \nand offered them Federal assistance for the first time. We were able to \nshepherd that groundbreaking legislation through the Congress and saw \nit signed into law in 2004. ``Cassie's Law'' was named for Cassie Dehl \nof Idaho, who died following an abusive dating relationship. Sue \nFellen, as a leader of the effort to stop abusive relationships in \nIdaho, was also a member of the National Network to End Domestic \nViolence. In her role in Idaho and nationally, Sue helped get the word \nout that this Idaho legislation should become a national model and I am \nproud to have partnered with her in these efforts.\n  Sue and I worked with a large group of Idahoans and found the funding \nand commitment to the first one-stop response center for response, \ntreatment and prosecution in domestic violence and sexual assault cases \nin Idaho. I am proud to say that the FACES Center--for Family Advocacy \nCenter and Education Services--has now been open nearly 5 years.\n  Sue Fellen and I have worked together on many other Federal issues. \nCongress has a penchant to want to spend money and on many occasions, \nleaders in both political parties have seen fit to borrow from the \nVictims of Crime Act, or VOCA. This fund is replenished by those who \nperpetrate crime and is intended as an ongoing fund to benefit the \nvictims of crime and family members who need assistance. By working \nwith advocates like Sue Fellen and my colleagues here in the Senate \nsuch as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, my friend Patrick \nLeahy of Vermont, we have been able to keep that VOCA funding intact, \nand away from being spent on programs for which that money was never \nintended.\n  I have been proud to partner with Sue and the National Network with \nother Senate colleagues as we strengthened the Violence Against Women \nAct, provided improved DNA and rape assistance kits to speed the \nconviction of assault cases and worked with private partners such as \nthe Liz Claiborne Foundation to broaden the audience for the critical \nmessage that domestic and sexual violence should not be tolerated. Not \nby Congress. Not by men. Not by anyone.\n  Surveys show that, out of the teenagers questioned, more than half, \n62 percent, know someone who has been in an abusive relationship with \ntheir boyfriend. Two in five know someone who has been put down or \ncalled stupid, many of them through the social media on their computers \nand texts on their phones.\n  One in five between the ages of 13 and 14 know of friends and peers \nwho have been hit, kicked, slapped or punched in anger. These \nstatistics should alarm all of us. I have often said men should not \nstand by and observe any domestic violence.\n  Thankfully, there are people who do not just stand by. They jump in. \nThey dedicate their lives to improving the safety of women, children \nand families. They are people like Sue Fellen and I am glad to call Sue \nmy friend and colleague in this effort.\n  Thank you, Sue. You and your husband Sherm, and even your dog Belle, \ncan look forward to a most well-deserved retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/24/senate-section/article/S5436-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JACOB COSTELLO\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

They also have the \nopportunity to learn more about the federal government and visit \nWashington's museums and memorials.\n  Jacob represents the best of our Arkansas values of hard work and \ndetermination. His dedication to volunteerism and public service is to \nbe admired by all Arkansans, and I commend him for this tremendous \nhonor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/24/senate-section/article/S5436-3", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5436-S5437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING GAY ISLAND OYSTER COMPANY\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, one of the most beloved summer \ntraditions we have in coastal Maine is enjoying fresh seafood from our \nState's numerous bays and harbors. While Maine is of course famous for \nits exquisite lobster, parts of our State are also undergoing a \nrenaissance in oyster harvesting, particularly in the midcoast region. \nToday, I rise to recognize one of the companies involved in this \nreinvigoration of the industry, the Gay Island Oyster Company, a small \nfamily-run business founded in 2000 in the small seaside town of \nCushing by Tara and Barrett Lynde.\n  A historic source of food in Maine, oysters have been gathered off \nthe State's coast for over 5,000 years. Certain excavations have even \nfound piles of shucked oysters, also known as ``middens,'' over 30 feet \ndeep near the Damariscotta River near present-day route 1. \nUnfortunately, by 1949, climate changes, development, overfishing, and \npollution had all but eliminated Maine's native oyster population. In \nresponse, Maine's Department of Sea and Shore Fisheries began a \nconcerted effort to return this unique bivalve to local waters.\n  The Gay Island Oyster Company is one of the pioneering small \nbusinesses to take advantage of this reintroduction and has helped to \nrevolutionize Maine's aquaculture industry. The owners of the company, \nTara and Barrett Lynde, also hold a special distinction as a dynamic \nmother-and-son oyster harvesting team. Their oyster farm is unique in \nits harvesting methods, using floating mesh bags which bring Gay \nIsland's oysters to the water's surface exposing them to tidal water \nflows. Tara and Barrett say that by\n\n[[Page S5437]]\n\nbringing oysters, which are normally found on the bottom of the ocean, \nto the surface, the oysters benefit from constant movement which \ntranslates into deeper oysters, narrower shells, and a cleaner taste. \nThis method ensures that Gay Island oysters are full and sweet with \nperfect salinity and consistent taste.\n  To harvest these oysters, Tara and Barrett first place oyster \nseedlings in the calmer and less salty waters of the Meduncook River. \nAfter about a year they are moved a short distance away to an area \nbetween Gay and Morse islands, just off the coast of Cushing. The \noysters then remain there for 2 more years before they are ready for \nharvest and consumption.\n  Gay Island Oyster Company is proud to remain a small business, and \nTara and Barrett believe that their individual attention to detail \nallows them to ensure that the quality of their oysters will remain \nhigh. As a small family owned and operated business, Gay Island Oyster \nCompany's efforts at responsible and sustainable oyster cultivation are \na positive contribution towards a sensible use of such a precious \nresource. While Gay Island oysters are found in numerous restaurants, \nthey can also be ordered from anywhere in the United States online, and \nare shipped the same day they are harvested to guarantee an unmatched \nfreshness.\n  Maine's coastal heritage is critical to the past, present, and future \nof our State. While we often recognize the lobstermen and fishermen who \nspend long hours hauling in their catches, oystermen and other \nshellfishermen deserve credit for the intensity of their labors.

A bill to promote coastal jobs creation, promote sustainable \nfisheries and fishing communities, revitalize waterfronts, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Coastal Jobs \nCreation Act of 2010. This bill would establish a grant program within \nthe Department of Commerce to enhance employment opportunities for \ncoastal communities by increasing support for cooperative research \nprograms, revitalization of coastal infrastructure, and stewardship of \ncoastal and marine resources. As Ranking Member of the Senate \nSubcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast Guard, and as \na Senator from a State which relies heavily on its coastal region as an \neconomic driver, I am acutely aware of the hardships that have been \nvisited on these areas in recent years.\n  I particularly want to thank my lead cosponsor on this key piece of \nlegislation, Senator Lautenberg. Clearly, his home State of New Jersey \nshares many of the same issues we face in Maine when it comes to \nensuring the vitality of our historic fishing and coastal industries, \nand I greatly appreciate his support of this initiative. I also want to \nthank the bill's additional cosponsors, Senators Whitehouse, Collins, \nShaheen, Boxer, Kerry, and Cantwell, for their vital contributions.\n  As our Nation struggles to recover from the ongoing recession, it is \ncritical that we do all we can to create employment opportunities. I \nhave said it before, and I will say it again: the jobless recovery that \nour Nation is currently experiencing is not a true economic recovery. \nWhile the most recent unemployment figures may have shown a decline \nfrom 9.9 to 9.7 percent--of course, welcome news--the private sector is \nnot creating jobs. Indeed, there were 411,000 temporary Census \nemployees hired in May, as opposed to the 41,000 new jobs in the \nprivate sector. This does not bode well for our future\n\n[[Page S5441]]\n\neconomic health, and does not instill confidence in our fragile \neconomy.\n  Ultimately, what affects our coastal economy drives our Nation's \neconomy. More than 75 percent of growth in this country from 1997 to \n2007, whether measured in population, jobs, or GDP, occurred in coastal \nStates, and more than half of U.S. citizens live in coastal \ncommunities. As the Nation's economy has struggled through the ongoing \nrecession, maritime industries have experienced more than their share \nof hardship. This has been compounded in the fishing industry by \nregulatory changes mandated by the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \nConservation and Management Act which we reauthorized in 2006. The law \nnow requires strict, science-based annual catch limits to be imposed in \nall fisheries by 2011. While we expect these changes will ultimately be \nbeneficial to the health of the fish stocks, they have dire economic \nimplications today.\n  On April 18, 2010, Bumble Bee Foods shuttered the last sardine \ncannery in the United States, which had been located in Prospect \nHarbor, Maine. This closure can be attributed to a single cause: the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service's decision to slash the catch limit \nfor herring by 38 percent for 2010, meaning there were not enough fish \navailable to supply the plant. Scientists did not recommend this \nreduction because herring is overfished--it is not--but rather because \nthey did not have the data to provide sufficient confidence in the \nstock assessment. In addition to impacts on the herring and lobster \nfisheries, this lack of data has directly resulted in a century-old \nfish processing plant closing its doors, costing an economically \ndepressed community 130 jobs and spelling the end of an entire industry \nin the United States. If the law's new mandates are to be effective, \nthey will require an infusion of better scientific data. The grant \nprogram authorized in this legislation will lead to more cooperative \nresearch to improve fishery-dependent data and increase employment \nopportunities for fishermen by involving them in the research process.\n  An additional concern this bill would help alleviate is the rapid \ndecline in availability of working waterfront property. As Americans \nmove to the coast in greater numbers, the demand for waterfront \nproperty increases, boosting prices and raising the tax burdens on \nwaterfront property owners. According to a report by Maine Sea Grant \nand the Island Institute, a non-profit advocacy group, of the more than \n5,300 miles of Maine's coastline, just 20 miles remain in use as \nworking waterfront property--less than half of one percent of the \npotential area. This bill would authorize grants to recapitalize \nworking waterfront property to stem the loss of this vital \ninfrastructure without which our coastal industries will simply vanish.\n  If enacted, this critical legislation would greatly enhance the \nhealth and vitality of our Nation's coastal communities, and help put \nour Nation on a path to a true economic recovery, driven by small \nbusinesses and private sector job creation. Once again, I thank Senator \nLautenberg, and all of my cosponsors again for their efforts in \ndeveloping this vital legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HAGAN:\n  S. 3529. A bill to require that certain Federal job training and \ncareer education programs give priority to programs that provide an \nindustry-recognized and nationally portable credential; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, today, I am proud to introduce an \nimportant piece of legislation to spur job growth across America. The \nAmerican Manufacturing Efficiency and Retraining Investment \nCollaboration Achievement Works Act also known as the AMERICA Works Act \nis part of the solution to the Nation's unemployment problem.\n  With the national unemployment rate at 9.7 percent, and at 10.8 \npercent in my home state of North Carolina, we need to do everything we \ncan to reinvigorate the American workforce.\n  The United States needs a strong technical workforce. Our country is \nfacing a widening skills gap between older workers with advanced \ntechnical skills who will be retiring in the next few years, and the \nyounger workers who have not yet received adequate training to replace \nthem. The benefits of industry-recognized credentials are widely known, \nbut too often those credentials do not count toward educational \nrequirements, do not match the needs of local employers, or require too \nmuch time to earn just one credential. Ultimately, the system ends up \nbreaking down, to the detriment of instructors, employers, and \nemployees.\n  The AMERICA Works Act would give priority to Federal job training \nprograms that provide an industry-recognized and nationally-portable \ncredential. The legislation encourages national industries to come \ntogether and agree upon common standards, defining the skill sets \nneeded in employees. Once industries have agreed upon standards, they \ncan work with educational institutions to turn the standards into \nworkable curriculums with tiered or stackable credentials. Ultimately, \nlocal workforce boards can help workers seeking training and employment \nopportunity by directing them toward job training programs that have \npriority under existing Federal programs.\n  The AMERICA Works Act would require certain Federal job training and \ncareer development education programs to give priority to programs that \nprovide an industry-recognized and nationally-portable credential. This \ncredentialing system starts out with basic competencies that prepare \nindividuals for the workplace. Once basic competencies are completed, \nindividuals can work toward high performance technical competencies and \nthen progress further to highly skilled technical and management \ncompetencies. The credentialing levels are stackable, allowing workers \nflexibility along their career tracks. Stackable credentials provide \nstraight forward paths, with clear entry and exit points, for workers \nto advance their careers and attain high quality jobs.\n  In North Carolina, we have an advanced manufacturing skills program \nat Forsyth Technical Community College in Winston-Salem. Forsyth \nTechnical Community College is participating in the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers Endorsed Skills Certification System, \nwhich offers credit programs toward nationally-recognized, stackable \ncredentials. Currently, they have 207 students enrolled in their \nprograms. Forsyth Technical has already collaborated with State and \nlocal businesses to begin the process of incorporating their \ncredentials into job descriptions. They believe that introducing \ngraduates with skill certifications into the local workforce will help \nimprove the hiring process, and these nationally-recognized credentials \nwill increase employment opportunities.\n  The AMERICA Works Act will benefit business. When businesses clearly \nidentify skills they need in their employees, educational institutions \ncan tailor programs to teach those skills and workers will be better \nsuited to meet their needs--starting on day one.\n  This legislation will benefit workers. Stackable credentials benefit \nworkers by offering several on-ramps and off-ramps to a two-year \ntechnical degree: workers in training can exit the system having earned \na basic, industry-recognized credential that qualifies them for \nemployment, but without having completed the full two-year technical \ndegree, and they can easily re-enter the system later to move up within \ntheir field and work toward the more advanced degree.\n  The AMERICA Works Act will benefit educational programs. Local \neducational institutes want to provide their students with the most \nuseful skills possible. Open lines of communication between businesses, \nworkforce boards and workers will better enable them to do just that.\n  This legislation will benefit local economies. Local workforce boards \nwill have the chance to determine which skills training programs are \nmost valuable for their region, today and into the future. Local areas \nwith well-trained workforces can more effectively lure new businesses. \nWhile this bill mentions manufacturing, it would benefit any industry \nthat meets the criteria established in the legislation.\n  I want to do everything I can to create jobs and make sure our \nworkers have the skills needed to help our businesses grow and thrive. \nBy incentivizing companies to work with educational institutes and \ndevelop industry-recognized, nationally-portable,\n\n[[Page S5442]]\n\nand stackable credentialing curricula, we can ensure that we have the \nbest businesses, with the best workers, trained at the best institutes.\n  I urge my other colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nbill to enhance employment opportunity for hardworking Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 3534. A bill to establish a Native American entrepreneurial \ndevelopment program in the Small Business Administration; to the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as Chair of the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, I am pleased to introduce the Native \nAmerican Small Business Assistance and Entrepreneurial Growth Act of \n2010. This vital and timely legislation codifies and builds upon the \nSmall Business Administration's, SBA, existing efforts through the \nOffice of Native American Affairs, which is responsible for overseeing \nand implementing programs that are specifically tailored to meet the \nneeds of the Native American community. By strengthening and improving \nthese programs, the SBA will be able to reach even more Native \nAmericans, helping them to achieve their dream of starting or growing \ntheir own small businesses and spurring vital and necessary growth \nwithin tribal communities.\n  According to the most recent report released by the U.S. Census \nbureau, the ``three year average poverty rate for American Indians and \nAlaska Natives was 25.9 percent higher than for any other race \ngroups.'' Additionally, research shows that entrepreneurial development \nis playing a significant role in promoting healthy tribal economies, \nand fostering much needed economic growth in various industries. Data \nfrom the 2000 U.S. Census shows that since 1997, the number of Native \nAmerican-owned businesses has risen by 84 percent to 197,300, and that \ntheir gross incomes have increased by 179 percent to $34.5 billion.\n  However, in the face of historically high unemployment and tight \ncredit, particularly for Native Americans, starting a business has \nnever been more difficult. During the 111th Congress, the Committee has \nheard from industry experts, organizational leaders and entrepreneurs \nworking in or on behalf of Native American communities. From them, we \nknow that, despite the growth we are seeing in Native American-owned \nbusinesses, more resources are needed to provide additional technical \nassistance and business development opportunities so as to ensure the \neconomic sustainability and growth within tribal communities. According \nto the Aspen Institute, ``training and technical assistance are \narguably the most important components of microenterprise development \nservices in the United States, particularly when those services are \naimed at low-income clients.'' Additionally, according to the \nCorporation for Enterprise Development, this is particularly true for \nNative American entrepreneurs operating in environments that have not \ntraditionally been geared towards private enterprise. For these \nreasons, it is critical that we do more to provide necessary resources \nfor Native American entrepreneurial development programs that are \nworking to address critical sustainability issues in tribal \ncommunities.\n  That is why today I am introducing the Native American Small Business \nAssistance and Entrepreneurial Growth Act of 2010. Since its \nestablishment, SBA's Office of Native American Affairs worked to \npromote and support Native American entrepreneurs and to encourage \nimportant entrepreneurial activity in Native American communities. This \nlegislation will further enhance and improve the existing programs \nwithin the Office of Native American Affairs, as well as create a new \nprogram that provides financial assistance to eligible entities to \ncreate Native American business centers which will conduct projects to \nprovide culturally tailored business development training and related \nservices to Native Americans and Native American small business \nconcerns.\n  In introducing this important piece of legislation today, I would \nnote that many of the provisions in this bill were included in S. 1229, \nthe Entrepreneurial Development Act of 2009, which I introduced earlier \nthis Congress and which passed out of Committee with unanimous and bi-\npartisan support in June of 2009. It is also the basis for many of the \nSBA related provisions included in the Native American Employment Act \nof 2010 that Senator Dorgan, Chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on \nIndian Affairs introduced earlier this month. Given the importance of \nthis legislation to hundreds of thousands of Native American-owned \nbusinesses, and the potential we have before us to strengthen one of \nAmerica's greatest emerging markets, I have decided to re-introduce \nthese provisions as a stand-alone bill. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues in the Senate to bring this legislation to the \nPresident's desk in the coming months.\n  In closing, I would like to thank Chairman Dorgan for his continued \nleadership on behalf of existing and future Native American small \nbusiness owners, and especially for his cosponsorship of this important \nlegislation. Chairman Dorgan has been a tireless advocate for Native \nAmerican communities across the country and in his home state of North \nDakota, and I am pleased to have his support on this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3534\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for certain land exchanges in Gunnison \nCounty, Colorado, and Uintah County, Utah; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about \nlegislation I am introducing, co-sponsored by Senators Bennett, Hatch, \nand Bennet of Colorado, to effectuate a relatively small land exchange \ninvolving\n\n[[Page S5445]]\n\nlands in Colorado and Utah. The exchange involves a private ranch, the \nU.S. Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service.\n  In a nutshell, the private Bear Ranch in central/west Colorado is \ncompletely bisected by a narrow strip of BLM land, mostly 1/4 to 1/2 \nmile wide, which is of limited public use due to its narrow \nconfiguration. The Bear Ranch would like to acquire the BLM strip in \norder to consolidate its ranch holdings for more efficient land, ranch \nand wildlife management, and to improve wildlife enhancement. There is \nalso an issue of inadvertent trespass onto the Bear Ranch from the \nneighboring BLM land that would be eliminated by the Bear Ranch's \nacquisition of the BLM land strip.\n  In return for the BLM land, the Bear Ranch has purchased or optioned \ntwo magnificent tracts of land in Colorado and Utah that would be added \ninto the National Park System. The first is a 911 acre property near \nthe shores of the heavily used Blue Mesa Reservoir in the Curecanti \nNational Recreation Area outside of Gunnison, CO. This property has an \nimportant sage grouse habitat, superb views of both the Blue Mesa \nReservoir and the spectacular Dillon Pinnacles, and an important elk \nand deer winter range. A portion of it might also be utilized for a \nfuture park visitor center.\n  In Utah, the Bear Ranch has optioned 80 acres located inside Dinosaur \nNational Monument. The so-called Orchid Draw property is about 1 mile \nwest of the Monument's Quarry Visitor Center and is thought to contain \nrich dinosaur and vertebrate fossil resources. It is also within an \narea of special botanic interest, with nine sensitive plant species. \nThe Park Service has been trying to acquire this property for a long \ntime.\n  There are several other special features of our legislation which \ndeserve special mention.\n  First, the Bear Ranch will place a permanent conservation status on \nall the land it acquires from the BLM which will limit future use of \nthe land to ranching, wildlife conservation, open space and \nrecreational purposes only.\n  Second, the BLM land will be appraised at its full market value \nbefore the conservation easement is put in place so that the U.S. \ntaxpayers will get full value for the land they convey to the Bear \nRanch.\n  Third, if the land Bear Ranch conveys to the Park Service appraises \nhigher than the BLM land, the Bear Ranch will forego any cash \nequalization payment which might otherwise be due from the U.S., and \nwill instead donate the excess value to the U.S.\n  Fourth, the Bear Ranch has committed to donate up to $250,000 for new \ntrail, trailhead and other outdoor recreational improvements in the \nvicinity of the land exchange in order to improve public access and \nenhance recreational opportunities on nearby Forest Service and BLM \nlands. Exactly where, and how, those funds will be used will be \ndetermined by BLM and Forest Service planning that is currently \nunderway.\n  Our legislation has received the support of the local county and town \ngovernments of jurisdiction in both Colorado and Utah, and from \nnumerous environmental, conservation, recreation, historic and natural \npreservation organizations. Those include Gunnison County. CO, Uintah \nCounty, UT, the City of Gunnison, CO, City of Vernal, UT, the Nature \nConservancy, National Parks & Conservation Association, Thunder \nMountain Wheelers, Intermountain Natural History Association, and \nseveral others.\n  The bill also effectuates another small land for right of way \nexchange near Marble, CO, in order to facilitate a proposed small \nhydroelectric project and to acquire a new public trailhead to access \nthe popular Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness Area. That exchange is \nendorsed by the Aspen Valley Land Trust, Holy Cross Electric \nAssociation, a rural electric cooperative, the Town of Marble, CO and \nGunnison County, CO, among others.\n  In summary, this legislation represents a true ``win-win'' for both \nthe general public and numerous local communities. I thank my \ncolleagues, Senators Bennett, Hatch, and Bennet for joining me in \nsponsoring the bill, and for Congressmen John Salazar, Jim Matheson and \nMike Thompson for introducing an identical bill in the House. I am \nlooking forward to the Senate's expeditious consideration and approval \nso that it can become law this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 3538. A bill to improve the cyber security of the United States \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernment Affairs.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, over the past several months, our Homeland \nhas experienced direct terrorist attacks against two military bases and \nattempted terrorist attacks on Christmas Day and in Times Square. These \nattacks quickly captured the attention of the American public and stand \nas stark reminders of the threats our Nation continues to face from \nterrorists across the globe.\n  After these recent attacks, I have no doubt that every American is \naware of the threat from a terrorist with a bomb, which could take out \na city block or bring down an airplane. But I am afraid that right now, \nthe American public is largely unaware of a silent threat that could \ndevastate our entire Nation--cyber attacks.\n  These cyber attacks happen every day, but have remained largely under \nthe public radar. Our government, businesses, citizens, and even social \nnetworking sites all have been hit. Cyber attacks are on the rise and \nunless our private sector and Congress start down a better path to \nprotect our information networks, serious damage to our economy and our \nnational security will follow.\n  In an ever-increasing cyber age, where our financial system conducts \ntrades via the Internet, families pay bills online, and the government \nuses computers to calculate benefits and implement war strategies, \nsuccessful cyber attacks can be devastating. The nightmare scenarios no \nlonger exist just in Hollywood movies. Imagine if a terrorist disrupted \nour air traffic control on an average day with more than 28,000 \ncommercial aircraft in our skies; if a hacker took down Wall Street \ntrading for just hours; or if an attack destroyed an electrical grid in \na major city.\n  Scenarios like these make it even more important that we listen to \nthe recent comments by former Director of National Intelligence Mike \nMcConnell who testified that ``[i]f we were in a cyber war today, the \nUnited States would lose.'' That is no insignificant statement coming \nfrom a military and intelligence veteran like Mike McConnell and it \nshould cause all of us to pause and take a look at how we should \nneutralize this rising threat. Our networks and way of life could be \ntaken down by an enemy state, a terrorist group, or a single hacker. \nThat is why Senator Hatch and I are introducing the National Cyber \nInfrastructure Protection Act of 2010 today.\n  Let me be blunt here: our enemies won't wait for us to do our \nhomework, solve our turf battles, or modernize our laws before using \nour networks as a deadly weapon; in fact, the attacks have already \nstarted. We do not have another day to waste, and I believe our bill is \nthe best solution to address this threat.\n  This act is built on three principles: first, we must be clear about \nwhere Congress should, and, more importantly, should not legislate. \nCongress should set lanes in the road to protect our Nation's cyber \nsecurity, but leave flexibility for the private sector and government \nto adapt to changing threats within those lanes.\n  In 1978, when the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was enacted, \nit put into law certain technologies. Those technologies changed and \nthus FISA was ineffective in enabling us to listen in on cell phone and \ne-mail traffic between terrorists in foreign countries.\n  We have seen within the past few years the national security problems \nthat can arise when laws are too rigid to keep pace with technology. We \nhave also heard repeated concerns from industry, the private sector, \nand those operating critical infrastructure that overlegislating by \nCongress ultimately will make it harder to protect our networks as \ninnovation and quick response get overrun by unnecessary regulatory \nschemes and mandates.\n  Second, right now virtually every Federal department or agency has\n\n[[Page S5446]]\n\nsomeone who is responsible for cyber security issues. But who makes \nsure that all those departments and agencies work together to protect \nall of our government networks? Who is the one person responsible, with \nauthority to impact our cyber security strategies and activities? \nUnfortunately, right now, the answer is ``no one.''\n  To solve this problem, our bill establishes a National Cyber Center \nand designates a single, Senate-confirmed individual, accountable to \nthe Congress and the American people and reporting directly to the \nPresident, to serve as the Director. The Director has the statutory \nresponsibility and authority to coordinate activities to protect \ngovernment networks and develop policies and procedures to help Federal \nagencies do the job.\n  In order to reduce the center's operating costs and to capitalize on \nthe cyber expertise we all know resides in the Department of Defense, \nthe National Cyber Center is administratively placed in DOD. But, out \nof deference to concerns that the military should not have too much \ncontrol over government networks, the center is not run by the Defense \nDepartment and the Director does not report to the Secretary of \nDefense.\n  Because a key part of the center is to make sure the right people are \ntalking to each other, the act requires those parts of DOD, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, the Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation needed to carry \nout the center's missions to collocate and integrate within the center, \nmuch like the National Counterterrorism Center integrates elements of \nthe intelligence community. Other Federal agencies may also participate \nin the center.\n  As we put this bill together, former senior intelligence community \nofficials told us that providing strong budget authority was essential \nfor the Director to have the clout needed to do the job. And so, this \nact gives the Director clear input into cyber budgets across all \nFederal agencies, much like the Federal drug czar has in coordinating \ncounterdrug budgets across different agencies. To hit this point home, \nthe act also creates a National Cyber Security Program, similar to the \nNational Intelligence Program. Such influence--influence that the \ncurrent cyber czar simply does not have--is essential to creating a \ncomprehensive, cost-effective approach to securing our government \ninformation networks.\n  The third and final principle underlying this act is the idea that \nthere must be a venue for the government and the private sector to \ncollaborate and share information on cyber-related matters. The private \nsector is often on the front lines of cyber attacks, so any information \nit can provide to increase government awareness of the source and \nnature of cyber threats will make both government and the private \nsector stronger. The corollary to this is that the Government must \nshare its own cyber threat information, including classified or \ndeclassified intelligence, with the private sector.\n  Moreover, this collaboration, in order to be effective, must be \nvoluntary. Once the private sector stands to gain technical advice and \ngreater access to cyber threat information, there will be a clear \nincentive to join with the government in protecting our networks.\n  Our bill codifies this collaboration, creating a public-private \npartnership known as the Cyber Defense Alliance to facilitate the flow \nof information about cyber threats and the latest technologies between \nthe private sector and the government. The Alliance will be the \nclearinghouse for passing sensitive cyber threat information to the \nprivate and critical infrastructure entities on the front lines, but \nwithout compromising our intelligence sources and methods.\n  We agree with intelligence experts and private sector representatives \nwho have told us if the heavy hand of government drives this \ncollaboration, it will not be effective. Therefore, the alliance will \nbe managed by a board of directors consisting largely of private sector \nrepresentatives and located in the Department of Energy, where the \nexisting National Labs have great expertise to share. Because our \nprivate partners must know the information will not be compromised or \nother consequences will occur, the act gives solid protections from \nFOIA, antitrust restrictions, and other limitations.\n  This bill is one of many cyber-bills introduced in Congress, so some \nmay be asking why this approach is better.\n  A key aspect of this bill is that it provides a practical public-\nprivate cyber infrastructure designed to address effectively the cyber \nthreat rather than preserve the jurisdictional turf of any one agency \nor congressional oversight committee. In other words--I don't have a \ndog in this fight--I just want to pass the best bill to protect our \nnetworks. The cyber threat will only be eliminated when we get all of \nthe public and private players working together in harmony under a \ncommon vision toward common mission objectives.\n  Our bill does not impose mandates on industry and the private \nsector--mandates and regulations that form the core of other bills, \nraising substantial concerns among our industry and private sector \npartners. Our economy is in turmoil as it is and the last thing we need \nare mandates imposed on U.S. businesses that will put them at a serious \ncompetitive disadvantage and jeopardize their proprietary information \nin the global marketplace. Many industry partners have told us that if \nwe mandate this it would put them at a competitive disadvantage.\n  Finally, our bill moves away from the notion that creating a \nstatutory cyber coordinator in the Executive Office of the President \nwill solve the cyber security problem. The current cyber security \ncoordinator in the White House has neither the authority nor the staff \nto coordinate the government's wide-range of cyber operations and \nstrategies. Simply enshrining his position in statute will not overcome \nthe claims of ``Executive Privilege'' that are bound to come when \nCongress asks for information and it will not guarantee the leadership \nnecessary to address the cyber threat.\n  Also, I think many of my colleagues would agree that now is not the \ntime to give the Department of Homeland Security more responsibility, \nas some of the cyber bills out there want to do. I don't think many in \nthis Chamber would disagree that DHS is already overburdened.\n  The bill we are introducing today has already earned praise from the \nelectric power sector because of the cooperative relationship that the \nCyber Defense Alliance created in this bill fosters between the \ngovernment and private sector. The entities that are part of the \nelectric power sector recognize that this bill builds on what is \nalready working and creates the infrastructure necessary to ensure a \ncooperative relationship between all of the relevant public and private \ncyber players to address the evolving cyber-security threat. I ask \nunanimous consent that this statement from the electric power sector be \nmade a part of the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        The National Cyber Infrastructure Protection Act of 2010\n\n       Protecting the North American electric grid and ensuring a \n     reliable supply of power is the electric power industry's top \n     priority. Reliability is more than a buzzword for the \n     electric industry--it's a mandate. In fact, electric \n     companies can be assessed substantial penalties for failure \n     to comply with reliability standards.\n       This focus on reliability, resiliency and recovery requires \n     the power sector to take an all-hazards approach, recognizing \n     risks from natural phenomena such as hurricanes or \n     geomagnetic disturbances to intentional cyber attacks. The \n     electric power sector works closely with the North American \n     Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and federal agencies \n     to enhance the cyber security of the bulk power system. This \n     includes coordination with the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission (FERC), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), \n     and the Department of Energy (DOE), as well as federal \n     intelligence and law enforcement agencies, and various \n     federal and provincial authorities in Canada.\n       To complement its cyber security efforts and to address \n     rapidly changing intelligence on evolving threats, the \n     industry welcomes a cooperative relationship with federal \n     authorities to protect against situations that threaten \n     national security or public welfare, and to prioritize the \n     assets that need enhanced security. A well-practiced, public-\n     private partnership utilizes all stakeholders' expertise, \n     including the government's ability to gather and share timely \n     and actionable threat information with critical \n     infrastructure asset owners and operators, upon which they \n     can formulate appropriate mitigation strategies to prevent \n     significant adverse consequences to utility operations or \n     assets.\n\n[[Page S5447]]\n\n     The comprehensive draft cyber security legislation under \n     development in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \n     attempts to create such a cooperative relationship by: * * *\n\n  Mr. BOND. In addition, because, the vice chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee, believe no legislation in this area should impede the \nintelligence community's ability to protect our nation from terrorist \nattacks and other threats, we asked the Office of the Director of \nNational Intelligence for an informal assessment of our bill. They told \nus that, unlike other bills that have been introduced, this bill \nprotects intelligence community equities, especially with respect to \nprotecting classified intelligence sources and methods.\n  The National Cyber Infrastructure Protection Act of 2010 provides \nbroad lanes in the road, without micromanaging, to give all partners in \ncyber security, whether government or private, the flexibility to \ndefend against threats from our enemies. The private sector already has \na tremendous incentive to protect their own networks; all the Federal \nGovernment needs to do is support them with technology and information \nand get out of the way.\n  Cyber attackers have been stealing intellectual property, threatening \nto take down our critical infrastructure, and gaining insight into our \nnational security networks. The longer Congress waits to act, the more \nour vulnerability to these attacks increases. The National Cyber \nInfrastructure Protection Act will put the Government, our critical \ninfrastructure companies, and the private sector on the right path to \nsecuring our networks. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise to express my support as a \ncosponsor of the National Cyber Infrastructure Protection Act. At long \nlast, our Nation is finally recognizing the increasing danger posed by \ncyber threats and the devastating disruption that they can cause \nbecause of the interdependent nature of information systems that \nsupport our Nation's critical infrastructure.\n  As a Nation, we must develop a strategy that provides a strategic \nframework to prevent cyber attacks against America's critical \ninfrastructures. As a government, we must reduce national vulnerability \nto cyber attacks and minimize the damage and recovery time from cyber \nattacks should they occur. I believe that the legislation that my \ncolleague from Missouri and I are introducing today will provide a sure \nfoundation to put our Nation on a path to begin to address cyber \nvulnerabilities.\n  The challenge to protect cyberspace is vast and complex and \nultimately requires the efforts of the entire government. As a Nation, \nwe must recognize that cyber threats are multi-faceted and global in \nnature. These threats operate in an environment that rapidly changes. \nThe sharing of information between government and the private sector is \ncrucial to our overall national and economic viability.\n  Last January, McAfee issued a report that concluded that the use of \ncyber attacks as a strategic weapon by governments and political \norganizations is on the rise. The U.S. is the most targeted nation in \nthe world--and our military, government, and private sector systems are \noften attacked with impunity. Our Nation has experienced large-scale \nmalicious cyber intrusions from individuals, groups and nations. These \nattacks have dramatically increased in number and complexity.\n  Just last year, Google and over 30 other companies linked to our \nenergy, finance, defense, technology and media sectors fell prey to \ncostly cyber attacks. Too many nations either directly sanction this \nactivity or give it tacit approval by failing to investigate or \nprosecute the perpetrators. Many of the major incidents are presently \ncoming out of Russia and China.\n  The National Cyber Infrastructure Protection Act would establish a \nNational Cyber Center, housed within the Department of Defense. The \nmission of the National Cyber Center would be to serve as the primary \norganization for coordinating Federal Government defensive operations, \ncyber intelligence collection and analysis, and activities to protect \nand defend Federal Government information networks. Critical in \nachieving this mission would be the sharing of information between the \nprivate sector and federal agencies regarding cyber threats. This \ncenter would be led by a Senate-confirmed director modeled after the \nDirector of National Intelligence position. The director reports \ndirectly to the President and would coordinate cyber activities to \nprotect and defend Federal Government information networks. The \ndirector would serve as the President's principal adviser on such \nmatters and developing policies for securing Federal Government \ninformation networks.\n  In our Nation today, over 3/4 of our Nation's critical infrastructure \nis under the control of the private sector. One such example is smart \ngrid technology for power grids. The Smart Grid will use automated \nmeters, two-way communications and advanced sensors to improve \nelectricity efficiency and reliability. The nation's utilities have \nembraced the concept and are installing millions of automated meters on \nhomes across the country. However, cyber security experts have \ndetermined that some types of meters can be hacked. As we rely on \ntechnology developed by private industry, we must ensure that we harden \nthis technology against threats that could leave our citizens \nvulnerable.\n  The opening salvos of future conflicts will be launched in \ncyberspace. In 2008, we saw this occur when Russian forces launched a \ncyber attack on Georgian defense and information networks. The Russians \nessentially blinded the Georgian military during the South Ostessia \nconflict. Our reliance on technology and integrated networks certainly \nmakes our military and critical infrastructure more efficient. However, \nthat efficiency can have its price in the form of cyber vulnerability.\n  As Americans, we must be prepared to fight back should we be \nattacked. We must also harden our networks against the tools that \ncriminals use to steal a person's identity and a company's trade \nsecrets. These are the same tools that today can and will be used by \nterrorists in the future to attack and erode our infrastructure and \ndefense systems. The stakes are too high and the risks are too grave to \ndelay.

Res. 565\n\n       Whereas 2010 marks the 40th anniversary of the family \n     planning services programs operating under title X of the \n     Public Health Service Act which has for 40 years provided \n     low-income people in the United States access to \n     contraceptive services, supplies, and information regardless \n     of their ability to pay for these services;\n       Whereas a 2009 report from the Institute of Medicine echoed \n     the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's finding \n     that, ``family planning is one of the most significant public \n     health achievements of the twentieth century'';\n       Whereas the family planning services programs operating \n     under title X are the only dedicated source of Federal \n     funding for family planning services in the United States;\n       Whereas in 2008, 17,400,000 people were in need of publicly \n     funded services and supplies;\n       Whereas in 2008, title X-funded family planning providers \n     worked tirelessly to serve over 5,000,000 low-income men and \n     women;\n       Whereas publicly supported family planning services, such \n     as those provided by title X, help to prevent 1,500,000 \n     unintended pregnancies each year;\n       Whereas the contribution of family planning services in \n     assisting women in the planning and spacing of their \n     pregnancies is linked to a reduction in infant mortality;\n       Whereas every dollar spent to provide services in the \n     nationwide network of publicly funded family planning clinics \n     saves $3.74 in Medicaid-related costs;\n\n[[Page S5448]]\n\n       Whereas title X funds allow health centers to provide an \n     array of confidential preventive health services, including \n     contraceptive services, pelvic exams, pregnancy testing, \n     screening for cervical and breast cancer, screening for high \n     blood pressure, anemia, and diabetes, screening for STDs, \n     including HIV, basic infertility services, health education, \n     and referrals for other health and social services;\n       Whereas in 2008, title X centers provided over 2,200,000 \n     Pap tests and over 2,300,000 clinical breast exams; and\n       Whereas women who have access to family planning services \n     have better health outcomes: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges the family planning services programs \n     operating under title X of the Public Health Service Act as a \n     critical component of the United States public health care \n     system, providing high-quality family planning services and \n     other preventive health care to low-income or uninsured \n     individuals who may otherwise lack access to health care;\n       (2) recognizes family planning providers at Title X health \n     centers who work tirelessly to provide quality care to \n     millions of low-income women and men in the United States; \n     and\n       (3) supports the mission of the family planning services \n     programs operating under title X which provide men and women \n     the opportunity to maintain their reproductive health which \n     contributes to the health, social, and economic well-being of \n     families in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/24/senate-section/article/S5448-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4394.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Each year, many people in the United States are injured \n     by defective products manufactured or produced by foreign \n     entities and imported into the United States.\n       (2) Both consumers and businesses in the United States have \n     been harmed by injuries to people in the United States caused \n     by defective products manufactured or produced by foreign \n     entities.\n       (3) People in the United States injured by defective \n     products manufactured or produced by foreign entities often \n     have difficulty recovering damages from the foreign \n     manufacturers and producers responsible for such injuries.\n       (4) The difficulty described in paragraph (3) is caused by \n     the obstacles in bringing a foreign manufacturer or producer \n     into a United States court and subsequently enforcing a \n     judgment against that manufacturer or producer.\n       (5) Obstacles to holding a responsible foreign manufacturer \n     or producer liable for an injury to a person in the United \n     States undermine the purpose of the tort laws of the United \n     States.\n       (6) The difficulty of applying the tort laws of the United \n     States to foreign manufacturers and producers puts United \n     States manufacturers and producers at a competitive \n     disadvantage because United States manufacturers and \n     producers must--\n       (A) abide by common law and statutory safety standards; and\n       (B) invest substantial resources to ensure that they do so.\n       (7) Foreign manufacturers and producers can avoid the \n     expenses necessary to make their products safe if they know \n     that they will not be held liable for violations of United \n     States product safety laws.\n       (8) Businesses in the United States undertake numerous \n     commercial relationships with foreign manufacturers, exposing \n     the businesses to additional tort liability when foreign \n     manufacturers or producers evade United States courts.\n       (9) Businesses in the United States engaged in commercial \n     relationships with foreign manufacturers or producers often \n     cannot vindicate their contractual rights if such \n     manufacturers or producers seek to avoid responsibility in \n     United States courts.\n       (10) One of the major obstacles facing businesses and \n     individuals in the United States who are injured and who seek \n     compensation for economic or personal injuries caused by \n     foreign manufacturers and producers is the challenge of \n     serving process on such manufacturers and producers.\n       (11) An individual or business injured in the United States \n     by a foreign company must rely on a foreign government to \n     serve process when that company is located in a country that \n     is a signatory to the Convention on the Service Abroad of \n     Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial \n     Matters done at The Hague November 15, 1965 (20 UST 361; TIAS \n     6638).\n       (12) An injured person in the United States must rely on \n     the cumbersome system of letters rogatory to effect service \n     in a country that did not sign the Convention on the Service \n     Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or \n     Commercial Matters. These countries do not have an \n     enforceable obligation to serve process as requested.\n       (13) The procedures described in paragraphs (11) and (12) \n     add time and expense to litigation in the United States, \n     thereby discouraging or frustrating meritorious lawsuits \n     brought by persons injured in the United States against \n     foreign manufacturers and producers.\n       (14) Foreign manufacturers and producers often seek to \n     avoid judicial consideration of their actions by asserting \n     that United States courts lack personal jurisdiction over \n     them.\n       (15) The due process clauses of the fifth amendment to and \n     section 1 of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution \n     govern United States courts' personal jurisdiction over \n     defendants.\n       (16) The due process clauses described in paragraph (15) \n     are satisfied when a defendant consents to the jurisdiction \n     of a court.\n       (17) United States markets present many opportunities for \n     foreign manufacturers.\n       (18) In choosing to export products to the United States, a \n     foreign manufacturer or producer subjects itself to the laws \n     of the United States. Such a foreign manufacturer or producer \n     thereby acknowledges that it is subject to the personal \n     jurisdiction of the State and Federal courts in at least one \n     State.\n\n     SEC. 1002. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) foreign manufacturers and producers whose products are \n     sold in the United States should not be able to avoid \n     liability simply because of difficulties relating to serving \n     process upon them;\n       (2) to avoid such lack of accountability, foreign \n     manufacturers and producers of foreign products distributed \n     in the United States should be required, by regulation, to \n     register an agent in the United States who is authorized to \n     accept service of process for such manufacturer or producer;\n       (3) it is unfair to United States consumers and businesses \n     that foreign manufacturers and producers often seek to avoid \n     judicial consideration of their actions by asserting that \n     United States courts lack personal jurisdiction over them;\n       (4) those who benefit from exporting products to United \n     States markets should expect to be subject to the \n     jurisdiction of at least one court within the United States;\n       (5) exporting products to the United States should be \n     understood as consent to the accountability that the legal \n     system of the United States ensures for all manufacturers and \n     producers, foreign, and domestic;\n       (6) exporters recognize the scope of opportunities \n     presented to them by United States markets but also should \n     recognize that products imported into the United States must \n     satisfy Federal and State safety standards established by \n     statute, regulation, and common law;\n       (7) foreign manufacturers should recognize that they are \n     responsible for the contracts they enter into with United \n     States companies;\n       (8) foreign manufacturers should act responsibly and \n     recognize that they operate within the constraints of the \n     United States legal system when they export products to the \n     United States;\n       (9) United States laws and the laws of United States \n     trading partners should not put burdens on foreign \n     manufacturers and producers that do not apply to domestic \n     companies;\n       (10) it is fair to ensure that foreign manufacturers, whose \n     products are distributed in\n\n[[Page S5449]]\n\n     commerce in the United States, are subject to the \n     jurisdiction of State and Federal courts in at least one \n     State because all United States manufacturers are subject to \n     the jurisdiction of the State and Federal courts in at least \n     one State; and\n       (11) it should be understood that, by registering an agent \n     for service of process in the United States, the foreign \n     manufacturer or producer acknowledges consent to the \n     jurisdiction of the State in which the registered agent is \n     located.\n\n     SEC. 1003.
