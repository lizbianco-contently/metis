We have the omnibus or the continuing resolution we have \nto deal with in the near future because, as I have indicated, the \nfunding expires at midnight on Saturday.\n  The DREAM Act is something we need to work on. It is an extremely \nimportant piece of legislation allowing young men and women to join the \nmilitary. If they serve 2 years in the military, they would be eligible \nto get their green cards. It also allows them to continue their \neducation. It is an extremely important piece of legislation.\n  We have the 9/11 health matter; we need to reconsider that. We hope \nwe can move forward on that matter. There are thousands of people who \nare desperately ill who need to be helped as a result of the terrorist \nattack that took place on 9/11.\n  Yesterday the House passed don't ask, don't tell, and we are going to \nhave to deal with that in some way.\n  We have nominations, including that of Jim Cole, the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral, we have been trying for several months now to get cleared--\nthat second ranking person in the entire Justice Department. It seems \nto me we are having trouble getting even a vote on this individual. So \nthat is going to have to be resolved before we leave.

The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                         Omnibus Appropriations\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want the American people to see \nsomething. This is the bill the majority would have us pass, this \nOmnibus appropriations bill. It is 2,000 pages long. I think the \nAmerican people should think back to this time a year ago--last \nDecember--when the Democrats did the very same thing. At that point, it \nwas a 2,700-page health care bill because, frankly, they didn't want us \nto see what was in it. Only afterwards did we find out about the \n``Cornhusker kickback,'' the ``Louisiana purchase,'' and all the rest.\n  This is eerily familiar to anyone who remembers the health care \ndebate. We even have snow in the forecast, which is reminiscent of last \nyear. Last year we voted on health care in a blizzard--the 2,700-page \nhealth care bill in the middle of a blizzard.\n  This bill is so enormous it took the Government Printing Office 2 \ndays to print it. It spends more than $\\1/2\\ billion a page. Let's take \na look at it again.\n  Here is the bill. It spends--right at 2,000 pages in this bill--it \nspends $\\1/2\\ billion a page. It has more than $\\1/2\\ billion in it for \nthe Democratic health care bill we passed last year, the 2,700-page \nbill that looked pretty much like this. It has $\\1/2\\ billion in it for \nthat health care bill we passed last year.\n  An ever-growing number of Americans looking at that health care bill \nwould like for us to repeal it, not fund it. This is exactly the kind \nof thing the American people voted against last November--just this \nkind of thing. We had a referendum on November 2 on how the American \npeople felt about what we have been doing for the last 2 years, \nand right at the top of the list was the 2,700-page health care bill.\n\n  Frankly, it is just unbelievable. Just a few weeks after the voters \ntold us they don't want us rushing major pieces of complicated, costly, \nfar-reaching legislation through Congress, we get this 2,000-page bill. \nThey want to ram this gigantic, trillion-dollar bill through Congress, \nand they are using, once again, the Christmas break as an inducement to \nvote for it.\n  Look, we all know this is not the way to legislate. Americans expect \nmore from Congress and they demanded more on election day. That is why \ntoday I am introducing this clean, one-page continuing resolution that \nwould operate the government through February 18. So we have a choice. \nWe can pass this 2,000-page bill spending $\\1/2\\ billion a page, or we \ncan do this one-page, clean continuing resolution through February 18 \nof next year. That is the choice we have.\n  Once the new Congress is sworn in, we will have a chance to pass a \nless expensive bill, free of this kind of wasteful spending. Until \nthen, we need to take a step back and respect the will of the voters.\n  I think the message was pretty clear last November. One pundit \nreferred to it as a restraining order. In other words: Quit doing what \nyou have been doing. Here we are 1 month after the election attempting \nto pass this 2,000-page bill when we could pass a one-pager that would \nsimply continue the government through February 18.\n  So we are going to have an opportunity to do this. I hope it makes \nsense on a bipartisan basis, this one-page continuing resolution until \nFebruary 18, as an alternative to this 2,000-page monstrosity that \nspends $\\1/2\\ billion a page. I don't think there is any question it is \nthe right thing to do, and I hope my colleagues decide in the end that \nis the direction we ought to take. I am going to introduce this, and I \njust wanted to highlight it for my colleagues.\n\n\n                     Tributes to Retiring Senators\n\n                              Jim Bunning\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I know there are others on the Senate \nfloor seeking to speak, but I wish to bid farewell to one of our \ncolleagues. Few people can say they have had the same range of \nexperience and successes in life as Senator Jim Bunning. In fact, there \nisn't even another Major Leaguer who can say he struck out Ted Williams \nthree times in one game. Jim accomplished that notable feat in just his \nsecond year in the majors.\n  Thirty-nine years after that, he had become the only member of the \nBaseball Hall of Fame to serve in Congress. For the past 12 years, I \nhave been honored to work alongside this remarkable American in the \nSenate. We followed different paths in life, but we sure have deep love \nfor Kentucky and its people. It has been my honor over the years to \nwork closely with Jim to advance our common goals.\n  So today I wish to say a few words about my good friend as we honor \nhis remarkable life and his remarkable service.\n  Jim was born and raised in Southgate, KY, and it wouldn't surprise \nanybody to learn he excelled in school and in sports growing up. He \nplayed baseball as a teenager at St. Xavier High School in Cincinnati, \nbut it was for his skills as a basketball player that would earn him an \nathletic scholarship to Xavier University.\n  Baseball interrupted his college education, but at his father's \ninsistence,\n\n[[Page S10313]]\n\nJim would return to Xavier and earn a degree in economics that would \nserve him well in Congress over the years. He entered the majors in \n1955, and over the course of a storied 17-year career he would play for \nthe Detroit Tigers, the Philadelphia Phillies, the Pittsburgh Pirates, \nand the Los Angeles Dodgers. Jim is a pretty imposing force at \ncommittee hearings--just ask Chairman Bernanke--but he was a dominating \npresence on the mound long before that.\n  At 6 feet 4 inches, he was a hard-throwing sidearmer who would tumble \noff the mound with every pitch he threw. By the end of his career, Jim \ncould boast he was the first Major League pitcher to win 100 games, \nrack up 1,000 strikeouts, and throw no-hitters in both leagues. He \nfinished with an impressive 224 wins, 184 losses, 2,855 strikeouts, and \na 3.27 ERA--the career stats that would earn him a spot in the Baseball \nHall of Fame.\n  Jim's two greatest pitching achievements were his no-hitter in 1958 \nand the perfect game he threw on Father's Day, 1964, a feat that has \nonly been accomplished 20 times in baseball history. Another little \nknown feat was Jimmy's so-called ``immaculate inning'' in 1959 when he \nstruck out three Red Sox on nine pitches, a feat that has only been \nachieved 43 other times in baseball history.\n  Around here we joke that Jim likes to throw the high hard ones, but \nhe developed the skill early. Over a 4-year period with the Phillies, \nJim hit more opposing batters with pitches than any other pitcher in \nthe league. In fact, over a 17-year career, he plunked 160 batters or \nnearly 10 batters a year, making him the 13th most dangerous pitcher of \nall time, ahead of such other well-known head hunters as Roger Clemens, \nNolan Ryan, and Don Drysdale.\n  Jim has never been afraid of a little chin music, and he brought that \nsame competitive mentality to his life in public service. After \nbaseball, public service seemed like a logical choice. It was Jimmy's \nturn to give back, and give back is exactly what he did.\n  When Jim walks out of this Chamber for the last time at the end of \nthis session, he will be able to say with justifiable pride that he has \ngiven 33 years of his life to public service and to Kentucky.\n  Over those three decades, Jim has served in all levels of \ngovernment--from the Fort Thomas City Council to the Kentucky State \nSenate, to both Chambers in this building--12 years in the House and 12 \nin the Senate. He has dedicated his life to serving the people of \nKentucky, and Kentuckians are grateful for his service.\n  In the House, he made a name for himself, among other things, by \nworking tirelessly to strengthen and protect Social Security as \nchairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security.\n  And then, in 1998, he decided to make a run at the U.S. Senate seat \nwhich at the time was held by Wendell Ford. It turned out to be a \npretty close election, but once he arrived in the Senate, Jim set out \nto become one of the hardest-working and most influential Members of \nthis Chamber.\n  He has been a staunch social and fiscal conservative, and a budget \nhawk who for years has sounded the alarm on the kind of concerns about \nspending and debt that drove so many Americans to the polls this month. \nJim spoke for many Americans when he said in a recent statement that, \nbeing a grandfather to many he worries that future generations will be \nsaddled by the poor decisions that are being made today. ``For the \nfirst time in my life,'' he said, ``I question if my grandchildren will \nhave the same opportunities that I\nhad . . .''\n  One particular issue that has been close to Jim's heart is the issue \nof adoption. In 2001, Jim introduced legislation to make adopting more \naffordable to American families. And in 2007, he introduced legislation \nto make those tax incentives permanent.\n  And, of course, if there was ever a controversial issue regarding the \nnational pastime on Capitol Hill, Jim was right at the forefront, \nincluding the 2005 hearings related to steroid use in baseball. In one \nmemorable exchange from that hearing, Jim offered the following \ntestimony, from his own experience as a player: ``Mr. Chairman,'' he \nsaid, ``maybe I'm old-fashioned,'' [but] I remember players didn't get \nbetter as they got older. We all got worse. When I played with Hank \nAaron and Willie Mays and Ted Williams, they didn't put on 40 pounds to \nbulk up in their careers and they didn't hit more homers in their late \n30's than they did in their late 20's.'' It was just this kind of \nstraightforward, commonsense approach to the issues that has won Jim a \nlegion of admirers not only on the baseball diamond, but off of it. And \non this issue in particular, Jim's passion and personal perspective \nhelped shed light not only on the dangers of steroid use at the \nprofessional level, but on the growing steroid epidemic among young \nathletes at all levels.\n  Despite his high profile, Jim never forgot about the issues that \nmattered most to his constituents back home. He's been a staunch \nsupporter of clean coal technologies as an effective, efficient way to \nuse coal, improve our environment, and bring jobs to Kentucky. Another \nissue that was extremely important to all Kentuckians was the failed \nclean up of radioactive contamination that was found in the drinking \nwater wells of residences near the Department of Energy's uranium \nenrichment plant in Paducah, KY, in 1988. In 2004, Jim harshly \ncriticized the DOE's cleanup efforts, as well as called several \nhearings on Capitol Hill to draw attention to DOE's failure to \ncompensate many workers that had been stricken with radiation-related \ndiseases.\n  In every issue he has taken on, whether national, statewide or local, \nJim has been a man of principle from start to finish. He has stayed \ntrue to himself. And in a truly remarkable life, he has got a lot to be \nproud of. But if you were to ask Jim to list his greatest achievement, \nI don't think he would say it was his election to the U.S. Senate or \nhis induction to the Hall of Fame. They would both come in a distant \nsecond and third to the day he married his high school sweetheart, \nMary. Jim and Mary still live in the northern Kentucky town where he \ngrew up. They have been married for nearly 60 years. Together, they \nhave raised nine children. And they enjoy nothing more than spending \ntime with the next generation of Bunnings--which last time I checked \nincluded 35 grandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren. Jim will tell you \nthere's no secret to his success. He is happy to give all the credit to \nMary. As he put it in his Hall of Fame induction speech, she is his \n``rock.''\n  Today, we honor and pay tribute to our friend and colleague for more \nthan three decades of public service. Jim will be remembered for his \ntwo Hall of Fame-worthy careers, for his example of principled \nleadership, and for his devotion to God, country, and family. On behalf \nof myself and the entire Senate family, Jim, we thank you for your \nservice, and we wish you the best in the next chapter of your life.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I join Senator McConnell in a tribute to my \nfriend and colleague, Jim Bunning. Jim and I came into the House of \nRepresentatives at the same time as parts of the 100th class. I have \nenjoyed being with him as well in the Senate. Jim and Mary are counted \nas among the best friends my wife Carol and I have. I agree with \nSenator McConnell that while people may disagree with Jim Bunning, no \none has ever doubted his courage, his sincerity, his love for this \ncountry, his desire to do what is right, and his commitment to all \nthose efforts. So I will greatly miss Jim when he is no longer part of \nthe Senate. I think it is probably time for Jim and Mary to have a \nlittle bit of time to spend with all those children, grandchildren, and \ngreat-grandchildren. Obviously, we all wish them both well.\n\n\n                         omnibus appropriations\n\n  Madam President, I will speak for a few moments about the matter \nSenator McConnell brought to our attention; namely, this almost 2,000-\npage Omnibus appropriations bill. I know the majority leader has turned \nto the START treaty, and I think it is fairly obvious why. The American \npeople are focused like a laser beam on this spending bill. I can't \nturn on the TV without hearing comments by both the commentators as \nwell as people in public life about what this spending bill will do for \nthis country's future.\n\n[[Page S10314]]\n\n  I think it is time we devote some attention to this spending bill, \nrather than put it under the table and talk about the START treaty \ninstead, which, after all, we could accomplish at any time.\n  As the majority leader said, spending for the U.S. Government runs \nout at midnight Saturday night. I can hear the cries at that time: We \nhave an emergency on our hands. You don't want to shut down the Federal \nGovernment, do you? We have to do something.\n  Well, the something is apparently this 2,000-page, over $1 trillion \nbill, which will not have had adequate time for debate or exposure to \nthe American people. Apparently, under the schedule, as it now is, it \nwould not even entitle us to try to amend it. Think about that for a \nmoment. That which is most important to the American people and the \nsubject of the message conveyed in this last election--to stop the \nwasteful Washington spending--we are not even going to be able to amend \nthe $1 trillion-plus bill that has been laid before us.\n  I know--and I think most people in this body know--how important \ninternational relations and treaties are, including the START treaty. \nBut I also agree with the colorful comment by James Carville, a former \nadviser to President Clinton, who has a way with words. He said the \nAmerican people don't give a pig's patooty about the START treaty.\n  Obviously, those of us in the Senate do. We understand its \nimportance. But at this moment, the most important thing on the minds \nof the American people is how we are going to fund the Federal \nGovernment without continuing to waste billions of dollars of their \nmoney. That is what we ought to be focusing on in the last few hours we \nhave.\n  Let me address a little bit about what we have found so far is in \nthis bill and why so many of us are so concerned about it. The first \npoint I will make is, I don't think ever in the history of the modern \nCongress that Congress has failed or the Senate has failed to pass a \nsingle appropriations bill. The American people should understand that, \nordinarily, Congress passes a budget and we each--both bodies--pass \nabout 12, sometimes 13 bills, to fund the different agencies and \ndepartments and functions of the U.S. Government. We didn't do that \nthis year. We didn't pass a single one. We didn't pass a budget. So now \nthe emergency that occurs, because we will run out of funding on \nSaturday, obviously, is laid at the feet of the majority, which didn't \ndo its work earlier in the year, and that forces us into the position \nof having to act in this emergency way.\n  As the Republican leader said, ironically, this is at the same time \nwe were considering the health care legislation last year, the week \nbefore Christmas, in a situation in which Members have very little time \nand ability to change the legislation that is before us, a bill that \nwill cost more than $1 trillion. Very few Members will have time to \nanalyze it, let alone read it.\n  Funding of the government, of course, is one of the most important \nresponsibilities that we as Senators have. But as I said, this bill is \ngoing to get short shrift on the floor because it appears we will not \neven have an opportunity to amend it, if the majority leader's schedule \nholds.\n  Let's talk about some of the specifics in it. As I said, it costs \nmore than $1 trillion. There is nearly $18 billion more spending in \nthis legislation than in the temporary continuing resolution that was \nenacted last September. In other words, at that time, we understood we \nneeded to begin the process of funding the government, even though not \na single appropriations bill had been passed. So we passed legislation \nthat, over a 12-month period, was $18 billion less than the bill that \ncomes before us now. I don't think this is responsible, and I think \nmost Americans who have had to trim their budgets would agree it is not \nresponsible.\n  The bill contains more than 6,700 earmarks. Think about that for a \nmoment. There are only 535 Members of Congress. Most of us don't have \nearmarks in this bill. So at 6,700 earmarks, you are talking about some \nlegislators in the House and Senate having numerous earmarks. The total \nis $8 billion worth of earmarks. There is a debate about whether \nearmarks are good or bad, and some who believe they are OK say it is \nnot that much money. But $8 billion is a lot of money no matter who is \ndoing the counting--even in the Federal Government. It includes \nthings--and I don't like to make fun of these things because they all \nhave some purpose--like $247,000 for virus-free wine grapes in \nWashington. I am sure it is important to have virus-free wine grapes, \nbut the last time I checked, the people who grow grapes are doing \nfairly well financially and could probably afford, if all the wine \ngrowers pool their resources, to come up with $200,000 to try to make \nsure their grapes are free of virus.\n  There is a $100,000 appropriation for the Edgar Allan Poe Visitor \nCenter in New York. Edgar Allan Poe is certainly an iconic American \nliterary figure, but for the Federal Government--I mean the taxpayers \nin Arizona probably don't appreciate the need to pony up money for the \nEdgar Allan Poe Visitor Center in New York.\n  The omnibus bill contains upward of a $1 billion increase in spending \nfor the vastly unpopular health care bill Americans said they didn't \nwant and continue to strongly oppose. Here are a couple of the details \non that. There is an allocation of $750 million for the Prevention and \nPublic Health Fund slush fund for a variety of programs--not named; a \n$175.9 million adjustment in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices program management account to implement the massive Medicaid \nexpansion, as well as cuts to Medicare Advantage--something my \nconstituents strongly objected to; an $80.7 million adjustment for HHS \nprogram management, on and on.\n  There are millions included for implementation of the very \ncontroversial Dodd-Frank financial reform bill, including a Securities \nand Exchange Commission funding increase of $189 million. That is 17 \npercent more than last year; a Commodity Futures Trading Commission \nfunding increase of $117.2 million or a 69-percent increase over last \nyear's funding; Treasury gets increase of $32.35 million or a 10-\npercent increase. It goes on and on.\n  The omnibus also contains $790 million for an increase in education \nstimulus programs. A thorough examination of those programs reveals \nthat, at least in some cases, they advance the cause of the teachers \nunions--at least in my view--more than the cause of educating American \nchildren.\n  Some claim that at least you can say this bill's top line--its gross \namount of spending is consistent with the budget proposal advocated by \nSenators Sessions, McCaskill, and many of the rest of us, including \nmyself. But that is not true, as it turns out. It excludes numerous \nparts, such as multiyear spending caps, enforcement mechanisms, and \nlimitations on emergency spending designations--something I will talk \nabout in a second. In addition, the majority is using a budgetary \nsleight of hand to ostensibly meet the spending caps for 2011. This is \nwhat I was going to mention. They do this by a trick of retroactively \ndeclaring spending in last year's supplemental appropriations bill for \nAgent Orange claims as an emergency. So that money is spent. It was \nlast year's funding. Now we are going to call that money emergency \nfunding. What is the effect? It doesn't count and reduces the baseline \nand, like magic, by treating it as an emergency--to the tune of almost \n$3.5 billion--they have been able to secure a lower CBO score on the \nbill and, therefore, not exceed the spending caps. Without the gimmick, \nthey obviously would have exceeded the spending caps proposed in the \nSessions-McCaskill legislation.\n  I will mention process briefly. This bill is being considered under a \ndeeply flawed process, as the Republican leader said. Voters made a \nvery clear statement, I think, last month. They do not like wasteful \nWashington spending. They want it to stop. They didn't like the health \ncare bill. They do not want us--here, a week before Christmas--to rush \nvery complex, very large bills through the Congress without time for \ntheir representatives to read them, to study them and have an \nopportunity, potentially, to amend them. But under the schedule laid \nout, as I said, an open amendment process for this bill would be \nimpossible.\n\n  At the very least, one would think Republicans should be entitled to \n1 or 2 amendments to each of the 12 appropriations bills that are \nincluded within\n\n[[Page S10315]]\n\nthis giant Omnibus appropriations package. Under regular order, each of \nthese bills would take at least several days of floor time and we would \nconsider numerous amendments. That is not going to happen with this \nbill. Instead, we will do the equivalent of more than a month's work of \nfloor time in a couple of days, with no amendments. And some wonder why \nCongress' approval rating has fallen to 13 percent. Someone said: Who \nis the 13 percent? And the answer was: Well, it is our staff and our \nfamilies. Maybe.\n  Let me conclude here with a little bit about jobs and energy prices. \nThis bill will raise energy prices in the United States and destroy \nenergy jobs through and including some of the following provisions:\n  There is a ban on shallow water drilling. I thought the whole idea--\nespecially after the gulf, where we had deepwater drilling problems--\nwas to encourage drilling in shallow waters to make up for that other \nloss of production. The bill changes the law to triple the time for the \nDepartment of the Interior to approve exploration plans for offshore \noperators from 30 to 90 days. This provision could lead to huge \nfinancial penalties to the government, breach of contracts, and add \nfurther impediments to creating jobs and energy here at home.\n  The bill reduces the State's share of Federal onshore oil and gas \nproduction revenues to 48 percent, down from the 50-50 split required \nunder current law, and it raises fees for onshore and offshore oil and \ngas production on Federal lands. These fees amount to a tax that will \nmake domestic energy production more expensive to produce, especially \nfor the small businesses that do so.\n  There is much more--much more the American people should know--but we \nare supposed to be talking about an arms control treaty with Russia \ninstead. I want to remind everyone that we are in a lameduck Congress, \nand my view is that trying to enact such a huge and complex bill within \nthe narrow postelection timeframe shows disrespect for the democratic \nprocess. For that reason and the others I have discussed, I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose cloture on this bill and to pass a sensible \ncontinuing resolution of the kind the Republican leader has introduced.\n  I want to leave no doubt about this final point. Those who are \nwatching this process carefully and who understand how the process \nworks understand that the important vote here is on cloture. It is the \nfirst vote. It is, in effect, the vote to consider this omnibus bill. \nOur constituents will not be fooled by Senators who vote ``yes'' on \ncloture to go to this bill--ensuring it will be considered under this \nrushed process without amendment--but then who vote ``no'' on final \npassage, after it is too late to stop the flawed process and say, well, \nI voted ``no'' on the bill. Well, of course, they voted ``no'' on the \nbill, but then it was too late.\n  The key vote is on the cloture vote, whenever that might occur, and I \nam told it might occur at actually 12:01 on Sunday morning--in other \nwords, one minute after midnight. Well, that would be very reminiscent \nof last year's consideration of the health care bill, where through all \nthe procedural gimmickry this body did not distinguish itself in \nadopting legislation under a process the American people saw through, \nobjected to, and continue to criticize the legislation adopted as a \nresult of the process as well as its substance.\n  If we want to do the same thing with this legislation, then it will \ndemonstrate in the very first act relating to spending after the \nelection that this Senate did not get the message sent by the American \npeople.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, are we in morning business at this \npoint?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. We are on the treaty.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for no more than 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Omnibus Appropriations\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I want to respond to what has been said \nby my friend Senator Kyl from Arizona, as well as Senator McConnell of \nKentucky, about the appropriations bill, which we are going to consider \nin a very short period of time.\n  I am a member of this Appropriations Committee. I remember what \nhappened, and I want to put it on the record right now so that some of \nthe things that have been said can be compared to what I think is the \nreality. This is the reality: The Appropriations subcommittees--each \nand every subcommittee of that full committee--met with Democrats and \nRepublicans and prepared a bill. I have the Subcommittee on Financial \nServices and General Government. Senator Susan Collins of Maine worked \nlong and hard in preparation of that bill. Other subcommittee chairs \ndid the same thing. There was full bipartisan cooperation in the \npreparation of each of these subcommittee bills--every single one of \nthem. And the appropriations bill that we will vote on is the \ncombination of all of that effort.\n  Let me also talk about the amount of money we are going to \nappropriate to continue to fund the operations of our Federal \nGovernment.\n  It is true, it is over $1 trillion. In fact, it is $1.1 trillion in \nthis bill. But what hasn't been said by Senator McConnell and Senator \nKyl is that is exactly the amount they asked for. Senator McConnell \ncame to the Senate Appropriations Committee and said Republicans will \nnot support this bill unless you bring the spending down to $1.108 \ntrillion. That is exactly what we bring to the floor to be considered.\n  So to stand back in horror and look at $1.1 trillion and say, where \ndid this figure come from, well, it came from Senator Mitch McConnell \nin a motion he made before the Senate Appropriations Committee. It \nreflects the amount that he said was the maximum we should spend in \nthis current calendar year on our appropriations bills. He prevailed. \nIt is the same number as the so-called Sessions-McCaskill figure that \nhas been debated back and forth on this floor, voted repeatedly by the \nRepublicans to be the appropriate total number. So we have a bipartisan \nagreement on the total number. Yet now the Republican leader comes to \nthe floor, stands in horror at the idea of $1.1 trillion--the very same \nnumber he asked for in this bill. You can't have it both ways.\n  Secondly, they say, well, this is a 2,000-page bill. Well, allow me \nto explain why.\n  When you take the work of 12 subcommittees, instead of separate bills \nand put them in one bill, the total number of pages is going to \nincrease. Maybe the best thing we can give as a Christmas gift to the \nSenate Republican Caucus is a speed reading course so they can sit down \nand read these bills. It turns out their fingers get smudgy and their \nlips get tired if you have more than 100 pages in a bill. Over and over \nwe are told, don't worry about the substance, just count the pages, and \nif it gets up to a thousand pages, it is clearly a bad bill. Wrong. \nThis 2,000-page bill reflects the work of 12 subcommittees and 12 \nRepublican Senators who helped to assemble and to devise the contents \nof that bill. It is no surprise that it would reach that number when we \nput all of the spending bills--the Appropriations subcommittee bills--\ninto one document.\n\n  Another point that is raised--what a surprise--we have this thing \nthrown at us. We have not seen this before. We don't have time to look \nat this.\n  This bill was posted 2 days ago, and will be available not only for \nevery Senator and every staff member but for every citizen of this \ncountry to look at in detail. The reason Members have been coming to \nthe floor talking about its contents is they have access to it, and \nhave had for almost 48 hours, and will for an even longer period of \ntime before it is finally considered.\n  I also want to say that the schedule we are facing here now, which is \nputting us up against some deadlines--deadlines for the funding of \ngovernment, a lot of personal family deadlines, which trouble all of \nus, but we accepted this job and its responsibility--many of these \ndeadlines have come to be because of an exercise of the Senate rules. \nTime and time and time again the Republican minority has forced us to \ngo into a cloture vote, into a filibuster--record-breaking numbers of \nfilibusters over the last several years.\n  If Members of the Senate were to go back home and ask the cable TV \nviewers who watch C-SPAN what their impression of the Senate is, their \nimpression is an empty Chamber--an empty\n\n[[Page S10316]]\n\nChamber because day after weary day we have had to put up with cloture \nvotes and filibusters from the Republican side, delaying us time and \ntime and time again while we burned off the hours on the clock instead \nof rolling up our sleeves and actually getting down to business.\n  Now they come and tell us, well, we are going to threaten to start \nreading bills. They have a right to do that under the rules. It is \nreally not needed, since all these bills have been posted and any \nSenator who wanted to read them has now had 48 hours to read this \nappropriations bill, if they wanted to. But they may burn off hours on \nthe clock again and then complain we are ruining Christmas for Members \nof the Senate and their families. Well, unfortunately, their hands are \nnot clean.\n  When it comes to the things included in this bill, incidentally, I \nhave heard many Republican Senators come down here and talk about \nspecific elements in this Appropriations bill they disagree with, and \nthat is their right. But many of the same Senators who are criticizing \ncongressionally directed spending, or earmarks, have earmarks in the \nbill. That is the height of hypocrisy--to stand up and request an \nearmark, have it included in the bill, and then fold your arms and \npiously announce, I am against earmarks. You ought to be consistent \nenough to know if you are asking for an earmark one day and criticizing \nit the next, your credibility is going to be challenged. That is a \nfact.\n  As far as some of the things that have been talked about, one of them \nbrought up by Senator Kyl relates to drilling, and how quickly drilling \npermits will be issued by the Federal Government.\n  Our Department of Interior has asked for 90 days to review \napplications for drilling permits included in the bill. Why would we \nwant to be careful when it comes to drilling permits? America knows \nwhy. We saw what happened in the Gulf of Mexico. We saw the damage \ndone. And we know for many businesses and many families and many \npeople, and for a very fragile environment, things will never be the \nsame. Let us avoid that from happening in the future. Waiting 90 days \ninstead of 30 days is hardly an onerous burden to make sure that what \nis done is done properly and done in a way that won't come back to \nhaunt us.\n  Finally, to argue this is disrespectful of the democratic process is \nto ignore the obvious. Time and time and time again, when we have tried \nto move the democratic process, we have run into a roadblock with \nfilibusters from the other side of the aisle--obstructionism.\n  I am glad we passed the tax bill yesterday. It was an amazing day. I \nthink the final vote was 81 to 18, which was an incredibly strong \nbipartisan showing. Let's end this session on a bipartisan note. Let's \nget away from lobbing bombs back and forth across the aisle. Let us \nroll up our sleeves and get down to what we need to do.\n  Senator Kyl should come to the floor and offer his amendment on the \nSTART treaty. He has talked about needing time to offer amendments. \nLet's do it, and let's do it this morning. Let's start the amendment \nprocess, let's have votes, let's not filibuster anything. Let's get to \nthe vote, vote on the substance, and let's bring it to an end. Then let \nus bring up the Omnibus appropriations bill and the CR, let the Senate \nwork its will, and let's vote on it.\n  We have two or three other items we can complete, and if people don't \nexercise delay tactics, we can get this done in a few days. I urge my \ncolleagues, in the spirit of what we did with the President's tax \npackage, let's return to a more bipartisan approach to completing our \nbusiness and going home to our families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. What is the business before the Senate?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The START treaty.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair. I wish to work with my colleague, the \nchairman of our committee, to make time available to Senators. I see \nthe distinguished Senator on the floor.\n  Are you prepared, sir, to make a statement?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, yes, I am.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I rise today to express my views on \nthe new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, also known as New START. This \ntreaty is an extremely important and serious matter. New START \nsignificantly impacts America's national security and nuclear \ndeterrent. As a result, I believe this treaty deserves adequate time in \nthe Senate--time to examine the issues, time to debate the many flawed \nprovisions, and time to vote on all of the amendments offered for \nconsideration.\n  The majority leader should not be piecemealing together segments of \ntime for debate on an issue as important as nuclear arms control. The \ntreaty should not be shortchanged and rushed through the Senate. The \ntreaty should not be jammed together with consideration of a 1,924-page \nomnibus Federal spending bill. The treaty should not be considered \nduring a lameduck session.\n\n  Consideration of the treaty will require a substantial amount of time \nin order to sufficiently address its many flaws. Like many of my \ncolleagues, I plan on offering amendments, amendments designed to \nprotect our national security. This debate concerns the national \nsecurity of the United States. It is critical that the United States \nmaintains a strong nuclear deterrent in order to defend our Nation and \nprovide assurances to our allies. I have major concerns about the \nimpact the New START will have on Wyoming and on national security.\n  While I have many issues with the New START, I want to address only a \nfew of my major concerns this morning. First, START straitjackets the \nU.S. missile defense capabilities. Second, START offers no method to \nmake sure a historically noncompliant Russia state will keep its \npromises. Third, the approach embodied by START is representative of an \noutdated and simplistic view of the U.S. position on the world stage.\n  To begin, I wish to specifically discuss the limitations placed on \nthe U.S. missile defense by the New START. The treaty signed by \nPresident Obama and Russian President Medvedev on April 8, 2010, places \nexplicit limitations on U.S. missile defense. The preamble of the \ntreaty--the preamble declares an interrelationship between strategic \nnuclear offensive weapons and strategic nuclear defensive weapons. It \nimplies the right of Russia to withdraw from the treaty based on U.S. \nmissile defenses that are beyond ``current strategic'' capabilities. \nThe treaty preamble, the very preamble of the treaty, gives Russia an \nopportunity to turn their backs on the treaty at the slightest sign of \na shift in American defensive strategy. This language is unacceptable \nand needs to be removed.\n  I offered an amendment in the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations \nto strike this language. The White House resists any attempt to amend \nthe preamble. The administration argues it is a nonbinding concession \nto Russia. Russia clearly doesn't see it that same way. They have made \nit quite clear they consider the preamble legally binding. A Russian \nForeign Minister stated the treaty contained ``legally binding linkage \nbetween strategic offensive and strategic defensive weapons.'' The \nRussians have wanted this language for a long time in order to have \ngrounds to claim that the U.S. missile defense program violates an \ninternational agreement. This type of constraining language is not \nunique to the preamble.\n  The treaty also places a legally binding limitation on missile \ndefense in article V of the treaty. Article V prohibits the \ntransforming of offensive strategic missile launchers into defensive \nstrategic missile launchers. As this Nation continues to face threats \nfrom around the world, we should not take any action that will hinder \nour missile defense options. We need to be able to defend ourselves.\n  Just like the preamble, the administration makes excuses as to why \nthey have made concessions to the Russians on our missile defense. The \ncurrent administration claims that they have no plans to use the \nmissile defense options\n\n[[Page S10317]]\n\nprohibited under the new START treaty. I believe that placing any \nconstraints on future U.S. defense capabilities should not even be up \nfor debate, let alone placed in a treaty on strategic offensive nuclear \nweapons.\n  The purpose of New START was to reduce strategic nuclear weapons \nbetween the United States and Russia, not limit the ability of the \nUnited States to defend ourselves. It is outrageous that the \nadministration would make any concessions to Russia on our national \nsecurity.\n  The United States must always remain in charge of our own missile \ndefense--not Russia, not any other country. We should not be tying our \nhands behind our backs and risking the security of our Nation and our \nallies. Russia is trying to force the United States to choose between \nmissile defense and the treaty. The clear choice should always be to \nprotect the ability of the United States to defend ourselves. I believe \nthe administration's decision was a serious mistake.\n  I also have major concerns about the central limits of New START. \nThis treaty is a one-sided agreement aimed at only reducing U.S. \nstrategic nuclear weapons. Russia is currently below the limit for \nstrategic nuclear delivery vehicles under the New START treaty. As a \nresult, Russia will not have to make reductions. The United States will \nbe the only party required to slash its forces.\n  Due to loopholes in the treaty counting rules, Russia could deploy \nmore than 1,550 warheads, go above that ceiling and still be in \ncompliance with the treaty. Russia may even be able to deploy more than \n2,100 warheads under the treaty. Each deployed heavy bomber, regardless \nof the actual number of warheads on it, only counts as one deployed \nstrategic warhead. If anything, the limits just tell Russia how many \nweapons they are allowed to add to their strategic nuclear force. Why \nwould the administration enter into a bilateral treaty that only \nrequires the United States to make sacrifices? This is not acceptable.\n  New START offers us nothing in return, not even a robust verification \nmechanism that enables us to make sure Russia is keeping its promises. \nPresident Ronald Reagan regularly repeated the phrase ``trust, but \nverify.'' He did it repeatedly regarding nuclear weapons. The \nverification measures play an important role in analyzing the New \nSTART. The New START has a weak verification regime.\n  Former Secretary of State James Baker made the exact point by \nindicating the New START verification procedure provisions, he said, \nwere weaker than the original New START. Under New START, the U.S. \nwould be limited to 18 inspections per year as opposed to 28 in the \npast. Under the original START treaty the United States conducted \napproximately 600 inspections. Under New START the United States is \nlimited to a maximum of 180 inspections. This further plays into \nRussia's favor due to there being 35 Russian facilities compared to \nonly 17 U.S. facilities to inspect.\n  The administration also dropped two key provisions from New START. \nThe United States will no longer have continuous monitoring at the \nRussian nuclear missile assembly plant. We had it in START I. Why are \nwe giving up this important verification component in New START? The \nUnited States also will not have full access to Russian nuclear \nballistic missile launch telemetry under New START. Under START I we \nhad unrestricted access. Why are we giving that up?\n  The treaty does not provide us with the verification mechanisms that \nenable us to make sure Russia is keeping its promises. Instead, there \nis a lot of trust and precious little verification.\n  A weaker verification system is even more dangerous due to Russia's \nlong history of noncompliance on arms control treaties. Russia has a \nrecord of noncompliance and violations under the original START treaty. \nUp until the end of the original START treaty in December of 2009, \nRussia was continuing to engage in compliance violations. The \nDepartment of State compliance reports from 2010 spell out the numerous \nviolations made by the Russians.\n  Finally, the treaty relies on the false premise that Russia is \nAmerica's only nuclear rival. This view of the world is outdated and \nsimplistic. Even if we could trust Russia there are numerous other \nthreats such as North Korea and Iran which have repeatedly shown \nhostility to the United States and to our allies. We should never \nabandon our defenses and sacrifice our deterrent in the face of \nincreasing international belligerence. It is the equivalent of asking \nAmerica to stare down the barrel of a gun without knowing whether the \ngun is loaded, and then to trust the person holding it not to pull the \ntrigger.\n  In arguing for this treaty the administration has tried to have it \nboth ways. The treaty demands the United States reduce our nuclear \nstrike force by specific numbers. Yet the administration has only \noffered a vague range of estimates regarding where these cuts would \ntake place. The President's force structure plan provides up to 420 \nintercontinental ballistic missiles, 14 submarines carrying up to 240 \nsubmarine-launched ballistic missiles, and up to 60 nuclear-capable \nlevee bombers.\n  Even if the administration did cut the absolute maximum number of \nweapons it has proposed to cut, it would still fail to live up to the \nreductions demanded by New START. Instead of giving the Senate a \nspecific force structure, the President is repeating his health care \nplaybook and telling us to wait until after the United States ratifies \nthe treaty to find out the details.\n  It is wrong that the Senate is considering approving this treaty \nwithout knowing these details, and these details matter.\n  The force structure of our nuclear triad is critical to maintaining \nan effective deterrent. The nuclear triad of the United States spans \nsea, air, and land. By working together, our nuclear triad complicates \nand deters any attempt at a successful first strike by anyone on our \ncountry. I believe the President's force structure proposal will weaken \nour nuclear triad.\n  The American people deserve a full debate on the Senate floor on a \ntreaty of this magnitude. It is my hope that the Senate will take its \nconstitutional responsibility very seriously and provide the New START \nwith the scrutiny it deserves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I understand the distinguished Senator on \nthe floor wishes to speak. I yield for Senator Udall.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, let me start by thanking my \ngood friend from Indiana, not only for yielding the floor to me but for \nhis strong leadership on this crucial treaty before us here in the \nSenate.\n  I rise in strong support of the New START treaty. I want to start by \nreminding my colleagues that arms control treaties are an integral part \nof this country's modern history, premised on a shared belief that a \nworld with fewer nuclear weapons is a safer world. Even as the Cold War \nraged, it was Ronald Reagan who committed America to the ultimate goal \nof eliminating these weapons from the face of the Earth.\n  Those are his very words. This goal has animated numerous arms \ncontrol agreements since then and it underpins the New START treaty, an \nagreement I believe we cannot fail to ratify. The dangers of nuclear \nproliferation have grown. As the Senator from Indiana knows well, \nbecause this has been a part of his life's work, the threat of global \nnuclear war has receded but the risk of nuclear attack has increased, \nenabled by the spread of nuclear technology and the danger of materials \nfalling into the wrong hands.\n  I believe we cannot be seen as a credible leader of a nation strongly \ncommitted to meeting our nonproliferation obligations unless we pursue \nfurther nuclear arms reductions ourselves. The United States and Russia \nhave over 90 percent of the world's nuclear arms between us. Thus, we \nhave an obligation to verifiably decrease our nuclear stockpiles and \nreduce this primary threat to global and national security. That is why \nthe New START treaty matters. It establishes limits for U.S. and \nRussian nuclear weapons to levels lower than the 1991 START Treaty and \nthe 2002 Moscow treaty.\n  These limits have been validated by our defense planners and ensure \nthat we have the flexibility to meet our security needs.\n\n[[Page S10318]]\n\n  The treaty also includes a strong verification regime, which \nSecretary Gates called the ``key contribution'' of the agreement.\n  As we debate this agreement today, we should not only consider the \nconsequences of ratification but also the consequences of failure. \nBecause START expired over a year ago, we currently have no treaty and, \ntherefore no constraints on Russia's stockpile or verification of their \nweapons.\n  The choice facing U.S. Presidents through the decades has been \nwhether we are better off signing arms agreement with the Russians or \npursuing an arms race. Historically, Presidents from both parties and \nbipartisan majorities in the U.S. Senate have agreed that we are better \nserved by agreements.\n  Today is no different. As U.S. Strategic Command's General Chilton \ntestified, without a treaty, Russia is not constrained in its \ndevelopment of force structure, and we have no insight into its nuclear \nprogram, making this ``the worst of both possible worlds.''\n  Failure to ratify this treaty would make the broad ``resetting'' of \nU.S.-Russian relations harder. The distrust it would engender would \nalso reduce or even eliminate the possibility of further bilateral \nstrategic weapons reductions. As former National Security Adviser Brent \nScowcroft--I think we would all agree he is one of the wisest Americans \nabout foreign policy--testified earlier this year, ``the principal \nresult of non-ratification would be to throw the whole nuclear \nnegotiating situation into a state of chaos.''\n  But we need to remember that this treaty is not just about Washington \nand Moscow, it is also about the world community and our global \nrelationships. Failure to ratify this treaty would signal to the world \nthat America is not willing to constrain its own weapons arsenal, even \nas we ask other countries to restrict theirs or avoid joining the \n``nuclear club'' altogether.\n  It would discourage multilateral cooperation on nonproliferation \ngoals and hinder our ability to lead by example. It would make global \ncooperation on dealing with rogue states like Iran and North Korea more \nchallenging, tying our hands at a time when the threat from those two \ncountries is increasing.\n  Treaty opponents have tried to make the case that the dangers of \nratifying the agreement outweigh the advantages of ratification. They \nare simply wrong.\n  They argue that the treaty limits our ability to develop missile \ndefense capabilities. The head of the Missile Defense Agency argued, \nthat the treaty actually reduces constraints on missile defense. And \ncountless military and civilian leaders, including the former \nSecretaries of State for the last five Republican Presidents, have \npublicly stated that New START preserves our ability to deploy \neffective missile defenses.\n  Treaty opponents argue it inhibits our ability to maintain an \neffective and reliable nuclear arsenal. It is true that this \nadministration inherited an underfunded and undervalued nuclear weapons \ncomplex. But the President understands that the nuclear experts and \ninfrastructure that maintain our arsenal also help secure loose nuclear \nmaterials, verify weapons reductions and develop technologies that \nunderpin our nuclear deterrent.\n  That is why the President's budget request provides $7 billion for \nthese programs this year, a 10-percent increase over last year. New \nSTART would in no way limit these investments. And as treaty opponents \nknow well, the President has offered an even more robust investment in \nmodernization and refurbishment of our nuclear infrastructure over the \nnext 10 years, totaling $84 billion.\n  The importance of ratifying this treaty goes beyond politics. We know \nthat a lack of demonstrated bipartisan support could poison relations \nwith Russia and our allies. And we cannot risk the loss of American \nleadership in the world that would ensue if we are perceived as too \nentangled in our own internal politics to ratify a strategic arms \ntreaty that is clearly beneficial to our own security.\n  I know that some of my colleagues hope to amend this treaty and, in \nso doing, kill it, since any changes will require the administration to \nstart from scratch and reopen negotiations with the Russians. I urge \nthem to reconsider and to think about what is at stake.\n  And I urge them and all my colleagues to listen to our military \nleadership when they tell us that this treaty is essential to our \nnational security. As Senator Lugar pointed out yesterday in his \neloquent statement, ``Rejecting an unequivocal military opinion on a \ntreaty involving nuclear deterrence would be an extraordinary position \nfor the Senate to take.''\n  Let us not allow this to be the first time in history that the Senate \ndenies ratification to a treaty with overwhelming bipartisan support \nand the endorsement of the full breadth of our military and civilian \nleaders. I urge my colleagues to support this treaty and to support a \nsafer world.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator very much for \nhis comments and his support. It is my understanding that Senator \nEnsign was going to speak at this point in time. He is on his way. We \nare happy to accommodate that.\n  Let me say to colleagues that we are open for business. We are ready \nto entertain amendments people may have. We encourage colleagues to \ncome down here. Obviously, some people have raised the question of the \npress of time, but it does not seem, from both yesterday and today, \nthat anybody is actually in a rush to bring an amendment.\n  We are prepared to vote on our side of the aisle. I want to make that \nvery clear. There are 58 Democratic Senators and Senator Lugar who \nobviously are working to advance this treaty. We do not have any \namendments. We are prepared to vote. So if colleagues want to bring an \namendment, now is the time to do it, and we encourage them to do so.\n  Let me just say that I know Senator Barrasso just spoke with respect \nto missile defense. I understand the legitimate concerns that have been \nexpressed by a number of colleagues about the question of missile \ndefense. I wish to make it as clear as possible, from all of the record \nto date, that the treaty's preamble, first of all, requires nothing \nlegally whatsoever. There is no legal, binding effect of the preamble--\nnone whatsoever.\n  Secondly, Secretary Clinton said this and Secretary Henry Kissinger \nsaid this: All it is is a statement of fact about the existence of a \nrelationship. It has no restraint whatsoever on our ability to proceed \nwith missile defense.\n  Moreover, the resolution of ratification could not be more clear \nabout that. There are pages within the resolution and several different \nindividual references to the fact that the missile defense is not \naffected.\n  Let me read from it. This is from ``Understandings,'' and this is the \nmissile defense understanding No. 1:\n\n       It is the understanding of the United States--\n\n  This is what we will pass when we pass this, and I am quoting from \nit--\n\n     that the New START Treaty does not impose any limitations on \n     the deployment of missile defenses other than the \n     requirements of paragraph 3 of Article V of the New START \n     Treaty, which states, ``Each Party shall not convert and \n     shall not use ICBM launchers and SLBM launchers for placement \n     of missile defense interceptors therein. Each Party further \n     shall not convert and shall not use launchers of missile \n     defense interceptors for placement of ICBMs and SLBMs \n     therein.''\n\n  It goes on to say that any New START treaty limitations on the \ndeployment of missile defenses beyond those specifically contained--and \nI will speak to what they are in a moment--would require an amendment \nto the New START treaty. That would require an entire new process of \nratification in order to live up to the requirements of the treaty \nprocess itself.\n  Now, the specific, tiny, little limitation they are talking about in \nthere is one that the Secretary of Defense said: We don't want; that \nis, the conversion of a current ICBM silo. There are four of them that \nare grandfathered into existence here, but the military has determined \nit is more expensive to do that than to simply build a new silo for a \nground-based missile, which is what we plan to do in the event we want \nto--when we deploy.\n  So there is, in effect, zero limitation. Every single member of the \nStrategic Command and the current command has said there is no \nlimitation. Secretary Gates has said there is no limitation. And I \nbelieve we will be able to have even some further clarification of the \nabsence of any limitation.\n\n[[Page S10319]]\n\n  The fact is, if you change that preamble now, you are effectively \nkilling the treaty because it requires the President to go back to the \nRussians, renegotiate the treaty, and then you have to come back and go \nthrough months and months of hearings and resubmission and so forth.\n  The important thing to focus on is the fact that--and let me quote \nHenry Kissinger about the language Senator Barrasso has referred to. He \nsaid, ``It is a truism, it is not an obligation.''\n  Secretary Gates also emphasized the fact that it has no impact \nwhatsoever on the United States. Secretary Gates reminded us in May \nthat the Russians have always reacted adversely to our plans for \nmissile defense, so they have tried a number of times to try to \ninterrupt that.\n  Secretary Gates said in his testimony:\n\n       This treaty does not accomplish any restraint for them at \n     all.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       We have a comprehensive missile defense program, and we are \n     going forward with all of it.\n\n  In addition to that, General Chilton reported on how he informed the \nRussians in full about exactly what program we were going forward with, \nincluding the recently agreed on deployment at Lisbon for the \ndeployment of missile defense in Europe.\n  They understand exactly what we are doing, what our plans are, and, \nnotwithstanding that, they signed the treaty. So I think the comfort \nlevel of all of our military, of all of those involved with the \nlaboratories, and all of those involved with the Strategic Command \nought to speak for itself.\n  I see Senator Ensign is here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I rise today to talk about this New \nSTART treaty. I have some very serious concerns about it.\n  I appreciate the work that has been done by my colleagues. This is an \nincredibly serious issue. I do not question anybody's motives, but I do \nthink there are some serious flaws that lie not only within the four \ncorners of the treaty text but also speak to the manner in which this \nadministration has dealt with Russia. This policy of Russian ``reset'' \nhas meant that the United States is making major concessions, while our \nRussian counterparts give up virtually nothing.\n  Further, I have serious reservations about the manner in which the \nSenate is considering this treaty. This body, the Senate, is supposed \nto be the most deliberative body in the world. It is supposed to be a \nchamber that respects the rights of the minority. Senators are supposed \nto be afforded the right of unlimited debate and the right to have \ntheir amendments considered. Rushing a treaty of this magnitude through \na lameduck session is not what the Founders had in mind when they gave \nthis body the power of advice and consent in these serious matters.\n  The American people sent a clear message in November to concentrate \non jobs, taxes, and the economy.\n  While I do not think this lameduck is the time to debate this very \nimportant treaty, I do plan on offering multiple amendments to address \nthis treaty's flaws, as well as the resolution of ratification. My \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle will also offer amendments with \ntopics ranging from how this treaty restrains our missile defense \ncapabilities to ceding the Senate's advice and consent power to the \nflawed Bilateral Consultative Commission.\n  For example, there needs to be an amendment which addresses the \nverification regime in this treaty, or lack thereof. Further, it is \nastounding to me that tactical nuclear weapons were left out of the \ntreaty, considering that Russia has approximately a 10-to-1 advantage. \nAdditionally, we need to consider how the rail-mobile ICBMs are \ncounted, or not counted, and our Russian policy in a much broader \nsense.\n  As the Senate moves forward in examining the intended consequences of \nthis treaty, we also need to pay careful attention to those \nconsequences that are unintended because that is where the danger truly \nlies. In order to properly examine these, the administration needs to \nprovide the Senate with the full negotiating record which it has yet to \ndo. Only upon examination of this record can we accurately determine \nhow Russia views this accord to ensure that their understanding is the \nsame as ours.\n  On the topic of missile defense, this is clearly a case of the \nadministration wanting to have its cake and eat it too. There should be \nzero--zero--mention of missile defense within 100 miles of this treaty. \nYet there it is, right in the preamble to New START, which clearly \nrecognizes an interrelationship between offensive nuclear weapons and \nmissile defense. I believe this is unacceptable.\n  Further, if we examine article 5, paragraph 3, of New START, missile \ndefense is again referenced, plain as day, in a provision prohibiting \nthe United States from converting ICBMs or sea-based launchers for \nmissile defense purposes. Where is the wisdom in removing such an \noption from our toolkit for the whole life of the treaty? Russia must \nunderstand that we will not limit our options for national defense \nbased on current plans, ideas, or technology. Should a breakthrough \noccur in missile defense technology or launcher development we cannot \nhave already ruled out pursuing new courses of action.\n  In their attempts to persuade Republicans to support the treaty, \nproponents have attempted to invoke the name of Ronald Reagan. Let's \nremember that over two decades ago, President Reagan returned from \nIceland and made the following statement:\n\n       While both sides seek reduction in the number of nuclear \n     missiles and warheads threatening the world, the Soviet Union \n     insisted that we sign an agreement that would deny me and \n     future presidents for 10 years the right to develop, test and \n     deploy a defense against nuclear missiles for the people of \n     the free world. This we could not and would not do.\n\n  This clearly states, in his own words, where Ronald Reagan would be \non this New START treaty. Another especially troublesome facet of the \nNew START is that it would establish a Bilateral Consultative \nCommission with the authority to agree upon additional measures to \nincrease the effectiveness of the treaty. This seems like a broad and \nvague purview for a commission, and it is unclear why the Senate would \ndelegate its advice and consent responsibilities to a commission. This \nleads me to ask the question: Since missile defense has fallen under \nthe purview of this treaty, wouldn't it be logical that this commission \ncould make decisions as to what we can and cannot do with our missile \ndefense assets? We must make it clear this commission, the BCC, cannot \nhave the authority to further handicap our national defense as it could \notherwise do under this treaty without further scrutiny of the Senate.\n  I hope we agree as a body to insist that the workings of the BCC are \ncompletely visible and accessible to the Senate and that we explicitly \nmake these changes to the treaty itself, not just the resolution of \nratification.\n  As we move forward in examining this treaty, a colleague of mine will \nbe sorely missed. The senior Senator from Missouri, Kit Bond, as vice \nchairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is the foremost \nexpert in the Senate and likely in all of Congress on matters of \nintelligence. At least that is my opinion. I wish to quote my good \nfriend. The Select Committee on Intelligence has been looking at this \nissue closely over the past several months.\n\n       As the vice chairman of this committee, I have reviewed the \n     key intelligence on our ability to monitor this treaty and \n     heard from our intelligence professionals. There is no doubt \n     in my mind that the United States cannot reliably verify the \n     treaty's 1,550 limit on deployed warheads. The administration \n     claims that New START is indispensable to reap the ``Reset'' \n     benefits with Russia. If a fatally flawed arms control \n     agreement is the price of admission to the Reset game, our \n     Nation is better off if we sit this one out.\n\n  I could not agree more. It is naively optimistic to assume that a \nworld with fewer nuclear weapons is the same thing as a safer world. \nOur security has long depended on a strong and flexible deterrent. New \nthreats are constantly emerging from every corner of the globe. This \nhas been recently demonstrated by Iran's resistance to denuclearization \nand North Korea's increasingly violent saber rattling. The United \nStates must be able to rapidly adapt and respond to new threats to our \nsecurity. Now is the time for more flexible deterrent capability, not \nless.\n  New START is riddled with U.S. concessions from which I can see \nlittle gain. U.S. leadership in this arena will\n\n[[Page S10320]]\n\nbe measured by how well we protect our ability to defend ourselves and \nour friends, not by how quickly we agree to an imperfect treaty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I ask my colleague from Nevada--he \nmentioned he had some amendments, and we are ready to do amendments. Is \nhe prepared to go forward with his amendments?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Let me check.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, let me speak to a couple points the \nSenator from Nevada raised. He talked about the article V ban. I \ndiscussed this a few minutes ago with respect to the conversion of ICBM \nsilo launchers. There is a one-paragraph restraint in the treaty with \nrespect to the conversion of those missile defense interceptors. The \nForeign Relations Committee, in the course of our hearings, pressed the \nadministration on this question very extensively. There were a lot of \nquestions asked by colleagues on both sides of the aisle. The record \nunequivocally counters the argument just made by the Senator from \nNevada. The ban does not prevent us from deploying the most effective \nmissile defenses possible. I will be specific.\n  We will soon have some 30 missile defense interceptors in silos in \nCalifornia and Alaska. We are going to have an additional eight extra \nlaunchers in Alaska, if we need them. If we need more interceptors, the \nMissile Defense Agency Director, LTG Patrick O'Reilly, who was \noriginally appointed to that post in the administration of President \nBush, told the committee: ``For many different reasons,'' they would \n``never'' recommend converting either ICBM silos or SLBM launchers into \nmissile defense interceptor launchers.\n  What we are hearing is a completely red herring argument, sort of \nthrow it out there and say that somehow this is a restraint on missile \ndefense. Why is it not a restraint? One reason is cost. It is \nintriguing to me to hear a lot of colleagues raise this particular \nmissile defense issue in the treaty, when they also raise the issue of \nthe deficit and how much we are spending and how we should not be \nspending on things people don't want and the military doesn't want. \nHere is something the military doesn't want. They don't want it because \nthe conversion cost of the last ICBM launcher at Vandenberg into a \nmissile defense interceptor launcher was about $55 million.\n  The average cost for a new hardened missile defense interceptor silo \nin a new missile field is $36 million. The reason for that is because \nthe Missile Defense Agency has developed a smaller, more effective, \nspecial purpose silo to meet its needs.\n  The annual operating cost for a separate converted silo, which is \nwhat our colleagues are complaining about, is actually $2 million \nhigher per silo, and it is $2 million higher than a silo which the \nmilitary thinks is more effective and less expensive to maintain. As \nStrategic Command General Chilton noted, we also don't want to force \nRussia to make a split-second guess as to whether a missile that is \nflying out of a U.S. silo field is either a missile defense interceptor \nwhich may be aimed at a rogue missile or a nuclear-tipped missile aimed \nat Moscow. That confusion is impossible to distinguish unless we have a \ncompletely separate silo field. So converting an old ICBM silo in a \nparticular field where we can't distinguish between an interceptor or \nan ICBM actually increases the potential of confusion and threat and \npossibly a dangerous mistake and decision.\n  With regard to putting a missile defense interceptor in a submarine \nlaunch tube, Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen both said this is not a \ncost-effective step, and it presents very unique operational \nchallenges. We need to take these red herrings off the table. Secretary \nGates and Admiral Mullen both noted it would make much more sense to \nput missile defense interceptors on aegis-capable surface ships, which \nis what they are doing, and that is not constrained by any treaty. \nThere is no constraint whatsoever in our ability to go out and do what \nbest meets the needs as defined by the military themselves.\n  The bottom line is, article V, paragraph 3 does not constrain us one \niota.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I plan to speak for about an hour for the \nbenefit of scheduling, although I will only scratch the surface of what \nI will have to say about this treaty.\n  Let me begin by talking about 14 or 15 specific things I intend to \ncover at some point when we have time during this debate and note that \nthere will be amendments proposed that deal with many of the items I am \ngoing to be mentioning.\n  First, I think it is important for us to lay out what some of the \nconcerns are.\n  This morning when I talked about the fact that the Senate is going to \nhave to deal with the funding of the U.S. Government which expires on \nmidnight on Saturday, I noted the fact that the process the majority \nleader has invoked, to dual-track or consider the START treaty along \nwith the Omnibus appropriations bill, is not a process that allows \nadequate consideration of either, and the American people sent a signal \nin the last election that they didn't want us to continue this wasteful \nWashington spending spree we have been on. Yet the Omnibus \nappropriations bill, which I am not sure I could lift, will do exactly \nthat.\n  We ought to be focused on a process by which that can actually be \nconsidered with amendments. Under the way the majority leader has \noutlined our schedule, that does not appear to be possible.\n  The first concern I have with respect to going to the START treaty at \nthis time is that we are putting the cart before the horse. Our first \njob needs to be to ensure that the Federal Government doesn't run out \nof money at midnight on Saturday. Yet the majority leader has turned to \nthe START treaty. Why? I think the obvious--at least one--answer is to \ndivert attention from this big pile of spending that I am pointing to, \n6,700 earmarks. If we are talking about the START treaty, we are not \ntalking about the Omnibus appropriations bill. But the American people \nare talking about government spending. That is what we should be \nfocusing our attention on.\n  The problem now is that we are on the START treaty, and those of us \nwho want to talk about this and want to amend it and believe we will be \ndenied the opportunity to do so will be accused of not wanting to talk \nabout the START treaty because that is what the majority leader has put \non the Senate floor. And he will say: Gee, you have had all this time \nto talk about it. Why aren't you talking about it? That is part of what \nis wrong with the process. That is one of the reasons I have been \nsaying you cannot do all these things and do them right.\n\n  In addition, the majority leader said this morning we have other \nthings he wants to consider before Christmas as well. There is no \nearthly way to do all this within the time we have.\n  Let me mention some of the concerns I will be discussing with respect \nto the START treaty. I think one thing you have to talk about, first of \nall, is whether we are going to have sufficient time in order to do \nwhat needs to be done to both amend the treaty as well as the \nresolution of ratification and debate some of the issues, including the \nissue that my colleague from Massachusetts was just talking about.\n  Secondly, what were the benefits of the treaty for the United States \nvis-a-vis Russia? What were the concessions we made to Russia? What do \nthey get out of it? What do we get out of it? My own view is, they got \nvirtually everything out of it, and I do not know what we got out of \nit, except for the President to say he made another arms control deal \nwith Russia.\n  Third, where will this treaty leave our nuclear forces, our delivery \nvehicles, and our warheads in terms of the deterrent capability not \nonly for the United States but the 31 allies who rely on the U.S. \nnuclear umbrella? We will have cut our forces to the bone. Yet, \ninterestingly, Russia will not be forced to make any reductions at all \nin these delivery vehicles for the nuclear warheads.\n  Fourth--and there has been quite a bit of discussion in the media \nabout my work on modernization--where does the administration's \nmodernization plan end up relative to START? The point here is, if you \nare going to bring your nuclear warheads down to a bare minimum number \nor below that you\n\n[[Page S10321]]\n\nhave to make darn sure every single one of them is safe, secure and \nreliable and they will do what they are supposed to do and everybody \nneeds to know that. But all the experts agree the facilities we have \nfor taking care of our warheads and maintaining them are inadequate for \nthat purpose, and they have to be modernized.\n  Is the process and the amount of money that has been set aside for \nthat adequate? I will discuss my views on that and the questions that \nremain about critical funding for the modernization of both our nuclear \nweapons and the complex necessary to sustain them.\n  Fifth is the administration's uncertain commitment to the nuclear \ntriad. This I find troubling because while they have committed to a \nmodernization program, they have not yet committed to a program for the \nmodernization of the three legs of the nuclear triad: the delivery \nsystems, the ICBM force, the bomber force, accompanied by cruise \nmissiles and our submarine force. I will be discussing the areas in \nwhich I think the commitments in that regard are insufficient and \ndangerous.\n  Probably most interesting to a lot of people in this country, and \ncertainly to a lot of our colleagues, is the question of what has \noccurred with respect to the relinking of strategic offense and defense \ncapabilities. This is the missile defense concern. There is \nsignificantly divergent views between the United States and Russia on \nthis question of what the treaty does or does not do with respect to \nmissile defense. Both explicitly and impliedly, there are limitations \non U.S. missile defense activities in the treaty.\n  On the one hand, the Department of Defense has said the United States \nhas plans for developing and deploying missile defense systems that \nwill have adequate capability against ICBMs coming, for example, from \nIran. If they have capability against those missiles, they also have \ncapability against Russian missiles.\n  On the other hand, the U.S. official policy statement that \naccompanied the treaty and subsequent briefings from the State \nDepartment assures the Russians that the United States will not deploy \ndefenses that are capable of undermining the Russian deterrent. That is \nimportant because of the way the Russians interpret the preamble and \nother features of the treaty.\n  Misunderstanding and conflict between the parties is thus built into \nthe treaty if the United States intends to deploy more capable missiles \neither to defend Europe or the United States, which it is our stated \npolicy to do. So are we to believe the administration will ever put \nthis treaty at risk over future missile defense plans? That is a \nsubject we will be exploring in-depth.\n  Seventh, the Senate gave advice to the administration not to limit \nmissile defense or conventional prompt global strike, which is a \ncapability that would permit us to deliver over long ranges, \nintercontinental ranges, a warhead that is not a nuclear warhead, \nsomething which this administration and I think are very important for \nour future ability to deal with rogue states, for example. \nNevertheless, contrary to Congress's instructions, the administration \nhas subjected advanced U.S. conventional military capabilities to \nlimitations in this treaty, and we will discuss that.\n  Eight is something else. There are people who say there is nothing \nthat stands between us and a nuclear-free world. It is called zero \nnuclear, the President's stated goal of a world without nuclear \nweapons. Some say this treaty needs to be adopted, ratified in order to \npermit us then to take the next step, which is to achieve that great \ngoal. I submit that goal is neither feasible nor desirable, and that to \nthe extent this treaty is deemed as a stepping stone toward that, it is \na bad step to take.\n  Moreover, it is an unwelcome distraction from addressing the true \nnuclear dangers the President has made very clear are his top \npriorities; that is, the dangers of proliferation and terrorism.\n  Ninth is a question about verification, something Senator Bond has \ntalked a great deal about and I am going to be speaking some about \nbecause of issues that arose during my trip with Senator Feinstein to \nGeneva during the time our negotiators were working on this treaty with \ntheir Russian counterparts.\n  It is very clear that with lower force levels, we need better \nverification. But this New START treaty has substantially weaker \nverification provisions than its predecessor, START I. Of course, \nRussia has a history of cheating on every arms control treaty we have \never entered into with them, which amplifies the concern.\n  There are some comparisons, and I would suggest they are false \ncomparisons, to the SORT treaty, which is the 2002 treaty. It is called \nthe Moscow Treaty; that is, the treaty that deals with our strategic \noffensive weapons after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the fall of the \nSoviet Union, and the determination by the United States and Russia \nboth to simply bring down our nuclear forces. We did not need anymore \nthe nuclear forces that existed during the Cold War.\n  There are some false comparisons there that I think are very \nimportant for us to talk about as it relates to this treaty before us.\n  I think we also need to talk about the New START and Russian reset. I \nwill talk about that a little bit when I begin discussing the reasons \nfor trying to act so quickly here. But I think it also requires some \nfurther discussion because, frankly, Russia is threatening a new arms \nrace if the Senate does not ratify this treaty. Is that the reset the \nPresident is so fond of talking about, this new wonderful relationship \nwith the Russian Federation?\n  Twelfth, I think we need to talk about tactical nuclear weapons. The \ntreaty did not deal with tactical nuclear weapons, and respected \nMembers of this body, including the Vice President of the United \nStates, then a Senator, made clear that after the last treaty the next \nitem on the agenda had to be to deal with tactical nuclear weapons. It \nshould have been, but it was not done here.\n  Thirteenth--and this deals with some of the amendments that are going \nto be necessary--there is a Commission in here that somewhat like \nprevious treaty commissions--it is called the Bilateral Consultative \nCommission--and the treaty delegates to this Commission the ability, \neven in secret, to modify terms of the treaty--a group of Russians and \na group of U.S. negotiators. There is some reference in the committee's \nresolution of ratification, but, in my view, it is inadequate for the \nSenate to be able to react in time to notification by that Commission \nof things it is intending to do in time for the Senate to provide its \nadvice and consent, if those are necessary.\n\n  Then, as I mentioned, it is also important for us to determine how \nthis treaty is distracting attention from what the President has said, \nand I agree, is our top priority; that is, dealing with proliferation \nand terrorism. This treaty does not do anything to advance our goals in \nthat respect, and I think it would be much better if we could have \nspent part of the last 2 years better focusing on the illegal nuclear \nweapons programs of Iran and North Korea and why that should be our top \nagenda item right now.\n  Those are some of the things I am going to be talking about. I will \nnot have time to deal with all of them during this first hour. But let \nme at least briefly talk about the question of adequate time. I do not \nthink Senators are quite aware of some of the procedures that exist \nwith respect to treaty ratification. Because of precedent in the \nSenate, when cloture is filed, it will close off debate both on \namendments to the treaty and the preamble, as well as amendments to the \nresolution of ratification.\n  I think it is important to note there are amendments that Members, at \nleast on our side, have that go both to the treaty and preamble and \nalso amendments that deal with the resolution of ratification. In fact, \nI think there are many more that deal with the latter subject. We are \ngoing to have to be able to deal with both of those subject matters. So \nwhen Members talk about filing cloture, I think it is important to \nrealize that would cut off debate on every additional change, even if \nwe have not been able to complete work on the amendments to the \nresolution of ratification.\n  Also, I think it should be clear that there have been numerous \nletters sent to our leadership in the Senate and to the committee \nleadership from Republican Members of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nother Republican Senators, the 10 Republican Senators-\n\n[[Page S10322]]\n\nelect, Representatives from the House Armed Services Committee, and \nothers, indicating this is not the appropriate time or way to deal with \nthis treaty.\n  Incidentally, I happened to be watching Chris Matthews the other \nnight--a television program--and Lawrence Eagleburger, one of the \npeople who support the treaty, was asked by Matthews what the fuss was \nabout getting it done now and, among other things, this is what \nLawrence Eagleburger, former Secretary of State, said:\n\n       They want to do it before these lame duckers are out there. \n     That's not the way to move on this issue.\n\n  I agree with that. There are a lot of serious things to consider, and \nthe rush to do all the business this lameduck session has is not the \nbest way to get that done.\n  The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee yesterday expressed \nthe view that we had plenty of time to do this, comparing the work we \nhave here to the START I treaty. The START I treaty is the predecessor \nto this New START treaty, though there was the intervening 2002 Moscow \nTreaty I mentioned before. But just to make two quick points on this: \nWhen we dealt with START I, we did not have all the competing \nconsiderations, the dual tracking with an Omnibus appropriations bill \nand the votes we are going to have to take on that, as well as the \nother items the majority leader has mentioned. Secondly, if we are to \ntalk about an analogous treaty, the START treaty was not considered by \nthe Senate until September of 1992, and the analogy would be that this \ntreaty before us now would be appropriate to bring to the Senate next \nMay, May of 2011. That is how much time elapsed between the two.\n  I am not suggesting we need that much more time, but I am simply \npointing out the fact that it is not analogous. Probably a better \nanalogy would be the INF Treaty. That is a treaty that took the Senate \n9 days of floor time. We had no intervening business of any kind. There \nwere 20 votes on amendments and plenty of time to work out \nconsideration of other amendments.\n  So the idea that, well, some treaties have not taken that long, \ntherefore, why can't we do this one, is a specious argument, and I \nthink when we see the serious issues that need to be considered, our \ncolleagues will appreciate the need to take adequate time on this \nagreement.\n  One of the curious arguments is, we have to do this quickly because \nthe verification provisions of the predecessor START I treaty have \nlapsed and, as a result, we have a situation that is untenable. As a \nmatter of fact, Robert Gibbs, the Press Secretary, believing that the \nSenate yesterday was reading the treaty, which did not happen, \nnevertheless put out a statement, obviously prematurely, and one of the \nthings he said was:\n\n       Every minute that the START Treaty is being read on the \n     Senate floor increases the time that we lack verification of \n     Russia's nuclear arsenal.\n\n  Well, apart from the fact that he was wrong about the reading of the \ntreaty, he is also wrong about the urgency because of the lack of \nverification of the Russians. First of all, I am confused by the two \nmain arguments to support the treaty.\n  No. 1, we have this wonderful relationship with the Russians that has \nbeen reset and we are cooperating on all of these things. By the way, \nwe can't trust those guys so we quickly have to put these verification \nmeasures in place. There is something that doesn't quite connect there \nas far as I am concerned.\n  But I go back to why we don't have verification right now. This story \nreminds me a little bit about the trial of a fellow who killed both of \nhis parents and then pled for mercy from the court because he was an \norphan. This problem of verification was created by the administration. \nIt has nothing to do with action by the Senate, and they have nothing \nbut themselves to blame for whatever verification procedures are not in \nplace.\n  How did that come about? Well, the START treaty had perfectly good \nverification provisions in it that could have been continued for \nanother 5 years if the United States had taken the view with Russia \nthat that is what we should do. But the administration said, no, we are \ngoing to deliver the START treaty on time so there won't be any hiatus \nthere, so we don't need to continue the verification provisions of \nSTART I.\n  Here is what was said in a joint statement between President Barack \nObama and Dmitry Medvedev, President of the Russian Federation, on \nApril 1 of 2009:\n\n       The United States and the Russian Federation intend to \n     conclude this agreement before the treaty expires in \n     December.\n\n  Originally, we had nothing to worry about because the new treaty \nwould be done by then. It soon became evident that wasn't going to \nhappen, the negotiations were dragging, and the treaty would expire. \nDid this administration decide to try to continue the existing treaty--\nwhich it could have done? It just takes the United States and Russia \nagreeing to do it, no Senate action required. No, it didn't do that.\n  Several of us began to express concerns about this. The Republican \nranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee even \nintroduced legislation to provide the necessary legal framework for \nverification to continue even though the two treaties had lapsed, and I \ncosponsored that legislation. The administration said, well, what we \nare going to do is get a bridging agreement with Russia that will \nbridge the time between the time START lapses and the time the new \ntreaty is ratified.\n  Michael McFaul, the NSC adviser for Russia, in a press briefing on \nNovember 15 of 2009 made that point. He said:\n\n       It does expire on December 5 and in parallel, we have a \n     bridging agreement that we are also working on with the \n     Russians, so there is no interruption. The key thing here is \n     verification. We just want to preserve the verification.\n\n  So that was the intention. Those of us who expressed concerns about \nthis were at least, I think, somewhat mollified, except that when I \nwent to Geneva, what we found was there had been no conversations \nwhatsoever, and it appeared to me--I came back to the floor and \nactually called it malpractice--that our negotiators and the Russian \nnegotiators had not thought about, let alone begun, to negotiate what \nkind of agreement would be put in place in the event the treaty expired \nand nothing else was in place to provide for verification. But at least \nthey promised we would have this bridging agreement.\n  Then the administration said--when the treaty was signed and the two \nPresidents spoke to the issue--that we would continue in the spirit of \nthe previous treaty so there would be no difference in action between \nthe two countries in whatever time period it took for the ratification \nof the treaty to occur by the two countries' bodies. This is a \nquotation from the statement of Presidents Medvedev and Obama:\n\n       We express our commitment as a matter of principle to \n     continue to work together in the spirit of the START Treaty \n     following its expiration, as well as our firm intention to \n     ensure that a New START Treaty and strategic arms enter into \n     force at the earliest possible date.\n\n  It is a complete mystery as to what happened. What happened to the \nbridging agreement? What happened to this spirit of cooperation we were \ngoing to continue in the spirit of the previous treaty? We are now told \nit is an absolute emergency for the Senate to hurry up and ratify this \ntreaty because the Russians might cheat. Nobody has explained what \nhappened here and nobody has explained why it was important before, but \nit never got done, and now we have the emergency.\n  There were documents that trickled in over time, but one of the \nthings we have asked for to try to explain what happened and what this \nspirit is that the Presidents both talked about was the negotiating \nrecord. We have absolutely been denied access to that negotiating \nrecord. The Russians know what we said and what they said. The State \nDepartment knows what we said and what they said, but Senators who are \nasked to give their advice and consent can't be trusted, I guess, to \nknow what was said between the Russian and U.S. negotiators.\n  Numerous officials of the administration have said there is an \nurgency to ratify the treaty because we lack verification measures with \nRussia. That was the statement Senator Clinton made back in August and \nothers have said the same thing. Of course, we do have some \nverification, but I don't want to get into in open session the national \ntechnical means we have. We can discuss that in executive session.\n\n[[Page S10323]]\n\n  But apart from the mystery about this bridging agreement and the \ncommitment of the two Presidents, this urgency is irrational if we are \nto believe that we really reset this relationship with Russia. In fact, \nadministration officials have actually denied that the emergency \nexists, a point that has been made by others. Gary Samore, who is \nspecial assistant to the President, said:\n\n       I am not particularly worried near term, but over time as \n     the Russians are modernizing their systems and starting to \n     deploy new systems, the lack of inspections will create much \n     more uncertainty.\n\n  Absolutely true. I agree with that. But he is not worried in the near \nterm; that is to say, within the next few months.\n  The Washington Post I thought put it well. In an editorial they said:\n\n       But no calamity will befall the United States if the Senate \n     does not act this year. The Cold War threat of the nuclear \n     exchange between Washington and Moscow is, for now, almost \n     nonexistent.\n\n  So I don't think it is a valid argument to rush this treaty through \nin the week before Christmas, that somehow this is an urgent need and \nthat our national security is threatened if we don't do that. I also \nreject the argument that the only choice for us is this treaty or no \ntreaty. Obviously, there are other choices. When it comes to \nverification, both countries have the ability to have agreements with \neach other that provide for the kind of inspection regimes that would \nbe appropriate.\n  Let me conclude at this point. Ian Kelly, who is a State Department \nspokesman, made a comment that I think sums it up. He said:\n\n       Both sides pledge not to take any measures that would \n     undermine the strategic stability that the START has provided \n     during this period between the expiration of the START treaty \n     and entering into the force of the new treaty, which will \n     take some months.\n\n  He is right. But I think the argument that the Senate has to act \nnow--right now--or else our national security is going to be \njeopardized by lack of verification is specious, and it certainly \nraises questions if we are to examine what the real basis is and what \nthe result of this new reset relationship with Russia is. That is the \nargument: We have to do this now, because otherwise we won't be able to \nverify what the Russians are doing. The other argument is that we reset \nour relationship with Russia and, therefore, if we don't do this, it \nwill make the Russians mad and they will not continue to cooperate with \nus on important matters they have cooperated with us on. I think it is \nimportant to both examine that allegation as well as the question of \nwhat the two countries got out of this treaty.\n  Let me speak for a moment about what the Russians got out of the \ntreaty and what the United States purportedly gets out of the treaty, \nmost of it characterized in this reset language. Russian politician \nSergei Kurginyan said:\n\n       Russia could not have an easier partner on the topic of \n     nuclear arms than Obama.\n\n  He is referring to President Obama.\n  What exactly did the Russians get out of this? Some said, Well, even \nthough they are no longer a powerful nation they need the superpower \nstatus, and entering into a treaty such as this, such as the kinds of \ntreaties that used to be entered into during the Cold War, gives them a \nfeeling of superpower status along with the United States. So it is \nimportant for us to do that. First of all, I am not sure you treat a \nserious reset partner that way, but apart from that, obviously, the \nRussians felt that if they could negotiate a good treaty with the \nUnited States, it would be to their benefit, and I don't question their \nintentions in doing that.\n  But what we got out of this in terms of the primary feature of the \ntreaty is to reduce the nuclear warheads and delivery vehicles. The \ndelivery vehicles are the most important thing, in my view. But only \nthe United States reduces its strategic delivery vehicles under this \nNew START treaty. The Russians don't. They currently have about 560 \ndelivery vehicles. These are ICBMs, bomber capability, and submarine \ncapability. The United States has 856. The treaty takes you down to 700 \nof deployed delivery vehicles. So even under the treaty, Russia can \nbuild up to that level by adding 140 launchers they don't currently \nhave, while the United States must cut our forces by 156. One says, \nWell, why shouldn't it be exactly equal? The United States has \nobligations beyond those of Russia. Russia has a need to defend its \nterritory. The United States has 31 other countries relying on the U.S. \nnuclear umbrella. Therefore, the targets we must hold at risk and the \nconcerns we have about adequate delivery vehicles are much different \nthan Russia's. Nonetheless, we have agreed to a parity number here of \n700. So they can build up to that number; we have to build down. That \nis not exactly a great victory, in my view. In fact, it is the first \ntime since the very disastrous Washington naval treaties with Germany \nand Japan before World War II that the United States has agreed to one-\nsided reductions in military might.\n  I mentioned the bridging agreement before. Where that fell through \nthe cracks, I don't know. The administration was apparently pushing for \nit. It didn't get it. We still don't know what happened because we \nhaven't been given the record.\n  On mobile missiles, this is a matter that exercised the Russians when \nthe committee dealt with it in a very modest way in its resolution of \nratification. You see, the Russians have had rail mobile missile plans \nand don't know exactly what they are going to do in the future with \nrail mobile, but when the committee deigned to speak to this, the \nRussians reacted like a scalded dog: Well, we recommend the Duma not \napprove the treaty if we are going to be talking about rail mobile \nmissiles. What about the United States in contention? We shouldn't be \ntalking about U.S. missile defense. No, that is OK, but we don't want \nto talk about rail mobile missiles. So the Russians successfully \nprevented any revisions on that and there is maybe a concern now that \nwe made a mistake in not including that. Obviously, the concession \nmakes it much harder to monitor their forces if they go with rail \nmobile forces.\n  In addition, we limited the monitors of missile production at \nVotkinsk. Votkinsk was the missile production facility in Russia that \nproduced many of the missiles the Russians used and this was required \nby the START I treaty. The Russians didn't want this anymore. I can \nunderstand why. If we are going to understand what they are producing \nin their factory and see what happens when they roll them outside the \nfactory, then we will have a better idea of whether they are cheating. \nThe Russians said from the very beginning, We are not going to let you \ndo that anymore. So they got something very important with regard to \nverification. Again, the argument is we have to do verification. \nUnderstand that verification in this treaty is much weaker than the \nverification that existed under START I and that could have been \ncontinued for another 5 years if the administration had taken that \nposition.\n  Very troublesome is a reverse in course by the United States and \nRussia both with regard to MIRVing of ICBMs. We have been working \nagainst MIRVing for a long time and finally achieved in the last treaty \na recognition of the fact that MIRVed missiles; that is to say, \nmissiles that have numerous warheads on top, are very destabilizing \nbecause it creates a situation where you basically have to use them or \nyou lose them. If we attack a missile silo and kill eight warheads all \nat once with one strike, that is a major loss. So the idea is that \nstrategic offensive weapons with those MIRVs on them need to get off \nbefore they are hit by an incoming missile. Very destabilizing.\n  So both countries agreed we would move toward a single warhead \nmissile. Well, in this treaty, that all goes by the boards. The United \nStates is going to continue to provide for single warheads, but not \nRussia. In fact, it is believed that 80 percent of the Russian ICBM \nforce in the future will consist of MIRVed ICBMs. I don't know why the \nadministration walked back from that. Again, we don't know because we \ndon't have the negotiating record.\n  The SLCM is the submerged launch cruise missile. Now, the START I \ntreaty had a side agreement that limited submerged launch cruise \nmissiles. But this new START treaty ends that side agreement and says \neven though the United States is retiring our submerged launch cruise \nmissiles, as we intended to do under START I, it appears that Russia is \ndeveloping a new\n\n[[Page S10324]]\n\nversion of such a missile, with a range of up to approximately 5,000 \nkilometers, which is a longer range than some ballistic missiles \ncovered by the treaty.\n\n  Again, why do we allow a relinkage of a subject as important to us as \nmissile defense with strategic arms limitations and yet not limit rail \nmobile, SLCMs, and so on? It is a very lopsided result in the \nnegotiations, it seems to me.\n  I mentioned missile defense. Russia not only achieved a recognition \nof its position that missile defense is related to strategic offensive \nsystems in the preamble of this treaty, but it negotiated limitations \non U.S. missile defense in article V. Importantly, it added some what I \nwill call ``bullying'' language in the unilateral statement \naccompanying the treaty. These achievements came after the U.S. gave \naway ground-based European systems and promised the Senate there would \nbe no treaty limitations on defensive missiles.\n  Missile defense targets is another area in which the U.S. gave \nground. There is ambiguous treaty language which I believe will \nconstrain U.S. ability to maximize the affordability of our missile \ndefense targets. We are not going to be able to reuse old targets.\n  Telemetry is a big issue the U.S. fought hard on but apparently caved \non. We don't have the record, so we don't know what kind of quid pro \nquo could have been gotten for this. Under START I, one of the most \nvaluable collection methods was the unencrypted telemetry from missile \ntests by the Russians. They got that from our missile tests. We both \nknew the capability of each other's missiles. In a sense, that is \nstabilizing. But under New START, which is supposed to be improving the \nsituation with regard to certainty, unencrypted data from almost every \nballistic missile flight will be not subject to sharing with the other \nside. At best, five flights a year will be shared. But Russia can \nchoose to never share flight test data from new missiles they are \ncurrently developing and testing. They can say here is data from five \ntests of old missiles, but they don't have to share data as to any of \ntheir new missiles. None of our intelligence people will tell you that \nis an improvement or a good situation.\n  Here is another disparity in the treaty: conventional prompt global \nstrike. Remember I mentioned the Russian potential plans for rail \nmobile or cruise missile submarine launch. I think the United States \nhas a very good idea about moving forward with something we call \nconventional prompt global strike. It is not even a nuclear program. It \nis a sensible way to deal with some of the emerging threats around the \nworld today, where we may have a need, in a very quick time and over a \nlong distance, to send a conventional warhead to a country. We may not \nwant to have to send a nuclear warhead--Heaven knows what that would \nstart--but it makes sense to have a conventional capability to do this.\n  The Russians have fought that. It is a little unclear why, since it \nwould totally be aimed at other countries, certainly not Russia. In a \ntreaty nominally about nuclear weapons, we have a specific limitation \non the U.S. plans for conventional prompt global strike. It would limit \nthe capability we are seeking to address WMD and terrorist threats by \nrequiring that any such missiles be counted against the already-too-low \nlimit of 700 missiles for delivery of nuclear warheads.\n  Let's say we were going to deploy 24 of these missiles--to decide a \nnumber. That means you have to reduce the 700 by 24. That provides a \nhuge disincentive to deploying these conventional prompt global strike \nmissiles and a dangerous reduction from a negotiated 700 launcher limit \nin the treaty.\n  I am not going to get deeply into inspections and verifications. That \nwill have to be dealt with in executive closed session where we can \ndiscuss classified matters. Suffice it to say here, in discussing the \ndisparity between what the Russians got and what we got, in a number of \ninspections this new treaty cuts the number of inspections by more than \nhalf compared to START I.\n  Part of the problem is that none of the inspections that are \npermitted will ever enable us to have a good sense of the total number \nof warheads. So that is different from the START I treaty. We are never \ngoing to be able to monitor, under this treaty, whether the Russians \nare complying with the overall limit on warheads. Again, we will have \nto get more into that in executive session.\n  I talked about tactical nukes. I mentioned the fact that when he was \na Senator, Vice President Biden made remarks during ratification of the \n2002 Moscow Treaty. He said:\n\n       After entry into force of the Moscow Treaty, getting a \n     handle on Russian tactical nuclear weapons must be a top arms \n     control and nonproliferation objective of the United States \n     Government.\n\n  Well, here it is 8 years later, and not only is there no further \nprogress toward that--and I agree with the Vice President--but this \ntreaty, at the insistence of the Russians, has not one word about \ntactical nuclear weapons. I will be discussing that in more detail \nlater on. I just mention it here to illustrate yet another area where \nit seems to me there is a great disparity.\n  I didn't count up all of these things, but there have to be 10 or 12 \nareas in which the Russians have gotten very much what they bargained \nfor. The question is, What did we get?\n  We are told that we benefit for the following reasons: We can resume \ninspections in Russia. As I said, we could have done that by extending \nthe START I treaty. That is a problem of our own making. By allowing \nthat to expire and not renewing or putting into place a bridging \nagreement or enforcing the joint statement the two Presidents put \ntogether in working together in the spirit of START I, the inspections \nare significantly weaker, as I said.\n  I will quote Senator Bond. He said:\n\n       The administration's new START Treaty has been oversold and \n     overhyped. If we cannot verify that the Russians are \n     complying with each of the treaty's three central limits, \n     then we have no way of knowing whether we are more secure or \n     not. There is no doubt in my mind that the United States \n     cannot reliably verify the treaty's 1,550 limit on deployed \n     warheads.\n\n  Senator Bond is exactly right. We will discuss some of that in open \nsession and the rest of it in closed session.\n  I will conclude this point by noting that the Vice President and \nothers have also suggested that this treaty is important for the United \nStates because it is a valuable part of the so-called reset \nrelationship with the Russians.\n  I have to ask several questions about this. Why have we assumed this \nhas been such a great success?\n  My colleague, Senator Durbin, for example, stated a couple of weeks \nago that we need Russia's help in dealing with Iran because that nation \nis about to bring online a new nuclear powerplant. I remind everybody \nthat Russia built and fueled that powerplant for Iran. So that is a \ngreat benefit to this reset relationship.\n  We will have more to say about that as well. I will conclude this \npart by quoting from Dr. Henry Kissinger, who believes the treaty \nshould be ratified. He said:\n\n       The argument for this treaty is not to placate Russia. That \n     is not the reason to approve this treaty. Under no condition \n     should a treaty be made as a favor to another country, or to \n     make another country feel better. It has to be perceived to \n     be in the American national interest.\n\n  So what are the two big arguments for the treaty? We have to get this \nverification regime in place because the Russians may cheat. Well, I \nguess they are our new best friends and we have to keep it that way or \nelse they will get mad. Dr. Kissinger wrote before about this matter of \nwhat should motivate us to do an arms control treaty. He said every \narms control treaty has to be justified within its own four corners. \nYou can never say a reason to do it is to make the other country feel \nbetter or to gain some kind of leverage with the other country or to \ngain its cooperation in some way. A, it is illegitimate; and, B, it \ndoesn't work. He made that point precisely with respect to this. He is \nsaying that is not a reason to endorse this treaty.\n\n  I conclude that the two big arguments are not arguments at all, and, \nin point of fact, the Russians got a lot more out of this treaty than \nthe United States ever would.\n  I spoke a little bit about the treaty limits because this is the \ncentral idea of the treaty--to reduce the number of\n\n[[Page S10325]]\n\nwarheads and delivery vehicles. I wanted to discuss that in this \ncontext because there are a lot of people who believe--and I certainly \nunderstand the argument--that it seems like a good idea if both \ncountries are reducing nuclear weapons forces and warheads. That was \nexactly the theory under the Moscow Treaty of 2002. We didn't need that \nmany warheads and delivery vehicles.\n  The United States said: We are just going to reduce ours; and Russia \nsaid: We have to reduce ours, too, so why don't we have a treaty. The \nUnited States said: We can have one, but we don't need one; we are \ngoing to do this out of our own best interests because it costs a lot \nof money. As a favor to Russia, we said: If you want to do a treaty, \nfine, but we will not make any concessions to do it.\n  Now we are cutting into the bone and getting the level of delivery \nvehicles down to 700 could jeopardize our ability to carry out our \nmissions. That is my assertion. There are experts in the administration \nwho have briefed us, who can show exactly where the targets are, where \nour missiles are, how many we would need, and so on. They say actually \nwe still have enough to do the job.\n  I am willing to accept their, first of all, patriotic motivations, \nexpertise, and judgment on this issue. But I also note that when you \nread all of the statements that all of them made, they appreciate that \nthis is it--this is the limit beyond which we don't dare go. It rests \nupon several assumptions, including the assumptions that the Russians \nare never going to break out or cheat. It rests on the assumption that \nwe don't have new targets that we have to worry about.\n  I suggest, especially with respect to the Chinese development and \nmodernization of its nuclear force, and the role it is beginning to \nplay in the world militarily, it is not necessarily a valid assumption \nthat the targets that existed during the Cold War are all that we will \never have to worry about.\n  Let me talk briefly about this matter of how we have brought down the \nnumber of warheads and missiles, and why it is not necessarily the \ngreat thing that the proponents are cracking it up to be. The first \npoint I will reiterate: We did all the giving; they did the taking. We \nhave to reduce the number of our delivery vehicles, and they can \nactually build up theirs.\n  At the signing of the treaty, Russia had a total of 640 strategic \ndelivery vehicles, with only 571 of them deployed. That is according to \nthe Moscow defense briefing in 2010 about their missiles and delivery \nvehicles. Aleksey Arbatov, a former deputy chairman of the Duma Defense \nCommittee said:\n\n       The new treaty is an agreement reducing the American and \n     not the Russian strategic nuclear forces. In fact, the latter \n     will be reduced in any case because of the mass removal from \n     the order of battle of obsolete arms and the one-time \n     introduction of new systems.\n\n  We believe his statement is correct. I am worried that we have gotten \nvery close to the line. Nothing has changed since 2008 except that the \nChinese have been working hard at their modernization. That is when the \nBush administration testified that the current level--the levels we \nhave today, not the levels we are going down to--were necessary for \ndeterrence.\n  I could quote from Secretary Bodman and Secretary Gates who spoke to \nthat issue in September of 2008 to make that point. General Cartwright, \nVice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, who supports the treaty, testified \nthat in 2009 he would be concerned about having fewer than 800 delivery \nvehicles. I am quoting:\n\n       From about 1,100 down to about 500--500 being principally \n     where the Russians would like to be, and 1,100 being \n     principally where we would like to be, now the negotiation \n     starts. I would be very concerned if we got down below those \n     levels, about midpoint.\n\n  Secretary Schlesinger said:\n\n       As to the stated context of strategic nuclear weapons, the \n     numbers specified are adequate, though barely so.\n\n  Those are the views of experts.\n  Dr. Kissinger, who testified in support of the treaty, said this:\n\n       [T]he numbers of American and Russian strategic warheads \n     and delivery systems have been radically reduced and are \n     approaching levels where the arsenals of other countries will \n     bear on a strategic balance, as will tactical nuclear \n     weapons, particularly given the great asymmetry in their \n     numbers in Russia's favor.\n\n  There are two things he is talking about. First, as Russia and the \nUnited States bring our forces down, there is a certain point--I am not \nsuggesting we are there yet, but there is a certain point that \ncountries, such as China, for example, can say: Wait a minute, there is \nnow not that much difference between where Russia and China are--Russia \nand the United States are and where we are, and therefore, if we just \nbuild ours up somewhat, we can be at virtual parity with Russia and the \nUnited States, and, voila, instead of having two powers with a large \nnumber of nuclear warheads, you then have three. So there is an \nincentive for countries like that to build up once we get down to a \ncertain point.\n  The other point he makes is with respect to tactical weapons. \nTactical does not really relate to the amount of boom the weapon makes, \nits destructive capabilities, so much as the delivery vehicle it is on. \nThe Russians have a significant advantage in that, as Secretary \nKissinger pointed out. So there is an asymmetry that exists both with \nrespect to warheads and delivery vehicles.\n  General Chilton, when he talked about support for New START, \npredicated it on no Russian cheating or changes in the geopolitical \nenvironment. I would like to read his quotation. He said:\n\n       It was decided . . . we would just fix that [Presidential \n     guidance] for our analysis of the force structure for the \n     START negotiations. And so that's how we moved forward. . . . \n     The only assumptions we had to make with regard to the new \n     NPR, which was, of course, in development in parallel at the \n     time [with the START treaty] was that there would be no \n     request for increase in forces. And there was also an \n     assumption that I think is valid, and that is that the \n     Russians in the post-negotiation time period would be \n     compliant with the treaty.\n\n  He assumes they are going to be, in other words. But those are the \ntwo assumptions on which we had to base a reduction down to this level. \nI think Senators should ask themselves whether they agree with these \nassessments in light of the facts that Russia does continue to \nmodernize its force, as does China; that more nuclear forces in those \ncountries necessarily means more potential targets for the United \nStates to hold at risk; and that Russia has violated practically every \narms control treaty it signed with the United States; and taking into \naccount what hangs in the balance--the commitment of the United States \nnot only to our 31 allies and the nuclear umbrella we have but also the \nprotection of the United States with our nuclear deterrent. We have \nlittle to gain and much to lose if we can't be certain the numbers in \nNew START are adequate.\n  Let me conclude this point by talking about some counting rules. This \nis a little esoteric and gets down into the weeds, but it is important \nto understand in the context of what I am talking about.\n  Under the treaty, strategic stability may be weakened because there \nis not a specified loadout of reentry vehicles per missile. That is \nwhat we used to have. The counting rules in the treaty present \nopportunities for allowable cheating that the United States is not \nlikely to pursue--in fact, I would say we will not pursue--but which \ncould give Russia an advantage.\n  While the United States improves stability in our ICBM force by \neliminating the MIRVing I talked about before, Russia will become more \nreliant on MIRVed ICBMs, and, again, that is destabilizing because it \nencourages first-strike planning for fixed silo weapons--the ``use it \nor lose it'' problem.\n  The Chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mullen, said:\n\n       The United States will ``de-MIRV'' the Minuteman III ICBM \n     force to a single warhead to enhance the stability of the \n     nuclear balance.\n\n  So why would we, then, encourage the Russians to go exactly the \nopposite direction in this treaty?\n  Let me quote again. This is from a Russian forces blog, November 30, \n2010:\n\n       The commander of the Strategic Rocket Forces, Lt.-General \n     Sergei Karakayev, announced today that all new mobile Topol-M \n     missiles will carry multiple warheads. This modification of \n     the missile is officially known as the Yars or RS-24. The \n     first three RS-24 missiles were deployed in Teykovo earlier \n     this year.\n\n  That is what I was referring to before, and that promotes strategic \ninstability, not stability.\n\n[[Page S10326]]\n\n  Finally, due to the bomber accounting rules, at least one Russian \nmilitary commentator has noted:\n\n       Under the treaty, one nuclear warhead will be counted for \n     each deployed heavy bomber which can carry 12 to 234 missiles \n     or bombs depending on its type. Consequently, Russia will \n     retain 2,100 warheads.\n\n  Might I inquire how close I am to using the 60 minutes I had intended \nto speak?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has about 10 minutes \nremaining on the hour he asked for, but there is no time limit.\n  Mr. KYL. I appreciate that there is no time limit on my speaking and \nI appreciate there is no time limit on my time, but I have an \nengagement at noon and, second, I did not want to be out here on the \nfloor talking for too long.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I wish to ask the Senator, if I can--I don't want to \ninterrupt him, but I wanted to inquire, get a sense here--I appreciate \na lot of the comments he has made. First of all, let me say that I have \nappreciated working very closely with Senator Kyl on this for months \nnow. We have had an enormous amount of dialog; we have had a lot of \nmeetings; we have gone back and forth. I think he would agree that we \nhave tried very hard and in good faith to address many of the concerns \nhe has raised, notwithstanding the ones he just raised in his speech, \nmany of which I will speak to as we go along.\n  But I would like to sort of get a sense from him. He mentioned \namendments, others have, but we are now almost at lunchtime, and we \ndon't have an amendment. I would like to get a sense of when we might \nanticipate really being able to do the business on the treaty.\n  Mr. KYL. I will be happy to respond. Part of the business of the \nSenate on the treaty is to expose its flaws and to have a robust debate \nabout those flaws, which can provide the foundation for amendments \nwhich we intend to offer.\n  I was struck by the seriousness and importance, at least in my mind, \nof the two-page list of amendments my staff acquired from colleagues. \nAs my colleague knows, we actually shared a list of 10 or 12 amendments \nthat I had thought about, and actually some of my colleagues--in fact, \nwe had a couple-of-hour conversation about that one morning to see if \nwe could reach agreement on any of them, which we were not able to do. \nBut there are some very serious amendments, most of which go to the \nresolution of ratification, and a few go to the treaty or the preamble \nitself.\n\n  I note that yesterday my colleague said--I think I am quoting him \ncorrectly--``Make no mistake, we will not allow an amendment to the \ntreaty or the preamble.'' Maybe there are the votes to not allow that. \nBut I do think it is important for us, in this discussion, before \noffering such an amendment, to appreciate why we believe such an \namendment would be important.\n  As my colleague well knows, there is a great deal that can be said \nabout this. I am trying to say it in as succinct a form as I can.\n  Mr. KERRY. I appreciate it.\n  Mr. KYL. But there is a great deal of discussion that needs to occur \nfor a predicate for the amendments we intend to offer.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I completely respect what the Senator \nfrom Arizona has just said, and we obviously want to give him time to \nlay any predicate to whatever he may perceive to be a flaw. For \ninstance, as he raises the question about the MIRVing, as he just did--\nand later, I will go through each of these points--but the fact is, the \nreason the Russians are MIRVing--which we all understand, and there are \nplenty of letters from the Strategic Command and elsewhere that will \narticulate the way in which they do not see that as a threat--the \nreason they MIRV is because they cannot afford to do some of the other \nthings with respect to the numbers of missiles, so they put more \nwarheads on one missile.\n  We have preserved a very significant breakout capacity here. As \nGeneral Chilton and others will point out, it is not a flaw at all. It \nis actually an advantage which is maintained in this treaty for the \nAmerican strategic posture. I will go into that later. What the Senator \ndescribes as a flaw from his point of view I think the record will well \nstate is sort of a preserved American advantage.\n  That said, I respect, obviously--we want to get this joined. I think \nwhat the Senator has just laid out is very helpful. It will help us \njoin the debate. But I do want to impress that the sooner we can get to \nsome of these amendments, the more we can really discover whether \nsomething is, in fact, a flaw or is not a flaw and has been adequately \nanswered.\n  Mr. KYL. I appreciate my colleague's comment. I note that I think the \nreason the Russians are going to MIRVing is--at least the primary \nreason is exactly as Senator Kerry has stated. They have financial \nlimitations on what they can do here, but I don't think one can deny \nthat the result of it is strategic instability compared to moving \ntoward a single warhead missile, such as the United States has been \ndoing and will continue to do.\n  What I wanted to do in this segment of my remarks before I conclude--\nand I will advise my colleagues that the next thing I intend to be \ntalking about is the administration's commitment to the nuclear triad, \nbut I don't think I am going to have time to get to that. I would like \nto conclude now with some comments about modernization.\n  It has been well known that I have been involved in negotiations with \nthe administration regarding modernization. My colleague and friend, \nSenator Kerry, has been very helpful, I might say, in occasionally \nrestarting those conversations when they got bogged down a little bit \nand was helpful--and I specifically have complimented him before and \nwill do it again--in ensuring that the President's increase in the \nbudget for our nuclear modernization program that was in his budget \nthis year will actually be carried out in the funding the Congress \ndoes. We had to do a continuing resolution back in September, and I \nthink it was largely due to Senator Kerry's efforts that that funding \nwas included.\n  I just note that we have had a lot of concern back and forth about \nwhether there is a real commitment to get that done over the years. \nObviously, both of us appreciate the fact that no one can guarantee \nanything, but there is a certain amount of good will and commitment \ninvolved here, and certainly the administration needs to be very \nactively involved in ensuring that the funding required for its \nmodernization program actually comes to pass.\n  I note that the continuing resolution as passed by the House of \nRepresentatives unfortunately conditioned this funding Senator Kerry \nand I were responsible for--conditioned it on the ratification of the \nSTART treaty, saying: If you don't ratify the treaty, you are not going \nto get the money. Thankfully, a couple of administration officials \nrelatively quickly pushed back on that and said: No, that is not right. \nThe treaty stands on its own, and the modernization program stands on \nits own, and this funding is necessary.\n  That is the kind of pushback on what might otherwise be rather petty \npolitics that is going to be required by all of us who understand that \nmodernization is critical in the future.\n  With that belief predicate, let me state what the problem has been \nand generally how we went about trying to correct or solve the problem.\n  The United States, believe it or not--and this is the fault of \nRepublican and Democratic administrations and Republican and Democratic \nMembers of Congress--it is a negligence, I would say a gross negligence \non all of our parts. I take some of the blame for not having yelled \nabout this more than I have. But at the same time that every other \nnuclear power is modernizing its forces, both its facilities and its \ncapability to maintain its weapons, its weapons, and, in the case of \nthe Russians and the Chinese, their delivery systems as well--while \nevery one of them has a capacity to do that, to actually produce a \nwarhead to put back into production when one comes out of production, \nthe United States does not. The country that literally invented these \nweapons with the Manhattan Project is still using Manhattan Project--\nthat is 1942, in case you have forgotten--era buildings to take care of \nthese most sophisticated weapons. If you were to liken it to a car, it \nwould be like a Ferrari race car or Formula 1\n\n[[Page S10327]]\n\nrace car, highly technical--I don't think you would want to refurbish \nthose in somebody's old backyard garage.\n  The bottom line is that these facilities have to be brought up to \nmodern standards to be able to modernize our weapons over time. Why do \nthe weapons have to be modernized? Generally speaking, these are \nweapons that were designed in the 1970s, built in the 1980s, and built \nto last 10 years. Do the math. We are still relying on those weapons.\n  What we found, even though we have cut way back on the funding for \nwhat we call surveillance--that is to say, taking a look at several of \nthese weapons every year, taking the skin off, looking down inside, \nseeing what is rusty and what is loose and so on, to use an analogy to \na car maybe--what we found is that there are significant issues with \nthese weapons that need to be addressed if our commanders and labs are \nto continue to be able to secure them as safe, secure, and reliable, as \nthey must.\n  So we need the facilities in which to bring these sophisticated \nweapons in, take them apart, make sure they are put back together \nproperly with all the requisite either new parts or reused parts or \nwhatever is necessary to continue to allow them to work and get them \nback into production.\n  The timeline on this is more than critical. Suffice it to say in this \nopen session of Congress that we dare not waste any more time at all. I \nthink that is one of the reasons why the President's advisers from the \nlaboratories and the Department of Defense and Energy presented this to \nthe President and his nuclear posture review. In the modernization plan \nhe developed, there is a very firm commitment on his part to move \nforward with this, because no time can be wasted.\n  To give you one illustration, when we left one of the facilities we \nhad examined--we have been to each of these facilities and we have \ntalked to the people there, and we were given a little souvenir from \none of them. It is encased in plastic, a little vacuum tube. It is a \nvacuum tube such as those that came out of our black-and-white TVs back \nin the 1960s, I guess. It is still being used in a component of one of \nour weapons, and they are replacing it with circuit boards, of course.\n  That is the kind of thing that needs to be modernized in these \nweapons. So what is it going to take to do it? Well, the Congress, \nunderstanding that we had to get about this, in the last Defense bill \nput in a requirement that the President prepare a plan. It is named \nafter the section of the bill, which was 1251. That section of the bill \nnow is the nomenclature for the plan, the 1251 plan for modernizing our \nforces.\n  This followed a speech Secretary Gates made. Let me quote from the \nspeech and then get into a little bit of the detail here. He said:\n\n       To be blunt, there is absolutely no way we can maintain a \n     credible deterrent and reduce the number of weapons in our \n     stockpile without either resorting to testing our stockpile \n     or pursuing a modernization program.\n\n  That was pretty much the genesis, that and the so-called Perry-\nSchlesinger Commission, which ran the red flag up the flagpole to get \nthis program moving. So in fiscal year 2010, the Obama administration \ndevoted $6.4 billion to nuclear weapon activities, but it has \nacknowledged that that is a loss of purchasing power of about 20 \npercent, from 2005--this is by the administration's own calculations. \nSo we knew from the very beginning there was not enough money in the \nplan to get the job done.\n  In December, a year ago, 41 Senators--this is before Scott Brown, I \nmight add, joined us--wrote a letter to the President stating:\n\n       Funding for such a modernization program beginning in \n     earnest in your FY 11 budget is needed as the U.S. considers \n     the further nuclear weapon reductions proposed in the START \n     follow-on negotiations.\n\n  To make a long story short, the administration had a 10-year plan in \nplace that was becoming pretty apparent would not be adequate. That 10-\nyear plan called for about $7 billion a year over 10 years, to \nbasically operate the facilities. I have said, it is like the money to \nkeep the lights on, but not money for this new modernization of our \nnuclear warheads or most of it would not have gone to that.\n  They realized they needed about $10 billion, at least according to \ntheir initial calculations. They got about half of that from the \nDefense Department, the other half they figured they would get from \nsavings from recalculating interest costs in the latter years of the \nbudget. So they added a $10 billion slug onto the $70 billion that was \nalready budgeted for general operation of the system, and said that is \nour $80 billion modernization program. But based upon work that had \ndone by laboratories earlier, by other study groups and so on, a lot of \nexperts agreed, including all of the former lab directors, that that \nslug of $10 billion would never be adequate for the costly items that \nneeded to be performed over the next decade. Most of us estimated it to \nbe about double that cost or about $20 billion. I think that is \nessentially where we are going to end up, by the way.\n  In any event, the two biggest drivers are two new buildings, \nfacilities that have to be built, one for plutonium work at Los Alamos \nLab in New Mexico, the other for uranium work at the so-called Y-12 \nplant at Oak Ridge, TN. Those two buildings alone could end up costing \nover $10 billion. As a result, as I said, we went to the administration \nand said, we appreciate this modernization plan, but you need to update \nthe plan and incorporate a lot of new costs.\n  We showed them a lot of areas in which there were deficiencies, \nincluding deferred maintenance that had to be performed. We even \npointed out there was a billion-dollar unfunded pension liability that \nwould have to be dealt with in order for the scientists to continue to \nwork. I will not go into the quotations here. Vice President Biden \nacknowledged the same thing in a statement he made. I appreciate the \nfact that, by the way, they complimented our work and our staff for \npointing out a lot of these things, which were the bases then for the \nadministration coming back and doing an update to the 1251 plan, which \nat least incorporated funding for some of the items we had talked \nabout.\n  There has been some talk about an additional $4.1 billion, and I know \nSenator Kerry will confirm this. It grates on me, and I am sure it does \non him as well, to hear people referring to this in negotiation terms: \nWell, they gave Kyl another $4.1 billion. That should be enough.\n  That is not the point here. This is an ongoing, evolving process. The \nadministration has also identified about another $2 billion likely to \nhave to be spent within 6 years, but they were only looking at a 5-year \nprocess, so that $4 billion pertains to 5 years. My guess is, there \nwill be another $6 billion over the last 5 years, and we will \nultimately look at about $20 billion, more or less.\n  The point is, I did not believe the administration had been \nsufficiently careful in defining the requirements and identifying the \namount of money that would be needed. I have said to many people, \nincluding my colleague Senator Kerry, we better not underestimate this \nfor the appropriations Members of Congress. We better let them know \nupfront, this is going to be pretty costly, and get that out on the \ntable.\n  To their credit, the administration has now put out new figures. As I \nwill discuss in more detail later, but to summarize here, while that is \na big step forward and very welcome, and I will support it all, there \nare other things that need to be done. One of the biggest concerns I \nhave is that it achieves this objective in part by simply extending the \ndate to complete these two big facilities I mentioned by another 2 \nyears. They would not be complete until 2023 for one and 2024 for the \nother one.\n  That has the advantage of getting them outside the 10-year budget \nwindow, so you do not count any new money, but it extends the time by \nwhich these facilities can be done. And every year we were told it is \nabout a $200 million expense to keep the existing facilities operating.\n  So we are losing a lot of money every year that we do not get these \ntwo new buildings constructed so we can move into them and get the \nmodernization done. That is the biggest concern I have. I will talk \nabout some others later.\n  But let me conclude here with a couple of quotations that I think \nillustrate the importance of doing what we need to do here.\n\n[[Page S10328]]\n\n  Tom D'Agostino, who is the Deputy NNSA Administrator said:\n\n       Our plans for investment in and modernization of the modern \n     security enterprise are essential, irrespective of whether or \n     not the START treaty is ratified.\n\n  He and I think all of us agree, it is even more important if we go \ndown to the lower numbers in the START treaty. But this is important \neither way. I note that former Energy Secretary Spence Abraham wrote a \ncolumn in Weekly Standard recently that made the same point, that \nregardless of what is done on the START treaty, this modernization \nneeds to move forward.\n  I made the point earlier about how the House Democrats conditioned \nthe funding on ratification of START. I hope in the comments that are \nmade on the floor here, it may be the subject of an--in fact, it \nprobably will be the subject of at least one amendment to the \nresolution of ratification. But this is a place where the debate we \nhave, the comments we make, may be as important as an amendment, \nbecause it is a statement of our intention as Senators. I think you \nwill find that republican Senators who support the START treaty, and I \nam sure Democratic Senators who support the START treaty, will all say, \none of the things that has to happen is the modernization of our \nfacilities, along the lines of this updated 1251 plan, and the \nstatements that the administration, as well as we, have made.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. I will yield.\n  Mr. KERRY. I want to compliment the Senator, and confirm on the \nrecord that Senator Kyl indeed brought to the attention of the \nadministration and to all of us several points which the laboratory \nchiefs agreed were in deficiency. And he is absolutely correct, that \nwhile it is not directly within the four corners of the treaty, the \nmodernization, per se, obviously if you contemplate reductions, you \nhave to also be able to understand you are maintaining the capacity of \nyour existing force. Senator Kyl has been diligent in pursuing that.\n  I also applaud the administration for responding, and I think he \nwould too, and acknowledging that. So he is correct, that I think this \npart of the record is an important one. We have met separately with \nSenator Inouye, with Senator Feinstein, and they have agreed with \nSenator Kyl, that they accept the need to continue down to the levels \nthat the administration has put on the table, and they are committed to \ndoing that.\n  That said, let me also place in the Record a letter from our three \nlaboratory leaders, Dr. George Miller at Lawrence Livermore, Dr. \nMichael Anastasio, who was just referred to at Los Alamos, and Dr. Paul \nHommert at Sandia. I will read the relevant portion. I will put the \nwhole thing in the Record. But here is what they say:\n\n       We are very pleased by the update to the Section 1251 \n     Report, as it would enable the laboratories to execute our \n     requirements for ensuring a safe, secure, reliable and \n     effective stockpile under the Stockpile Stewardship and \n     Management Plan. In particular, we are pleased because it \n     clearly responds to many of the concerns that we and others \n     have voiced in the past about potential future-year funding \n     shortfalls, and it substantially reduces risks to the overall \n     program. We believe that, if enacted, the added funding \n     outlined in the Section 1251 Report update--for enhanced \n     surveillance, pensions, facility construction and Readiness \n     in Technical Base and Facilities among other programs--would \n     establish a workable funding level for a balanced program \n     that sustains the science, technology and engineering base. \n     In summary, we believe the proposed budgets provided adequate \n     support to sustain the safety, security, reliability and \n     effectiveness of America's nuclear deterrent within the limit \n     of 1,550 deployed strategic warheads established by the new \n     START Treaty with adequate confidence and acceptable risk.\n\n  I think it is very important to sort of do that. I would think we \nhave adequately addressed it, because there is also language in the \nresolution of ratification that embraces the modernization component. \nSo I thank the Senator from Arizona. I think that has been a \nconstructive component to helping us to be in a position to be able to \nratify the treaty.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I appreciate my colleague's comments. \nRather than read the remainder of this, I ask unanimous consent that at \nthe conclusion of my remarks here there will be additional quotations \non the need for modernization by former lab directors Dr. Miller, \nSecretary Schlesinger, and several others.\n  I would conclude by emphasizing what the lab directors also \nemphasized in this correspondence. ``As we emphasized in our \ntestimonies, implementation of the future vision of the nuclear \ndeterrent will require sustained attention and continued refinement.''\n  The outyears are very important. That is why the record we create in \nthis debate is important to ensuring that those who come after us will \nappreciate our intentions as we move forward here that we never again \ntake our eye off the ball and allow the deterioration in our nuclear \nforces to occur, as we have, so we can continue to support them as \ncalled for in this modernization plan. I will ask unanimous consent to \nhave those printed in the Record at this point, and then make the \nremainder of the statement at another time when I have not taken up all \nof my colleagues' time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Additional Quotes on Modernization\n\n       Former laboratory directors: ``However, we believe there \n     are serious shortfalls in stockpile surveillance activities, \n     personnel, infrastructure, and the basic sciences necessary \n     to recover from the successive budget reductions of the last \n     five years.'' \\47\\\n       Dr. Michael Anastasio: ``I fear that some may perceive that \n     the FY11 budget request meets all of the necessary \n     commitments for the program . . . I am concerned that in the \n     Administration's Section 1251 report, much of the planned \n     funding increase for Weapons Activities do not come to \n     fruition until the second half of the ten year period.'' \\48\\\n       Dr. George Miller: ``In my opinion, there is no `fat' in \n     the program of work that has been planned and, in fact, \n     significant risks exist; therefore, there is no room for \n     error.'' \\49\\\n       Secretary Schlesinger: ``I believe that it is immensely \n     important for the Senate to ensure, what the Administration \n     has stated as its intent, i.e., that there be a robust plan \n     with a continuation of its support over the full ten years, \n     before it proceeds to ratify this START follow on treaty.'' \n     \\50\\\n       Secretary Baker: ``Because our security is based upon the \n     safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons, it is \n     important that our government budget enough money to \n     guarantee that those weapons can carry out their mission.'' \n     \\51\\\n       Secretary Kissinger: ``As part of a number of \n     recommendations, my colleagues, Bill Perry, George Shultz, \n     Sam Nunn, and I have called for significant investment in a \n     repaired and modernized nuclear weapons infrastructure and \n     added resources for the three national laboratories.'' \\52\\\n       Under Secretary Joseph: ``New START must be assessed in the \n     context of a robust commitment to maintain the necessary \n     nuclear offensive capabilities required to meet today's \n     threats and those that may emerge . . . This is a long-term \n     commitment, not a one-year budget bump-up.'' \\53\\\n       Under Secretary Edelman: ``a modernized nuclear force is \n     going to be essential to that.

Madam President, I thank the Senator from Arizona. I look \nforward with anticipation to when he returns to the floor with an \namendment. We look forward to moving on that. I also regret that he \nwill not be here, because I would like to be able to answer some of the \nconcerns he raised, because I think there are answers to them. I think \nit is important obviously for that part of the record.\n  Some of the questions that were raised were questions about \nverification. I will not take a long time, because I know the Senator \nfrom Nebraska and the Senator from Georgia are waiting to speak. In a \nletter from the Secretary of Defense to us regarding this issue of \nverification--and we may well have a closed session where we will \ndiscuss that to some degree. But in the letter, Secretary Gates writes \nto me, and, through me, to the Senate, saying:\n\n       The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Joint \n     Chiefs, the Commander, U.S. Strategic Command, and I assess \n     that Russia will not be able to achieve militarily \n     significant cheating or breakout under New START, due to both \n     the New START verification regime and the inherent \n     survivability and flexibility of the planned U.S. Strategic \n     force structure.\n\n  They have confidence in this verification regime. We need to have \nconfidence in the leadership of our military, national security \nagencies, the intelligence agencies, and the strategic command, all of \nwhom are confident we have the capacity to verify under this treaty.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that printed in the Record.\n                                         The Secretary of Defense,\n\n\n                                                     Pentagon,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, Jul 30, 2010.\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: (U) As the Senate considers the New \n     Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) with Russia, I \n     would like to share the Department's assessment of the \n     military significance of potential Russian cheating or \n     breakout, based on the recent National Intelligence Estimate \n     (NIE) on monitoring the Treaty. As you know, a key criterion \n     in evaluating whether the Treaty is effectively verifiable is \n     whether the U.S. would be able to detect, and respond to, any \n     Russian attempt to move beyond the Treaty's limits in a way \n     that has military significance, well before such an attempt \n     threatened U.S. national security.\n       (U) The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Joint \n     Chiefs, the Commander, U.S. Strategic Command, and I assess \n     that Russia will not be able to achieve militarily \n     significant cheating or breakout under New START, due to both \n     the New START verification regime and the inherent \n     survivability and flexibility of the planned U.S. strategic \n     force structure. Additional Russian warheads above the New \n     START limits would have little or no effect on the U.S. \n     assured second-strike capabilities that underwrite stable \n     deterrence. U.S. strategic submarines (SSBNs) at sea, and any \n     alert heavy bombers will remain survivable irrespective of \n     the numbers of Russian warheads, and the survivability of \n     U.S. inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) would be \n     affected only marginally by additional warheads provided by \n     any Russian cheating or breakout scenario.\n       (U) If Russia were to attempt to gain political advantage \n     by cheating or breakout, the U.S. will be able to respond \n     rapidly by increasing the alert levels of SSBNs and bombers, \n     and by uploading warheads on SSBNs, bombers, and ICBMs. \n     Therefore, the survivable and flexible U.S. strategic posture \n     planned for New START will help deter any future Russian \n     leaders from cheating or breakout from the Treaty, should \n     they ever have such an inclination.\n       (U) This assessment does not mean that Russian compliance \n     with the New START Treaty is unimportant. The U.S. expects \n     Russia to fully abide by the Treaty, and the U.S. will use \n     all elements of the verification regime to ensure this is the \n     case. Any Russian cheating could affect the sustainability of \n     the New START Treaty, the viability of future arms control \n     agreements, and the ability of the U.S. and Russia to work \n     together on other issues. Should there be any signs of \n     Russian cheating or preparations to breakout from the Treaty, \n     the Executive branch would immediately raise this matter \n     through diplomatic channels, and if not resolved, raise it \n     immediately to higher levels. We would also keep the Senate \n     informed.\n       (U) Throughout my testimony on this Treaty, I have \n     highlighted the Treaty's verification regime as one of its \n     most important contributions. Our analysis of the NIE and the \n     potential for Russian cheating or breakout confirms that the \n     Treaty's verification regime is effective, and that our \n     national security is stronger with this Treaty than without \n     it. I look forward to the Senate's final advice and consent \n     of this important Treaty.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert M. Gates.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. One last quick comment. Senator Kyl knows these materials \nvery well. He is an effective advocate for a point of view. But that \ndoes not mean that by saying those things, all of them have a factual \nunderpinning or that they are, in fact, the best judgment as to what \nour military thinks or the national intelligence community thinks about \nthe components of this treaty. Let me give an example. Senator Kyl has \nraised concerns about the conventional prompt global strike capacity. \nWhat he didn't say is, Russia very much wanted to ban strategic range \nconventional weapons systems altogether. We rejected that approach. The \nObama administration said: No; we are not going to ban all conventional \ncapacity. In effect, they decided to proceed along the same approach we \nused in START I.\n  Ted Warner, the representative of the Secretary of Defense to the \nnegotiation, testified in the Foreign Relations Committee, saying we \nagreed to a regime whereby conventionally armed ICBMs or SLBMs--for the \nfolks who don't follow this, those are the intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles or submarine-launched ballistic missiles--would be permitted. \nBut, yes, they did agree to count them under the strategic delivery \nvehicle and strategic warhead ceilings. Senator Kyl sees that as a \nproblem. All of our folks who negotiated this treaty and our military \nand our strategic thinkers see that as an advantage for the United \nStates. That protects us. We are better off that way. Why? Because it \nwould be extraordinarily difficult to verify compliance with a treaty \nthat limited nuclear-tipped ICBMs and SLBMs but didn't count and, \ntherefore, didn't inspect identical conventionally armed ICBMs and \nSLBMs. We couldn't tell the difference between them. We would be \nabsolutely foolish on our part to allow the Russians to deploy \nadditional ICBMs and SLBMs based exclusively on their assurance that \nthey are not nuclear armed. How would we know? It is only by putting \nthem under the counting that we, in fact, protect the interests of our \ncountry rather than creating a whole sidebar arms race which would make \neverybody less safe. Not counting those missiles would, in fact, create \na new risk--the risk of breakout, that we allow the other side, Russia, \nthe opportunity, even if there were no cheating, to simply leave the \ntreaty and arm those missiles with nuclear warheads on very short \nnotice, and we would all be worse off.\n  In fact, what Senator Kyl was complaining about is something that \nmakes us more stable. If we did what he is sort of hinting he might \nlike to do, we could actually create greater instability, and it would \nbe clearly much more likely to kill the treaty altogether.\n  Some of these things get raised and they sound like there is \nreasonableness to them. But when we put them in the overall context of \nstrategic analysis and thinking and the balance, the sort of threat \nanalysis that attaches to any treaty of this sort, what we are trying \nto work through is sort of reaching an equilibrium between both sides' \nperceptions of the other side's capacity and of what kind of threat \nthat exposes each side to. That is how we sort of arrive at that \nequilibrium. That is what has driven every arms control agreement since \ntheir inception. The Pentagon has made very clear that the global \nprompt strike is going to be developed, but it is going to be developed \nas a niche capacity. They think it is too expensive to do in huge \nnumbers. It is\n\n[[Page S10330]]\n\nalso very clear that under the best circumstances, it is going to be a \nlong time before that is ready to deploy.\n  We have boost-glide vehicles still in the proof-of-concept test \nstage. Nobody has any imagination as to whether they will be ready in \n10 or 15 years. The life of this treaty is 10 years. So we are looking \nbeyond the life of the treaty for when they might or might not be \nready. There are a host of other concepts out there about this. We are \ngoing to get a report from the Pentagon next year on what technologies \nthey think are most promising. It is going to be exceedingly difficult \nto imagine bringing them online within the 10-year life of this treaty. \nAny concept of sort of revising things that make this treaty subject to \nsome component of that is, in effect, a guise to try to kill the \ntreaty. I say that about this one component of it. There are many \nothers, many other similar kinds of arguments raised in the last hour. \nAs we go forward, if an amendment arises, we will deal with each of \nthem.\n  I want colleagues to be aware there is more underneath some of these \nred herrings than may appear to the eye at first blush.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. May I inquire if there is a scheduled recess at 12:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not under that order.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I was on the floor last night and \naddressed my significant concerns with the omnibus and the dual-track \nprocess we are on right now. That statement has been made. I come this \nmorning to address the START treaty, the New START treaty. I voted for \nit to come out of the Foreign Relations Committee to the floor. I want \nto go through my reasons for having done so. I wanted to talk about \nwhat the New START treaty is, not what it is not.\n  First, I want to pay tribute to Dick Lugar. He has been a bastion of \nstrength on nuclear proliferation and nonproliferation issues for \nyears. I thank Senator Kerry for the time he gave us to go through hour \nafter hour after hour of hearings and hour after hour after hour of \nsecure briefing in the bowels of the new Visitor Center, where we read \nthe summary of the notes of negotiations on the treaty, where we read \nthe threat initiative and the estimate of the terrorism threat \ninitiative and all the classified documentation about which we cannot \nspeak on this floor. These things are critical to our consideration as \nwe debate this treaty.\n  I wish to talk about two Senators, one a Democrat and one a \nRepublican. With all due respect to the chairman, it is not he. It is a \nDemocrat by the same of Sam Nunn from Georgia, who chaired the Armed \nServices Committee, who, along with Senator Lugar, put together Nunn-\nLugar and the cooperative threat initiative. I sought out Senator Nunn \nand Senator Lugar in my deliberations during the committee debate and \nmy consideration of what I would do in terms of that committee vote and \nlater a vote on the floor. I wish to make a couple notes about the \nsuccess of the Nunn-Lugar initiative. Nunn-Lugar is a commitment to see \nto it that nuclear materials are secure. It is a commitment to see to \nit that loose nukes around the world don't fall in the hands of those \nwho would kill my grandchildren, your grandchildren or all of us in the \nUnited States. I don't think it has been mentioned, but as a result of \nthe Nunn-Lugar initiative, since 1991, since its formation, they have \nreduced the number of loose nukes in the world by 7,599.\n  Belarus, the Ukraine, Kazakhstan no longer have nuclear arsenals. \nThrough that comprehensive threat initiative, they have destroyed the \nweapons, and they have turned weapons of mass destruction into \nplowshares that are powering powerplants. The nuclear threat initiative \ndoes not mean we get out of the business of having a nuclear arsenal. \nIt means we get in the business of security for the nukes that are \nthere and establish goals toward nonproliferation which to all of us is \ncritically important.\n  My history as far as this goes back to the 1950s. It goes back to Ms. \nHamberger's first grade class, when I remember getting under the school \ndesk once a week to practice what we would do if a nuclear attack hit \nthe United States. My history with this goes back to October of 1962 \nwhen, as a freshman at the University of Georgia, I stood in fear with \nall my colleagues and watched what was happening in Cuba, watched the \nblockade, watched the strength of John Kennedy, who faced the Russians \ndown and ultimately prevented what would have been a nuclear strike \nagainst the United States and ultimately our strike against them in \nCuba as well as in Russia.\n  Then I remember the night in October of 1986, when I had the honor to \nintroduce Ronald Reagan in Atlanta the night before he flew to Iceland \nto begin negotiations on nuclear treaties at that time. In one speech \nmade today, it has been referenced that Reagan rejected what Gorbachev \noffered at Reykjavik. That is correct. Reagan rejected not doing \nresearch and development and building a nuclear arsenal. But what he \ndid insist on was verification of what both countries were doing so we \ncould never have a situation of not having transparency, not having \nintelligence, and not knowing what the right and left hand were doing. \nIt was out of that rejection and at his insistence that the beginning \nof the negotiations for the START treaty began. They were ultimately \nsigned in 1991, under the administration of George H.W. Bush.\n\n  Until December 5 of last year, that START treaty had been in place. \nFor those years, the United States had transparency. It had \nverification. It had cooperative communication back and forth between \nthe two countries that controlled 90 percent of the nuclear weapons in \nthe world. My history with this goes all the way back to climbing under \na school desk, to introducing President Ronald Reagan, to 1 year \nserving on the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate.\n  My decision to support the treaty coming out of the committee were \nbased on four principles. The first is inspections. It has been said \nthe inspections have been reduced. What has not been said is the number \nof sites to inspect have also been greatly reduced. The number of \ninspections correspond with what is necessary to inspect the Russian \narsenal and know whether they are complying with the treaty. \nInspections are very important. We learned on 9/11 what happens when we \ndon't have human intelligence on the ground where we need it. What \nhappens is we get surprised. What happened to us on 9/11 is almost \n3,000 citizens died at the hands of a heinous attack by radical \nterrorists because we didn't have as good intelligence as we needed to \nhave. That is why I don't want to turn my back on the opportunity to \nhave human intelligence on the ground in the Russian Federation \nverifying that they are complying with a mutual pact we have made with \nthem and, correspondingly, the transparency they have to inspect our \nnuclear arsenal in the United States.\n  The second point I wish to make that caused me to come to the \nconclusion it was the right thing to do to support the treaty in \ncommittee was the verification process. I have heard some people say \nthis verification process is not as good as the old verification \nprocess. I am not going to get into that argument, but this \nverification process is a heck of a lot better than no verification \nprocess at all, which is exactly what we have today.\n  Since December 5 of last year, we haven't had the human intelligence. \nWe couldn't verify. Verification is critically important because with \nverification comes communication. With communication comes \nunderstanding, and from that understanding and communication comes \nintelligence. While our inspections are to make sure the quantity of \nthe nuclear arsenal and the warheads and the delivery systems are \nwithin compliance, it also gives us interaction to learn what others \nmay know about nuclear weapons around the world that are not covered by \nthis treaty.\n  That brings me to one other point. It has been said by some that \nbilateral treaties are no longer useful in terms of nuclear power; we \nneed multilateral treaties. I have to ask this question: If we reject \nthe one bilateral treaty over nuclear power, how will we ever get to a \nmultilateral treaty? We will not do it. I think it is important to have \na bilateral treaty between the two countries that controls 90 percent \nof the weapons so we see to it, as other countries gain nuclear power, \nwe can bring\n\n[[Page S10331]]\n\nthem into a regimen that requires transparency and accountability \ntoo. You will never be able to do that if you reject it between \nyourself and the Russian Federation.\n\n  Now, the third thing I want to talk about for a second--I mentioned \nSenator Nunn before. He served as Armed Services chairman, and so did \nJohn Warner, who is a distinguish retired Republican Member of this \nSenate. They released a joint statement not too long ago and raised a \npoint I had not thought of. If you will beg my doing this, I will read \non the floor of the Senate one of the points they made that was \nsupportive of this treaty. I quote from Senator Nunn and Senator \nWarner:\n\n     . . . Washington and Moscow should expand use of existing \n     Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers--which we--\n\n  Meaning Warner and Nunn--\n\n       and other members of Congress--\n\n  Meaning Dick Lugar--\n\n     established with President Ronald Reagan to further reduce \n     nuclear threats.\n       For example, to improve both nations' early warning \n     capabilities, the centers could exchange data on global \n     missile launchers. Other nations could be integrated into \n     this system. It could provide the basis for a joint \n     initiative involving Russia, the United States and the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization on a missile defense \n     architecture for Europe that would help address other key \n     issues, like tactical nuclear weapons vulnerable to theft by \n     terrorists. Indeed, when the centers were proposed, they were \n     envisioned to help prevent catastrophic nuclear terrorism. \n     These initiatives can go forward with a New START Treaty.\n\n  I thought that observation was very telling and looking prospectively \ninto the future about, again, having the two nations--the Russian \nFederation and the United States--bring in other people, such as NATO, \nto be a part of a treaty and a missile defense system that is agreeable \nwith all parties. The absence of negotiation, the absence of \ntransparency, the absence of cooperation ensures that cannot happen.\n  My fourth point is this: The thing I fear the most as a citizen, the \nthing I fear the most as a Senator, and the thing I fear the most, \nquite frankly, as the father of three and grandfather of nine is a \nnuclear fissionable material getting into the hands of a radical \nterrorist. That is the fear that all of us dread.\n  It is critical, when we look at what the Nunn-Lugar initiative has \ndone in the destruction of loose nukes--7,599--what the original START \ntreaty, the foundation it gave us, to begin to reduce nuclear weapon \nproliferation without reducing our ability to defend ourselves and to \nlaunch strikes that are necessary to protect the people of the United \nStates of America.\n  But I worry about one of the radical terrorists getting hold of one \nof these materials, and I fear in the absence of transparency, \nverification, and inspection, we run the risk, unwittingly, of playing \ninto their hands and making that type of a material more and more \navailable.\n  What is known as the Lugar Doctrine is very important to understand \nat this stage of the debate. In doing my research on the treaty, and \nthe work that Dick Lugar and others have done on nonproliferation, I \ncame upon what is known as the Lugar Doctrine. I would like to read it \nbecause it answers the question I just raised about a loose nuke \ngetting into the hands of a rogue terrorist:\n\n       Every nation that has weapons and materials of mass \n     destruction must account for what it has, spend its own money \n     or obtain international technical and financial resources to \n     safely secure what it has, and pledge that no other nation, \n     cell, or cause will be allowed access or use.\n\n  That is as clearly and as succinctly as you can state the future fear \nthat all of us have for this country and what might happen with nuclear \nweapons.\n  So in closing my remarks, I went through interviews with Sam Nunn, \nlistened to the chairman and the ranking member, listened to the \ntestimony, Ms. Gottemoeller, and all the others, read the \ndocumentation, which everybody else can read in the secure briefing \nroom, and I came to the conclusion that verification is better than no \nverification at all; that inspections and transparency are what \nprohibit things like what happened on 9/11 from ever happening again, \nand that you can never expect multilateral negotiations with other \ncountries that have some degree of nuclear power if the two greatest \npowers refuse to sit down and negotiate and extend the understanding \nthey have had since 1991.\n  Only through setting the example, without giving in or capitulating a \nthing, do we hopefully give hope to the future that my grandchildren \nand yours can live in a world that will not be free of nukes but will \nbe secure; that loose nukes are not in the hands of bad people; and we \nhave transparency and accountability while still having the capability \nto defend ourselves and execute the security of the people of the \nUnited States of America.\n  It is for those reasons I supported the New START treaty in the \ncommittee, and I submit it for the consideration of the Members of the \nSenate.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I rise to discuss the New \nSTART treaty. In the last 40 years, our country has participated in \nnumerous arms control and nonproliferation efforts. They are a critical \nelement of our national security strategy.\n  If done right, arms control agreements can enhance U.S. national \nsecurity by promoting transparency and information--sharing that can \ninform us about the size, makeup, and operations of other military \nforces.\n  They also provide other countries with information about our force \nand capabilities, and that promotes a strategic balance and discourages \nan attack on the U.S. or its allies.\n  Transparency and information sharing enable our military planners to \nbetter prepare for a real threat. Without such agreements and \nunderstandings, our military and the military of countries like Russia \nmust prepare for worst-case scenarios.\n  That leads to inefficient, runaway defense spending. If that sounds \nfamiliar, that is because we have been down that road before--it was \ncalled the arms race.\n  The U.S. and the former Soviet Union poured massive resources into \nbuilding not only vast stockpiles of nuclear weapons, but also on the \nexpansive systems needed to defend against incoming bombers and \nmissiles.\n  Since the late 1960s, arms control agreements and other measures have \nworked to reduce nuclear forces and systems that support them.\n  I would note that former President Ronald Reagan, who accelerated \nnuclear modernization and launched the Star Wars missile defense \neffort, overcame his initial distaste for arms control agreements. \nWorking with Soviet Premier Gorbachev, Reagan laid the foundation for \ntoday's START treaty.\n  In July 1991, Presidents Bush and Gorbachev signed the START I treaty \nand the Senate later approved it on an overwhelming and bipartisan vote \nof 93 to 6--a vote which concluded after 4 days of floor debate. \nNebraska's Senators at the time, Jim Exon and Bob Kerrey both supported \nthe START 1 treaty.\n  As we consider New START, it is our constitutional duty to address \ntoday's concerns and the treaty's merits.\n  Now I have heard five main concerns during debate.\n  They are: No. 1, treaty limitations on missile defense; No. 2, \nsufficiency of modernization plans for nuclear enterprise; No. 3, \nadequacy of treaty verification measures; No. 4, force structure \nchanges resulting from treaty reductions; No. 5, and the timing of the \nSenate's deliberations of the treaty.\n  First, the New START treaty won't affect any current or planned U.S. \nmissile defense efforts. Some point to language in the treaty's \npreamble and the inclusion of unilateral statements. But they are not \nlegally binding. And changing the preamble would unravel the treaty.\n  The only binding restriction on missile defense systems arises in \narticle V. It prevents conversion of ICBM silos into missile defense \nlaunchers. That has no practical effect because converting silos is \nmore expensive and less desirable than building new silos.\n  Second, some have questioned the administration's commitment to \nmodernize our nuclear facilities and forces. As the chairman of the \nArmed Services' Strategic Forces Subcommittee, I held three hearings \nthis year addressing the health of our nuclear weapons complex.\n  I would note that the administration asked for $7 billion in Fiscal \nYear 2011\n\n[[Page S10332]]\n\nfor stockpile sustainment and infrastructure investments.\n  That is roughly 10 percent more than 2010 funding.\n  The administration also plans to invest $80 billion in the next \ndecade to sustain and modernize the nuclear weapons complex. That is \nthe biggest commitment to the nuclear enterprise in more than a decade. \nOn top of that, the administration recently offered an additional $4 \nbillion toward modernization goals.\n  Third, some argue that verification measures are less rigorous than \nfor START I.\n  Its verification measures expired last December. So, as of today, we \nhave gone 376 days without onsite monitoring and verification in \nRussia.\n  The less we are allowed to see for ourselves the more uncertainty we \nwill feel about Russian forces.\n  New START includes verification measures allowing 18 onsite \ninspections annually. We determine where and when to go, with very \nlittle advance notice to the Russians.\n  As many of you know, this treaty counts every warhead and delivery \nsystem and tracks them with unique identifiers. That is a tremendous \nadvancement in transparency over the previous system of attribution. \nAnd it certainly is better than no verification system, which exists at \nthe present time.\n  Fourth, some express concern about the treaty's impact on the nuclear \ntriad--our strategic bombers, missiles, and ballistic missile \nsubmarines.\n  In testimony and in direct conversations with me, our military \nleaders have assured that the New START retains the triad.\n  Proposed reductions by the Pentagon aim to spread across all systems \nand minimize impacts to any one system or base, thus retaining a safe, \nsecure, and effective triad.\n\n  Finally, some indicate that considering New START now prevents the \nSenate from spending adequate time to consider the treaty, or that we \nwould be rushing judgment on the treaty.\n  New START was signed in April of this year, and the Senate has had it \nfor consideration since May.\n  Together, the Foreign Relations, Intelligence, and Armed Services \nCommittees have held 21 hearings and briefings related to the treaty. \nThe truth is that the Senate has been actively deliberating New START \nfor 7 months.\n  By comparison the 2002 Moscow Treaty took 9 months to complete and \nSTART I took a little more than a year. When it came to floor debate, \nthe 1991 START I treaty required 4 days of debate, while START II, the \nChemical Weapons Convention and the 2002 Moscow Treaty each took 2 \ndays.\n  I am confident that the Senate has fulfilled its responsibility to \nfully consider and deliberate on New START, and our actions are \nentirely consistent with the past actions of this body in considering \nprevious arms control agreements.\n  Those are concerns that have been raised. Now let's look now at the \nmerits.\n  In recent months, I have spoken about this treaty with key military \nleaders including Secretary Gates, Admiral Mullen, General Cartwright, \nand General Chilton.\n  Each has expressed full support and participation in this treaty. \nThey also fully support the proposed reductions to the nuclear arsenal \nand the continued sustainment of the nuclear triad.\n  In addition, Secretary Clinton and every living former Secretary of \nState--nine in total--have all publically voiced their support. Five \nformer Secretaries of Defense on both sides of the aisle have endorsed \nthe treaty. Seven former Strategic Command commanders have endorsed the \ntreaty. STRATCOM, headquartered in my State in Omaha, NE, in the \nBellevue area, oversees America's strategic nuclear, nonnuclear and \ncyber defenses.\n  Also, it is important, I believe, that the U.S. Strategic Command \nactively played a key role in negotiating the treaty. With that \nexperience, the former STRATCOM commander in chief General Chilton who \nis recently departed, said:\n\n       Our nation will be safer and more secure with this treaty \n     than without it. What we negotiated to is absolutely \n     acceptable to the United States Strategic Command for what we \n     need to do to provide the deterrent for the country.\n\n  I wholeheartedly agree.\n  I am prepared to vote to ratify the New START Treaty because it \npromotes our national security and can make America and the world \nsafer. It increases transparency between nuclear nations. It promotes \ncooperation and not suspicion. And it reduces the possibility of a \nnuclear exchange and still enables America to respond to the terrible \nthreats that continue in the nuclear age.\n  I would like to elaborate.\n  America will be stronger if we can continue to look under Russia's \nhood, and they under ours. Trust but verify still works.\n  This treaty will help U.S. Strategic Command accomplish its \nabsolutely vital mission for our Nation.\n  Further, as the chairman of the U.S. Senate--Russia \nInterparliamentary Group, I have held many meetings with my Russian \ncounterparts about this treaty. It is a step in the right direction to \nencourage further cooperation between the U.S. and Russia. As we work \ntoward cooperation, the treaty reestablishes verification measures and \nincreases transparency considerably.\n  That will reduce uncertainty about Russian forces, and increase their \npredictability. Without this treaty, our understanding of Russian \nnuclear forces will continue to deteriorate.\n  We would have a tendency for U.S. forces to overcompensate for what \nwe don't know.\n  That is a losing strategy in an era of large budget deficits and \nneeded fiscal constraint. Entering into this treaty demonstrates our \ncommitment to modernizing the nuclear stockpile by making the most of \nwhat we have to spend and to keep our country safe.\n  The New START treaty offers the possibility of providing our military \nwith insights needed to efficiently and successfully provide a safe, \nreliable, and secure nuclear deterrent.\n  At the end of the day, the New START treaty builds on successes from \nprevious treaties, and paves the way for further bilateral agreements \nbetween the United States and Russia.\n  It moves us further away from a nuclear war no one wants. Even as it \ndoes, we will retain a powerful and effective deterrent capability.\n  And finally, ratification also will send a strong message to those \naround the world opposed to proliferation and those seeking to \nproliferate.\n  For these reasons, I support the New START treaty and I believe the \nSenate should ratify it as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I would like to speak briefly on the \nNew START treaty and state the reasons I believe the Senate should go \nahead and ratify this treaty.\n  Let me highlight some key points on, first, what the treaty \naccomplishes. Let me mention four things.\n  No. 1, it reduces the number of deployed nuclear warheads by a \nrelatively small number; that is, it takes us from 2,200, which is what \nwe were required to reduce to under the Moscow Treaty, down to 1,550.\n  Second, its counting regime is not based on attributing a number of \nwarheads to a launch system but, instead, like the 2002 Moscow Treaty, \nthis treaty actually requires the counting of deployed warheads.\n  Third, this treaty reestablishes a verification regime of inspectors \non the ground. This is something which lapsed a year ago when START I \nlapsed.\n  Fourth, this treaty still maintains a credible nuclear deterrent \nagainst Russia, against China, against anyone who might threaten our \ncountry.\n  Before discussing some of these points in detail, let me put the New \nSTART treaty in some historical perspective, at least as I see it.\n  As this chart graphically demonstrates, at the peak of the Cold War \nsome 30 years ago there were about 60,000 nuclear warheads. That is \nclearly an astounding number given that a single warhead would destroy \nmost major American cities and most major cities anywhere in the world.\n  From 1991, when the first START treaty was signed, until 2002 when \nthe Moscow Treaty was signed, the number of warheads declined \ndramatically from about 50,000 to a little over 20,000, or about 10,000 \nfor the United States and 10,000 for Russia. This includes spare and \ndeployed warheads not just those that were deployed. The Moscow\n\n[[Page S10333]]\n\nTreaty took this count further down and allowed 2,200 to 1,700 deployed \nwarheads. Additional spares of about 3,300 were included, and the \nnumber rises to somewhere between 5,500 and down to 5,000 warheads for \neach nation. If the New START treaty is ratified as shown on this \nchart, down here where this arrow is in the right-hand bottom corner, \nin 2010, it will take the number of deployed warheads to 1,550 from the \nMoscow lower limit of 1,700 that was in the Moscow Treaty. That is a \nvery modest reduction compared to what has been done in previous arms \ncontrol agreements.\n\n  After the Cold War ended 20 years ago, it was clear we had an \nastounding and excessive number of nuclear weapons. I believe it was \nthe hope and the expectation of most Americans that there would be deep \nreductions in nuclear weapons at that time. That reduction, in my view, \nhas been slow in coming. Our government has declassified the number of \nnuclear warheads we have in our active stockpile, and that number is \n5,113. If asked directly, I believe most Americans would be surprised \nto know at the end of 2010 we still have over 5,000 nuclear warheads, \nand we have 2,200 that are deployed.\n  Today we have a treaty before us that achieves a modest reduction \nfrom the Moscow level of 2,200 deployed warheads. As I indicated \nbefore, this treaty will take us down to 1,550. Quite frankly, I am \nsurprised some are arguing for having a drawn-out debate over the \ntreaty. START I took about 4 days of floor debate and lowered the \nnumber of warheads between Russia and the United States from about \n50,000 to 20,000, a 60-percent reduction. The Moscow Treaty lowered the \ntotal number of U.S. warheads from about 11,000 to today's level of \nabout 5,000. That took 2 days to debate. That involved a 55-percent \nreduction. Yet with a relatively modest reduction called for in this \ntreaty, we still have people proposing a floor debate that could extend \ninto the next Congress.\n  Let me turn to a number of substantive issues associated with the New \nSTART treaty that I believe weigh in favor of its ratification by the \nSenate. First, we have been briefed by the military commanders about \nthe 1,550 deployed warheads that will still be in place once this \ntreaty is approved. This total is comprised of about 700 deployed ICBMs \nand SLBMs and about 800 total heavy bombers and launchers.\n  I urge my colleagues to obtain the classified briefing on the treaty. \nI believe it is clear the commander of the U.S. Strategic Command has \nanalyzed in detail the strategic nuclear force structure of each side \nunder this treaty and is confident we can maintain our deterrence \nagainst Russia and China, who hold 96 percent of the world's strategic \nnuclear warheads.\n  The resolution of approval as reported by the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee speaks to this issue, noting in condition 3 that \nbefore any reductions in deployed warheads are made below the current \nMoscow Treaty level, the President must notify Congress that such \nreductions are in the ``national security interests of the United \nStates.''\n  The second point is that the intelligence community has judged that \nwe are better off with this treaty and its inspection regime than we \nare without it. Monitoring and verification under START I, which has \nnow expired, was based on counting strategic launch systems and then \nattributing a number of warheads to each submarine, each airplane, each \nmissile. This counting rule overestimated the number of warheads \ncarried on U.S. strategic systems. The New START treaty is much more \nspecific than START I. It counts only the actual number of warheads \ncarried by each deployed missile. In fact, this is the same counting \nrule as in the Moscow Treaty which was developed by the prior \nadministration and subsequently approved in the Senate 95 to 0.\n  Moreover, under this treaty we have the ability to inspect on the \nground, with short notice, to determine whether uniquely coded \nlaunchers actually carry the declared numbers of warheads. Contrary to \nwhat some have claimed, short notice inspections of uniquely identified \nlaunchers combined with other intelligence assets give us a high \nprobability of detecting cheating such as uploading more warheads, \nwhich would take days to months for Russia to achieve.\n  Condition 2 of the resolution of approval out of the committee speaks \nto the monitoring issue by requiring the President to certify that our \nNational Technical Means or other intelligence assets, combined with \nour on-the-ground verification capability, is ``sufficient to effective \nmonitoring of Russian compliance with the provisions of the Treaty.''\n  Third, there is a larger policy issue of strategic stability. This \ntreaty provides a framework of transparency through inspections and \naccountability of warheads and launchers. If we are worried about \nunchecked growth of Russia's strategic nuclear forces, not now but 5 \nyears from now, it makes great sense to approve this treaty.\n  Many have criticized the treaty because it does not deal with \nRussia's numerical advantage and tactical nuclear weapons, such as \ngravity bombs or submarine launched cruise missiles. I would point out \nthat none of the previous nuclear arms control treaties have dealt with \ntactical nuclear weapons. While I agree we should have discussions with \nRussia on tactical nuclear weapons, we need this treaty to restart the \nprocess of negotiations if we are ever going to achieve the goal of \nreducing tactical nuclear weapons.\n  This treaty lays the groundwork for a subsequent negotiation to \naddress tactical nuclear weapons, many of which are deployed close to \nour NATO allies. If we cannot demonstrate we have the ability to enter \ninto binding obligations on strategic nuclear forces, which are the \nmost easily verifiable, how can we advance to the next step with Russia \non reducing their tactical nuclear weapons, which number in the \nthousands and which are the most easily concealed of the weapons?\n  The fourth point: Let me turn to the issue of modernization of our \nown nuclear arsenal. Despite our unsustainable budget deficit--and I \nnotice the Senator from Alabama is on the Senate floor today. He and I \nboth voted against the tax bill. I don't know all of his reasons. One \nof mine was the unsustainable deficits faced by this country today. But \ndespite these unsustainable budget deficits, this administration is \ncommitting an additional $14 billion over the next 10 years for a total \nof $84 billion to modernize our nuclear weapons enterprise to ensure \nthat as we draw that nuclear arsenal down, reduce the numbers in the \nnuclear arsenal under New START, we will be capable of maintaining \nthose weapons we do rely upon.\n  Now, this chart shows the 10-year projection for weapons stockpile \nand infrastructure funding, and my colleagues can see there is a very \nsubstantial commitment of funds by this administration to maintain the \nreliability of our stockpile.\n  The fifth point I wish to make is that concerns have been raised \nregarding the nonbinding Russian unilateral missile defense statement. \nThis is separate from the binding provisions of the treaty. This is a \nnonbinding statement that Russia made that considers the treaty \neffective only where there is, as they put it, ``no qualitative or \nquantitative buildup of the missile defense capabilities of the United \nStates of America.''\n  In testimony before the Armed Services Committee, Secretary of State \nClinton stated unequivocally the treaty does not constrain our missile \ndefense efforts. Secretary Clinton went on to say:\n\n       Russia has issued a unilateral statement expressing its \n     view. But we have not agreed to this view and we are not \n     bound by it. In fact, we have issued our own statement making \n     it clear that the United States intends to continue improving \n     and deploying effective missile defense.\n\n  In the same hearing, Secretary of Defense Gates said:\n\n       The treaty will not constrain the United States from \n     deploying the most effective missile defense possible, nor \n     impose additional costs or barriers on those defenses.\n\n  Secretary Gates then goes on to say in that hearing:\n\n       As the administration's Ballistic Missile Defense Review \n     and budget makes clear, the United States will continue to \n     improve our capability to defend ourselves, our deployed \n     forces and our allies and partners against ballistic missile \n     threats.\n\n  From a historical perspective I would note that similar unilateral \nstatements on missile defense were made by Russia in connection with \nSTART I and in connection with START II, both of which treaties were \napproved by the Congress.\n\n[[Page S10334]]\n\n  Consistent with the statements by Secretaries Clinton and Gates, the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee's resolution of approval contains an \nunderstanding included in the instrument of ratification that ``it is \nthe understanding that the New START Treaty does not impose any \nlimitations on the deployment of missile defenses other than the \nrequirement of paragraph 3, article V.''\n  That section of the treaty prohibits the use of existing ICBM and \nSLBM launchers for missile defense or the conversion of missile defense \nlaunchers for ICBMs except for those that have been converted before \nthe treaty was signed.\n  On the question of whether we should vote on ratification in this \nCongress or leave this to the next Congress to consider, some Senators \nclaim that we simply need more time and that other treaties have laid \nbefore the Congress for much longer periods. This is simply not the \ncase. Arms control treaties since the ABM Treaty in 1972 were either \ntaken up, debated and ratified within the same Congress or, in the \ncases of START II, the Moscow Treaty and the Chemical Weapons Treaty \nwere taken up, debated and approved within the Congress from which the \nForeign Relations Committee reported a resolution of approval. This \nhistorical precedent on the ratification of arms control treaties runs \ncounter to what some of my colleagues are advocating. It is this \ncongressional session of the Senate that received the treaty, held 21 \nhearings and briefings and submitted over 900 questions as part of the \nadvise and consent process and it should be this congressional session \nof the Senate that should finish the job.\n  Let me conclude with where I started on the New START treaty, it is a \nrelatively modest treaty in terms of reducing the number of nuclear \nwarheads. Our military commanders have analyzed the force structure \nunder the treaty and have concluded it maintains our nuclear deterrent \nand that it provides on the ground intelligence through verification \nthat the intelligence community believes we are better off with than \nwithout. Finally, it is clear that it does not impede our missile \ndefense programs.\n  In my opinion there is no credible argument that the ratification of \nthis treaty undermines our national security. I urge my colleagues to \nvote for the ratification of the New START treaty. I thank the chair \nand yield back any remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, as we begin consideration of the New \nSTART treaty, we must understand that the proposal is not made in a \nvacuum. In one sense, it is an important part of our Nation's strategic \npolicy. I have served as chairman, ranking member, and a member of the \nSubcommittee on Strategic Forces, subcommittee of the Armed Services \nCommittee, for 12 years in the Senate. Thus, on these matters of \nnuclear policy and missile defense that have been before us so many \ntimes, I have had a front-row seat on it.\n  Our President, whose work and proposals absolutely deserve fair and \njust consideration in the Senate, after appropriate debate, has stated \nthat this treaty is a critical part of his approach to strategic \nissues, repeatedly insisting that it is needed so the United States can \nset an example and show leadership in moving toward what he has often \nstated to be his goal--a nuclear-free world.\n  This treaty now comes at a time when our Nation is the world's only \nnuclear power. We are the only nuclear power to have no nuclear \nproduction facility ongoing at this time. It will have to be \nreconstituted. That has been a sore spot in this Congress for quite a \nnumber of years, but it has not happened.\n  For over a decade, the Senate's efforts to modernize our aging \nweapons stockpiles--which our scientists have told us are getting to a \npoint where they have to be fixed--have been blocked by House \nDemocrats, mostly, and some Republicans there. We have gotten bills out \nof the Senate to do this, but they have failed in the House. It has \nbeen an article of faith on the left in America and abroad on the \ninternational left that our goal must be to eliminate all nuclear \nweapons from the world. President Obama and his administration have \noften used that rhetoric. But our modernization capability hasn't been \nstarted, and that is a troubling situation. As Secretary Gates has said \nabout modernization, we cannot continue at this rate.\n  In 2008, I sponsored legislation to create a bipartisan commission of \nexperienced statesmen to do a study of our nuclear posture. The \nlegislation passed and the Commission on the Strategic Posture of the \nUnited States did its work. It was headed by Dr. William J. Perry and \nJames R. Schlesinger, a former Defense Secretary of this country--a \nDemocrat and Republican. They reached a consensus on a number of key \nissues. They concluded that we could reduce our nuclear stockpile more \nthan the current number, but that ``modernization is essential to the \nnonproliferation benefits derived from the extended deterrent.'' So \nthey said it was essential to have a modernization program.\n  I know a lot of the discussion has been ongoing about that. I do \nbelieve Senator Kyl has done an excellent job in raising this issue, \nand the administration responded positively in some regards. The \nCommission also, nicely, in diplomatic language, deflected the \nadministration's goal of zero nuclear weapons by saying:\n\n       It's clear that the goal of zero nuclear weapons is \n     extremely difficult to attain and would require a fundamental \n     transformation of the world political order.\n\n  I think that is about as close as you come from a bipartisan \ncommission expressing serious concerns about this policy. Meanwhile, \nChina, Russia, Pakistan, and India continue to expand their stockpile, \nwhile rogue, outlaw nations, such as North Korea and Iran, posing great \nrisk to world peace, advance their nuclear weapons programs.\n  We will need to talk about this more as this debate goes forward. It \nis quite clear that the greatest threat to world peace and nuclear \ndanger arises from the rogue nations and other nations that have less \nsecure situations than the Russians do. While it could be very \nbeneficial to have a good treaty with the Russians, this is not the \ncore of the danger this Nation faces today.\n  We have had very little work, very little success, in getting the \nkind of robust support from Russia and China that we should have \nregarding North Korea and Iran. It is inexplicable to me why they would \njeopardize their reputation as a positive force in the world to curry \nfavor with rogue nations such as Iran and North Korea. But this \nadministration has been unsuccessful in gaining the kind of support to \nratchet up the sanctions to get those countries that could perhaps make \na difference.\n  The Russians are steadfast in their nuclear program. They have \nabsolutely no intention of going to zero nuclear weapons. I had an \nopportunity to talk to some of their people, and it is pretty clear to \nme they thought it was outside the realm of good judgment to discuss \ngoing to zero nuclear weapons. They were never going to zero nuclear \nweapons. They have a 10-to-1 advantage over the United States in \ntactical nuclear weapons--more maneuverable--and this treaty does \nabsolutely nothing to deal with that situation. The Russians may make \nsome changes in the future, perhaps, but I don't think they are going \nto do much on tactical nuclear weapons. It is a critical part of their \ndefense strategy.\n  We understand Russia is willing and has plans at this time to reduce \ntheir strategic nuclear stockpile, which is what this treaty deals \nwith, not the tactical weapons, and that is because it represents a \nnecessary economic move for them. Frankly, I don't think they see the \nUnited States or Europe as the kind of strategic threat they used to \nbe, and they are willing to pull down those numbers. It is a good \nthing, and we should celebrate what gains we can obtain.\n  Some close observers believe this treaty curtails the U.S. programs, \nsuch as missile defense, while not curtailing certain Russian \nmodernization programs of the systems they want to advance. In short, \nthe Russians seem to have negotiated more effectively than the United \nStates in this treaty. That is my observation. We wanted it too \ndesperately. I warned our negotiators that they were too committed, too \ndesperate to get this treaty. It would make more difficult the \nnegotiation also with the Russians. I think that has proven to be true.\n\n[[Page S10335]]\n\n  Let me be plain about my overall concern. First, the idea that it \nshould be the goal of this country to move toward the total elimination \nof nuclear weapons is not just a fantasy, a wild chimera or some \nharmless vision; I think it is dangerous. It can only raise questions \nabout the quality of the judgment that underlies our strategic policy.\n  The question arises, is the fierce determination of this \nadministration to get a treaty a part of their stated goal of moving to \nzero nuclear weapons and setting ``an example'' for the world? Is the \nUnited States of America, under whose nuclear umbrella resides a host \nof free and prosperous nations, no longer reliable as a nuclear power? \nWe know many other nations that are part of our nuclear umbrella are \nworried about our nuclear policy. I can understand that. How far, how \nlow does this world leadership role take us? How few weapons should we \ngo to? Down further from 1,500, as this treaty would have it--and that \nmight be a sustainable number--to 1,000 or 500? Well, not 500, somebody \nwould say. But I note that Mr. Jim Hoagland, writing in the Washington \nPost on December 10, declared that the treaty fails, in his view, \nbecause the numbers are not low enough. He says that ``500 or fewer'' \nwould be sufficient.\n  Well, will this example of reducing our weapons cause other nations \nto follow our good example? I think not. If Iran and North Korea risk \ntheir security and their financial soundness on building a nuclear \narsenal today, will our example cause them to stop? I think not. \nRather, I must conclude it will embolden them. As our weapon numbers \nfall lower and lower, these rogue nations can begin to see clearly \ntheir way to being a peer nuclear competitor of what is now the world's \ngreatest military power. Why would we want to encourage them in that \nfashion? I think it is a risky goal.\n  Thus, to the extent that the treaty is an effort to advance the \nstated goals of this administration--a nuclear-free world--the treaty \nwill be counterproductive and dangerous, I think. If that is what it is \nabout, it is counterproductive, and it will enhance and encourage other \nnations to have nuclear weapons, and any country that has advanced \nunder our nuclear umbrella who does not now have nuclear weapons may \ndecide they have to have their own, further proliferating nuclear \nweapons.\n  At the Halifax International Security Forum a few weeks ago, \nsupported by the German Marshall Fund, Under Secretary of Defense for \nPolicy Michele Flournoy repeated the administration's goal of zero \nnuclear weapons, and further stated, ``It is a vision. It's an \naspiration.'' She acknowledged, ``It may not happen in our lifetimes.'' \nI can tell you it is not happening in our lifetimes, with a high degree \nof certainty.\n  The name of the panel, by the way, had a little bit of an irony to \nit. It was ``A World Without Nukes, Really?'' Good question. So some of \nmy Democratic colleagues may say these statements about ``no nukes'' \nor, you know, they are just rhetoric, you have to say those things to \nkeep the President's political left in line. The President is not \nreally serious about it. It is not a real goal of his.\n  Well, I do not know. America leaders usually mean what they say. He \nhas not renounced the policy. Secretary Flournoy was repeating it a few \nweeks ago at an international conference. I've got to say, a lot of \npeople were not too impressed with that policy, frankly, from our \nallies around the world.\n  Even if the President is not telling us accurately what his \nphilosophy is, these words do not mean anything. He is throwing out \nastonishing visions about what he would like to happen, the lamb lying \ndown with the lion. What else is he not serious about as we consider \nthis treaty? If one is not accurate about matters as significant as \nnuclear weapons, we have a grave problem of leadership in this country. \nDoes it mean the President favors modernization of our stockpile? He \nsays so. But, in essence, he has conditioned that support on passing of \nthe treaty when we need to modernize the stockpile whether or not we \nhave a treaty.\n  Does this give me confidence that the President is clearheaded about \nour nuclear policy when the Secretary of Defense and former Secretary \nof Defense and the laboratory directors and the top military people \nhave, without exception, said we need to modernize our nuclear forces, \nand he is only going to support it if this Congress ratifies the \ntreaty? I do not feel good about that. A lot of people have opposed \nmodernization. They think modernization is a step toward more nuclear \nweapons, in their mind, and we ought to eliminate nuclear weapons, not \nhave more.\n  That is, frankly, where the President's political ancestry is. That \nis where he came from politically. So forgive me if I am not real \ncomfortable about this. Does the President mean it when he says he has \nnot compromised and will not compromise our ability to deploy strategic \nmissile defense systems in Europe?\n  There is a rub here. Some in this relativistic, postmodern world may \nnot have the slightest concerns that our Commander in Chief's words are \nambiguous on matters such as this. They do not believe much in the \nauthority of words anyway. But call me old fashioned. I think words are \nimportant. These words that I am hearing worry me. So these views that \nare fantastical place a cloud of unreality over this entire process.\n  Secondly, I am not persuaded that this administration has not \nretreated on nuclear missile defense to a significant degree. I am not \npersuaded that that has not occurred. For example, the latest WikiLeaks \nreveal that the administration negotiated away President Bush's plan \nfor a forward missile defense site in Poland in exchange for the \nRussian cooperation. The New York Times summarized these cables on \nNovember 29:\n\n       Throughout 2009, the cables show, the Russians vehemently \n     objected to American plans for a ballistic missile defense \n     site in Poland and the Czech Republic. . . . In talks with \n     the United States, the Russians insisted that there would be \n     no cooperation on other issues until the European site was \n     scrapped. . . . Six weeks later, Mr. Obama gave the Russians \n     what they wanted: he abruptly replaced the European site with \n     a ship-borne system.\n\n  So it makes me a bit nervous. We had a plan to place that in Europe, \na two-stage system instead of the three stage we have in the United \nStates, to give us redundant coverage from Iranian attack, and the \nRussians did not like it. They did not want a missile defense system on \ntheir border, even though, at best, it would have only minimal support \nagainst a massive number of missiles that they have. We were only going \nto put 10, I think, in Poland. But they objected. They objected. The \nBush administration stood firm. They got the last treaty by standing \nfirm. Indeed, former Secretary of Defense for Policy Doug Feith wrote \nan article in one of the major newspapers, an op-ed, I think the Wall \nStreet Journal, saying that they said no, and eventually the Russians \nagreed to sign.\n  He raised an important issue. I want to share this with my colleagues \nwhom I know believe so deeply we have to have this treaty or all kinds \nof bad things will happen. Mr. Feith told the Russians: We do not have \nto have a treaty with you. We do not have a treaty with other nations \nthat have nuclear weapons. If it is not a good treaty, we are not going \nto agree to it.\n  Eventually the Russians agreed. He said the very same insistences, \nthe positions they asserted at that time against the Bush \nadministration that they rejected were demands acquiesced in by this \nadministration in this treaty.\n  So forgive me if I am a bit dubious about how wonderful this treaty \nis. I asked the State Department about those cables, and we have not \nheard any information on them. So there are many more things we need to \ntalk about with regard to the treaty and the overall strategic \nsituation we find ourselves in.\n  Are we making the world safer? I am worried that we are not. I am \nworried that this approach may not make us safer. I am well aware that \nsome of our best allies are worried now about the constancy of the \nUnited States, the commitment of the United States to a defense, even \nif, God forbid, nuclear defense of our world allies, that we will not \nfollow through, and so they may have to have their own nuclear weapons.\n  I know there is a good bit more to discuss in this debate. I \nencourage this body to be deliberative in its consideration of the \ntreaty. I am not happy that it is being shoved at this point in\n\n[[Page S10336]]\n\ntime. I was so hopeful and expectant that we would be able to give a \nfirm date to start the debate early next year, and we could have a \nrobust debate, not only about the treaty but how it fits into our \noverall nuclear strategic posture, what are we going to do about \nmissile defense, what are we going to do about updating our stockpile, \nand what about our triad and delivery systems, what are we going to do \nabout those. Now it is being jammed in here. I understand why. They \nhave got more votes they think now, and the likelihood of it passing is \ngreater now. I think it has a realistic chance of passing next year.\n  But, more significantly, I think the administration wishes to avoid a \nfull debate about the strategic nuclear policy of the United States. If \nthat is successful, then I think the American people will be the \nlosers, as will the security of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I wanted to ask the Senator before he leaves, it is now \n1:30 in the afternoon, and we have yet to have one amendment presented \nto us. I recognize there is a value to having some of these comments \nhelp frame it, but it also can be done in the context of a specific \namendment.\n  I would ask the Senator if he has an amendment he is prepared to \noffer that could help us move forward?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, it is difficult to amend a treaty, as the Senator \nknows, once it has been signed. There are things that can be done. I \nthink, first and foremost, we need to ask ourselves, is this a good \nthing for the country? Will it advance our interests? I believe we need \na pretty big discussion about that and where we stand.\n  I know Senator Kerry has been supportive of modernization--I believe \nyou have--at least as this treaty has moved forward, if not in the \npast. And we need to do that. But I am a bit uneasy that the President \nis basically saying, if you do not pass my treaty, we are not going to \nmodernize, when I think modernization is critical to the security of \nour country. I also want to know how it fits into our overall strategic \npolicy.\n  So that is kind of my biggest concern, I say to Senator Kerry. I do \nnot know that the numbers that the treaty takes us to, the reduced \nnumbers themselves are dangerous. Some people say they think it is a \nbit dangerous, but most experts do not think so. I am not inclined to \noppose a treaty on whether it is 1,550 or 1,700 or 1,800. But I think \nif it is part of a trend to take our numbers down further--perhaps you \nsaw Mr. Hogan's article saying it ought to be 500 or lower. That would \nmake me very concerned and I think would cause serious ramifications \ninternationally. Would you agree? If this treaty would be, say, for \n500, it would definitely create some concern and angst around the \nworld?\n  Mr. KERRY. Well, let me say to my friend--and I appreciate his desire \nto try to be thoughtful about what the numbers are and about the treaty \nas a whole. I appreciate that. A couple of comments I want to make. No. \n1, the administration is not linking modernization to the treaty. I \nthink it is clear now to Senator Kyl. I read a letter before the \nSenator started speaking from the directors of the three laboratories \nexpressing their satisfaction and gratitude with the levels of funding \nthat have been put in there.\n  I acknowledge that Senator Kyl was correct in finding some \ninadequacies in the original funding levels, and the administration, in \ngood faith, has made up for those. What happened over in the House, \nhappened over in the House. It was not instigated by the \nadministration. In fact, the administration has countered that and made \nit clear that modernization is necessary as a matter of modernizing, in \norder to keep our arsenal viable.\n  The second point I wish to make to the Senator, I hope the Senator \ndoes not vote against this treaty because he thinks somehow this is a \nstep to some irresponsible slippery slide that takes us to ``zero'' \nnuclear weapons without all of the other things that very intelligent, \nthoughtful statesmen have talked about in the context of less nuclear \nweapons.\n  But I should point out to the Senator, Dr. Henry Kissinger, who is an \nadvocate for this concept, not as something we are going to do tomorrow \nor in the next, you know, 10 years perhaps, 20 years, 30 years, but as \nan organizing principle, as a way of beginning to think differently \nabout how we resolve conflicts--because whatever you do that moves you \ntoward a world of less nuclear weapons, because we have to get 67 votes \nhere, clearly would build the kind of consensus that says we are doing \nthings that make us safer. So it would have to be accompanied by the \nother country's transparency, by other countries taking part.\n  It would also, I would say to the Senator, almost necessarily have to \nbe accompanied by something that today is way out of reach, which is a \nkind of restraint on conventional weapon growth and involvement and the \nway in which we try to resolve conflicts between countries.\n  It is no accident that George Shultz, Bill Perry, and Sam Nunn, as \nwell as both of the 2008 Presidential nominees, Senator McCain and \nPresident Obama, have all agreed this is a principle worth trying to \nmove toward. One thing is for certain: The road to a reduced number of \nnuclear weapons in the world, which would reduce the amount of \nfissionable material potentially available to terrorists, certainly \ndoesn't pass through a nuclear Tehran. So if we are going to have our \nbona fides to be able to leverage North Korea and Iran, we need to at \nleast prove we can put together a bilateral agreement between the two \ncountries that have 90 percent of the world's nuclear weapons.\n  I would hope my colleague would not view this--given all of the \nsignoffs that have accompanied it, from our national security \nestablishment, from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, from military leaders, \nfrom the national intelligence community, from our laboratory \ndirectors, our strategic commanders--all of them have agreed 1,550, the \ncurrent number of launchers we have, the 800--this is going to permit \nthe United States to maintain the advantages we feel we have today.\n  I hope my colleague would look hard at sort of how Henry Kissinger \nand George Shultz and Bill Perry have framed this concept of moving in \nthat direction as an organizing principle. I don't expect it in my \nlifetime. I doubt the Senator does. But I wouldn't vote against this \ntreaty that provides a window into what the Russians are doing, \nprovides verification, reduces the threat, and creates stability. I \nwouldn't link the two, and I would hope the Senator would not.\n  I see the Senator from Arizona has arrived.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. May I ask, I believe earlier today the Senator made the \npoint:\n\n       Make no mistake, we are not going to amend the treaty \n     itself. We are willing to accept resolutions that don't kill \n     the treaty.\n\n  I think I understand that. But I do assert that, as we both know, \namending a treaty is not something that is easily done. So we have to \ndeal with whether we think the treaty is helpful. We can do some things \nthrough the amendment process to make it more palatable and acceptable \nto people who have concerns. I do not dispute that. But I do believe \nthat, fundamentally, this day ought to be about discussing the overall \nstrategic impact of the treaty.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator. We have incorporated into the \nresolution of ratification some 13 different declarations, \nunderstandings, and conditions. We certainly would welcome more if they \nare constructive and are not duplicitous. We have already addressed the \nmissile defense issue, the rail-mobile issue, the verification issue. \nAll of those have been addressed. But I welcome and look forward to \nworking with the Senator in the next days to see if we can do that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we are discussing the New START treaty at \nthis time. I look forward to continued debate and discussion on this \nvital and important national security issue. I wish to, however, remind \ncolleagues that, as with any other issue that relates to this treaty \nand the Russians, it\n\n[[Page S10337]]\n\ncan't be totally considered in a vacuum. Events that have transpired in \nthe last several years in Russia should bring great concern and pause \nto all of us.\n  I will speak about the situation in Russia today and specifically the \ncontinued imprisonment of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his associate, \nPlaton Lebedev, and the imminent verdict by a Russian judge to likely \nextend that imprisonment which was delayed from yesterday to December \n27. If we needed any more reason to know what verdict is coming, this \nis it.\n  The Russian Government seems to be trying to bury some inconvenient \nnews by issuing it 2 days after Christmas and after this body will \nprobably be finished debating the possible ratification of a treaty \nwith the Russian Federation. Some may see this as evidence that the \nRussian Government is accommodating U.S. interests and desires. I would \nbe more inclined to believe that if these prisoners were set free. \nUntil that time, I will continue to believe that when Prime Minister \nPutin says Khodorkovsky should sit in jail, as he said yesterday, that \nthis is exactly the verdict the Russian court will deliver.\n  The fact is, the political fix has been in for years on this case. \nMr. Khodorkovsky built one of the most successful companies in post-\nSoviet Russia. And while I am under no illusions that some of these \ngains may have been ill-gotten, the subsequent crimes committed against \nhim by the Russian State have exceeded the boundaries of human decency, \nequal and lawful justice, and the God-given rights of man.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article in \nYahoo from yesterday that says ``Russia's Putin: Khodorkovsky `should \nsit in jail'.'' That is what the Prime Minister of Russia said about an \nongoing judicial situation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           [From Yahoo! News]\n\n           Russia's Putin: Khodorkovsky `Should Sit in Jail'\n\n                   (By Lynn Berry, Associated Press)\n\n       Moscow.--Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin declared \n     Thursday that former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky is a \n     proven criminal and ``should sit in jail,'' a statement \n     denounced as interference in the trial of a Kremlin foe whose \n     case has come to symbolize the excesses of Putin's rule.\n       Putin's judgment gave ammunition to government opponents \n     who claim Khodorkovsky is being persecuted by Putin and his \n     allies.\n       Khodorkovsky is serving an eight-year sentence after being \n     convicted of tax fraud and is awaiting a verdict in a second \n     trial on charges of stealing oil from his own oil company \n     that could keep him in prison for many more years.\n       Putin was in his first term as president when Khodorkovsky, \n     then Russia's richest man, was arrested in 2003 after funding \n     opposition parties in parliament and challenging Kremlin \n     policies.\n       Khodorkovsky's lawyers and supporters said Putin's comments \n     during his annual televised call-in show would put undue \n     pressure on the judge as he deliberates and exposed Putin's \n     role as a driving force behind the seven-year legal \n     onslaught.\n       One of his lawyers, Karinna Moskalenko, said Putin's \n     statements indicate that the judge will find Khodorkovsky \n     guilty.\n       In addition to saying Khodorkovsky was guilty of economic \n     crimes, Putin once again suggested the former oligarch had \n     ordered the killings of people who stood in his way as he \n     turned Yukos into Russia's largest oil company. Khodorkovsky, \n     whose oil company was taken over by the state, has not been \n     charged with any violent crime.\n       Putin reminded television viewers that the former Yukos \n     security chief was convicted of involvement in several \n     killings.\n       ``What? Did the security service chief commit all these \n     crimes on his own, at his own discretion?'' he said.\n       Putin said Khodorkovsky's present punishment was ``more \n     liberal'' than the 150-year prison sentence handed down in \n     the U.S. to disgraced financier Bernard Madoff, who cheated \n     thousands of investors with losses estimated at around $20 \n     billion.\n       ``Everything looks much more liberal here,'' Putin said. \n     ``Nevertheless, we should presume that Mr. Khodorkovsky's \n     crimes have been proven.''\n       Speaking to reporters afterward, Putin said he had been \n     referring to the conviction in the first case, a distinction \n     he did not make during the televised show.\n       He insisted the second case would be considered objectively \n     by the court, but said it involved even higher monetary \n     damages than the first case, implying no leniency should be \n     shown.\n       ``I believe that a thief should sit in jail,'' Putin said.\n       With more than a touch of sarcasm, Khodorkovsky's lead \n     lawyer, Vadim Klyuvgant, thanked Putin for speaking his mind \n     ``because it directly and clearly answers the question of \n     who, with what aims and with what power is putting pressure \n     on the court as the judge is deliberating.''\n       Judge Viktor Danilkin is scheduled to begin reading the \n     verdict on Dec. 27.\n       If convicted, Khodorkovsky and his partner Platon Lebedev \n     face prison sentences of up to 14 years, which could keep \n     them in prison until at least 2017.\n       Putin has not ruled out a return to the presidency in 2012, \n     and critics suspect him of wanting to keep Khodorkovsky \n     incarcerated until after the election.\n       The case has been seen as a test for President Dmitry \n     Medvedev, who has promised to establish independent courts \n     and strengthen the rule of law in Russia.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Quoting:\n\n       I believe that a thief should sit in jail.\n       With more than a touch of sarcasm, Khodorkovsky's lead \n     lawyer, Vadim Klyuvgant, thanked Putin for speaking his mind \n     ``because it directly and clearly answers the question of \n     who, with what aims and with what powers is putting pressure \n     on the court as the judge is deliberating.''\n\n  In 2003, when Mr. Khodorkovsky became increasingly outspoken about \nthe Russian Government's abuses of power, its growing authoritarianism, \ncorruption, and disregard for the law, he was arbitrarily arrested and \ndetained under political charges. His company was stolen from him by \nauthorities, and he was thrown in prison through a process that fell \nfar short of the universal standards of due process. Mr. Khodorkovsky \nwas held in those conditions for 7 years, and when his sentence was \ndrawing to a close, new charges were brought against him which were \nthen even more blatantly political than the previous ones.\n  Mr. Khodorkovsky, along with Mr. Lebedev, was charged with stealing \nall of the oil of the company that had been so egregiously stolen from \nthem. The trial has now concluded. So what will happen next? It seems \nrather clear. After spending 7 years in prison, Mr. Khodorkovsky will \nlikely face many more, which I fear is tantamount to a death sentence.\n  This case is a travesty of justice for one man, but it is also a \nrevealing commentary on the nature of the Russian Government today.\n  Yesterday, the Senate voted to take up the New START treaty. To be \nsure, this treaty should be considered on its merits to our national \nsecurity. But it is only reasonable to ask--and I ask my colleagues \nthis question--if Russian officials demonstrate such a blatant \ndisregard for the rights and legal obligations owed to one of their own \ncitizens, how will they treat us and the legal obligations, be it this \ntreaty or any other, they owe to us?\n  What is worse, the sad case of Mikhail Khodorkovsky now looks like \none of more modest offenses of corrupt officials ruling Russia today.\n  I would like to quote from a recent article in the Economist dated \nDecember 9, 2010, entitled ``Frost at the core,'' which I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the Economist, Dec. 9, 2010]\n\n                           Frost at the Core\n\n\ndmitry medvedev and vladimir putin are presiding over a system that can \n                            no longer change\n\n       On December 15th, in a small courtroom in central Moscow, \n     Viktor Danilkin, a softly spoken judge, is due to start \n     delivering a verdict. Its symbolism will go far beyond the \n     fate of the two defendants, Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon \n     Lebedev, former principal shareholders in the Yukos oil \n     company. Both men have been in jail since 2003 on charges of \n     tax evasion. Their sentences expire next year. In order to \n     keep them in prison, the government has absurdly charged them \n     with stealing all the company's oil.\n       Neither the first nor the second trial had much to do with \n     the rule of law. But there the similarity ends. In 2003 Mr. \n     Khodorkovsky personified the injustice and inequality of the \n     1990s, when tycoons wielded enormous power over a state that \n     could not even pay pensions and salaries on time. Seven years \n     on, Mr. Khodorkovsky is a symbol of the injustices \n     perpetrated by corrupt bureaucrats and members of the \n     security services, who epitomise the nexus between power and \n     wealth. As Mr. Khodorkovsky said in his final statement, \n     ``They turned, us, ordinary people, into symbols of a \n     struggle against lawlessness. This is not our achievement. It \n     is theirs.''\n       The chances that Mr. Khodorkovsky will be found not guilty \n     are slim. If he were, it would be a sign that the system of \n     Vladimir Putin, Russia's former president and current prime \n     minister, was beginning to come\n\n[[Page S10338]]\n\n     apart. That system, which tolerates corruption and violence, \n     has just received the endorsement of FIFA, which has awarded \n     Russia the prize of hosting the 2018 football World Cup. But \n     its evolution had much to do with Mr. Khodorkovsky's story.\n       In the 1990s, when businessmen bribed the courts, both \n     parties knew they were in the wrong. After Mr. Khodorkovsky's \n     case, a judge taking instructions from a bureaucrat felt he \n     was in the right. The Russian state not only flagrantly \n     flouted the law for its own interests, but also sent a \n     powerful signal to its bureaucracy that this practice was now \n     okay.\n       According to Alexander Oslon, a sociologist who heads the \n     Public Opinion Foundation in Moscow, Mr. Putin's rule ushered \n     in a breed of ``bureaucrat-entrepreneurs''. They are not as \n     sharp, competitive or successful as the oligarchs of the \n     1990s, but they are just as possessed by ``the spirit of \n     money'' in Mr. Olson's phrase, the ideology that has ruled \n     Russia ever since communism collapsed. By the end of the \n     1990s the commanding heights of the economy had been largely \n     privatised by the oligarchs, so the bureaucrat-entrepreneurs \n     began to privatise an asset which was under-capitalised and \n     weak: the Russian state.\n       Unlike businessmen of Mr. Khodorkovsky's type, who made \n     their first money in the market, the bureaucrat-entrepreneurs \n     have prospered by dividing up budget revenues and by \n     racketeering. ``Entrepreneurs'' who hire or work for the \n     security services or the police have done especially well, \n     because they have the ultimate competitive advantage: a \n     licence for violence.\n       No one worries about conflicts of interest; the notion does \n     not exist. (Everyone remembers the special privileges given \n     to party officials for serving the Soviet state.) As American \n     diplomats are now revealed to have said, the line between \n     most important businesses and government officials runs from \n     blurry to non-existent. Putting Mr. Khodorkovsky in jail, or \n     awarding a large contract to one's own affiliated company, \n     could be justified as a public good. Indeed, more people were \n     in favour of locking up Mr. Khodorkovsky, even though they \n     knew it would benefit only a few Kremlin bureaucrats.\n       In 1999 the oil price started to climb and petrodollars \n     gushed into Russia, changing the mindset of the political \n     class. Mr. Oslon points out that the most frequently used \n     word in Mr. Putin's state-of-the-nation address in 2002 was \n     ``reform'' and its variants. A few years later the most \n     frequently used word was ``billion''. Divvying up those \n     billions has become the main business in Russia. Corruption \n     no longer meant breaking the rules of the game; it was the \n     game.\n       Unlike private businessmen, who started to invest in their \n     core businesses (Yukos among them) in the late 1990s, \n     bureaucrat-entrepreneurs have little incentive to do so. \n     Their wealth is dependent on their administrative power, \n     rather than newfangled property rights. The profits are often \n     stashed away in foreign bank accounts or quickly spent: on \n     luxury property in European capitals, or on their children's \n     education in British private schools. All this is inevitably \n     accompanied by anti-Western rhetoric and claims of Russia's \n     resurgence.\n\n\n                        The message of Krasnodar\n\n       On November 4th, National Unity Day, in the small town of \n     Kushchevskaya in the Krasnodar region, eight adults and four \n     children were killed in a house. They were the family of a \n     wealthy farmer and his guests.\n       The youngest child, nine months old, suffocated when the \n     killers set the house alight.\n       Terrible murders can happen in any country. This one stood \n     out because it was the work not of a maniac but of a well-\n     established criminal gang, which has terrorised the region \n     for nearly 20 years. More than 200 trained thugs do its work, \n     including dozens of murders and rapes. Its boss, Sergei \n     Tsapok, was a deputy in the local council and had links with \n     the chief law-enforcement agencies, the tax police and local \n     government. The gang first emerged in the early 1990s, \n     racketeering and carving up valuable plots of land. In 2002 \n     it began to ``legalise'' and incorporate itself into local \n     state power structures.\n       Mr. Tsapok's agricultural firm received massive state \n     credits and grants. It employed the head of security of the \n     local prosecution service as its in-house lawyer. In 2008 Mr. \n     Tsapok boasted that he was among the guests at the \n     inauguration of Dmitry Medvedev as Russia's president, \n     according to Novaya Gazeta, an independent Russian newspaper. \n     The gang ran the region not only under the gaze of \n     government, but also in its stead.\n       When the chief Russian investigator into the murders \n     arrived a few days later from Moscow, he was besieged by \n     complaints from all over the region. Alexander Tkachev, the \n     governor, seemed dismayed by all the fuss: ``Such a crime \n     could have happened in any part of the region. Unfortunately, \n     such gangs exist in every municipality.'' Despite what \n     happened, he remains in his job.\n       In the past such bespredel (extreme lawlessness) was mostly \n     restricted to Chechnya and a few other parts of the north \n     Caucasus. But violence has spread, and Kushchevskaya has \n     caused horror not only because of the child victims, but \n     because it presented a threatening model of a crumbling \n     state. The government used to mask its problems with a thick \n     layer of money. But as this layer gets thinner, the problems \n     become more obvious.\n\n\n                            a shrinking pie\n\n       Corruption was also excessive in the 2000s, but it was \n     compensated for by strong economic growth and fast-rising \n     incomes. This, and soothing television pictures, created a \n     sense of stability. But the global financial crisis hit the \n     Russian economy harder than that of any other large \n     industrial country, exposing its structural weakness. As \n     Vladislav Inozemtsev, an economist, argues in a recent \n     article, the improvement in living standards was achieved at \n     the cost of massive under-investment in the country's \n     industry and infrastructure. In the late Soviet era capital \n     investment in Russia was 31% of GDP. In the past ten years \n     Russia's capital investment has been, on average, about 21.3% \n     of GDP. (For comparison, the figure over the same period in \n     China was 41%.)\n       Despite rising oil prices and a construction boom, Mr. \n     Inozemtsev says, in the post-Soviet period Russia has built \n     only one cement factory and not a single oil refinery. The \n     Soviet Union used to build 700km of railways a year. Last \n     year, it built 60km. ``We have lived by gobbling up our own \n     future,'' he argues. Peter Aven, the head of Alfa Bank, the \n     largest private bank in the country, thinks today is like the \n     late Soviet period: ``Once again the main source of wealth is \n     oil and gas, which is being exchanged for imported goods. The \n     state today is no better than Gosplan was in the Soviet \n     Union.''\n       Russia's trade surplus is shrinking. As imports grow, so \n     does pressure on the rouble. The government is now running a \n     budget deficit. Mr. Aven says Russia's budget balances at an \n     oil price of $123 a barrel. Three years ago it balanced at \n     $30. For all the talk of stability, only 6% of the population \n     can imagine their future in more than five years' time, which \n     may explain why only 2% have private pension plans.\n       To keep up his approval rating, particularly among \n     pensioners and state workers, Mr. Putin has had to increase \n     general government spending to nearly 40% of GDP (see chart). \n     To pay for this he has raised taxes on businesses, which are \n     already suffocating from corruption and racketeering. While \n     Russia's peers in the BRIC group of leading emerging \n     economies are coping with an inflow of capital, $21 billion \n     fled out of Russia in the first ten months of the year. \n     Unlike foreign firms such as Pepsi (see article), Russia's \n     private firms are too nervous to invest in their own economy.\n       That economy is growing by less than 4% a year. This would \n     be respectable in many Western countries, but as Kirill \n     Rogov, an economic and political analyst, argues, it is not \n     enough to sustain the political status quo. When the pie of \n     prosperity was expanding, dissension within the elite made no \n     sense. However, now that money is scarcer and the world is \n     divided into ``Mr. Putin's friends and everyone else'', as \n     one businessman put it, conflicts are inevitable.\n       A sense of injustice is now growing in many different \n     groups. Private businessmen and even oligarchs complain about \n     the lack of rules and bureaucratic extortion. Middle-class \n     Muscovites moan that officials in their black luxury cars, \n     with their flashing blue lights, push them off the road and \n     occasionally run them over. People in the north Caucasus feel \n     they are treated like aliens rather than Russian citizens. \n     Everyone is fed up with corruption.\n       The discontent does not register in Mr. Putin and Mr. \n     Medvedev's joint popularity ratings, which remain at 70%. But \n     growing numbers of the elite feel that the present political \n     and economic model has been exhausted and the country is fast \n     approaching a dead end. ``The problem is not that this regime \n     is authoritarian, the problem is that it is unfair, corrupt \n     and ineffective,'' says one leading businessman. ``Corruption \n     will erode and bring down this system.'' The paradox is that \n     few Russian government officials disagree with this.\n       At a recent government-sponsored conference on Russia's \n     competitiveness, everyone agreed that the system does not \n     work. Russian politicians sometimes sound like opposition \n     leaders, and Mr. Medvedev makes pledges as if he were a \n     presidential candidate. If Mr. Putin has stopped lamenting \n     the level of corruption in Russia, as he used to, it is only \n     because he believes this is futile and that other countries \n     are the same.\n       In a democracy, such confessions of impotence from top \n     officials would probably prompt their resignations. In Russia \n     it leads to a discussion of how best to preserve the system. \n     Which tactics work better will be the subject of a \n     conversation between Mr. Putin and Mr. Medvedev when they \n     decide, probably next summer, which of them will become \n     Russia's next president. As Mr. Putin said, the decision will \n     be made on the basis of what is best for Russia. (``Think of \n     them as co-heads of a corporation,'' Mr. Oslon suggests.) The \n     aim is the same, but the styles vary.\n       Mr. Medvedev calls for innovation and technical \n     modernisation to revive growth. He is appealing through \n     the internet to the most enterprising people in Russia, \n     and is inviting Russian and foreign scientists to come and \n     innovate in a specially created zone, called Skolkovo, \n     which would be protected against the rest of the country \n     by a high security wall and honest police.\n       The president, who is keen to keep his job after 2012, will \n     try to persuade Mr. Putin that it is in the interests of the \n     corporation, and of Mr. Putin as one of its main \n     stakeholders, for his predecessor not to return to the \n     Kremlin. He could cite the need for better relations with the \n     West to legitimise the\n\n[[Page S10339]]\n\n     financial interests of the Russian elite, and the \n     inefficiency of the security services as a support base. But \n     even if Mr. Putin would like to retire, can he afford to?\n       The two men may belong to the same system and want the same \n     thing, but they are formed by different experiences. Mr. \n     Putin, despite his belligerence about the 1990s, is the very \n     epitome of that period. He operates by informal rules and \n     agreements rather than laws and institutions. He became \n     president at the end of a revolutionary decade, when the job \n     carried more risks than rewards. He is cautious, dislikes \n     making decisions and rarely fires anyone, putting loyalty and \n     stability above all else.\n       Mr. Medvedev, on the other hand, was installed as president \n     after nearly a decade of stability, when the political \n     landscape was cleared of opposition and the coffers were full \n     of money. He is a stickler for formality, though he is a lot \n     less careful, and makes decisions that can destabilise the \n     system--such as firing the previous mayor of Moscow, Yuri \n     Luzhkov. But he is also weaker than Mr. Putin, and may not be \n     able to hang on to power.\n       The likeliest outcome is that the two will try to preserve \n     their tandem one way or another. Kremlin officials dismiss \n     talk of dead ends as pointless whining and alarmism from \n     liberals. The prevailing view is that the system works and \n     everything will carry on as usual. That may be wrong, \n     however. ``Mr. Putin can return to the Kremlin technically, \n     but he cannot do so historically,'' Mr. Rogov argues. His \n     popularity may be buoyant, but the historic period of \n     stabilisation and restoration which he initiated is coming to \n     an end. Mr. Putin always took great care over symbols, \n     marking the beginning of his rule with the restoration of the \n     Soviet anthem. At the time, it was a symbol of continuity and \n     greatness. Today it sounds increasingly archaic.\n       As stability turns into stagnation, Mr. Putin is becoming a \n     symbol of the bygone 2000s. Mr. Medvedev, on the other hand, \n     with his tweets and his iPad, has absorbed hopes of change \n     among the younger, more restless set. He has done nothing to \n     justify this; as a recent editorial in Vedomosti, a Russian \n     business daily, argued, ``Medvedev is strong not because of \n     his deeds, but because he rides an illusion.'' Nonetheless, \n     the wish for change is real.\n\n\n                           Dissenting voices\n\n       This is reflected in the media. Glossy lifestyle magazines \n     are becoming politicised; one has even put Lyudmila Alexeeva, \n     an 83-year-old human-rights activist, on its cover. The \n     beating-up of Oleg Kashin, a journalist from Kommersant, a \n     mainstream newspaper, troubled the well-heeled more than the \n     murder of Anna Politkovskaya did three years ago, precisely \n     because Mr. Kashin--unlike her--did not oppose the regime or \n     write about Chechnya. And recently Leonid Parfenov, a stylish \n     Russian TV presenter, caused a scandal when, at an awards \n     ceremony attended by Russia's most powerful media executives, \n     he said that Russian television reporters have turned into \n     servile bureaucrats. ``Our television'', he said, ``can \n     hardly be called a civic or public political institution.''\n       It was not what Mr. Parfenov said that was news, but the \n     fact that he said it at all. He used to steer clear of words \n     like ``civic'' or ``duty'', and argue that Russian liberalism \n     was not found in politics, but in fashion boutiques and \n     Moscow coffee shops. Many young, successful Russians shared \n     his view. Mr. Parfenov's speech reflects a change of mood \n     among them, as well as a growing interest in politics. \n     Although state television has enormous sway over older \n     Russians, the young, urban and educated get their news and \n     views from the internet, which remains largely free of \n     Kremlin propaganda.\n       Stanislav Belkovsky, a political commentator, sees a \n     similarity between Russia's situation and the period of \n     Perestroika reform under Mikhail Gorbachev in the mid-1980s. \n     As then, a large part of the elite has realised that the \n     system is ineffective and is no longer willing to defend it. \n     When ordinary people come to share this view, the system is \n     in grave danger.\n       That moment may be some time away: the Russian economy is \n     more flexible than the Soviet one, the elite is more diverse, \n     the borders are open and there are safety valves to release \n     dissatisfaction. But as Mr. Khodorkovsky said in a recent \n     interview from jail, the tensions between the declining \n     performance of the Russian economy, the expectations of the \n     population and the corruption of the bureaucracy will erode \n     the system, whoever is president.\n       With Mr. Putin in power, Russia may suffer deep stagnation, \n     but a collapse of the system would be all the more dramatic. \n     With Mr. Medvedev stagnation may be shorter, but his grip on \n     power would be weaker. This may matter little in the long \n     run, but it makes a big difference for Russians living now--\n     not least for Mr. Khodorkovsky himself.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. Khodorkovsky, the Economist writes, is a symbol of \nthe injustices perpetrated by corrupt bureaucrats and members of the \nsecurity services who epitomize the nexus between power and wealth.\n  The article goes on to describe the staggering scale of corruption in \nRussia today.\n\n       Shortly before his arrest Mr. Khodorkovsky estimated state \n     corruption at around $30 billion, or 10% of the country's \n     [gross domestic product]. By 2005 the bribes market, \n     according to INDEM, a think-tank, had risen to $300 billion, \n     or 20% of GDP. As Mr. Khodorkovsky said in a recent \n     interview, most of this was not the bribes paid to traffic \n     police or doctors, but contracts awarded by bureaucrats to \n     their affiliated companies.\n\n  I go on to quote from the Economist:\n\n       Their wealth is dependent on their administrative power, \n     rather than newfangled property rights. The profits are often \n     stashed away in foreign bank accounts or quickly spent: on \n     luxury property in European capitals, or on their children's \n     education in British private schools.\n       Unsurprisingly, surveys now show that the young would \n     rather have a job in the government or a state firm than in \n     private business. Over the past 10 years, the number of \n     bureaucrats has gone up by 66%, from 527,000 to 878,000, and \n     the cost of maintaining such a state machine has risen from \n     15% to 20% of GDP.\n\n  Other figures point to the same conclusion as the Economist. In its \nannual index of perceptions of corruption, Transparency International \nranked Russia 154 out of 178 countries--perceived as more corrupt than \nPakistan, Yemen, and Zimbabwe. The World Bank considers 122 countries \nto be better places to do business than Russia. One of those countries \nis Georgia, which the World Bank ranks as the 12th best country to do \nbusiness with.\n  President Medvedev speaks often and at times eloquently about the \nneed for Russia to be governed by the rule of law. Considering the \nlikely outcome of Mr. Khodorkovsky's show trial, it is not surprising \nthat President Medvedev himself has lamented that his anticorruption \ncampaign has produced, in his words, ``no results.''\n  Russians who want better for their country and dare to challenge the \ncorrupt bureaucrats who govern it are often targeted with impunity.\n  One case that has garnered enormous attention both within Russia and \naround the world is that of Sergei Magnitsky, a tax attorney for an \nAmerican investor who uncovered the theft by Russian officials of $230 \nmillion from the Russian treasury. Because of Mr. Magnitsky's \nrelentless investigation into this corruption, the Russian Interior \nMinistry threw him in prison to silence him. He was deprived of clean \nwater, left in a freezing cell for days, and denied medical care. After \n358 days of this abuse, Sergei Magnitsky died. He was 37. Not only has \nthe Russian Government held no one accountable for his death, several \nofficials connected to Mr. Magnitsky's imprisonment and murder have \nactually received commendations.\n  Then there is the tragic case of Russia's last remaining independent \njournalist. Last month, Russian journalist Oleg Kashin, who had written \ncritically of a violent youth movement associated with the Kremlin, was \nbeaten by attackers who broke his jaw, both his legs, and many of his \nfingers--a clear political message to other writers.\n  No one has been charged for this crime, and writing in the New York \nTimes this Sunday, Mr. Kashin suggests that no one ever will.\n  ``[I]t seems indubitable,'' he writes, ``that the atmosphere of \nhatred and aggression, artificially fomented by the Kremlin, has become \nthe dominant fact in Russian politics, the reset in relations with the \nUnited States and talk of economic modernization notwithstanding. . . . \nA man with a steel rod is standing behind the smiling politicians who \nspeak of democracy. That man is the real defender of the Kremlin and \nits order. I got to feel that man with my own head.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this entire article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 11, 2010]\n\n                          A Beating on My Beat\n\n                            (By Oleg Kashin)\n\n       On the night of Nov. 6, I was attacked by two young men \n     armed with steel rods. The assault occurred a few feet from \n     the entrance to my house, which is just a 10-minute walk from \n     the Kremlin.\n       A month later, I am still in the hospital. One of my \n     fingers has been amputated, one of my legs and both halves of \n     my jaw have been broken, and I have several cranial wounds. \n     According to my doctors, I won't be able to go back to my job \n     as a reporter and columnist at Kommersant, an independent \n     newspaper, until spring.\n       A few hours after the attack, President Dmitri Medvedev \n     went on Twitter to declare\n\n[[Page S10340]]\n\n     his outrage, and he instructed Russia's law enforcement \n     agencies to make every effort to investigate this crime. But \n     no one has been apprehended, and I do not expect that the two \n     young men will ever be identified or caught.\n       Three theories quickly emerged about who was behind the \n     attack--which was, I believe, an assassination attempt. The \n     first holds that it was the municipal authorities of Khimki, \n     a town between Moscow and St. Petersburg. I had written \n     several articles criticizing a proposed highway between the \n     two cities that would run through the town, something the \n     local authorities want but many residents oppose.\n       The second theory is that it was Andrei Turchak, the \n     governor of the Pskov region, who was upset by a blog posting \n     of mine arguing that he had his position only because of his \n     ties to the Kremlin.\n       And the third theory is that the perpetrators came from \n     Nashi, a youth movement I have criticized. The group's \n     appearance on the public scene has accompanied a new level, \n     and acceptance, of violence in Russian politics; members are \n     called ``Nashists'' by their opponents, as a pun on \n     ``fascists,'' for good reason.\n       Nashi is closely tied to the Kremlin, which founded the \n     group five years ago in response to fears that Ukraine's \n     Orange Revolution could inspire similar uprisings in Russia. \n     When newspapers reported that Vasily Yakemenko, its former \n     leader and now the minister for youth affairs, might have \n     been involved in the attack on me, he was granted an \n     unscheduled meeting with Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. Was \n     this meant to show that the authorities didn't share such a \n     suspicion--or that they didn't care whether the accusation \n     was true?\n       What strikes me about the theories is that, in each case, \n     the ultimate perpetrator is the state. And for some reason \n     that seems acceptable to most Russians: practically no one \n     here has questioned the right of the state to resort to \n     extra-legal violence to maintain power, even against \n     journalists.\n       I don't mean to compare myself to Anna Politkovskaya or \n     Paul Klebnikov, journalists who were killed probably because \n     of their investigative work. But in a way the attack against \n     me is more disturbing. Unlike most of the reporters who have \n     been attacked in Russia in recent years, I have not engaged \n     in any serious investigations into corruption or human rights \n     abuses. I have not revealed any secret documents or irritated \n     influential figures with embarrassing material.\n       What I have done, though, is criticize Nashi. Indeed, all \n     this year I have called attention to the violence that \n     accompanies the group's every public activity. Even at their \n     legally sanctioned events the members trample--and this is no \n     exaggeration; they literally stomp with their feet--portraits \n     of Russia's ``enemies,'' including human rights activists, \n     politicians and journalists.\n       I also believe they were the organizers of anonymous acts \n     aimed at the opposition: fabricated video clips, hacker \n     attacks and physical assaults. Some of them were symbolic; \n     for example, an unidentified man once hit Garry Kasparov, the \n     former world chess champion who is an opposition leader, on \n     the head with a chess board.\n       But even when there is strong evidence of official Nashi \n     involvement, members have gone unpunished. In the summer of \n     2005 a group of hooligans with baseball bats invaded an \n     opposition meeting and savagely beat the participants. The \n     police detained the attackers, and a list of their names, \n     including some ``Nashists,'' appeared in the papers. But all \n     of the detainees were immediately released, and the case has \n     never gone to court.\n       Nobody knows for certain whether there is a direct link \n     between the flourishing of Nashi and the increased violence \n     against critics of the state. But it seems indubitable that \n     the atmosphere of hatred and aggression, artificially \n     fomented by the Kremlin, has become the dominant fact in \n     Russian politics, the ``reset'' in relations with the United \n     States and talk of economic modernization notwithstanding.\n       A man with a steel rod is standing behind the smiling \n     politicians who speak of democracy. That man is the real \n     defender of the Kremlin and its order. I got to feel that man \n     with my own head.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. An earlier New York Times news story, dated May 17 of \nthis year, and entitled ``Russian Journalists, Fighting Graft, Pay in \nBlood,'' describes the fate of other independent journalists in Russia. \nOne is Mikhail Beketov, who exposed corruption in a Moscow suburb. This \nis what happened to him.\n\n       \"Last spring, I called for the resignation of the city's \n     leadership,'' Mr. Beketov said in one of his final \n     editorials. ``A few days later, my automobile was blown up. \n     What is next for me?'' Not long after, he was savagely beaten \n     outside his home and left to bleed in the snow. His fingers \n     were bashed, and three later had to be amputated, as if his \n     assailants had sought to make sure he would never write \n     another word. He lost a leg. Now 52, he is in a wheelchair, \n     his brain so damaged that he cannot utter a simple sentence.\n\n  No one has been charged or held responsible for this crime either.\n  The same article mentions another journalist, Pyotr Lipatov, who was \nattacked while covering an opposition rally. As he was leaving, the \narticle says:\n\n       [T]hree men pushed him to the ground and punched him \n     repeatedly on the head. ``Even when I was unconscious, they \n     didn't let me go,'' Mr. Lipatov said. This beating was \n     recorded on video by protesters. Mr. Lipatov's colleagues \n     used the video to track down the men who beat him. They were \n     police officers. While Mr. Lipatov, 28, was recovering in the \n     hospital, he said two other police officers visited and urged \n     him to sign a statement saying that he had provoked the \n     attack. . . .\n       Officials later acknowledged that police officers had been \n     involved in the attack, but they still brought no charges. \n     Instead, they raided Mr. Lipatov's offices, seized computers \n     and brought a criminal extremism suit against him. They \n     asserted that he had sought to foment ``negative stereotypes \n     and negative images of members of the security forces.'' \n     Fearing for his safety and more criminal charges, he quit.\n\n  Sadly, I could go on and on like this, to say nothing of the many \nunsolved murders. So I ask unanimous consent that the entire article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 17, 2010]\n\n           Russian Journalists, Fighting Graft, Pay in Blood\n\n                         (By Clifford J. Levy)\n\n       Khimki, Russia.--Mikhail Beketov had been warned, but would \n     not stop writing. About dubious land deals. Crooked loans. \n     Under-the-table hush money. All evidence, he argued in his \n     newspaper, of rampant corruption in this Moscow suburb.\n       ``Last spring, I called for the resignation of the city's \n     leadership,'' Mr. Beketov said in one of his final \n     editorials. ``A few days later, my automobile was blown up. \n     What is next for me?''\n       Not long after, he was savagely beaten outside his home and \n     left to bleed in the snow. His fingers were bashed, and three \n     later had to be amputated, as if his assailants had sought to \n     make sure that he would never write another word. He lost a \n     leg. Now 52, he is in a wheelchair, his brain so damaged that \n     he cannot utter a simple sentence.\n       The police promised a thorough investigation, but barely \n     looked up from their desks. Surveillance videos were ignored. \n     Neighbors were not interviewed. Information about \n     politicians' displeasure with Mr. Beketov was deemed \n     ``unconfirmed,'' according to interviews with officials and \n     residents.\n       Prosecutors, who had repeatedly rejected Mr. Beketov's \n     pleas for protection, took over the case, but did not seem to \n     accomplish much more. Mr. Beketov's close colleagues said \n     they were eager to offer insights about who in the government \n     had been stung by his exposes. But no one asked.\n       Eighteen months later, there have been no arrests.\n       In retrospect, the violence was an omen, beginning a wave \n     of unsolved attacks and official harassment against \n     journalists, human rights activists and opposition \n     politicians around the region, which includes the Moscow \n     suburbs, but not the city itself. Rarely, if ever, is anyone \n     held responsible.\n       One editor was beaten in front of his home, and the \n     assailants seized only copies of his articles and other \n     material for the next day's issue, not his wallet or \n     cellphone. Local officials insisted that he sustained his \n     injuries while drunk.\n       Another journalist was pummeled by plainclothes police \n     officers after a demonstration. It was all captured on video. \n     Even so, the police released a statement saying that he had \n     hurt himself when he was accidentally pushed by the crowd.\n       These types of attacks or other means of intimidation, \n     including aggressive efforts by prosecutors to shut down news \n     media outlets or nonprofit groups, serve as an unnerving \n     deterrent. And in a few cases in recent years, the violence \n     in the country has escalated into contract killings. \n     Corruption is widespread in Russia, and government often \n     functions poorly. But most journalists and nonprofit groups \n     shy away from delving deeply into these problems.\n       The culture of impunity in Russia represents the most \n     glaring example of the country's inability to establish real \n     laws in the two decades since the collapse of the Soviet \n     Union. And this failure radiates throughout society, touching \n     upon ordinary men and women who are trying to carve out lives \n     in the new Russia, but are wary of questioning authority.\n       Russia's president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, has bemoaned the \n     country's ``legal nihilism.'' Yet under Mr. Medvedev and \n     Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, it has persisted. And among \n     the major beneficiaries have been the governing party's \n     politicians.\n\n\n                        Threats, Then a Beating\n\n       Boris Gromov, the governor of the Moscow region, commanded \n     the 40th Army during the Soviet war in Afghanistan, and his \n     opponents believe that he governs with a general's sense of \n     order. Mr. Gromov, appointed by Mr. Putin, has in turn seeded \n     local government with fellow Afghanistan veterans, including \n     the Khimki mayor, Vladimir Strelchenko.\n       Mikhail Beketov often referred to Mr. Gromov and Mr. \n     Strelchenko as ``army boots,'' and did not think much of \n     their honesty.\n\n[[Page S10341]]\n\n       Mr. Beketov was brawny like a boxer, fast-talking, \n     perpetually late and prone to latching onto causes. He \n     himself had been an officer in the army paratroops, but then \n     switched to journalism, working as a war correspondent in \n     Afghanistan and Chechnya. His experiences left him with a \n     distaste for overbearing military officials.\n       He established his newspaper, Khimkinskaya Pravda (Khimki \n     Truth), in 2006. He wrote regularly about what he considered \n     corruption among local officials, who were often members of \n     Mr. Putin's governing party, United Russia.\n       He financed the newspaper himself. It had a circulation of \n     only about 10,000 copies, but it garnered a large following \n     in Khimki, which has a population of 185,000, and the \n     surrounding cities, especially after Mr. Beketov grabbed hold \n     of two topics.\n       His articles resonated nationally when he questioned why \n     the city had demolished a monument that contained the remains \n     of Soviet fighter pilots. The work was done to widen a road.\n       And he relentlessly focused on the fate of the Khimki \n     forest, a pristine expanse of old-growth oaks and wild \n     animals, including elk and boars, improbably close to Moscow. \n     With little public notice, the government had planned to \n     build a major highway to St. Petersburg through the forest. \n     Mr. Beketov suspected that officials were secretly profiting \n     from the project.\n       Local officials, unaccustomed to such criticism, lashed out \n     publicly. Privately, Mr. Beketov received phone threats. He \n     asked the authorities for help, but was rebuffed, his \n     colleagues said. He returned home one day to discover his dog \n     dead on his doorstep. Then his car was blown up.\n       Instead of investigating the explosion, prosecutors opened \n     a criminal inquiry into his newspaper. His friends said that \n     Mr. Beketov told them that one city official had warned him \n     about his articles.\n       But he did not relent. ``You can imagine what kind of money \n     the authorities plan to fleece from this so-called \n     infrastructure,'' he wrote about the highway plan.\n       ``For four years, I have observed our authorities,'' he \n     said. ``I have closely interacted with many senior officials, \n     including Strelchenko himself. Given how the authorities have \n     collected scandals with frightening regularity, I have come \n     to a regrettable conclusion: They are shameless.''\n       On a November evening in 2008, Mr. Beketov was assaulted, \n     most likely by several people, outside his home. He was \n     discovered by a neighbor the next day.\n       Even as Mr. Beketov later lay in a coma at the hospital, he \n     was not safe. A threat was phoned in: We will finish him off.\n       His friends and colleagues grew so alarmed that they moved \n     him out of the Khimki hospital to a better, more secure one \n     in neighboring Moscow.\n       Both the police and prosecutors found the case tough to \n     crack.\n       Yuliya Zhukova, a spokeswoman in the Moscow region for the \n     investigative committee of the prosecutor general's office, \n     said the office had conducted a thorough inquiry, but \n     ultimately had to suspend it for lack of evidence. She said \n     that investigators needed to interview Mr. Beketov to make \n     progress, but that his doctors would not allow that. (Mr. \n     Beketov has been unable to communicate since the attack.)\n       Yevgenia Chirikova, a leader of a local environmental group \n     who worked closely with Mr. Beketov on his articles about the \n     highway, said that she was eager to help, but that \n     investigators did not contact her.\n       ``I waited and waited and waited,'' Ms. Chirikova said. ``I \n     knew that according to the rules, they are supposed to \n     question those closest to the victim.''\n       She said she decided to approach the investigators herself. \n     They questioned her for several hours, asking her about her \n     motivations for getting involved in the case, she said.\n       Ms. Zhukova criticized allies of Mr. Beketov and some \n     journalists for assuming that the attack was related to Mr. \n     Beketov's work.\n       ``Very often, unfortunately, they have presented erroneous \n     information, and misled people regarding the course of the \n     investigation,'' she said.\n       Governor Gromov and Mayor Strelchenko declined to be \n     interviewed for this article. After the attack, Mr. \n     Strelchenko said he had played no role in it, but also \n     complained that it was getting too much attention.\n       ``I don't want to say that it was good what happened to \n     Mikhail,'' he said. ``But I want you to separate truth from \n     untruth.''\n\n\n                         Attacks on Two Editors\n\n       To the north on the M-10 highway from Khimki is a city \n     called Solnechnogorsk, where a newspaper, Solnechnogorsk \n     Forum, was publishing exposes about how local politicians \n     were seeking to do away with elections to maintain power.\n       The newspaper's editor, Yuri Grachev, is 73. In February \n     2009, several men assaulted him as he left his home, putting \n     him in intensive care for a month with a severe concussion, a \n     broken nose and other wounds.\n       Police officials first said he was drunk and fell down. \n     Then they said he had been the victim of a random robbery, \n     though all that was taken was a folder with material for the \n     newspaper's next issue. The muggers have not been found, and \n     politicians from the governing party, United Russia, said the \n     attack had nothing to do with Mr. Grachev's work.\n       ``Maybe it was hooligans or maybe it was by chance,'' said \n     Nikolai Bozhko, the local party leader, who is also an \n     Afghanistan war veteran. ``The idea that it was ordered--I \n     don't believe that.''\n       Prosecutors had better luck finding evidence that \n     Solnechnogorsk Forum had committed libel. They have brought \n     charges against the paper, aiming to shut it down.\n       ``The system will stop at nothing to break you,'' Mr. \n     Grachev said.\n       Farther up the M-10 Highway is Klin, where an opposition \n     rally was held in March 2009 to protest corruption and \n     increases in utility rates.\n       As Pyotr Lipatov, editor of an opposition newspaper called \n     Consensus and Truth, was leaving the rally, three men pushed \n     him to the ground and punched him repeatedly on the head. \n     ``Even when I was unconscious, they didn't let me go,'' Mr. \n     Lipatov said.\n       This beating was recorded on video by protesters. Mr. \n     Lipatov's colleagues used the video to track down the men who \n     beat him. They were police officers.\n       While Mr. Lipatov, 28, was recovering in the hospital, he \n     said two other police officers visited and urged him to sign \n     a statement saying that he had provoked the attack. He \n     refused. The police then issued a statement.\n       ``According to Lipatov, filming the meeting with his \n     camera, he found himself in the middle of a reactionary \n     crowd, was pushed and fell to the ground,'' the statement \n     said. Two videos of the demonstration show a different \n     sequence of events.\n       Officials later acknowledged that police officers had been \n     involved in the attack, but they still brought no charges. \n     Instead, they raided Mr. Lipatov's offices, seized computers \n     and brought a criminal extremism suit against him. They \n     asserted that he had sought to foment ``negative stereotypes \n     and negative images of members of the security forces.''\n       Fearing for his safety and more criminal charges, he quit.\n       ``Everyone was against me--the judges, the police, the \n     prosecutors, everyone,'' he said. ``I took over Consensus and \n     Truth because I supported Prime Minister Putin's call to \n     fight corruption. But look what happened. The machine here \n     did everything possible to defeat us.''\n\n\n                        Promises, but No Arrests\n\n       After the attacks in Khimki, Solnechnogorsk, Klin and \n     elsewhere, the authorities, apparently concerned that the \n     region had developed a reputation as a danger zone for \n     journalists, vowed to protect them.\n       ``Attacks on journalists, naturally, create a special \n     resonance,'' Governor Gromov's office said. ``The regional \n     government believes that every case of an attack on \n     journalists must be thoroughly investigated.'' Even so, no \n     arrests have been made in any of the cases.\n       And the harassment has not let up.\n       On March 31, The New York Times interviewed Ms. Zhukova, \n     the spokeswoman for the investigators, about Mr. Lipatov. The \n     next day, investigators approached him in the central market \n     of Klin and said they urgently wanted to question him about \n     the beating, he said.\n       The session lasted more than six hours. Mr. Lipatov said \n     they tried to pressure him to sign a statement saying that he \n     had wanted to lead a mob to storm city buildings, thereby \n     justifying the police beating. He said he declined to do so.\n       Back in Khimki, a new opposition newspaper, Khimki Our \n     Home, was established to help continue Mr. Beketov's work.\n       The editor, Igor Belousov, 50, is a deeply religious man. \n     He publishes the Russian Orthodox calendar in his newspaper. \n     Before turning to journalism, he was a senior city official, \n     but he resigned because of what he described as pervasive \n     corruption.\n       Not long after the publication got started, Mr. Belousov \n     was accused of criminal libel by prosecutors and civil libel \n     by Mayor Strelchenko. In February, the police, without any \n     notice, arrested him on charges of selling cocaine. Court \n     documents show that the case is based exclusively on the \n     testimony of a drug dealer from another city who could not \n     recall basic details of the alleged crime.\n       ``We used to have so many journalists here, but they have \n     all suffered and have all given up,'' Mr. Belousov said. \n     ``Only I remained, and now I am giving up.''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Russia's beleaguered political opposition, unfortunately, \nfares no better than its journalists. I have met a few times this year \nwith former Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, who organizes peaceful \npolitical rallies to protest a lack of democracy in Russia, a right \ngranted under the Russian Constitution. But these rallies are often \ntargeted and violently broken up by Russian authorities.\n  Considering that this is how Russian officials treat their fellow \ncitizens, it is not hard to see a profound connection between the \nRussian Government's authoritarian actions at home and its aggressive \nbehavior abroad. The most glaring example of this remains in Georgia. \nOver 2 years after its invasion, Russia not only continues to occupy 20 \npercent of Georgia's sovereign territory, it is building military bases \nthere, permitting the ethnic cleansing of Georgians in South Ossetia, \nand denying access to humanitarian missions--all in violation of \nRussia's obligations under the cease-fire agreement\n\n[[Page S10342]]\n\nnegotiated by President Sarkozy. In a major recent step, President \nSaakashvili even renounced the use of force to end Russia's occupation, \npledging only to defend nonoccupied Georgia in the event of a Russian \nattack. And yet Russian officials responded hostilely and dismissively.\n  I ask my colleagues, when the Russians illegally, in violation of all \ninternational law, occupy a sovereign nation--a sovereign nation--and \nhave recognized these two provinces within the international boundaries \nof Georgia as independent nations, how in the world are we going to \ntrust them to adhere to a treaty?\n  I have met with the people in Georgia who have been displaced from \ntheir homes--the sorrow and the misery inflicted on them. President \nSarkozy of France flew in and arranged for a cease-fire. The Russians \nagreed to it. They are in total violation of it. They are occupying 20 \npercent of the country of Georgia. I think Nicaragua and one other \ncountry have also recognized these two ``independent'' states in which \nthe Russians are now carrying out ethnic cleansing and stationing \nRussian military. But not to worry, we can trust the Russians to adhere \nto solemn treaties and abide by international law.\n  When we consider the various crimes and abuses of this Russian \nGovernment, it is hard to believe that this government shares our \ndeepest values. This does not mean that we cannot or should not work \nwith the Russian Federation where possible. The world does not work \nthat way. What it does mean is that we need a national debate about the \nreal nature of this Russian Government, about what kind of a \nrelationship is possible with this government, and about the place that \nRussia should realistically occupy in U.S. foreign policy. The Senate's \nconsideration of the New START treaty offers a chance to have this \ndebate, as does Russian accession to the WTO. Some may want to avoid \nit, but we cannot.\n  I believe we need a greater sense of realism about Russia, but that \nis not the same as pessimism or cynicism or demonization. I am an \noptimist, even about Russia. I often find sources for hope in the most \nhopeless of places. Mikhail Khordokovsky has languished in prison for 7 \nyears, and on December 27, he will likely be forced to endure many \nmore. Yet, in a final appeal to the judge in his case, Mr. Khordokovsky \ngave one of the more moving speeches I have heard in a long time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Mikhail Khodorkovsky: Full Transcript of His Final Words\n\n       I can recall October 2003. My last day as a free man. \n     Several weeks after my arrest, I was informed that president \n     Putin had decided: I was going to have to ``slurp gruel'' for \n     8 years. It was hard to believe that back then.\n       Seven years have gone by already since that day. Seven \n     years--quite a long stretch of time, and all the more so--\n     when you've spent it in jail. All of us have had time to \n     reassess and rethink many things.\n       Judging by the prosecutors' presentation: ``give them 14 \n     years'' and ``spit on previous court decisions'', over these \n     years they have begun to fear me more, and to respect the \n     law--even less.\n       The first time around, they at least went through the \n     effort of first repealing the judicial acts that stood in \n     their way. Now--they'll just leave them be; especially since \n     they would need to repeal not two, but more than 60 \n     decisions.\n       I do not want to return to the legal side of the case at \n     this time. Everybody who wanted to understand something--has \n     long since understood everything. Nobody is seriously waiting \n     for an admission of guilt from me. It is hardly likely that \n     somebody today would believe me if I were to say that I \n     really did steal all the oil produced by my company.\n       But neither does anybody believe that an acquittal in the \n     YUKOS case is possible in a Moscow court.\n       Notwithstanding, I want to talk to you about hope. Hope--\n     the main thing in life.\n       I remember the end of the '80s of the last century. I was \n     25 then. Our country was living on hope of freedom, hope that \n     we would be able to achieve happiness for ourselves and for \n     our children.\n       We lived on this hope. In some ways, it did materialise, in \n     others--it did not. The responsibility for why this hope was \n     not realized all the way, and not for everybody, probably \n     lies on our entire generation, myself included.\n       I remember too the end of the last decade and the beginning \n     of the present, current one. By then I was 35. We were \n     building the best oil company in Russia. We were putting up \n     sports complexes and cultural centres, laying roads, and \n     resurveying and developing dozens of new fields; we started \n     development of the East Siberian reserves and were \n     introducing new technologies. In short,--we were doing all \n     those things that Rosneft, which has taken possession of \n     Yukos, is so proud of today.\n       Thanks to a significant increase in oil production, \n     including as the result of our successes, the country was \n     able to take advantage of a favourable oil situation. We felt \n     hope that the period of convulsions and unrest--was behind us \n     at last, and that, in the conditions of stability that had \n     been achieved with great effort and sacrifice, we would be \n     able to peacefully build ourselves a new life, a great \n     country.\n       Alas, this hope too has yet to be justified. Stability has \n     come to look like stagnation. Society has stopped in its \n     tracks. Although hope still lives. It lives on even here, in \n     the Khamovnichesky courtroom, when I am already just this \n     side of 50 years old.\n       With the coming of a new President (and more than two years \n     have already passed since that time), hope appeared once \n     again for many of my fellow citizens too. Hope that Russia \n     would yet become a modern country with a developed civil \n     society. Free from the arbitrary behaviour of officials, free \n     from corruption, free from unfairness and lawlessness.\n       It is clear that this can not happen all by itself; or in \n     one day. But to pretend that we are developing, while in \n     actuality,--we are merely standing in one place or sliding \n     backwards, even if it is behind the cloak of noble \n     conservatism,--is no longer possible. Impossible and simply \n     dangerous for the country.\n       It is not possible to reconcile oneself with the notion \n     that people who call themselves patriots so tenaciously \n     resist any change that impacts their feeding trough or \n     ability to get away with anything. It is enough to recall \n     art. 108 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian \n     Federation--arresting businessmen for filing of tax returns \n     by bureaucrats. And yet it is precisely the sabotage of \n     reforms that is depriving our country of prospects. This is \n     not patriotism, but rather hypocrisy.\n       I am ashamed to see how certain persons--in the past, \n     respected by me--are attempting to justify unchecked \n     bureaucratic behaviour and lawlessness. They exchange their \n     reputation for a life of ease, privileges and sops.\n       Luckily, not all are like that, and there are ever more of \n     the other kind.\n       It makes me proud to know that even after 7 years of \n     persecutions, not a single one of the thousands of YUKOS \n     employees has agreed to become a false witness, to sell their \n     soul and conscience.\n       Dozens of people have personally experienced threats, have \n     been cut off from family, and have been thrown in jail. Some \n     have been tortured. But, even after losing their health and \n     years of their lives, people have still kept the thing they \n     deemed to be most important, human dignity.\n       Those who started this shameful case, Biryukov, Karimov and \n     others, have contemptuously called us ``entrepreneurs'' \n     [], regarding us as low-lifes, capable of \n     anything just to protect our prosperity and avoid prison.\n       The years have passed. So who are the low-lifes now? Who is \n     it that have lied, tortured, and taken hostages, all for the \n     sake of money and out of cowardice before their bosses?\n       And this they called ``the sovereign's business'' \n     []!\n       Shameful. I am ashamed for my country.\n       I think all of us understand perfectly well--the \n     significance of our trial extends far beyond the scope of my \n     fate and Platon's, and even the fates of all those who have \n     guiltlessly suffered in the course of the sweeping massacre \n     of YUKOS, those I found myself unable to protect, but about \n     whom I remember every day.\n       Let us ask ourselves: what must be going through the head \n     of the entrepreneur, the high-level organiser of production, \n     or simply any ordinary educated, creative person, looking \n     today at our trial and knowing that its result is absolutely \n     predictable?\n       The obvious conclusion a thinking person can make is \n     chilling in its stark simplicity: the siloviki bureaucracy \n     can do anything. There is no right of private property \n     ownership. A person who collides with ``the system'' has no \n     rights whatsoever.\n       Even though they are enshrined in the law, rights are not \n     protected by the courts. Because the courts are either also \n     afraid, or are themselves a part of ``the system''. Should it \n     come as a surprise to anyone then that thinking people do not \n     aspire to self- realisation here, in Russia?\n       Who is going to modernise the economy? Prosecutors? \n     Policemen? Chekists? We already tried such a modernization--\n     it did not work. We were able to build a hydrogen bomb, and \n     even a missile, but we still can not build--our own good, \n     modern television, our own inexpensive, competitive, modern \n     automobile, our own modern mobile phone and a whole pile of \n     other modern goods as well.\n       But then we have learnt how to beautifully display others' \n     obsolete models produced in our country and an occasional \n     creation of Russian inventors, which, if they ever do find a \n     use, it will certainly be in some other country.\n       Whatever happened with last year's presidential initiatives \n     in the realm of industrial policy? Have they been buried? \n     They offer the real chance to kick the oil addiction.\n\n[[Page S10343]]\n\n       Why? Because what the country needs is not one Korolev, and \n     not one Sakharov under the protective wing of the all-\n     powerful Beria and his million-strong armed host, but \n     hundreds of thousands of ``korolevs'' and ``sakharovs'', \n     under the protection of fair and comprehensible laws and \n     independent courts, which will give these laws life, and not \n     just a place on a dusty shelf, as they did in their day--with \n     the Constitution of 1937.\n       Where are these ``korolevs'' and ``sakharovs'' today? Have \n     they left the country? Are they preparing to leave? Have they \n     once again gone off into internal emigration? Or taken cover \n     amongst the grey bureaucrats in order not to fall under the \n     steamroller of ``the system''?\n       We can and must change this.\n       How is Moscow going to become the financial centre of \n     Eurasia if our prosecutors, ``just like'' 20 and 50 years \n     ago, are directly and unambiguously calling in a public trial \n     for the desire to increase the production and market \n     capitalisation of a private company--to be ruled a criminally \n     mercenary objective, for which a person ought to be locked up \n     for 14 years? Under one sentence a company that paid more tax \n     than anyone else, except Gazprom, but still underpaid taxes; \n     and with the second sentence it's obvious that there's \n     nothing to tax since the taxable item was stolen.\n       A country that tolerates a situation where the siloviki \n     bureaucracy holds tens and even hundreds of thousands of \n     talented entrepreneurs, managers, and ordinary people in jail \n     in its own interests, instead of and together with criminals, \n     this is a sick country.\n       A state that destroys its best companies, which are ready \n     to become global champions; a country that holds its own \n     citizens in contempt, trusting only the bureaucracy and the \n     special services--is a sick state.\n       Hope--the main engine of big reforms and transformations, \n     the guarantor of their success. If hope fades, if it comes to \n     be supplanted by profound disillusionment--who and what will \n     be able to lead our Russia out of the new stagnation?\n       I will not be exaggerating if I say that millions of eyes \n     throughout all of Russia and throughout the whole world are \n     watching for the outcome of this trial.\n       They are watching with the hope that Russia will after all \n     become a country of freedom and of the law, where the law \n     will be above the bureaucratic official.\n       Where supporting opposition parties will cease being a \n     cause for reprisals.\n       Where the special services will protect the people and the \n     law, and not the bureaucracy from the people and the law.\n       Where human rights will no longer depend on the mood of the \n     tsar. Good or evil.\n       Where, on the contrary, the power will truly be dependent \n     on the citizens, and the court--only on law and God. Call \n     this conscience if you prefer.\n       I believe, this--is how it will be.\n       I am not at all an ideal person, but I am a person with an \n     idea. For me, as for anybody, it is hard to live in jail, and \n     I do not want to die there.\n       But if I have to I will not hesitate. The things I believe \n     in are worth dying for. I think I have proven this.\n       And you opponents? What do you believe in? That the bosses \n     are always right? Do you believe in money? In the impunity of \n     ``the system''?\n       Your Honour!\n       There is much more than just the fates of two people in \n     your hands. Right here and right now, the fate of every \n     citizen of our country is being decided. Those who, on the \n     streets of Moscow and Chita, Peter and Tomsk, and other \n     cities and settlements, are not counting on becoming victims \n     of police lawlessness, who have set up a business, built a \n     house, achieved success and want to pass it on to their \n     children, not to raiders in uniform, and finally, those who \n     want to honourably carry out their duty for a fair wage, not \n     expecting that they can be fired at any moment by corrupt \n     bosses under just about any pretext.\n       This is not about me and Platon--at any rate, not only \n     about us. It is about hope for many citizens of Russia. About \n     hope that tomorrow, the court will be able to protect their \n     rights, if yet some other bureaucrats-officials get it into \n     their head to brazenly and demonstratively violate these \n     rights.\n       I know, there are people, I have named them in the trial, \n     who want to keep us in jail. To keep us there forever! \n     Indeed, they do not even conceal this, publicly reminding \n     everyone about the existence of a ``bottomless'' case file.\n       They want to show: they are above the law, they will always \n     accomplish whatever they might ``think up''. So far they have \n     achieved the opposite: out of ordinary people they have \n     created a symbol of the struggle with arbitrariness. But for \n     them, a conviction is essential, so they would not become \n     ``scapegoats''.\n       I want to hope that the court will stand up to their \n     psychological pressure. We all know through whom it will \n     come.\n       I want an independent judiciary to become a reality and the \n     norm in my country, I want the phrase from the Soviet times \n     about ``the most just court in the world'' to stop sounding \n     just as ironic today as they did back then. I want us not to \n     leave the dangerous symbols of a totalitarian system as an \n     inheritance for our children and grandchildren.\n       Everybody understands that your verdict in this case--\n     whatever it will be--is going to become part of the history \n     of Russia. Furthermore, it is going to form it for the future \n     generation. All the names--those of the prosecutors, and of \n     the judges--will remain in history, just like they have \n     remained in history after the infamous Soviet trials.\n       Your Honour, I can imagine perfectly well that this must \n     not be very easy at all for you--perhaps even frightening--\n     and I wish you courage!\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. This is how Mr. Khordokovsky saw the broader implications \nof his trial:\n\n       I will not be exaggerating if I say that millions of eyes \n     throughout all of Russia and throughout the whole world are \n     watching for the outcome of this trial. They are watching \n     with the hope that Russia will after all become a country of \n     freedom and of the law. . . . Where supporting opposition \n     parties will cease being a cause for reprisals. Where the \n     special services will protect the people and the law, and not \n     the bureaucracy from the people and the law. Where human \n     rights will no longer depend on the mood of the tsar--good or \n     evil. Where, on the contrary, the power will truly be \n     dependent on the citizens and the court, only on law and God. \n     For me, as for anybody, it is hard to live in jail, and I do \n     not want to die there. But if I have to I will not hesitate. \n     The things I believe in are worth dying for.\n\n  That there are still men and women of such spirit in Russia is a \ncause for hope. Eventually maybe not this year, or next year, or the \nyear after that, but eventually these Russians will occupy their \nrightful place as the leaders of their nation--for equal justice can be \ndelayed, and human dignity can be denied, but not forever.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to thank and congratulate the \nSenator from Arizona for his important and impassioned comments about \nthe situation in Russia regarding the rights of Mr. Khordokovsky, and I \nwould associate myself with those comments.\n  I would say to him, though, one thing. He asked the question, how do \nyou trust Russia? That is precisely why this treaty is so important. A \ntreaty is not built on trust. No one taught us that more than in those \nfamous words of President Reagan: Trust, but verify. We do not have \nverification today. We are sitting here with no verification. We are in \na forced position of ``trust,'' where we do not necessarily. So the \nsooner we get this treaty ratified, the sooner we provide a foundation \nunderneath the important questions Senator McCain asked; which is, if \nyou cannot trust them, you have to have verification. The whole point \nis, you build a relationship even in the worst of times so your \ncountry--our country--is more stable and more protected.\n  During the worst of the Soviet Union, during the worst years of \nconfrontation, we still built up a series of treaties of arms \nagreements and various other kinds of agreements in order to try to \ntamp down the potential for hostility. Our hope is, obviously, that we \ncan do that as soon as possible here.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I wish to address a couple of points raised \nby Senator Kyl earlier, and I will address a good number more as the \ndebate goes forward. Let me be very clear for the record ahead of time, \nbecause he opened his floor remarks this morning by asserting we don't \nhave time to be able to consider this treaty before the end of the \nyear. Then he said that even though the START I treaty--which I \nreferred to yesterday and he specifically referred to my comments--he \nsaid even though it was completed in 4 days--maybe 4 plus, slightly--he \nsaid it wasn't done under the same circumstances. It didn't have to \ncompete with other legislation and so forth. Well, that is incorrect. \nSo let's set the record straight.\n  On the same day the Senate held a cloture vote on the START I treaty \nand votes on two amendments related to the treaty, on that same day, it \nvoted on the final passage of a tax bill. The following day, when the \nSenate voted on another amendment related to the treaty, it also agreed \nto the conference report on Interior appropriations, passed the DC \nappropriations bill, and debated and held two rollcall votes on the \nForeign Operations appropriations bill. The following day, it\n\n[[Page S10344]]\n\ncompleted the final passage vote on the START treaty. So if our \npredecessor Senate had the ability to do START I while it passed three \nor four other bills and held four or five separate votes on those other \nitems, I think it is very clear we have the ability here to be able to \ndo this treaty in the next days.\n  More importantly, the Senate has been considering this treaty not \njust for the day and a half we have now been on it. We went on this \ntreaty yesterday and some people chose to not even come to the floor \nand talk about it. Now we are back here waiting for amendments and no \none has yet chosen on the other side to come and bring an amendment. We \nare ready to vote on the treaty. Fifty-eight Democratic Senators are \nready to vote on the treaty. The only thing we are waiting for is the \npeople who say we don't have time, who haven't brought an amendment to \nthe floor. I clearly smell a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy strategy \ngoing on here. But they have to know that when flights are disrupted \nnext week or people can't get home, we are here to do business, and I \nthink it will be clear why we are not able to. So we are going to stay \nhere. We have made that clear. The majority leader has made it clear, \nand the President and the Vice President made it clear. We are prepared \nto proceed forward on any amendment with respect to understandings, \ndeclarations, or conditions they wish to bring, and certainly to have a \nrobust debate.\n  I will also reiterate that starting in June of last year, the Foreign \nRelations Committee was briefed at least five times during the talks \nwith the Russians. That is while the talks were going on. So we have a \ngroup of Senators almost 60 strong who at one time or another over a \nyear and a half have been following these negotiations very closely. \nThey have been briefed down in the secure facilities. They have been \nbriefed by the negotiators, by the military, by the intelligence \ncommunity. The Intelligence Committee has weighed in. The Armed \nServices Committee has weighed in. The National Security Group has had \nan opportunity to work on this. Since the treaty was submitted, there \nhave been 12 open and classified hearings with more than 20 witnesses. \nThe Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff Chairman, the Commander of the Strategic Command, and the \nDirector of the Missile Defense Agency have all urged us to pass this \ntreaty.\n  The question is beginning to be asked not why should we do it now; \nthe question is why aren't we doing it now. I hope we can get some \namendments and begin to proceed.\n  At this point I might share a couple of other thoughts while we are \nwaiting for a couple of other colleagues who requested time to speak. \nSenator Kyl asked the question: What do we get out of this treaty? He \njuxtaposed what he said the Russians get versus what we get and seemed \nto imply we are not getting very much. Well, I can assure the Senator \nfrom Arizona that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the \nSecretary of Defense, the leaders of our Strategic Command, and others \ndon't come before the Congress willy-nilly just to say, Hey, do this, \nbecause we don't get anything out of it. Every single one of them has \narticulated very clearly how they believe this treaty strengthens \nAmerica's national security, advantages our leadership in the world, \nand positions us to be able to deal more effectively with Iran and \nNorth Korea.\n  I have to say to my colleagues, you cede the right to come to the \nfloor of the Senate and talk seriously about Iran and North Korea if \nyou can't talk seriously about the ways in which this treaty enhances \nour ability to be able to put leverage on those countries. Before we \npushed the so-called reset button with Russia, we didn't have their \ncooperation with respect to Iran. In fact, the Russians were very \nskeptical about the intelligence we were offering and putting on the \ntable. It wasn't until we sat down with them face to face and went \nthrough that that they became alarmed and they began to see, indeed, \nthis question of how we respond to Iran is deadly serious. As a \nconsequence of that, Russia joined with the United States.\n  I agree with my colleagues, the mere fact they are joining us is not \na reason to embrace a treaty if the treaty doesn't do all the other \nthings you need to provide stability and enhance your security. But \nwhen it does all those other things and you know the consequences of \nturning your back on all of those achievements is going to create a \nnegative relationship, you ought to try to weigh that a little bit. It \nseems to me when someone's point of view comes specifically from the \neconomic engagement, business world, somebody such as Steve Forbes \nwrites that this is important to the economic component of our \nrelationship and to that component of the reset button, I think we can \nsee the breadth of impact a treaty such as this can have.\n  Let me say a few more words about what we do get out of this. First \nof all--and this is as significant as any reason there is to be \nconsidering this--we get nuclear stability. The fact is that nuclear \nstability enhances the relationship between the countries so we can do \na lot of other things that assist in stabilizing this important \nrelationship in a time of crisis. The fact is, as I mentioned earlier--\nwe all know this--the United States and Russia possess 90 percent of \nthe world's nuclear weapons. Any single one of those weapons \naccidentally released, stolen, or the materials in them, has the \nability to be able to destroy any American city. That is a reality \ntoday. So both countries have decided it is in both countries' \ninterests to reduce the dangers that arise when you have \nmisunderstandings or mistrust without the verification that builds the \ntrust, and it is important to establish limits on those weapons in \norder to achieve that.\n  Predictability is what comes with this treaty. Transparency is what \ncomes with this treaty. Accountability comes with this treaty. Without \nthis treaty, we don't have the right to count their warheads. With this \ntreaty, we have a specific counting and identifying mechanism which \nwill provide for greater accountability and greater stability.\n  Secretary Gates said very clearly: ``Russia is currently above the \ntreaty limits in terms of its numbers.'' So they are going to have to \ntake down warheads. How could it not be in the interests of the United \nStates to have Russia reduce the number of warheads it has today?\n  There are many other reasons. I see my colleague from North Dakota \nhas arrived. I will go through a number of these others as the \nopportunity presents itself later. But I think there are a host of \nreasons that are very clear, and they are part of the record already \nand we will highlight them as we go forward, as to what we get out of \nthis treaty and why this is directly in the interests of our country, \nand that is the only reason the President of the United States is \nsubmitting this treaty to the Senate. We need to pay close attention to \nthe rationale our military and intelligence community has laid out to \nus of why they would like this treaty--as Jim Clapper, the head of the \nintelligence community has said, the sooner the better, the quicker, \nthe sooner, the better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak in \nfavor of the New START treaty and to do so strongly.\n  First let me say I have been listening to Chairman Kerry and Senator \nLugar discuss this treaty. I think they have been clear and compelling \nwith respect to the arguments they have advanced. I think Senator Kerry \nhas made abundantly clear why this treaty is entirely in the interests \nof the United States.\n  This treaty simultaneously takes real steps toward reducing the \nnumber of nuclear arms in the world while also recognizing the \nimportant role these weapons play in our national defense. Above all \nelse, I believe this treaty is stabilizing, which should be the goal of \nany action related to nuclear weapons.\n  I currently serve as chairman of the Senate ICBM Coalition. North \nDakota proudly hosts the only Air Force base in the country that has \ntwo nuclear missions. Minot Air Force Base houses both ICBMs and \nnuclear bombers. As a result, North Dakotans have a special \nappreciation for the awesome power of these weapons and their critical \nrole in our national security. While most people approach the existence \nof these weapons purely from an academic standpoint, we in North Dakota \nare confronted with their reality on a daily\n\n[[Page S10345]]\n\nbasis. Still, we as North Dakotans are only observers. I assure my \ncolleagues there is nothing more sobering than visiting a missile \nfacility and talking with the young men and women who stand every day \nas the sentinels of our security, or talking with bomber pilots as they \nprepare to fly halfway around the world to patrol the skies for our \nprotection, which I was fortunate to do this summer. Let me say \nparenthetically, these young people are extraordinary. We can be \nincredibly proud of the young men and women of our military. The \nquality of these young people is extraordinary. These brave men and \nwomen live the reality of nuclear deterrence and the stability and the \nsecurity it brings to our Nation.\n  As we approach this treaty, our first consideration must be its \nimplications for our ability to maintain deterrence and stability and \nour overall national security. My colleagues on the ICBM Coalition and \nI watched closely throughout the negotiation of this treaty. We \nattended dozens of meetings and briefings to understand the impacts \nthis treaty would have on our national security. I even visited Russia \nshortly after the treaty was presented to the world and met with many \nof their top military leadership. After careful and thorough analysis \nof this treaty, I can say with confidence that this treaty will \nstrengthen our national security. I have no doubt about that fact. \nThere is no question the treaty will reduce the number of launchers \nthat deliver nuclear weapons. This treaty has real cuts to those \nforces--cuts that perhaps go even deeper than the ICBM Coalition \ninitially would have liked. But after speaking at length with our \nmilitary leaders, the men and women responsible for developing the \nplans for the use of these weapons, it is clear to me the numbers \ncontained in this treaty remain sufficient to ensure the success of the \nnuclear deterrence mission.\n  They tell me that while absolute numbers are important, there is no \nprecise number that assures our security and enhances our nuclear \nstability. The bottom line is that we must maintain enough launchers to \nhave a credible and secure deterrent that promotes stability in times \nof crisis. This treaty does that. It not only maintains our nuclear \ndeterrent, but enshrines it for coming decades.\n  Beyond protecting a sufficient, credible, nuclear deterrent, this \ntreaty advances our national security in other ways as well. President \nRonald Reagan famously said: ``Trust, but verify.'' However, for over a \nyear, we have been unable to inspect Russia's weapons. That is not in \nour interests. It risks developments that harm our national security \ngoing undetected or even misunderstandings that could lead to a \nnational security crisis. This treaty allows us to resume the extensive \nand intrusive inspections that began under the first START treaty \nsigned by the first President Bush and ratified by this body on a vote \nof 93 to 6.\n  This treaty also moves our nuclear security forward at a more \nadvanced level. Although I doubt we can ever rid the world of all \nnuclear weapons, we are no longer in the midst of a nuclear arms race, \nand thank God for that. By signaling our commitment to reducing our \nnuclear arsenal while still maintaining a sufficient and credible \ndeterrent, this treaty will advance our interests in halting nuclear \nproliferation.\n  The single biggest threat to our Nation would be a terrorist \norganization with a nuclear weapon. This treaty will enhance our \nability to deter the development of nuclear weapons by rogue states, \nand it will reduce the risk that nuclear arms races around the globe \ndestabilize regions of the world or create opportunities for terrorists \nto acquire nuclear weapons.\n  Many treaty opponents argue this treaty may weaken our national \nsecurity. After closely reviewing their concerns and consulting with \nexperts, I do not find their arguments persuasive. Let's look at those \narguments in turn.\n  First, some opponents greatly inflate the importance of a short \nphrase in the nonbinding preamble of the treaty to argue that it would \nsomehow constrain our missile defense abilities. This ignores the \nremaining 17 pages of treaty text and 165 pages of protocol text. Let \nme say, I have long favored missile defense. I have at many times been \nin the minority on my own side on that question. If I believed this \nprevented our creating a stable and secure missile defense, I would not \nfavor the treaty.\n  This treaty doesn't do that. I think it is as clear as it can be. \nOther than limiting the conversion of existing ICBM launchers to \nmissile defense interceptors, which our military leaders have already \nsaid would be more expensive than building new launchers--and more \nimportant, in my view--would degrade our ICBM capability, there are no \nrestrictions on our missile defense--none.\n  Others argue the treaty will restrict future conventional missile \ncapabilities. That is simply not accurate. The treaty fully allows for \nthe use of conventional missiles. We as a nation are free to \nunilaterally decide what conventional capability we want. We also hear \nthat Russia's tactical weapons should be included in the treaty. I have \nalso been one who has long favored restrictions on tactical nuclear \nweapons. While I recognize the importance of addressing that threat, a \nstrategic arms treaty, by definition, is not the place to debate them. \nNever in history have tactical weapons been included in treaties aimed \nat strategic weapons. That hasn't stopped this Senate from ratifying \nthose agreements, nor has it stopped them for serving our national \nsecurity interests for decades.\n  I am quick to recognize that tactical weapons, at some point, can \nbecome a strategic issue. The problem we confront is never before in \nthe context of a strategic agreement have we included tactical systems. \nThat is the reality.\n  Frankly, I would very much like to have tactical weapons included in \nthis treaty. That would be my preference. But that is not the reality \nof the history of these negotiations.\n  Mr. President, some argue the number of total warheads goes too low. \nHowever, the treaty allows nearly twice as many warheads as launchers. \nMore important, the number of total launchers available is a far more \nimportant deterrence for our national security than the number of \nwarheads.\n  This treaty shows the administration understands the critical need to \nmaintain a sufficient number of launchers to assure continued nuclear \nstability. With that said, like many other military and civilian \nexperts on our nuclear forces, I would be extremely wary of any efforts \nto further decrease the number of our launchers. I have argued \nrepeatedly, as chairman of the ICBM caucus, against further reductions \nat this stage. I believe that is a prudent position.\n  Finally, opponents argue that the administration has not committed to \nan investment in the modernization of our nuclear weapons and \ninfrastructure. This argument completely ignores the dramatic increase \nin the modernization funding the President proposed in his budget. As \nchairman of the Senate Budget Committee, I can attest to the fact that \nthis increase is unprecedented. This commitment ensures that the \nremaining launchers and warheads will be reliable and effective in the \nevent we ever need to launch them.\n  In short, the arguments advanced by those who claim this treaty would \nhurt our national security are not convincing. That is not just my \nconclusion; that is the conclusion of former Secretaries of Defense and \nformer Secretaries of State from both the Republican Party and the \nDemocratic Party and previous administrations, as well as current and \nformer military officers who have all publicly stated that this treaty \nwill advance, not harm, our national security.\n  Let me say I have two major Air Force bases in my State: Grand Forks \nAir Force Base and Minot Air Force Base. I spend a significant amount \nof time talking to our top Air Force leadership. I have consulted with \nthem closely on this matter, as chairman of the ICBM caucus. I am \nabsolutely persuaded by the best military thinking available to me that \nthis treaty is entirely in the national security interests of the \nUnited States. I believe that is clear.\n  Mr. President, I am proud of my record in the Senate on national \nsecurity over the past 23 years, especially when it comes to our \nnuclear arsenal. For generations, the young men and women who have \nserved at Minot and Grand Forks Air Force Bases have declared peace as \ntheir profession, as they defended the United States from global \nthreats through nuclear deterrence. Though they may not be recognized \nas publicly today as they were 50 years ago, the airmen who stand guard \nat Minot remain at the vanguard of our\n\n[[Page S10346]]\n\nNation's most important military mission. I would never do anything to \nundermine the mission they carry out every day.\n  After a careful review and discussions with our Nation's best nuclear \nexperts, both those in uniform and those who do not wear the uniform, I \nam confident this treaty makes our Nation safer and more secure.\n  Mr. President, I will strongly support approving this treaty, and I \ncall on my colleagues to join me in that effort.\n  I want to conclude as I began, by thanking the chairman and the \nranking member for their leadership on this matter. It is in the \nhighest tradition of the United States Senate. Working together in a \nbipartisan--really nonpartisan--way, Senator Lugar and Senator Kerry \nhave provided vital leadership to this body and this country. We are \nall very deeply in their debt. I express my gratitude to them both for \nthe statesmanlike quality they have brought to this discussion and \ndebate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, as we are waiting for other Senators coming \nto the floor, hopefully, to offer amendments to the new START Treaty, I \nhave some interesting information that I think is relevant to our \ndiscussion today.\n  As has been suggested by other Senators, the so-called Nunn-Lugar \ncooperative threat reduction program, in operation for the last 19 \nyears, has made possible, through operations of U.S. military and U.S. \ncontractors, working with their counterparts in Russia, the destruction \nof very sizable amounts of nuclear weapons--threats that we took very \nseriously in 1991, and that I hope Americans take very seriously \ncurrently.\n  I have just received a report that, since October--and that is \nspecifically during the month of November--we have eliminated eight \nmore SLBMs in Russia. We have secured 10 more nuclear weapon transport \ntrains and neutralized 100-plus more metric tons of chemical weapons \nagent.\n  I mention this because I have been fortunate enough to receive \nmonthly, at least for the last 15 years, similar reports. I have a \nscoreboard in my office that, in fact, illustrates, first of all, that \n7,599 strategic nuclear warheads aimed at the United States have been \ndeactivated through the cooperative threat reduction program. Each one \nof those warheads, as I have pointed out, without being melodramatic, \nmay have been sufficient to completely eliminate my home city of \nIndianapolis.\n  I take seriously the treaty we are looking at now, not so much in \nterms of the numbers of reductions the treaty calls for, but simply \neven if 1,550 warheads are left on both sides, it is an existential \nproblem to both of our countries that we need to take seriously.\n  In any event, in addition to the 7,599 strategic nuclear warheads \ndeactivated, 791 ICBMs have been destroyed. These were the missiles on \nwhich the strategic nuclear warheads were located. So by taking the \nwarheads off of the missiles, then taking down the 791 intercontinental \nballistic missiles and destroying them--and then 498 ICBM silos in \nwhich these missiles were located were destroyed; 180 ICBM mobile \nlaunchers were destroyed; 659 submarine launched ballistic missiles \nwere eliminated, SLBMs; 492 SLBM launchers were eliminated; 32 nuclear \nsubmarines capable of carrying and launching ballistic missiles have \nbeen destroyed; and 155 bombers were eliminated.\n  We are talking about so-called carriers. We talk in the treaty about \nmaybe 1,550 warheads left, 700 carriers on both sides. For those who \nhave not followed closely these arguments over the years, these are the \nelements that have been aimed at us, and these are the vehicles that \nwould have made possible what they were doing.\n  Anecdotally, without taking the time of other Senators, I will say \nthat during one of my visits with former Senator Sam Nunn, from \nGeorgia, we went to a site in Siberia where, in fact, a missile had \nbeen taken out of the ground. This was a missile that we were told had \n10 warheads--the multiple reentry vehicle, where you could put multiple \nmissiles on one vehicle. We were in the silo. It was like a large tube \nthat had an elevator going down. I don't know on which floor we finally \narrived, but it was a floor in the silo where the Russians stayed as \nguards or as watch officers. What authority they had was not clear in \nterms of actually launching the missile or following the orders, \nwherever they may have come from. But the impression I had from that \nvisit to the silo, before it was destroyed that very day--and we have \npictures of it being destroyed in the office. I explain that this is \nnot a nuclear weapon being destroyed, it was just a silo in the ground. \nBut around a table at which the Russians who were on duty sat were \npictures of American cities. These were ostensibly the targets of the \n10 warheads. It has a chilling effect as you go around to discover \nwhich cities they are.\n  Are they cities that I represent on the chart? The fact is, that was \nthe intent.\n  It was made known to us in the United States that our total \npopulation--not the occasional nuclear terrorist attack--was at risk. I \nmention all of this once again not as a melodramatic presentation on a \nvery serious treaty, but we are talking about something that is very \nfundamental. During the course of the debate I have heard several of my \ncolleagues say--and I think they are mistaken--that right now the \nAmerican people are focused, as we all are, on how to create jobs, how \nto make a difference in the economy, and how to bring new hope into the \nlives of people whose confidence has been destroyed or badly shaken. \nThat is our paramount objective. But at the same time, these problems \noccur in a world that does not necessarily wish us well and is prepared \nto leave us in our domestic economy to work our problems out while the \nrest of the world necessarily takes time out.\n  I am not one who envisions, after all of this time, a nuclear attack \nusing ICBMs and the carriers that we are talking about. I accept the \nfact, as a practical matter, that by and large these weapons are \nmaintained for the security of the countries involved. But at the same \ntime, it seems to me to have been prudent throughout the years to have \ntaken the steps we could to take the warheads off of the missiles, \ndestroy the missiles, destroy the silos, and take up the cable in the \nfields around them and, in essence, to eliminate a lot of the threat.\n  My scoreboard starts out with 13,300 nuclear warheads. Whether that \nwas the precise number, we are not sure. How did we arrive at that \nnumber? We literally had boots on the ground. The subject was discussed \nfrequently today.\n  The dilemma I foresee, and I am not trying to borrow trouble, is that \nthe boots on the ground, in terms of specifics of the START treaty, \nended, as we now know, December 5, 2009. Most of us in the Senate knew \nof that date. We lamented the fact that was occurring. But the fact is, \nwe have not been able to take action until today's debate to remedy \nthat. We must do so.\n  This is not a question of a discretionary treaty that somehow might \nbe held over to a more convenient time. The facts of life are that even \nthe program I have discovered, the Cooperative Threat Reduction \nProgram, has diminishing results because the Russians are waiting for \nwork on this fundamental treaty.\n  In due course, even though we may appropriate in our Defense budget, \nas I hope we will, substantial moneys for the Nunn-Lugar program next \nyear, our ability to continue to work with the Russian military, \nRussian contractors outside a situation in which there is no START \ntreaty, and which the Russians may feel there is no expectation of a \nnew START treaty, could mean the monthly reports I have cited today, \nand most specifically the one for November of this year, may cease \ncoming to my office. The number of warheads removed, the number of \nmissiles destroyed and so forth may simply either stop or we may have \nno idea what, in fact, the Russians have decided to do.\n  I appreciate in past debates some of my colleagues have said--and I \nthink they were mistaken, but I understand their point of view--this is \nRussia's problem. Why were American taxpayer funds ever involved in \nhelping Russians take warheads off missiles, destroying missiles, \ndestroying submarines, in other words to destroy weapons that were \naimed at us?\n\n[[Page S10347]]\n\n  Phrased in those terms, that does not seem to be a sensible bargain; \nthat if you have cooperative threat reduction, and Russians now for 19 \nyears have allowed us to work in their country on their sites where \nthese weapons were located, with not only transparency, an actual feel \nof the hardware--the silo I was in was real. It was not by electronic \nmeans that we found it or surveillance of leaks from diplomacy. It was \nvery real. So was the submarine base I was invited to visit at Sevmash \nentirely out of the blue during one occasion in a visit to Russia.\n  Why was I asked to go there? Because they had a feeling, and \ncorrectly, that if they presented to me the fact that there were in \nexistence then six Typhoon submarines, that each one of them had 200 \nmissiles, small missiles on them, that even though Tom Clancy finally \ndiscovered the Typhoons in the ``Hunt for Red October'' story, the \nRussians may have been operating these submarines up and down our \neastern coast for as long as 20 years, whether we knew about it or \nnot--if you saw the submarines, the largest ever produced by any \ncountry, and with the 200 warheads, there were chip shots into New York \nor Philadelphia or any of our large eastern coast metropolitan areas--\nwhether citizens there ever knew there was a threat or not is \nimmaterial. There was--and a very substantial one. Yet the Russians \nwere inviting us to consider the destruction of these huge submarines \nbecause the work is very complex, extraordinarily expensive, and it was \nbeyond their abilities at that point.\n  We could take a choice, to leave six Typhoons in the world that might \nbegin to cruise again, maybe someplace else, or work with them to \ndestroy them. I am here to say that even after several years, only \nthree of the six have been destroyed. It is an extremely complex \noperation.\n  This is why we need to have treaty arrangements with the Russians. So \nthere are formal reasons why their government and our government might \nbe prepared to send our military personnel, our civilian contractors, \nothers who might wish to work with us on projects that we believe \nmutually are important because--and I will give just one more \nillustration--this is very subjective.\n  But on one occasion, I was surprised, although I should not have \nbeen, that many nuclear warheads, when they are removed from missiles, \nare not destroyed. It is difficult to destroy a warhead, very expensive \nand complex, dangerous for the personnel involved in it.\n  The Russians did not have very many facilities to do this. So they \nput many of these warheads into caves or caverns. I was invited into \none of these caverns on one occasion. I saw warheads lying there almost \nlike corpses in a morgue, which is what it reminded me of. There were \nsmall captions at the top of each of those corpses, in essence, which \nat least gave--and the Russians told me in translating what was on \nthere--a history of that warhead: when it had been created, what sort \nof servicing it had received over the years.\n  I mention this because these particular warheads were not inert \nmatter like sporting goods material. For the safety of the Russians who \nwere involved, they require servicing, apparently, from time to time. \nOne of the reasons why Russians always ask U.S. military and \ncontractors to remove the oldest warheads first was that none of us \nhave had that much of a history as to how long these warheads survive \nwithout potential ``accidents,'' something that could make a huge \ndifference in this particular case for those who were in proximity to \nthat particular cave.\n  It is a crucial matter for them and for us that we find solutions to \nthis. This is why, I believe, there is urgency in considering the New \nSTART treaty, urgency in doing so right now, as a matter of fact, as \nrapidly as possible, and reentering Americans onto the scene in Russia \nand, in reciprocal manner, accepting Russians who will be interested in \nour situation. Because this is important for our two countries, and it \nis important for many innocent people who were never a part of the \ndesigns of these weapons but could, in fact, be vastly affected in the \nevent that we make a mistake. We will make a mistake if we fail to act \npromptly, knowing what we do about the situation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I have said a couple times, during the \ncourse of our opening comments and subsequently, what a privilege it is \nto be working with Senator Lugar on this treaty. I listened to him \ntalk, as I have heard before, about his experiences of traveling over \nto Russia and going through the process of establishing this \nextraordinary program. But the country and the world owe him a huge \ndebt of gratitude for his leadership on this issue. His vision, \ntogether with Senator Nunn, has made a global difference, and he is \nproperly recognized on a global basis for that.\n  So I thank him for his comments calling every colleague to focus on \nthis linkage of the threat reduction program to the START agreement and \nto the relationship that comes out of it. I know Senator Inhofe is \nhere. I want to give him a chance. But I would like to say a few words \nbefore he does about the verification.\n  I think it is important, as we go forward, to be very clear about the \nverification components of this treaty. A number of colleagues have \nrequested the verification regime, and we may yet have further \ndiscussion on it. So let me make as clear as I can, this treaty has \nfully satisfied our intelligence community and our military community \nand our stockpile verification folks as to the verifiability of the \ntreaty.\n  Is it slightly different from what we had before with START I? The \nanswer is yes. But, importantly, I wish to underscore why that \ndifference exists because one colleague sort of raised the issue a \nlittle while ago. I think it was Senator Kyl who talked about why it \nwas we might not have gotten them to do an extension of the START I \ntreaty. Well, the reality is, it takes all parties to be party to that \nextension.\n\n  The fact is, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Belarus all dropped out of the \nnuclear game, and all those weapons were deposited into Russia. They \nwere all party to that original agreement. But Russia made clear to the \nBush administration, long before President Obama came to power, that \nthey were not going to proceed with that same system anymore, and the \nreason was, they saw it as a one-sided structure. They felt they did \nnot get anything out of it. We were the only ones who got something out \nof it. As long as they were not getting something, they made us--put us \non notice, we are not continuing that one.\n  That said, the new START succeeds in streamlining verification and \ntracking procedures, and it creates a new system, a state-of-the-art \ninspection system, and very strict reporting guidelines. The compliance \nand verification measures that are in the New START build on 20 years \nof verification experience, and they appropriately reflect the \ntechnological advances that have been made since 1991, as well as the \ndifference of relationships between the United States and Russia \nbecause of the end of the Cold War.\n  So colleagues need to look at those changes and measure it against \nthe original benchmark, if you will. The fact is, New START's enhanced \nverification measures have a five-pronged approach, five different \ncomponents.\n  One, invasive, onsite inspections.\n  Two, national technical means. We have always had that, but our \nnational technical means have improved significantly. Without \ndiscussing them on the floor, I think colleagues are aware of the \ncapacity of our national technical means.\n  Three, unique identifiers that will be placed on each weapon. We did \nnot have that before. Now we are going to have the ability to track \neach individual weapon, warhead, and count them. That is new. That is \nincreased.\n  Regular data exchange. We gain a great deal. They gain a great deal. \nIt is a mutual process of exchanging data, which provides stability and \nassurances for both sides.\n  Finally, prompt notifications of the movement of any weapons.\n  The New START permits up to 18 short-notice, onsite inspections each \nyear, in order to determine the accuracy of Russia's data and to verify \nthe compliance. The fact is, this new system is every bit as rigorous \nas the system that existed previously.\n  In fact, because of the change I described earlier, the Belarus, \nUkraine,\n\n[[Page S10348]]\n\nKazakhstan change--we had about 70 inspection sites previously, and \nthose were the nuclear facilities in each of those different countries. \nBut since three of them have now denuclearized, the result is, all the \nformer Soviet Union's remaining nuclear weapons are centralized in \nRussia, and they are divided between 35 nuclear facilities.\n  So we go from 70 facilities that we used to have to inspect down to \n35. Thus, the decreasing number of annual inspections from 28 in START \nI to 18 in the New START is almost exactly the equivalent in terms of \nthose allowed under START I because we are inspecting fewer places, and \nthe inspectors are now allowed to gather more types of data during \nthose inspections. The United States is also allowed to use national \ntechnical means, which would be reconnaissance satellites, ground \nstations, ships, all of them, to verify compliance. The treaty \nexpressly prohibits tampering with the other party's national technical \nmeans.\n  Third, Russia has to assign and inform the United States of the \nspecific unique alphanumeric identifiers that are designating the \ndeployed and nondeployed ICBMs and SLBMs and nuclear-capable heavy \nbombers. This information gives us a great deal more inside look with \nrespect to the tracking patterns on Russian equipment throughout the \nfull life cycle of any of those specific systems.\n  Fourth, the treaty requires Russia to regularly provide to the United \nStates the aggregate data on strategic offensive forces, including \nnumbers, locations, and technical characteristics of deployed and \nnondeployed strategic offensive arms.\n  Fifth, the New START establishes a comprehensive notification regime \nallowing us to track the movement of Russia's strategic forces and any \nchanges in the status of their strategic weapons.\n  The fact is, this agreement employs an enormously aggressive, \nforward-leaning, and effective verification system, and it has been \npredicated on decades of our doing this very thing with the same \npeople. This is not new ground we are breaking. We know how to do this. \nWe have built up a certain understanding of each other's capabilities, \neach other's idiosyncracies and resistances. We know how to do this. \nThe verification system designed for this treaty is specifically \ndesigned to be less complicated, less costly, and more effective than \nthe one in the original START treaty.\n  I have a series of quotes, but I want our colleague to have an \nopportunity to speak. I will wait and later share with colleagues the \nnumber of different distinguished, respected, long-serving \npersonalities within the intelligence community--former LTG Jim Clapper \nof the Air Force and others--all of whom have affirmed the ability of \nthis verification system to do the job and protect the interests of the \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from \nMassachusetts for his endurance. I appreciate that.\n  I have to say also to the Senator from Indiana, my good friend, I am \nkind of in a unique position as one who serves on both the Armed \nServices and the Foreign Relations Committee. I disagree with most of \nwhat was just stated by the senior Senator from Massachusetts.\n  One of the concerns I have had is that we have so many people who \nwant to be in on this, who should be in on this, who have been elected. \nWe have new Senators, one who is occupying the chair right now. We have \nSenators Kirk and Manchin. We also have Senators-elect Blunt, Boozman, \nPortman, Moran, Lee, Johnson, Hoeven, Ayotte, Paul, and Rubio. All of \nthem have signed a letter saying: This is very significant. We really \nneed to be a part of this. This is important.\n  It is important in a different way to me than it is to others. I am \nopposed for a number of reasons. I am one of the few bad guys who came \nout initially and said I opposed it.\n  We all know what a strategic arms reduction act is. Initially, when \nwe had two superpowers, it made a lot more sense to me. Frankly, I look \nat this, and I see the concerns I have.\n  Verification--that sounds good. Yes, we will verify. Yet the number \nof verifications, inspections, is like 18 per year in the New START as \nopposed to some 600 over a 15-year period.\n  Modernization is one thing on which we all agree. We have to \nmodernize. But there has to be a way of doing it. We haven't done it \nyet.\n  It was 3 years ago that Secretary Gates said:\n\n       No way can we maintain a credible deterrent and reduce the \n     number of weapons in our stockpile without either resorting \n     to testing our stockpile or pursuing a modernization program.\n\n  That is an area where we all agree. How are we going to do that? \nRight now, I think the generally agreed upon number that it would cost \nover a period of 10 years would be $85 billion. We have right now about \n$600 million that would be coming up in the next budget cycle. We all \nknow how things work around here. We can only commit funds for the next \ncycle. There is no assurance at all that we would be able to come \nthrough with the other $84.5 billion in that period. The modernization \nis not set up in a way where we are in the current year demonstrating \nthe commitment we have to modernize our fleet.\n  The fact that we are handling this in a lameduck session--most of the \nstuff we are trying to cram in right now is what we should have been \ntalking about all year long and have not been. They all fall into a \ncategory where it looks as if things are going to change in the Senate. \nWe know the House, after the November election, is now a Republican-\ndominated House. We know we have gained large numbers in the Senate. We \nalso know there are several of my good colleagues who are up for \nreelection in 2012. I am not sure they all want to join in all of these \nissues coming up at the last minute. This is one of them.\n  I look at the quotes we have--the missile defense issue has not been \naddressed. I know it would take a lot of discussion. There are probably \npotentially, with the new Congress coming in in January, 40 or 50 \ndifferent amendments just addressing the missile defense issue. They \nsay: Well, no, this is not a problem. But anytime you have a unilateral \nstatement that was made--which was made by the Russians early on--that \nthis treaty can only operate and be viable only if the United States of \nAmerica refrains from developing its missile defense capabilities \nquantitatively and qualitatively--that has been stated, and it has been \nstated and reaffirmed more recently when Sergei Lavrov said:\n\n       We have not yet agreed on this [missile defense] issue and \n     we are trying to clarify how the agreements reached by the \n     two presidents. . . . correlate with the actions taken \n     unilaterally by Washington.\n\n  The problem is that when the American people look at this, they say \nthat maybe back during the Cold War and maybe back when we had two \nsuperpowers, this thing made sense. Frankly, I was not as supportive of \nthis concept back then. But there is certainly justification for it.\n  Where are we today? Right now, we are probably in the most endangered \nposition we have been in as a nation. I say this from the experience I \nhave had on both of these committees. We have problems. There are \ncertainly problems with North Korea and what they have developed in \ntheir capabilities, problems with Syria, certainly problems with Iran. \nOur intelligence says--and it is not even classified--that Iran would \nhave the capability of sending a missile to Western Europe and the \nEastern United States by 2015.\n  One of the most disturbing things that happened at the beginning of \nthis administration, a year and a half ago, was when the President came \nout with his budget and did away with our site in Poland which was a \nground interceptor site that would have given us the capability of \ndefending the geography I just mentioned. They took a risk. It wasn't \neasy for Poland or the Czech Republic, in terms of their radar system, \nto almost defy Russia, but they were willing to do it. I always \nremember being a part of the negotiation over there when they said: Are \nyou sure, if we take this bold step, we start agreeing to build a \nground interceptor in Poland that would protect that area, are you sure \nyou will not pull the rug out from under us? I said: Absolutely. I had \nno hint that this would happen, but it did. So in February, right after \nthe new President was inaugurated, of\n\n[[Page S10349]]\n\nthe many things he did that I found objectionable with our defense \nsystems, that was the most egregious.\n\n  We are talking about doing a type of strategic arms reduction with \nRussia. I am not concerned about Russia; I am concerned about these \nother places. The threat is there. The threat is real. I don't think \nthere are too many people around since 9/11 who don't know that the \nterrorists would in a heartbeat come after the United States.\n  When we have something that is written in the preamble--statements \nhave been made over and over again that it would be a violation of this \ntreaty if we were to enhance our missile defense system. Yet we know \nthat Syria is going to have a capability by 2015. To me, that is mind-\nboggling that people could be sitting around here worrying about this \ntreaty between two countries when I don't look at them as being a \nthreat.\n  Then we have the issue of force structure. I think we know that not \nonly do we have to have a weapon, we have to have a way of sending it. \nWe all know the triad and how they are not being enhanced by this. That \nis my major concern.\n  I was against it from the very beginning. However, this is where we \nare today. We are in the middle of it. I know I keep hearing on the \nradio: You are going to be here until Christmas; you shouldn't do that. \nI will be spending New Year's Eve with our troops in Afghanistan. I am \nalso concerned about what we are doing here in America. Why are we \nwaiting? Last year, we waited until Christmas Eve. I always remember \ngoing home Christmas Eve. It happened to fall at the same time. It was \nthe worst snowstorm in the history of Texas and northeastern Oklahoma. \nI barely made it in time to get home. Yes, I have 20 kids and \ngrandkids. I would kind of like to see them at Christmas. These are \nthings we could have been doing a long time ago. You wait until the \nlast minute. This is when you want to cram things through that the \nAmerican people don't want and that should take time. We beat up this \nthing on this treaty for long enough.\n  But let's look at what we should be talking about now; that is, \nrunning government into the next year so we don't have some type of a \nstoppage, some type of a crisis on our hands. So the liberals have the \nomnibus bill that they have up, a bill that is $1.3 trillion. Here we \nare talking about we have come up with $2 trillion--$3 trillion--$2 \ntrillion in the first 2 years. This is unheard of in terms of deficits. \nLook where we are going right now with $9 billion more in spending than \nlast year, and we thought last year was an absolute disaster.\n  At the same time, where is the spending going? We have such things as \ntheir agenda--$1.4 billion for a variety of climate change programs. \nThey are not going to give up on that. They are going to keep coming \nforth trying to spend money. They are talking about the money for the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting, talking about zeroing out the \nefforts in Yucca Mountain. These are things that are in this bill.\n  What it does to the defense system--everything is enhanced except \ndefense. What is this aversion to trying to rebuild America's defense \nsystem? Overall, the defense spending cuts in the omnibus bill amount \nto $10.3 billion. That is from the President's request of 2011. It \nincludes the $450 million to include work on the second engine, the \nalternate engine. We have already talked about that. We have been \ndiscussing that in the Senate Armed Services Committee and the House \nArmed Services Committee.\n  We decided, I believe justly--I was on the single engine side of that \nargument because of the sheer cost. Yet I know the arguments on both \nsides. We have already done that. We have already debated it. I don't \nknow why we have to come to the floor after we have made these \ndecisions and then look at a bill that cuts the proposed purchase of \nthe F-35s from 42 to 35.\n  Let's remember what happened a year and a half ago. They talked about \ndoing away with the F-22s, which are the only fifth-generation \ncapability we have. The justification was, look what we are doing with \nF-35s. That is fine. But so it is going to be 42. This bill would cut \nit down--further cuts.\n  So while we are talking about a bill of $1.3 trillion, it throws \nmoney at every kind of social engineering, everything you could have \nexcept defense.\n  The CERP--this program used to be called the commander's emergency \nrelief program. It was one that was my program. You talk to the \ncommanders in the field, and they will tell you they have a capability \nof taking care of some of these needs. Whether it used to be Iraq, now \nAfghanistan, they can accomplish so much more if they can do it right \nnow. That is called CERP. They are already bringing the funding of that \ndown in this bill. I look at over $1 trillion in funding to implement \nthe very unpopular health care law. If anybody is out there thinking \nthis is going to be an easy lift, I personally think we will be able to \ndefeat this omnibus bill. I think it will be defeated by almost all \nRepublicans and a few of the Democrats, particularly those coming up \nfor reelection in 2012. I would hate to be in a position where I would \nsay: What I am going to run on is the fact that I already voted to put \nmore than $1 trillion into funding this form of socialized medicine.\n  That is where we are right now. I do think we need to take a deep \nbreath and just figure that we have a new Congress coming in, a new \nSenate coming in right after January. We will have plenty of time to \nallow other Senators who were elected to weigh in on this very critical \nissue of the New START treaty.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would like to briefly join my colleagues \nin explaining some of my concerns, first of all, about the process by \nwhich we are taking up something as important as a treaty with regard \nto nuclear arms. Of course, this is the second part of a two-part \nconstitutional process.\n  The President sent this treaty to the Senate, along with a \ntransmittal letter dated May 13, 2010, and here we are on December 16, \nshortly before the Christmas holidays and adjournment, taking up a \ntreaty as important as this. Of course, under article II, section 2 of \nthe United States Constitution, a treaty cannot be ratified without the \nvote of at least two-thirds of the Members of the Senate.\n  I know everyone--whether they are for this treaty, whether they are \nagainst this treaty, whether they are merely questioning some aspects \nof the treaty and are perhaps seeking to make some modifications--I \nbelieve everyone is approaching this issue with the kind of seriousness \nand gravity that should be required of a Senator approaching something \nthis serious.\n  But I have to make this observation: Here we are, as I said, on \nDecember 16, 2 days--2 days--after having dropped on us a 1,924-page \nOmnibus appropriations bill which calls for the Federal Government to \nspend an additional $1.2 trillion. The idea that we would later today \ntake up the issue of funding the Federal Government and consider this \nOmnibus appropriations bill while we would have to basically detour and \nlay this treaty by the side--this is, to me, just irresponsible. I do \nnot know any other word to describe it.\n  We have, in fact, been in session 151 days during 2010. That is \nright. You heard me correctly. The Senate has actually been in session \n151 days this year. I think most people would love to get a paycheck \nacross America and only be expected to show up and do their job 151 \ndays a year.\n  Now, I know when we go back home, we continue to work with our \nconstituents, to listen to their concerns and otherwise, but my simple \npoint is, when the President sends this treaty over on May 13, 2010, \nand at the same time, simultaneously, we are being asked to consider \nthis huge Omnibus appropriations bill of $1.2 trillion--some 2,000 \npages long--the idea that we would try to jam through or give expedited \nconsideration to the serious, substantive issues being raised by this \ntreaty is, as I said, poor time management, to say the least, and I \nthink irresponsible.\n  I want to raise some of the substantive concerns I have about the \ntreaty on which I know there will be further discussions.\n  First of all, I would point out that the treaty does not itself \naddress tactical----\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I have the floor.\n\n[[Page S10350]]\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I know. I am just asking if the Senator would yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would be glad, after I get through my remarks, to yield \nfor some questions.\n  Mr. KERRY. I appreciate it.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would note, as others have noted, that \nthe treaty completely excludes consideration of a limitation on \ntactical nuclear weapons, even though Russia possesses a significant \nsuperiority in terms of numbers over the United States for these types \nof weapons.\n  I would just note that some at the Department of Defense have noted \nthat the difference between strategic weapons and tactical weapons has \nbecome somewhat muddled and less meaningful in recent decades. I \nbelieve a legitimate cause for concern is why we would exclude tactical \nnuclear weapons, that the Russians have numerical superiority of, and \nnot even seek to regulate or contain those at all, while we are focused \nstrictly on strategic nuclear weapons, of which the United States would \nhave to cut our current numbers and the Russians not at all in order to \nmeet the goals of the treaty.\n  I would say, secondly, I have concerns about the treaty's provisions \non verification. Of course, President Reagan was famous for saying we \nshould trust, but verify when it comes to this type of treaty. I would \npoint out that Brent Scowcroft, in 1997, pointed out the importance of \nwhen we are actually reducing the overall number of weapons, \nverification becomes that much more important. He said, in 1997:\n\n       Current force levels provide a kind of buffer because they \n     are high enough to be relatively insensitive to imperfect \n     intelligence and modest force changes. . . . As force levels \n     go down, the balance of nuclear power can become increasingly \n     delicate and vulnerable to cheating on arms control limits, \n     concerns about nondeployed ``hidden missiles'' and the \n     actions of nuclear third parties.\n\n  So we need to be extraordinarily careful, even more careful now than \nperhaps we have been in the past with regard to the verification \nmeasures.\n  We know the Russians have taken every advantage to cheat on previous \ntreaties and to be untrustworthy. According to the official State \nDepartment reports on arms control compliance, the Russians have \npreviously violated--or are still violating, even as we speak--\nimportant provisions of most of the key arms control treaties to which \nthey have been a party, including the original START treaty, the \nChemical Weapons Convention, the Biological Weapons Convention, the \nConventional Forces in Europe Treaty, and Open Skies.\n  The New START treaty does not close that gap on verification \nloopholes that the Russians are already exploiting or, in fact, \nevading.\n  As my colleague, Senator Bond--who is, notably, the vice chairman of \nthe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence--has told us, the annual \n10-warhead limit on inspections allowed under this treaty permit us to \nsample only 2 to 3 percent of the total Russian deployed force and, \ntherefore, it will be impossible--it will be literally impossible; \nlimited to 10 annual warhead inspections over a 10-year treaty--to \ninspect all, much less most, of the 1,550 limit on deployed warheads.\n  So why would we call this a robust verification provision if we are \nonly allowed to see 2 to 3 percent of the total Russian force?\n  The New START treaty, unlike its predecessor, permits any number of \nwarheads to be loaded on a missile. So even if the Russians fully \ncooperated--which I do not believe they have in the past, nor can be \ntrusted to do so in the future--even if they do cooperate with all of \nthe provisions in the New START treaty, these inspections cannot \nprovide the sort of conclusive evidence that you would think would be \nrequired given the gravity of the potential risk. They cannot provide \nconclusive evidence that the Russians are, in fact, complying with the \nwarhead limit.\n  Third, the New START treaty handcuffs the United States from \ndeploying new capabilities we need to defend our Nation and our allies \nfrom missile attacks.\n  I would just point out that this chart I have in the Chamber \ndemonstrates the ballistic missile threat that is presented in a map of \nEurope and Africa and Asia. You will notice that Russia is not even on \nthis map. But you will notice a number of other ballistic missile \nthreats that could affect not only the United States but most certainly \nour allies. This map is a compilation from the Missile Defense Agency \nbased on information from several agencies in the intelligence \ncommunity and shows that more than a dozen nations--more than a dozen \nnations--have developed or are developing ballistic missile \ncapabilities. Several of these nations are notorious for that--North \nKorea, Iran, and Libya, just to name a few. But we know others, such as \nYemen and Pakistan, have al-Qaida operatives or other extremist groups \noperating within their borders.\n  The fact is, we need a robust missile defense capability, not to \nprotect us from Russian ballistic missiles but from ballistic missiles \nfrom some of these other nations that have developed them, some of whom \nhave groups such as al-Qaida and other terrorist organizations there \nthat would love to get their hands on some of these weapons and use \nthem against America or our allies. That is why it makes absolutely no \nsense to constrain our future missile defense options in exchange for \nreductions in the strategic nuclear weapons of just one country, and \nthat is Russia.\n  Now, some of my colleagues may be arguing there are no limitations on \nmissile defense in the treaty and that the language in the preamble, \nwhich ties our strategic offensive arms to our strategic defensive \narms--for the first time ever, by the way--that this preamble language \ndoes not mean anything, does not operate as a constraint on our missile \ndefense programs.\n\n  But that is not what the Russians have said. That is not how they \nread it. Of course, the Senate has been denied the negotiating record \nby which we could actually clarify what was said by American \nnegotiators and Russian negotiators in coming up with this language. \nIsn't that something you would think the administration would want \nclarified, if they could clarify it by providing this information? But, \nno, we have been stonewalled and told: You cannot have it, Senate, even \nthough under article II, section 2 of the Constitution, you have a \nconstitutional duty when it comes to treaty ratification.\n  I just think it is a very poor way to do business, to say the least, \nand causes me to question whether there is a uniform understanding of \nconstraints on our missile defense system. Again, you can see that the \nrisk is not just from Russia, it is much more widespread, \nunfortunately, than that.\n  Russia has also made a unilateral statement that it claims the right \nto withdraw from the New START treaty if the United States does, in \nfact, expand our missile defense capability. Doug Feith shed some light \non this issue earlier in an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal.\n  Mr. Feith, of course, as you remember, is a former Under Secretary of \nDefense under the Bush administration, and he helped negotiate the \nStrategic Offensive Reductions Treaty, known as the SORT treaty. He \nsays during those negotiations, the Russians were constantly trying to \nget the Americans to negotiate away our right to defend ourselves from \nmissile attacks. The Bush administration rightly rejected those Russian \ndemands, and they got a good treaty anyway. But the Obama \nadministration, in this treaty, gave Russia what it wanted when it came \nto our missile defense, among other concessions as well--a very serious \nconcern, I would say.\n  The New START treaty has other flaws, but even if it was an \noutstanding treaty, I think the gravity of what we are about here--in \nconsidering this treaty, and reductions in nuclear arms, and trying to \nmake the world a more secure and safer place--that it warrants more \ncareful and deliberate consideration of this treaty than we are going \nto be able to give during this lameduck session.\n  I have heard people talk about, well, the fact that this is the \nChristmas season--of course, we would all like to be with our families. \nBut we recognize the fact that we have important obligations to perform \nin the Senate. I think all of us are willing to perform those. But the \nproblem is, we have had an election on November 2, and there are a lot \nof people, as the Senator from Oklahoma said, who were just elected by \nthe American people who would be\n\n[[Page S10351]]\n\ndenied an opportunity to let their voice be heard on such an important \nissue if this treaty is jammed through during the waning days of the \n111th Congress. Now, we know the legitimacy of our government itself \nrests upon the consent of the governed. The fact is, during the most \nrecent election the American people said they don't like the direction \nWashington is heading and they want us to change. The idea that we \nwould then--after the election takes place but before the new Senators \nin Congress are actually sworn in--try to rush through such important \nmatters such as this treaty and deny them an opportunity, and the \nvoices of the people who elected them to be heard, to me, does not \nspeak well of this process, and I think indeed denies us the legitimacy \nof the consent of the governed, or certainly many of them.\n\n  Let's be clear about what is happening. We know the administration \nwants a vote on this New START treaty because they think they have a \nbetter chance of passing it now than when these new Senators are sworn \nin on January 5. There is no one I have heard who has suggested there \nis a national security threat to the United States from delaying the \nratification of this treaty by a month. No one. I don't think they \ncould plausibly make such a contention.\n  I think there is a little bit of an attempt to focus our attention \naway from the $1.2 trillion spending tsunami that was unleashed on \nCongress just 2 days ago in which we are told Senator Reid, the \nmajority leader, is going to insist be voted on in just a few days. I \nthink a better alternative to that, and certainly a better alternative \nthan to go through this unnecessary drama about government shutdowns, \nis to pass a one-page continuing resolution that would keep the \ngovernment operating until January or February, at which time these \nnewly elected Senators and House Members would be able to participate. \nIt would be the time when we could certainly take up this treaty and \ngive it thoughtful and careful consideration, the kind of debate and \namendment process I think our responsibility requires rather than \ntrying to move it through in this irresponsible manner.\n  This omnibus bill I mentioned earlier will no doubt be called up \nlater today, perhaps, and be attached to a continuing resolution and \nthen cloture filed, asking 60 Senators to agree to close off debate, \ndenying any opportunity for amendments and the kind of consideration I \nthink the American people would want us to have for a $1.2 trillion \nspending bill.\n  We know Christmas is almost here and many Americans look forward to \ncelebrating that important holiday and reflecting on what comes with \nthe new year. I hope our friends on the other side of the aisle will \nreconsider the tactics they are employing during this lameduck session \nto try to gloss over or ignore the important substantive concerns many \nof us have about this very significant treaty and to ram through \nunpopular legislation just as happened last year on Christmas Eve with \nthe passage of the health care bill. Many Americans remember passing \nthat bill on Christmas Eve in the Senate, and they were outraged by the \nprocess, by the back-room negotiations and deals that took place in \norder to get over the 60-vote threshold.\n  So this year I would submit that millions of Americans want just one \nthing from Congress, and that would be a silent night. Let's pray they \nget it. If the Senator still has a question or two for me, I would be \nglad to yield for that purpose.\n  I thank the chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I wish to say to my colleague from Texas, I \nam a little surprised to hear him be quite so harsh about the--I think \nhe used the word ``irresponsible''--about why we are here in this \npredicament right now. I shouldn't have to remind him, but in this \nsession of Congress there have been more filibusters by his party than \nat any time from World War I all the way through until the late 1970s.\n  We have nominees waiting to be passed who have sat there for months \nwho cannot get a vote. When we finally have a cloture vote to get 60 \nvotes to get them out, they get 90, 95 votes in the Senate. They just \ndelay and delay and delay. I am not going to stand here and listen to \nthem come to the floor of the Senate asking why we are trying to do the \nimportant business of the country at the last minute because all they \nhave to do is look in the mirror. That is all they have to do, and they \nwill see why we are here.\n  Then to say we can't do the important business of this treaty in the \namount of time we have is totally contradicted by history of every \ntreaty we have worked on. Earlier today we had a Senator say: Well, we \ncan't do that. We have to--we can't dual-track. I pointed out that \nSTART I, which was a much more complicated treaty, took 4\\1/2\\ days. On \nthe day they passed it, they passed two or three other pieces of \nlegislation. On the day we went to it, we passed a tax bill and an \nappropriations bill.\n  We have reached a new stage in America where we just say something. \nIt doesn't matter if it is based on the truth. Just say it, put it out \nthere, and somebody is going to believe it. Somebody will pick it up.\n  So I regret that. We have been here for a day. We still haven't had \nan amendment, and all this talk about serious consideration. I am going \nto release a breakdown of who has spoken and for how long because it is \ninteresting to take a look at what is going on.\n  By the way, why would we have to read something? I understand we may \nhave to read the appropriations bill for about a day and a half; have \nthe clerk up here just reading the bill. Now, there is an act of \nstunning responsibility. Let's just chew up the time of the Senate, \nkeeping everybody up all night reading a bill rather than working on \nit.\n  So I have said enough about it. I think what we need to do is do the \nbusiness of the country, and there is plenty of time to do it and still \nplenty of time to get home for Christmas if we would spend our time \ndoing that rather than a lot of delay tactics.\n  Some Senators have also cited an early statement by General \nCartwright, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, suggesting \nhe had some concern about the numbers. Let me make clear, here is what \nGeneral Cartwright said today: ``We need START and we need it badly.''\n  Now, are you going to listen to General Cartwright or are you going \nto listen to some of these sort of vague and somewhat similar talking \npoints that keep coming to the floor without an amendment, without any \nsubstantive work?\n  At this point I ask unanimous consent that at 6 p.m. today, the \nSenate resume legislative session and the majority leader be recognized \nat that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to object, and I will not. I just \nwant to make sure that at 3:30 I will be allowed to speak.\n  Mr. KERRY. We are staying on the START agreement at that time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So is 3:30 a good time or 3:40?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I intend to yield the floor. I ask \nunanimous consent that when I yield the floor, the Senator from \nCalifornia be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask for your ruling on the unanimous \nconsent request with respect to 6 p.m. today we move to legislative \nsession and the majority leader be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to thank my chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Kerry, with whom I have worked closely. I \nthank also Senator Lugar, the ranking member, who at times has been my \nchair. It does my heart good to see them working closely on this \nmatter. I was also elated to see the test vote we had on this already.\n  I hope that vote, that test vote, is indicative of where we are \ngoing. We were almost at 67. My understanding is that one Member wasn't \nthere to vote. We should be at 67. I hope we can get this done at the \nearliest opportunity because despite some of the protests of\n\n[[Page S10352]]\n\nour colleagues saying there hasn't been enough time, my understanding \nis that we have been on this for 7 months. And no one could have worked \nharder than our chairman and our ranking member on making sure that \nevery single objection to the New START treaty, every single problem \nand challenge was heard and that a lot of this was already worked out \nin the resolution of ratification. So, hopefully, we can get through \nthis.\n  I have had opportunities, as a member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee in particular, to ask national security experts what keeps \nthem up at night, what is the one thing they worry about. Whether it \ncomes from the CIA or any other place within the intelligence \ncommunity, the answer comes back like this: What keeps them up at night \nis the possibility that a terrorist could get hold of a nuclear weapon.\n  I have to say, that worrisome possibility is on the minds of many \nAmericans. The New START treaty makes this less likely. Therefore, \nratifying the treaty is in our national interest and, frankly, it is in \nthe interest of the world. The New START treaty requires a 30-percent \nreduction of deployed strategic weapons on the Russian and American \nside, with on-the-ground verification. That is key. It reduces delivery \nsystems to 800 per side.\n  I am not going to speak for very long, I say to my colleagues who \nhave come here, because so much has been said. I can't say it any \nbetter. So what I am going to do for most of the remainder of my time \nis quote from people, Republicans and Democrats, who have been quite \neloquent on this issue, in addition to Senators Kerry and Lugar.\n  It is clear Democrats and Republicans alike support this treaty. We \nhear a lot of talk about not labeling each other and coming together. \nLook, this is an area where we have come together, and all we have to \ndo is put the finishing touches on this ratification and complete this \nvery important work that is in front of us.\n  In addition to all of our NATO allies supporting this, including \nthose in Eastern Europe--which I think is very important to note--we \nhave the support of all of these American leaders on both sides of the \naisle. I will read some of their comments for the Record: ``I urge the \nU.S. Senate to ratify the START treaty.'' This is a statement from a \nfew days ago from President George Herbert Walker Bush.\n  This is from Colin Powell, Secretary of State for George W. Bush:\n\n       I fully support this treaty and I hope that the Senate will \n     give its advice and consent as soon as possible . . . [T]his \n     treaty is in the best interest of the United States of \n     America, the best interest of the world, and frankly in the \n     best interest of the Russian Federation.\n\n  Howard Baker, former Senator, Republican from Tennessee, said just a \nfew days ago:\n\n       A world without a binding U.S.-Russian nuclear arms control \n     treaty is a more dangerous place, less predictable, less \n     stable than the one we live in today. . . . Trust, but \n     verify. Ratify this treaty.\n\n  George Shultz, a constituent of mine, Secretary of State for \nPresident Reagan, wrote with Sam Nunn, a Democrat and former Senator \nfrom Georgia whom we all respect on these issues:\n\n       Noting the full support of the Secretary of State, the \n     Secretary of Defense, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n     staff, and following our own review of the treaty, we urge \n     the Senate to give its advice and consent to ratification of \n     New START as early as is feasible.\n\n  I hope we don't have a lot of delaying, more delaying tactics around \nhere because it is not necessary.\n  I heard colleagues say, What is the rush? What is the rush? We have \nhad 7 months. Senators Kerry and Lugar have bent over backwards and \ndone everything possible to accommodate Senators, such as Senator Kyl, \nwho wanted certain assurances on the modernization of our nuclear \nweapons. They did everything to answer every question. By the way, they \nwill continue to do that as we get to any other issues.\n  This is what James Schlesinger, Secretary of Defense for Presidents \nNixon and Ford, said:\n\n     I think it is obligatory for the United States to ratify New \n     START. . . . For the United States, at this juncture, to fail \n     to ratify the treaty in the due course of the Senate's \n     deliberation would have a detrimental effect on our ability \n     to influence others with regard to, particularly, the \n     nonproliferation issue.\n\n  So James Schlesinger gets to the point of nonproliferation, the \nworrisome fact that a terrorist or rogue state could get one of these \nweapons.\n  Alan Simpson, an outspoken former Republican Senator from Wyoming, \nsaid this:\n\n       Nothing in the treaty constrains our ability to develop and \n     deploy a robust missile defense system as our military \n     planners see fit. The idea that this treaty somehow makes \n     major concessions to the Russians on missile defense is just \n     simply not true.\n\n  I will quote Pat Buchanan, former White House Communications Director \nfor President Ronald Reagan:\n\n       Richard Nixon would have supported this treaty. Ronald \n     Reagan would have supported this treaty, as he loathed \n     nuclear weapons and wished to rid the world of them. And \n     simply because this treaty is ``Obama's treaty'' does not \n     mean it is not in America's interest.\n\n  I don't think I have ever in my life quoted Pat Buchanan on the \nfloor. I am just proving the point that this particular issue is \nextremely bipartisan. It unites everybody, except apparently a few of \nour friends on the other side.\n  Brent Scowcroft, LTG retired, National Security Adviser to Presidents \nFord and George H.W. Bush, said this:\n\n       New START should not be controversial no matter how liberal \n     or conservative you are.\n\n  That also makes the point.\n  Chuck Hagel, a former Republican Senator, made this statement--and I \nwill not read the entire statement. He ends it by saying:\n\n       This would be devastating not just for arms control but for \n     security interests worldwide [if we didn't deal with this \n     issue].\n\n  Henry Kissinger has a very long statement. I will not read the entire \nstatement, but he said this:\n\n     . . . for all these reasons, I recommend ratification of this \n     treaty. . . . I do not believe this treaty is an obstacle to \n     a missile defense program or modernization. . . . A rejection \n     of this treaty would indicate that a new period of American \n     policy had started that would have an unsettling impact on \n     the international environment.\n\n  So here you have somebody who has been deeply involved in foreign \nrelations for so many years saying, in essence--and I am not quoting \nhim here, but I am summing up what I read, that it would be a radical \ndeparture from America's foreign policy if we were not to do this.\n  James Baker, former Secretary of State for President George H.W. \nBush, writes:\n\n       New START appears to take our country in a direction that \n     can enhance our national security. . . . It can also improve \n     Washington's relationship with Moscow regarding nuclear \n     weapons and delivery vehicles, a relationship that will be \n     vital if the two countries are to cooperate in order to stem \n     nuclear proliferation in countries such as Iran and North \n     Korea. I agree with Secretary of Defense Bob Gates when he \n     wrote last week in the Wall Street Journal that the new \n     treaty provides verification that has been needed since START \n     I expired in December. An effective verification regime is a \n     critical component of arms control and I believe that the \n     world is safer when the United States and Russia are abiding \n     by one.\n\n  I will close with a couple of Democratic individuals who have also \njoined their Republican friends in this.\n  President Bill Clinton said this:\n\n       The START agreement is very important to the future of our \n     national security and it is not a radical agreement. This is \n     something that is profoundly important. This ought to be way \n     beyond party.\n\n  He said that a couple days ago. William Perry, we remember well; he \nwas Secretary of Defense for President Clinton. He said:\n\n       The treaty puts no meaningful limits on our antiballistic \n     missile defense program. In fact, it reduces restrictions \n     that existed under the previous START Treaty. I recommend \n     ratification.\n\n  Former Senator Sam Nunn said this:\n\n       Delaying ratification of this treaty, or defeating it, \n     would damage United States security interests and United \n     States credibility globally.\n\n  He takes the same tack that I am taking. He is someone who supports \nthis. The Joint Chiefs of Staff, former strategic nuclear commanders, \nand our intelligence community leadership all have stated that the \ntreaty is essential to our Nation's security.\n\n       I am hopeful the Senate will put our Nation's security \n     first by providing its advice and consent to this important \n     treaty.\n\n  That was Sam Nunn.\n  I will close with two more quotes, one from Vice President Joe Biden:\n\n       Failure to pass the new START Treaty this year would \n     endanger our national security.\n\n[[Page S10353]]\n\n     We would have no Americans on the ground to inspect Russia's \n     nuclear activities, no verification regimes to track Russia's \n     nuclear arsenal, less cooperation between two nations that \n     account for 90 percent of the world's nuclear weapons, and no \n     verified nuclear reduction.\n\n  We all know Vice President Biden was the respected chair of the \nForeign Relations Committee, and it was my honor to serve with him.\n  Finally, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said this:\n\n       Failing to ratify the treaty would not only undermine our \n     strategic stability, the predictability, and the \n     transparency, but it would severely impact our potential to \n     lead on the important issue of nonproliferation.\n\n  I end where I started. What keeps the intelligence community people \nup at night is the fear that we don't wrap our arms around nuclear \nproliferation, and that a weapon gets into the hands of a terrorist or \nrogue nation. New START is--as our chairman has said many times--not a \nvery broad treaty. It is pretty narrow. It is essential, but it doesn't \ncover that much new ground. It ensures that we are going to have a \nmutual reduction in these arms that we will be able to verify, and it \nmakes it less likely that we are going to have the type of \nproliferation that keeps a lot of us up at night, including the \nAmerican people, I am sure. We need to take steps in this holiday \nseason toward peace. We need to take steps every day to make sure that \nthe threats we face in this difficult world, with all of our \nchallenges, are diminished.\n  Once again, I say to my chairman, his leadership has been \nextraordinary on this. I was beginning to give up hope that we would be \nable to get this done. He constantly said that we don't give up, we \nkeep pursuing this. It is the right thing to do. And he has done it \nwith Senator Lugar by his side.\n  This is a good day. I feel good that we are doing this. I feel that \nthe people, particularly at this time of the year, will feel much \nbetter when we get this done in a bipartisan way. I know we will.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, are we working off of already arranged time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no operating UC for time at this \nmoment.\n  Mr. BURR. I thank the Chair. I want to make some introductory remarks \nabout the START treaty this afternoon. My real interest lies in the \nclosed session that will take place on a later date. But this is an \nimportant debate. I have deep respect for not just the chairman but for \nthe ranking member. But like all Members, I have a passion for this \nissue. I want to make some general comments at this time about it.\n  The threat of nuclear engagement between the United States and Russia \nhas diminished greatly since we began arms reduction talks with the \nSoviets in the 1970s. It is a credit to the agreements of past years \nthat the strategic relationship between the United States and Russia \nhas evolved to a point where Americans and Russians no longer fear a \nwar between NATO and Warsaw powers.\n  The world has changed in many ways for the better as a result of \nthose bilateral arms reduction efforts. But today, the United States \nand our allies face emerging and destabilizing nuclear threats from \nrogue nations and nonstate actors who have shown no willingness to \nfollow or accept international standards or adhere to nonproliferation \ntreaties.\n  While the new START treaty continues a historic dialog between two \ngreat nations, I am concerned that negotiated language in this treaty--\nespecially wording in its preamble about ``existence of the \ninterrelationship between strategic offensive arms and strategic \ndefensive arms''--may in fact signal a subtle yet troubling return to \nthe Cold War linkage between offensive and defensive weapons. Some \ndismiss this wording as the flowery language of diplomats. But words \nhave meaning. Treaty language is not filler. I can only conclude that \nthis specific commitment reflects the current thinking of the President \nand his administration, which is a departure from their predecessors in \npast administrations, and offers the Russians a reason to leverage the \ntreaty to their distinct advantage with respect to our efforts to \nimprove upon our missile defenses.\n  Even if a treaty such as the New START had a place in today's world, \nseveral key issues are lacking in the treaty that this body should and \nwould have to address. One, the treaty does not address Russia's \ntactical nuclear weapons. Two, this treaty does nothing to address \nstored warheads. Three, this treaty is silent on rail mobile ICBMs. \nFour, this treaty allows the Russians to encrypt and hide missile test \ndata for all new nuclear weapons they develop.\n  This treaty places limits on our nonnuclear conventional global \nstrike weapons--unheard of in the past. This treaty submits and \nsubjects our Nation's objectives in missile defense to the review and \napproval of the Kremlin. This treaty ignores the nuclear capabilities, \ndesires, ambitions, and plans of nations and non-nation actors who seek \nto undermine and harm U.S. national security interests.\n  Many pundits have spoken about the urgent need to get the U.S. \ninspectors on the ground in Russia to verify the state of their new \nnuclear weapon systems and verify compliance. But when one examines the \ninspection protocols within this treaty, it will be clear that we must \ngive such advance notification and jump through so many multiple hoops \njust to get approval to visit a site, by the time an inspection begins \nthere is a high likelihood we will only see what the Russians want us \nto see and nothing more.\n  Other supporters of this treaty contend that by ratifying New START \nwe further enhance our relationship and leverage with the Russians, \nwith respect to the destabilizing threats posed by North Korea and \nIran. But the Russians already recognize the problems posed by these \ntwo countries, because they are along their borders. The Russians \nshould not require this treaty as an incentive to protect their own \nregional interests.\n  For these reasons, I remain concerned that by ratifying New START, \nthe Senate would be allowing an outdated and narrow agenda to constrain \nour defense flexibilities and capabilities at the very point in history \nwhere we need a clear-eyed view of the real threats on the horizon.\n  There is no urgent need to ratify New START this week, next week, or \neven next year. Given the numerous flaws in this treaty, to say nothing \nof the flawed backward-looking process that developed it, it is prudent \nfor the Senate to work on ways to improve upon the treaty and how it \nhas been put forth in order to better ensure the strategic interests of \nthe United States and to make sure it is fully protected.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues, our Nation does need a new start in our \nrelationship with Russia. It needs a new approach. This treaty \nrepresents an old approach, based on Cold War relationships. In my \nestimation, it should be rejected by this body.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise in support of a treaty that I \nactually think is of vital importance to our national security, to our \nnational interests, and to our international reputation in the \nnonproliferation of nuclear weapons.\n  Let me first start off by recognizing Senator Kerry, the chairman of \nour Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Lugar, the ranking member. \nThey have done an extraordinary job. I smile as I listen to some of my \ncolleagues say it has not been reviewed enough, it has not been vetted \nenough. We have had an incredible number of sessions on the question of \nwhat the treaty contains and flushing out all of its points and points \nof view. In a very bipartisan way, the committee has worked assiduously \nto bring us to this point so that Members can make an informed \ndecision. So I wish to salute the chairman for his incredible work in \nthat regard.\n  The original START treaty expired on December 5 of last year, 2009. \nSo as of today, December 16, 2010, it has been 376 days since the \nUnited States lost the ability to conduct onsite inspections--lost it--\nnot knowing what has happened with those weapons. It has been 376 days \nsince we lost our ability to monitor and verify Russia's nuclear \narsenal.\n\n[[Page S10354]]\n\n  Now, I know some say our relationship with Russia has gotten a lot \nbetter. Yes, but it is their arsenal that we care about. It is about an \narsenal that now has a Russian leadership that we are having better \nrelationships with, but we never know what that relationship will be \ntomorrow. Good relationships are built on firm understandings, and the \ntreaty creates a firm understanding of our respective obligations. That \nis why we need to move forward and ratify START.\n  Now, I agree, I have heard some of my colleagues suggest that there \nare other nations--namely, Iran and North Korea--that presently present \nmaybe a greater threat to our security and the security of our allies, \nbut that is not the point. The point is that the threat of loose \nnuclear materials anywhere in the world--anywhere in the world, whether \nin Russia, Iran, or North Korea--is a major concern. The point is that \nthe severity of the threat from those nations does not diminish the \nthreat presented by the Russian nuclear arsenal. Those threats in no \nway negate the need to continue our nonproliferation regime and \nconclude a treaty with Russia and then move on to continuing to address \nthe serious threats presented by Iran and North Korea.\n  Let me just say that on one of those two, on Iran, since my days in \nthe House of Representatives, I have been pursuing Iran, well before \nsome people looked at Iran as a challenge. When I found out the \nInternational Atomic Energy Administration was taking voluntary \ncontributions for the United States to help create operational capacity \nat the Bushehr nuclear facility, I raised those issues and sought to \nstem the use of U.S. taxpayer dollars going for that purpose. So I \nunderstand about Iran and North Korea, but that does not diminish the \nimportance of knowing about this nuclear arsenal.\n  It is true that political developments in the past two decades have \ngreatly diminished the probability of nuclear war between our nations. \nBut the fact remains that Russia continues to have more than 600 \nnuclear launch vehicles and more than 2,700 warheads. It is because of \nthose numbers that this Chamber needs to do what is in our national \nsecurity interests and ratify START now. We need the ability to track \nand verify Russia's nuclear arsenal. We need onsite inspections. We \nneed the enhanced flexibility of short-notice inspections of deployed \nand nondeployed systems. We need to be able to verify the numbers of \nwarheads carried on Russian strategic missiles. We need the ability--\nprovided for the first time in this treaty--to track all accountable \nstrategic nuclear delivery systems.\n  We need a verification regime. Trust, but verify. Trust, but verify. \nWe know those words well. They have been spoken on this floor many \ntimes by many of our Republican colleagues, some who are now willing to \nturn their back on the truth of those words. The truth is that at the \nheart of this treaty, the ability for this Nation to verify Russia's \nnuclear arsenal remains paramount to our security. It remains paramount \nto continued bilateral cooperation between the United States and \nRussia.\n  For these reasons, START has broad bipartisan support, including \nsupport from the Secretaries of Defense and State and National Security \nAdvisers for a whole host of Presidents--President Nixon, President \nFord, Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Clinton, and George W. Bush. \nAll of those people have come together regardless of their partisan \nlabels or views, and they all believe this is in our national security \ninterest and necessary if we are to show the world that we demand as \nmuch of ourselves as we ask of others.\n  So as we press the Iranian and North Korean Governments to come into \ncompliance, this treaty demonstrates to all nations that have nuclear \naspirations that we are willing to live by the rules; that \nnonproliferation of nuclear weapons is not an empty wish but a national \npolicy that is in our national interest and the interests of the world; \nthat our willingness to accede to oversight and monitoring of our \nnuclear weapons and facilities, our willingness to reduce our nuclear \narsenal in the interest of global security, and our willingness to \ncooperate with willing partners is part and parcel of American policy. \nIt is what we believe is right, what we will live by, and what we will \ndemand of all nations.\n  I hope that with respect to global nuclear security, we can see clear \nto be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. Some have suggested \nin this Chamber that we can't do that. We certainly can. We can ratify \nSTART and continue to press Iran and North Korea.\n  You know, this is the one issue I would have hoped we--and we \ncertainly do in some respects, certainly in some of our leadership on \nthe committee, Senator Lugar and others--it is the one place the Senate \nhas always enjoyed a bipartisan effort. Put the country first in the \ncase of all of those in the world and understand that on this there is \nno division.\n  It was Senator Vandenberg, a Republican from Michigan, who once \nfamously said:\n\n       To me, bipartisan foreign policy means a mutual effort to \n     unite our official voice at the water's edge . . .\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       It does not invoke the remotest surrender of free debate in \n     determining our position. In a word, it simply seeks national \n     security ahead of partisan advantage.\n\n  But, sadly, I believe the efforts by some to derail START are \npolitically motivated, putting partisan advantage ahead of national \nsecurity. Nothing that protects us from the spread of nuclear weapons \nshould be politically motivated, not in this brave new world.\n  Let's be clear. This treaty does not in any way diminish our \ncommitment to keeping this Nation safe and strong. It imposes no limits \non current or planned ballistic defense programs by the United States. \nIn fact, the President has committed to a 10-year, $80 billion plan to \nmodernize our nuclear infrastructure, which represents a 15-percent \nincrease over current spending levels.\n  The truth is that the United States retains overwhelming strike \ncapacity under this treaty. Under this treaty, we will retain 700 \ndeployed launchers and 1,550 deployed warheads. Keep in mind the \noverwhelming strike capacity this represents to assure any adversary of \na devastating response to any attack on the United States or our \nallies, which is at the heart of our deterrent posture. In real terms, \njust to give us a sense of what this means, we will retain enough \nstrike capacity to end civilization as we know it and destroy the \nentire ecosystem of the planet--far beyond the destructive power of the \nweapons used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n  Let's keep in mind that one standard nuclear warhead has an explosive \nforce equal to 100,000 tons of conventional high explosives. The use of \n1,000 nuclear warheads has a destructive power of 100 million tons of \ndynamite and the ability to darken this planet in a nightmare nuclear \nwinter beyond our imagination.\n  So any argument to the contrary, any argument that we do not retain \nan overwhelming nuclear strike capacity, is, in my view, a political \nargument, and I believe that some who have come and said that we can't \ndo this--and then, in the midst of this discussion, in the midst of \nthis treaty debate, I hear omnibus discussions. I cannot believe that \nsomething that is about the national security of the United States, \nmaking sure future generations of Americans never face that nuclear \nwinter, somehow gets lumped in with all of the other political \nconversations.\n\n  I know I have heard the leadership on the other side of the aisle say \ntheir Number 1 goal is for this President to fail at all costs and to \nmake him a one-term President. But, my God, I thought this had nothing \nto do with that. I thought this had nothing to do with that. I would \nhope that on an occasion such as this where we are talking about the \nNation's security, the ability to verify, the ability to understand \nwhat Russia's nuclear weaponry is all about goes beyond the success or \nfailure of this President. It is about the Nation being able to \nsucceed.\n  Finally, I have heard a lot of talk about how late this is and that \nit is almost Christmas. I certainly want to be with my family as much \nas anybody else, but I have to be honest with you, I want my family and \nI want the family of every New Jerseyan I represent, of every American \nfor whom I am part of this Senate to have the security that they will \nnever face that nuclear winter.\n\n[[Page S10355]]\n\n  I cannot accept the statements I have heard here. I was not going to \ninclude this in my remarks, but I have heard now several times that we \nare here so late. Well, you know, this 2-year session of Congress has \nbeen so challenging because, time and time again, colleagues--\nparticularly on the other side of the aisle--have used a procedure in \nthe Senate--a right they have, but it is a right that has clearly been \nabused--to filibuster. What that means is that which we grew up \nunderstanding as Americans from the day we were in a classroom and we \nwere taught about a simple majority rule--well, here in the Senate, \nthat simple majority of representing the people of the United States, \nthe 300 million people, is 51. But under the rules of the Senate, when \none Senator wants to object to moving forward, ultimately we don't need \nthat simple majority that Americans have come to understand; we end up \nneeding 60. Of course, since neither party possesses those 60 votes, we \noften end up in a stalemate and are not able to move forward. That has \nbeen used time and time again. I would have to do it over 100 times \njust for the one session of the Congress, for the 2 years of the \nCongress, to remind people why it is so late in the process--because, \ntime and time again, that process has been used to delay. Even when \nthat process has been broken and the 60 votes have been accomplished, \nthere have been votes that soar in the 80th or 90th percentile of the \nMembers of this body voting to support the proposition. But the time \nwas killed. It is the time not of the Senate but the time of the \nAmerican people.\n  Then I have to hear some of my colleagues, in the midst of a debate \nabout a nuclear treaty--understanding that we are trying to prevent and \nto verify the possibility that weapons get out of the hands of those \nwho have the authority over them, among other reasons to have this \ntreaty--talk about the omnibus. Well, I just find it beyond my \nimagination, especially when colleagues who are railing about on that \nare part of asking for hundreds of millions of dollars in earmarks in \nthe omnibus. Then they come and say: Oh, this is a terrible thing, and \nthe treaty is being brought up at the same time, and somehow we should \nnot be able to move to this treaty because of that issue, even though \nwhat they rail against is what they have blatantly participated in. \nThis issue is too important--too important to be wound up in that.\n  In the end, the purpose of this treaty and of U.S. efforts to thwart \nother nations from going nuclear is to ensure that future generations \nwill not live with the specter of a nuclear winter and the destruction \nof civilization as we know it.\n  We have an opportunity to move--and I would hope move quickly--to do \nwhat is right, to ratify START, and lead the world by example. By \nleading the world by example, then we can also make demands on the rest \nof the world to make sure they obey and agree and ultimately concur and \nultimately live by the same example. That is our opportunity, and that \nis an opportunity we should not lose.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey. He \nis a valuable member of our committee, diligent and articulate on these \nissues. I appreciate the comments he made, particularly reinforcing the \ncomments about the delay.\n  I remind colleagues that earlier the Senator from Arizona mentioned \nit is sort of unfair to be doing this at the same time we are doing \nsomething else. I remind colleagues that he said START I was completed \nsort of on its own, freestanding. I wish to correct the record. START I \ndid not, in fact, go through freestanding. On the same day the Senate \nheld the cloture vote on the treaty on START I, it voted on two \namendments related to the treaty, and it also voted on the final \npassage of a tax bill. They managed to do two things at the same time.\n  The following day, the Senate voted on another amendment related to \nthe treaty. It also agreed on that day to the conference report on \nInterior appropriations. It passed the DC appropriations bill. Those \nare two separate items. And it debated and held two rollcall votes on \nthe Foreign Operations bill. Those are four separate bills and items \ndealt with at the same time they were dealing with START I. The \nfollowing day, it had the final passage on the START treaty, in about 4 \ndays-plus-and-a-half, I think.\n  Also, I remind my colleagues, as I should have reminded the Senator \nfrom Texas, 13 times colleagues came on the other side of the aisle to \nSenator Lugar and asked him to slow down the process of the legislation \npiece of the treaty because of the need to work on modernization. We \ndid that. Again, colleagues came to us. Way back last summer, we were \nprepared to move the treaty out of committee so we wouldn't wind up in \nthis situation. Guess who came to us and said: No, it would be better \nif we had a little more time. Our friends on the other side of the \naisle said: Please don't do that vote. I think it would be better for \nthe treaty if we took our time. So we provided another 6 weeks to file \nquestions, get answers, work on modernization, pull people together. \nFrankly, it was a constructive process. I am not suggesting it didn't \nprovide some benefits. But we accommodated a request to slow it down to \nmeet the needs of our friends on the other side of the aisle. Then, \nsubsequently, when there were potential complaints that it would be \npoliticizing the Senate and this treaty to have the vote and this \ndebate before the election--we could have done that, but we didn't want \nthe treaty to get caught up in the election process--we voluntarily \ndelayed the process to meet and accommodate some of the concerns of \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle. Then, when we come back \nafter the election, all of a sudden, we can't do it in a lameduck. We \nhave to do it down the road.\n  One colleague came to the floor defending the rights of people who \nare not even sworn in as Senators to somehow weigh in on this treaty. \nThey are not Senators. They may have been elected in this election, but \nthey haven't taken part in the year-and-a-half-long effort of preparing \nto deal with this treaty. Every Senator here has. All 100 of us walked \nup to the well, raised our hands, swore to uphold the Constitution of \nthe United States. That Constitution gives us the specific \nresponsibility of advice and consent on a treaty. That is why we are \nhere at this moment. If I had had my druthers, we would have been here \nweeks ago, but there was always a filibuster, always a delay, always \nsome longer period that some other piece of legislation was taking.\n  It is important for colleagues to be honest about that. We have had \n125 cloture motions since January of 2009. That is as many cloture \nmotions as had been filed between 1919 and 1974, between World War I \nand the Vietnam war. That is how many cloture motions we had filed \nsince last year alone. In addition, the Republicans came back to the \nminority in 2007, and we have had to file 264 cloture motions to end a \nfilibuster since 2007. That averages out to 66 per year. In the first \n44 years of the existence of this filibuster rule, it was only used \nabout once a year. For 44 years, it was used once a year. In the last \nfew years, it has been used 66 times a year. That is why we are here. \nThat is why we were delayed.\n  I, personally, look forward, when we return next year, to seeing us \nadjust that rule. I respect the rights of the minority because I know \nthat is what the Founding Fathers intended. But nobody intended that we \nhave to vote twice to get to a bill, filibuster on the motion to \nproceed, filibuster on the substance. It simply doesn't make sense, and \nthe American people do not support it. It negates the fundamental \nconcept of majority rule. I am willing to take my lumps, but I think \nthere is a way to not necessarily undo it completely and still create \nresponsible action in the Senate.\n  Since President Obama took office last year, the Senate has had \nrollcall votes on 62 nominations. Of those 62, 27 were confirmed with \n90 votes or more; 23 were confirmed with 70 votes or more. That means \nthat of the 62 nominations, fully 60 of them were confirmed with more \nthan 70 votes. Over 80 percent of the nominations we have taken votes \non have passed with overwhelming support, and almost all of those \nvotes, many of them anyway, took place only after an extraordinarily \nlengthy delay. Many of these nominations sat on the calendar for\n\n[[Page S10356]]\n\nover 100 days while people waited for the Senate to act.\n  On average, the Senate has taken more than five times longer to \nconfirm a circuit court nomination after it was favorably reported by \nthe Judiciary and so forth.\n  I don't want to chew up all our time going through that, but the \nrecord should be fundamentally clear that nobody is rushing anything \nhere. The START treaty debate, the original START treaty began on \nSeptember 28, 1992, and amendments were proposed. As early as the first \nday of the debate, they were debating amendments. There were two votes \non amendments on the second day of debate. On the third day, there were \nthree amendments, and they ratified the treaty. We ought to be able to \nmove here.\n  I wish to add a couple thoughts quickly on the subject of the \ntactical nukes. A number of Senators have expressed concern about why \nthis treaty doesn't deal with tactical nuclear weapons. All of us would \nagree, you have to acknowledge upfront there is an asymmetry, an \nimbalance between the numbers of tactical weapons that the Russians \nhave and have deployed and what we have. Remember, first, we needed to \nreplace the original START agreement in order to get verification \nmeasures back into place in order to take the steps then necessary to \ngo to sort of the next tier. Secretary Clinton and Secretary Gates \nexplained for the record:\n\n       A more ambitious treaty that addressed tactical nuclear \n     weapons would have taken a lot longer to complete, adding \n     significantly to the time before a successor agreement, \n     including the verification measures, could enter into force \n     following START'S expiration in December 2009.\n\n  Their fundamental judgment was, yes, we want to get there, but START \nitself helps you get there. If we sit without those verification \nmeasures in place that come with START, we make it much harder to \nactually reach the agreement we are trying to get to on the tactical. \nThe logic said: Get this agreement back into place. Revitalize the \ncooperation on arms control. That will empower you subsequently to be \nable to achieve your goal.\n  That is not something the Obama administration dreamed up. I \nemphasize that to our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. The \nvery respected former Secretaries of Defense, Secretary Bill Perry and \nSecretary Jim Schlesinger, were part of a bipartisan commission. They \nreported that the first step they thought necessary was to deal with \nthis. They knew nuclear tactical weapons were an issue. But they also \nknew our military leaders made it clear they didn't need actual parity \non those weapons. Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen both stated, in \nresponse to a question:\n\n       Because of the limited range of the tactical weapons and \n     very different roles from those played by strategic nuclear \n     forces, the vast majority of Russian tactical nuclear weapons \n     could not directly influence the strategic nuclear balance \n     between the United States and Russia.\n\n  Donald Rumsfeld told the Foreign Relations Committee in 2002:\n\n       I don't know that we would ever want to have symmetry \n     between the United States and Russia. Their circumstance is \n     different and their geography's different.\n\n  What he is referring to is the vast gulf of the Atlantic Ocean and \nthen Western Europe that is in between Russia and us and the whole \noriginal tactical decision of Russia in terms of the Warsaw Pact versus \nNATO that existed for so many years in the course of the Cold War.\n  I don't want to be mistaken by my colleagues on the other side. Yes, \nwe want to limit Russia's nuclear tactical weapons. But a desire to \nlimit those tactical weapons is not a reason to reject the START \ntreaty. Frank Miller, who was a senior NSC staffer in the Bush \nadministration, testified to the Arms Services Committee on July 22:\n\n       I believe this Treaty is properly focused on the strategic \n     forces of both sides. . . . The tactical forces are clearly a \n     political and military threat to our allies. . . . But I \n     think throwing this treaty away because we haven't gotten our \n     hands on the tacticals is not the way to approach this. I \n     think we have to go after the tacticals separately.\n\n  That is exactly what President Obama, Vice President Biden, Secretary \nClinton, and the rest of our military establishment want to do, but \nthey want the START treaty as the foundation on which to build that \neffort to try to secure something in terms of tactical weapons.\n  We should pursue a treaty on tactical nuclear weapons, one that can \ngive us adequate transparency about how many Russia has and that \nultimately reduces that number.\n  Let me say to my colleagues on the other side, that is precisely why \nwe put into the resolution of ratification declaration 11, which says:\n\n       The Senate calls upon the President to pursue, following \n     consultation with allies, an agreement with the Russian \n     Federation that would address the disparity between the \n     tactical nuclear weapons stockpiles of the Russian Federation \n     and of the United States and would secure and reduce tactical \n     nuclear weapons in a verifiable manner.\n\n  We address the issues of tactical nuclear weapons, and it was not an \noversight. It was a calculated, tactical decision to lay the \nfoundation, renew the relationship with Russia, renew our arms control \nunderstandings, and lay the foundation to be able to reach an \nagreement. That is what Secretary Gates said when he testified before \nthe Armed Services Committee on June 17. He said:\n\n       We will never get to that step [of reductions] with the \n     Russians on tactical nukes if this treaty on strategic \n     nuclear weapons is not ratified.\n\n  Secretary Gates, appointed by President Bush, said clearly: If we do \nnot ratify this treaty, we do not get to the treaty on tactical nuclear \nweapons.\n  So I think the imperative could not be more clear.\n  The Eastern European leaders see this the same way. And they, after \nall, are the ones more directly threatened by those weapons. Poland's \nforeign minister wrote, on November 20, our NATO allies see ``New START \nis a necessary stepping-stone to future negotiations with Russia about \nreductions in tactical nuclear arsenals, and a prerequisite for the \nsuccessful revival of the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe.'' \nThe Secretary-General of NATO said the same thing. He said that we need \n``transparency and reductions of short-range, tactical nuclear weapons \nin Europe. . . . This is a key concern for allies. . . . But we cannot \naddress this disparity until the New Start treaty is ratified.''\n  I hope our colleagues will stand with our allies and stand with \ncommon sense and ratify this treaty so we can get to the issue of \ntactical nuclear weapons.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, first of all, let me say that there are \nbig issues and small issues, some of substantial consequence, others \nthat are of minor importance that are debated here on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  This is one of those big issues, one of significant importance, not \njust to us but to the world. While we get involved in a lot of details \nin this discussion, the question to be resolved in all of the efforts \nthat are made here dealing with nuclear weapons is, Will we be able to \nfind a way to prevent the explosion of a nuclear weapon in a major city \non this planet that will kill hundreds of thousands of people?\n  The answer to that question comes from efforts about whether we are \nable to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, to keep nuclear weapons out \nof the hands of terrorists and rogue nations, and then begin to reduce \nthe number of nuclear weapons.\n  Let me read, for a moment, from Time magazine in 2002. It refers to \nsomething that happened exactly 1 month after 9/11, 2001--the terrible \nattack that occurred in this country by terrorists that murdered over \n3,000 Americans.\n  One month later, October 11, 2001, something happened. It was \ndescribed in Time magazine because it was not readily known around the \nrest of the country what had happened. Let me read it:\n\n       For a few harrowing weeks last fall--\n\n  Referring to October 2001--\n\n     a group of U.S. officials believed that the worst nightmare \n     of their lives, something even more horrific than 9/11, was \n     about to come true. In October, an intelligence alert went \n     out to a small number of government agencies, including the \n     Energy Department's top secret Nuclear Emergency Search Team \n     based in Nevada. The report said that terrorists were thought \n     to have obtained a 10-kiloton nuclear weapon from the Russian \n     arsenal and planned to smuggle it into New York City. The \n     source of the report was a mercurial agent code named \n     dragonfire, who intelligence officials believed was of \n     ``undetermined'' reliability. But dragonfire's claim\n\n[[Page S10357]]\n\n     tracked with a report from a Russian general who believed \n     that his forces were missing a 10-kiloton nuclear device.\n\n  Detonated in lower Manhattan, a 10-kiloton nuclear bomb would kill \nabout 100,000 civilians and irradiate 700,000 more, flattening \neverything--everything--for a half a mile in diameter. And so \ncounterterrorist investigators were on their highest alert.\n  I continue the quote:\n\n       ``It was brutal,'' a U.S. official told Time magazine. It \n     was also a highly classified and closely guarded secret. \n     Under the aegis of the White House's Counterterrorism \n     Security Group, part of the National Security Council, news \n     of the suspected nuke was kept secret so as to not panic the \n     people of New York. Senior FBI officials were not even in the \n     loop. Former mayor Rudolph Giuliani said he was never told \n     about the threat. In the end, the investigators found nothing \n     and concluded that dragonfire's information was false. But \n     few of them slept better. They had made a chilling \n     realization: If terrorists had, in fact, managed to smuggle a \n     nuclear weapon into a city, there was almost nothing anyone \n     could have done about it.\n\n  Here is the number of nuclear weapons on this planet. The story I \njust read was about one small nuclear weapon, a Russian 10-kiloton \nnuclear weapon. There are roughly 25,000 nuclear weapons on this Earth. \nI just described the apoplectic seizure that occurred over the \npotential of one 10-kiloton nuclear weapon missing, potentially \nacquired by a terrorist, smuggled to New York City, to be detonated in \none of our largest cities.\n  Russia has about 15,000 nuclear weapons, the United States about \n9,000, China a couple hundred, France several hundred, Britain a couple \nhundred; and the list goes on.\n  Now the question is, What do we do about all that? Will we just waltz \nalong forever and believe that somehow, some way, we will be lucky \nenough to make sure nobody ever explodes a nuclear weapon in the middle \nof a city on this Earth? Because when they do, all life on this planet \nis going to change. What do we do about that? My colleagues say, let's \nratify the START treaty. I fully agree. And there is so much more that \nneeds to be done beyond that. The work that has been done here on the \nfloor of the Senate by my colleagues Senator Kerry and Senator Lugar is \nextraordinary work.\n  Senator Lugar is here, and I do not know that he has been here \npreviously when I have done this--and people are tired of my doing it, \nbut it is so important--I have always kept in my desk a small piece of \nthe wing of a Backfire bomber that was given to me. Senator Lugar is \nresponsible for this. This is the piece of a wing of a Backfire bomber. \nNo, we did not shoot it down. Senator Lugar did not shoot it down, nor \ndid our Air Force. We sawed it up. We sawed the wings off the bomber.\n  How did that happen? It was done by a the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative \nThreat Reduction Program in which we actually paid to destroy a Soviet \nbomber. It makes a whole lot more sense than being engaged in warfare \nto shoot down this bomber.\n  I have--and I will not show it--in my desk a hinge from a missile \nsilo that was in the Ukraine that contained a missile with a nuclear \nweapon on its tip aimed at the United States of America. It is not \nthere anymore. Sunflower seeds grow where a missile once resided. \nBecause of Nunn-Lugar, the American taxpayers and, especially, \nimportantly, arms negotiations that work. We know this works. This is \nnot a theory. We know it works to reduce the number of nuclear weapons \nby engaging in negotiations and discussions.\n  I have heard lots of reasons for us not to do this: too soon; not \nenough information; not enough detail; more need for consideration--all \nof those things. I have always talked about Mark Twain who said the \nnegative side of a debate never needs any preparation. So I understand \nit is easy to come to the floor saying: Do not do this. Do not do this. \nBut it is those who decide to do things who always prevail to make this \na safer country when you are talking about weapons policies, nuclear \nweapons, and arms reduction.\n  Let me describe why we should do this. First of all, this was \nnegotiated over a long period of time with the interests of our country \nat heart and with substantial negotiation. I was on the National \nSecurity Working Group here in the Senate, and we sat down in secret \nbriefings on many occasions, having the negotiators themselves come \nback and say to us: Here is what we are doing. Let us explain to you \nwhere we are in the negotiations. This treaty did not emerge out of \nthin air. All of us were involved and had the ability to understand \nwhat they were doing.\n\n  They negotiated a treaty, and we needed to negotiate that treaty \nbecause the circumstances that exist now are that we do not have, given \nthe previous treaties' expiration, the capability to know what the \nother side is doing--the inspection capability.\n  Let me describe who supports this treaty. Every former Secretary of \nState now living, Republican and Democrat: Kissinger, Shultz, Baker, \nEagleburger, Christopher, Albright, Powell, Rice--all of them support \nthe treaty. They say it is the right thing for this country, it is \nimportant for us to do.\n  Let me put up especially the comment of Henry Kissinger because he \nsaid it this way:\n\n       I recommend ratification of this treaty. . . . It should be \n     noted I come from the hawkish side of the debate, so I am not \n     here advocating these measures in the abstract.\n\n  He said:\n\n       I try to build them into my perception of national \n     interest. I recommend ratification of this treaty.\n\n  I just mentioned my colleague Senator Lugar. He had a partnership \nwith our former colleague, Senator Nunn, and it is properly called \nNunn-Lugar, and we have talked a lot about it. I have talked about it \nmany times on the floor of this Senate. It is one of the things we \nshould be so proud of having done. I am sure Senator Lugar--I have not \ntalked to him about this--but I am sure he regards it as one of the \nsignificant accomplishments of his career, the Nunn-Lugar program.\n  As a result of that program, the Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus are \nnow free of nuclear weapons. Think of that--free of nuclear weapons. \nAlbania has no more chemical weapons. Madam President, 7,500 nuclear \nwarheads have been deactivated as a result of this program. The weapons \nof mass destruction that have been eliminated: 32 ballistic missile \nsubmarines, 1,400 long-range nuclear missiles, 906 nuclear air-to-\nsurface missiles, 155 bombers that carried nuclear weapons.\n  It is not hard to see the success of this. I have shown before--and \nwill again--the photographs of what Nunn-Lugar means and its success. \nYou can argue with a lot of things on this floor, but not photographic \nevidence, it seems to me. Shown in this photograph is the explosion of \nan SS-18 missile silo that held a missile with a nuclear warhead aimed \nvery likely at an American city.\n  The silo is gone. The missile is gone. The nuclear warhead is gone. \nThere are now sunflower seeds planted. It is such an important symbol \nof the success of these kinds of agreements.\n  This next photograph shows the Nunn-Lugar program eliminating a \nTyphoon class ballistic missile submarine.\n  We did not track it in the deep waters of some far away ocean and \ndecide to engage it and succeed in the engagement. We did not do that \nat all. We paid money to destroy this submarine.\n  I have the ground-up copper wire in a little vial in this desk from a \nsubmarine that used to carry missiles aimed at America.\n  Here is an example of what happened under Nunn-Lugar, dismantling a \nBlackjack bomber. We paid to have that bomber destroyed. We did not \nshoot it down. We did not have to.\n  Now this START agreement. ADM Michael Mullen, the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff--I want everybody to understand this because \nthere are some people coming to the floor saying: Well, from a military \nstandpoint, this might leave us vulnerable, short of what we should \nhave. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says:\n\n       I, the Vice Chairman, and the Joint Chiefs, as well as our \n     combatant commanders around the world, stand solidly behind \n     this new treaty, having had the opportunity to provide our \n     counsel, to make our recommendations, and to help shape the \n     final agreements.\n       We stand behind this treaty, representing the best \n     strategic interests of this country.\n\n  Finally, with respect to the issue of funding, I want to make some \npoints about that because I chair the subcommittee that funds nuclear \nweapons here in the Congress. There has been some discussion that there \nis not ample funding here for modernization of our current weapons \nprograms. That is not the case. It is not true.\n\n[[Page S10358]]\n\n  Let me describe where we are with respect to funding, and let me \npredicate that by saying Linton Brooks was the former NNSA \nAdministrator; that is, he ran the program dealing with nuclear \nweapons, the nuclear weapons complex. Here is what he said:\n\n       START, as I now understand it, is a good idea on its own \n     merits, but I think for those who think it is only a good \n     idea if you only have a strong weapons program, this budget \n     ought to take care of that.\n\n  He said:\n\n       Coupled with the out-year projections, it takes care of the \n     concerns about the complex, and it does very good things \n     about the stockpile, and it should keep the labs [the \n     National Laboratories] healthy.\n\n  He says: ``I would have killed for this kind of budget.'' I would \nhave killed for this kind of budget. This is the man who understands \nthe money needed to make sure our stockpile of nuclear weapons is a \nstockpile you can have confidence in.\n  So this notion that somehow there is an underfunding or a lack of \nfunding for the nuclear weapons life extension programs and \nmodernization programs is sheer nonsense.\n  Let me describe what we have done. As I said, I chair the \nsubcommittee that funds these programs. The President in his budget \nproposed robust funding. While most other things were held constant--\nvery little growth, in many cases no growth at all; in some cases, less \nfunding than in the past--the President said for fiscal year 2011, he \nwanted $7 billion for the life extension programs and modernization for \nthe current nuclear weapons stock, and that is because people are \nconcerned if we were to use our nuclear weapons, are we assured they \nwork. Well, you know what. I don't mean to minimize that, but the fact \nis we have so many nuclear weapons, as do the Russians and others, that \nif one works, unfortunately, it would be a catastrophe for this world. \nIn fact, if they are used, it will be a catastrophe. But having said \nthat, the proposal was $7 billion. That was a 10-percent increase over \nfiscal year 2010.\n  So then the President came out with a budget for the fiscal year we \nare now going to be in and he said, All right, in response to the \npeople in the Senate--there were some who were insisting on much more \nspending--he said, All right, we did a 10-percent increase for that \nyear on the programs to modernize our existing nuclear weapons stock, \nand we will go to another 10-percent increase for next year, fiscal \nyear 2012. So we have a 10-percent increase, and another 10-percent \nincrease.\n  I was out in North Dakota traveling down some county highway one day \nand was listening to the news and they described how money from my \nAppropriations Committee was going to be increased by another $4 \nbillion for the next 5 years. I am thinking, that is interesting, \nbecause nobody has told me about that: $4 billion added to this; first \n10 percent, then 10 percent, now $4 billion more. And we have people \ncoming to the floor who have previously talked about the difficulty of \nthe Federal debt, $13 trillion debt, $1.3 trillion annual budget \ndeficit, choking and smothering this country in debt. They are saying, \nyou know what, we don't have enough money. We are getting 10-percent \nincreases, plus $4 billion; still not enough, we want more. And the \npeople who run the place say, I would have killed to get a budget like \nthat.\n  Someplace somebody has to sober up here in terms of what these \nnumbers mean. I swear, if you play out the numbers for the next 5 \nyears, the commitment this administration has made for the life \nextension programs and the modernization programs for our existing \nnuclear weapons stock--there is no question we have the capability to \ncertify that our nuclear weapons program is workable and that we ought \nto have confidence in it.\n  I don't understand how this debate has moved forward with the notion \nthat somehow this is underfunded. It is not at all. In fact, there is \nfunding for buildings that have not yet been designed. We don't ever do \nthat. In fact, the money for the nuclear weapons program was the only \nthing that was stuck in at the last minute in the continuing \nresolution. All the other government programs are on a continuing \nresolution which means they are being funded at last year's level, \nexcept the nuclear weapons program. That extra money was put in, in the \ncontinuing resolution. Why? To try to satisfy those who apparently have \nan insatiable appetite for more and more and more spending in these \nareas. We are spending more than at any other time and so much more \nthan anybody in the world has ever spent on these things. So nobody \nshould stand up here with any credibility and suggest this is \nunderfunded. It is not. It is not. The people who understand and run \nthese programs know it is not, yet some here are trying to shove more \nmoney into these programs for buildings that haven't even been designed \nyet. We have never done that before. People know better than that.\n  Another issue: They say, Well, this is going to limit our ability \nwith respect to antiballistic missile systems. It does not. That has \nlong been discredited. There is nothing here that is going to limit \nthat. They say, Well, but the Russians, they put a provision in that \nsays that they can withdraw because of missile defense--yes, they put \nthat in the last START agreement as well. It doesn't mean anything to \nus. It is not part of what was agreed to. There is nothing here that is \ngoing to limit us with respect to our antiballistic missile programs to \nprotect this country and to protect others.\n  It is so difficult to think this is some other issue. It is not. One \nday somebody is going to wake up if we are not smart and if we don't \ndecide that our highest priority is to reduce the number of nuclear \nweapons and stop the spread of nuclear weapons, one day we will all \nwake up and we will read a headline that someone has detonated a \nnuclear weapon somewhere on this planet and killed hundreds of \nthousands of people in the name of a terrorist act. When that happens, \neverything about life on this planet is going to change. That is why it \nis our responsibility. We are the leading nuclear power on Earth. We \nmust lead in this area. I have been distressed for 10 years at what \nhappened in this Senate on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. This \ncountry never should have turned that down. We did. We are not testing, \nbut we still should have been the first to ratify the treaty.\n  The question now is, Will we decide to not be assertive and \naggressive on behalf of arms control treaties we have negotiated \ncarefully that have strong bipartisan support? Will we decide that is \nnot important? I hope not. It falls on our shoulders here in the United \nStates of America to lead the world on these issues. We have to try to \nprevent the issues of Korea and Iran and rogue nations and the spread \nof others who want nuclear--we have to keep nuclear weapons out of the \nhands of those who would use them. Then we have to continue to find \nways to reduce the number of nuclear weapons on this Earth. My \ncolleague talked about tactical nuclear weapons. This doesn't involve \ntactical nuclear weapons. I wish it did, but it doesn't. We have to get \nthrough this in order to get to limiting tactical nuclear weapons. The \nRussians have far more of them than we do, and the quicker we get to \nthat point of negotiating tactical weapons, the better off we are.\n  In conclusion, I was thinking about how easy it is to come to the \nfloor of the Senate and oppose. The negative side never requires any \npreparation. That is the case. Mark Twain was right. Abe Lincoln once \nwas in a debate with Douglas and Douglas was propounding a rather \nstrange proposal that Abe Lincoln was discarding and he called it ``as \nthin as the homeopathic soup that was made by boiling the shadow of a \npigeon that had starved to death.''\n  Well, you know, I come here and I listen to some of these debates. I \nrespect everybody. I do. Everybody comes here with a point. But I will \ntell you this: Those who believe this is not in the interest of this \ncountry, those who believe we are not adequately funding our nuclear \nweapon stock, those who believe this is going to hinder our ability for \nan antiballistic missile system that would protect our country, that is \nas thin as the homeopathic soup described by Abraham Lincoln. It is not \naccurate.\n  This is bipartisan. It is important for the country. We ought to do \nthis sooner, not later.\n  Let me conclude by saying, the work done by my two colleagues is \nstrong, assertive, bipartisan work that builds on some very important \nwork for the\n\n[[Page S10359]]\n\nlast two decades, Senator Kerry and Senator Lugar--I don't know whether \nthere will be ever be a Kerry-Lugar, but there was a Nunn-Lugar that \nhas been so important to this country and to the safety and security of \nthis world. I hope this is the next chapter in building block by block \nby block this country's responsibility to be a world leader in saying, \nWe want a world that is safer by keeping nuclear weapons out of the \nhands of those who don't have them, and then aggressively negotiating \nto try to reduce the nuclear weapons that do now exist.\n  Some months ago I was at a place outside of Moscow where my colleague \nSenator Lugar has previously visited, and that facility is devoted to \nthe training and the security of nuclear weapons. I suspect Senator \nLugar, because he knows a lot about this and has worked a lot on it for \na long time, thinks a lot about those issues, as do I. Are we certain \nthat these 25,000 nuclear weapons spread around the world are always \nsecure, always safe, will never be subject to theft? The answer to that \nis no, but we are trying very hard. This treaty is one more step in the \nattempt we must make to exercise our leadership responsibility that is \nours. So my compliments to Senator Kerry and Senator Lugar and to all \nof the others who are engaged in this discussion and who have worked so \nhard and have done so for decades on these nuclear weapons issue and \narms reduction issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe passage of H.R. 6392, a bill to designate the facility of the U.S. \nPostal Service located at 5003 Westfields Boulevard in Centreville, VA, \nas the Colonel George Juskalian Post Office Building.\n  Colonel Juskalian passed away this past Fourth of July, at the age of \n96, having served our nation for nearly 30 years on active duty, \nincluding campaigns during World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. After \ngrowing up in Massachusetts, he joined the U.S. Army in 1939 and was \ncalled to active duty as a first lieutenant in 1940. He served with \ndistinction in World War II, during which time he was captured by the \nGermans in Tunisia and spent 27 months in prisoner of war camps in \nItaly, Germany and Poland.\n  Upon his return home, Colonel Juskalian served in General \nEisenhower's secretariat in the Pentagon between 1945 and 1948, and \ncontinued to serve our nation with distinction until his retirement \nwith the rank of colonel in 1967. He received the Army's highest award \nfor noncombat service, the Legion of Merit, as well as four Silver \nStars, three Bronze Stars, and the Army Commendation Medal, among \nothers.\n  Apart from his military service, the colonel was a longtime resident \nof Centreville and was actively involved in his community. He was an \nactive participant in organizations such as the Armenian Assembly of \nAmerica, American Legion Post 1995, and the Blue and Grey Veterans of \nForeign Wars Post 8469 up until his death earlier this year. Many knew \nthe colonel through his volunteer work at local schools, where he \nshared his strong belief in giving back to our communities and our \nnation, through military service or otherwise.\n  By passing this bill and naming the Centreville Post Office facility \nafter Colonel George Juskalian, we will be honoring both Colonel \nJuskalian's many years of service as well as the sacrifices made by all \nmembers of the United States Armed Services. H.R. 6392 has the strong \nsupport of the Virginia American Legion, Post 1995, as well as the \nlocal division of Veterans of Foreign Wars, Post 8469. I have letters \nof support from both organizations and, without objection, would like \nto submit them for the record.\n  I applaud the efforts of my friend and colleague in the House, \nCongressman Frank Wolf, who united the Virginia delegation as co-\nsponsors of this bill and effectively ushered it through the House of \nRepresentatives by a unanimous vote. Now it is time for the Senate to \nact. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting swift passage of \nthis bill to honor such a courageous, admirable veteran and proud \nVirginian.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                    American Legion Post 1995,\n\n                                 Centreville, VA, August 16, 2010.\n     Hon. Mark R. Warner,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Frank R. Wolf,\n     U.S. Congress,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner/Congressman Wolf, It is with great \n     honor and privilege, and on behalf of American Legion Post \n     1995, Centreville, Virginia that I submit to you a proposal \n     for designating the United States Postal Facility located at \n     5003 Westfields Boulevard, Centreville, VA as the ``Colonel \n     George Juskalian Post Office.'' Sadly, Col Juskalian passed \n     away on 4 July 2010.\n       As Congressman Wolf so eloquently stated in the chambers of \n     the House of Representatives on 26 July, Col Juskalian, U.S. \n     Army (Ret.), served the United States with high distinction \n     for nearly 30 years, including service in WWII, Korea, and \n     Vietnam.\n       Colonel Juskalian survived the hardships of being a German \n     Prisoner of War, enduring nearly three years harsh treatment \n     in Nazi POW camps. Throughout his ordeal, and in later \n     service in our nation's wars, he upheld the highest ideals of \n     American servicemen. In so doing; he earned two Silver Stars \n     and four Bronze Stars for actions in combat.\n       Upon leaving the military, he remained a long time resident \n     of the Commonwealth of Virginia and continued to serve his \n     community until his death at age 96. He volunteered and \n     educated our youth in local schools, mainly with a message of \n     the importance of one's giving back to our community and \n     nation. He shared a strong belief in serving--in the military \n     or in other ways--in appreciation for the freedoms and rights \n     enjoyed by all and paid for by few.\n       Although Centreville, Virginia has many residents that have \n     served our nation with distinction, there is no monument, \n     plaque or memorial dedicated to the men and women of the U.S. \n     Armed Forces. Naming the Centreville Postal Facility for \n     Colonel Juskalian would represent a constant reminder to \n     patrons of the service and sacrifices made by military \n     veterans in their community.\n       By placing Colonel Juskalian's name and a small memorial in \n     the Centreville Post Office, we honor him and all veterans \n     within our community, past, present, and future.\n       For God and Country,\n                                                Peter F. DeFreece,\n     Commander.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     Blue and Gray\n\n\n                            Veterans of Foreign War Post 8469,\n\n                             Fairfax Station, VA, August 16, 2010.\n     Hon. Mark R. Warner,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Frank R. Wolf,\n     U.S. Congress,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner and Congressman Wolf: I am writing on \n     behalf of our VFW Post, of which the late Colonel George \n     Juskalian US Army retired was a member, to endorse the \n     recommendation to designate the United States Post Office at \n     5003 Westfields Blvd, Centreville, VA as the ``Colonel George \n     Juskalian Post Office.''\n       This is what Colonel Juskalian looked like in recent years. \n     He always sported a smile and he had a quick wit and he was \n     both an active member of our Post, but he was also the recent \n     Commander of the local chapter of American Ex-Prisoners of \n     War. Here is what he looked like after he came home as a hero \n     of World War II. On 28 January 1943, George rushed forward of \n     friendly lines to help rescue a reconnaissance patrol which \n     had been discovered by an overwhelming German force. Although \n     George was captured and spent the next 27 months in various \n     prison camps, his valor was recognized by the Army and he was \n     awarded the Silver Star Medal, our nation's third highest \n     battlefield award for heroism. While imprisoned with the \n     British for 3 of his 27 months of captivity, George overcame \n     continuing claustrophobia and helped dig an escape tunnel but \n     was transferred to a camp of only US prisoners in Poland \n     before he could escape. During the bleak late winter of 1945 \n     George and his fellow prisoners were force marched westward \n     to Hammelburg, Germany just in time to see the ill-fated Baum \n     rescue force enter their POW camp without enough force to \n     make it back. George forced an escape anyway and was \n     ultimately recaptured. He was bombed by US planes near \n     Nuremburg and watched as 40 of his comrades died, but he was \n     ultimately liberated by the US 45th Infantry Division.\n       Upon return to the United States, the scrappy little \n     officer volunteered to undergo refresher infantry training \n     and join in the invasion of Japan but the war ended first. \n     After the war George worked for General of the Army \n     Eisenhower in the Pentagon and must have done an impressive \n     job because he was offered a Regular Army commission during a \n     period when the Army was reduced in size dramatically. During \n     the Korean conflict, George was offered a plum assignment \n     away from the fighting but asked instead to be assigned to \n     Korea. There, George was assigned to command the 1st \n     Battalion, 32nd Infantry Regiment of the 7th Infantry \n     Division, then in combat as part of X Corps. George was \n     ordered to re-take a key hilltop which had just been captured \n     by the Chinese, called ``Old Baldy.'' Because high explosives \n     had denuded the peak, the only covered approach to the \n     objective was across a minefield, through which a path was \n     cleared at the point of a bayonet. The battalion's attack was \n     pressed with such ferocity that much of the hill was re-\n     taken, but the battalion was decimated and withdrawn under\n\n[[Page S10367]]\n\n     orders from higher headquarters. George was awarded a Silver \n     Star for heroism during the action.\n       After Korea, George had assignments literally around the \n     world but not surprisingly, fate found George, now a full \n     Colonel, in Vietnam during 1963-4 assigned initially as a \n     deputy Corps Advisor in the Mekong Delta, and later as the \n     Inspector General of Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, \n     working directly under General William Westmoreland. George \n     was subsequently assigned as the Deputy Chief of Staff for \n     Operations and Training for the Military District of \n     Washington and retired on 30 April 1967. George's awards \n     include: the Silver Star with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Legion of \n     Merit, the Bronze Star Medal with three Oak Leaf Clusters, \n     the Air Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the POW Medal, \n     numerous campaign medals; the Combat Infantryman Badge with \n     star, the War Department General Staff Device, and the \n     Parachutist Badge.\n       Following retirement, George did volunteer work with \n     numerous benevolent and veterans groups. From 1974-80, George \n     was the Director of Graduate Admissions at Southeastern \n     University while he concurrently studied for his Masters in \n     Business and Public Administration. He served a three year \n     appointment to the Veterans Administration Advisory Committee \n     for Former Prisoners of War. He was active with the scouts \n     and served in Armenian community relief and religious \n     organizations and was most recently the Commander of the \n     local chapter of American Ex-Prisoners of War.\n       In 1838 a young Abraham Lincoln spoke of ``the generation \n     just gone to rest,'' and the War for Independence by saying:\n       ``At the close of that struggle, nearly every adult male \n     had been a participator in some of its scenes. The \n     consequence was, that of those scenes, in the form of a \n     husband, a father, a son or a brother, a living history was \n     to be found in every family--a history bearing the \n     indubitable testimonies of its own authenticity, in the limbs \n     mangled, in the scars of wounds received, in the midst of the \n     very scenes related--a history, too, that could be read and \n     understood alike by all, the wise and the ignorant, the \n     learned and the unlearned. But those histories are gone. They \n     can be read no more forever. They were a fortress of \n     strength; but what invading foemen could never do the silent \n     artillery of time has done; the leveling of its walls. They \n     are gone. . . .''\n       Thousands of our World War II heroes are leaving us every \n     day. Centreville needs a lasting reminder of their service \n     and sacrifice for all the generations to come.

Madam President, America had an election on November 2. \nLet me begin by reminding my colleagues that the American people spoke \nloudly and clearly in November and chose a far different team to serve \nin Washington. A vastly different leadership will soon take over in the \nHouse of Representatives, and a substantially different group of \nSenators was chosen by the American people in the election on November \n2.\n  It seems the leadership of this lameduck Senate is determined, in the \nwaning days of 2010, to pack quite a bit of legislation that normally \nis debated over a considerable amount of time into just a few days--not \nonly the START treaty that we are on now but also don't ask, don't tell \nand supposedly the majority leader has not given up on the DREAM Act, \nwhich would provide amnesty to many illegal immigrants, and also there \nis the massive Omnibus appropriations bill with 2,000-plus pages.\n  So we are here at this time, realizing that if the Congress doesn't \nact, the government will run out of money on Saturday. I assume a \nshort-term CR will be done to address that. But certainly, it would be \nmuch easier if we passed what the minority leader suggested today; that \nis, a reasonable short-term resolution, so the government can be funded \nand the lights can stay on until mid-February, and the newly elected \nCongress--the people's choice--can best decide these great issues that \nare facing our country.\n  I did find it interesting, a few moments ago, to hear the chairman of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee scold the Senate about the number of \nfilibusters we have supposedly had in this term of Congress. I believe \nthe statement was made that we have had more filibusters in the last 2 \nyears than we have had in decades or since World War II or words to \nthat effect. Here is why that statement is only true in a very \ntechnical sense.\n  It has been the practice of the majority, during the 3 years I have \nbeen in the Senate--and from what I understand much longer before \nthat--to\n\n[[Page S10368]]\n\nbring a bill to the floor of the Senate. He immediately fills the \namendment tree; that is, he offers all the amendments that are allowed \nunder the parliamentary rules of the Senate. That is called filling the \ntree. It is so nobody else has an opportunity to file an amendment. \nThen, the majority leader files cloture on that bill. Technically, yes, \nthat is considered a filibuster. But I do not believe that is what most \nof the American people consider a filibuster and a delaying tactic, \nwith excessive speechifying, when they hear the term ``filibuster.''\n  So let's be clear that there has been an unusual practice--at least \nin the last 3 or 4 years--of calling up a bill, filling the tree, \nfiling for cloture, and then that goes down in history as a filibuster. \nWith all we have to do and all our leadership has determined we must \nconsider during these waning days of December 2010, we must divide our \nattention between an expensive 2,000-page omnibus bill and the \nconsideration of a very complicated arms control agreement. It is that \nagreement I will discuss.\n  It is hard to imagine a more important, more serious issue than our \nnuclear weapons stockpile. In my view, such a debate deserves our \nundivided attention. But we will pivot in a few moments and move to the \nomnibus bill.\n  I wish to take what time I have at this point to begin sharing my \nconcerns over this treaty and the effect it might have on national \nsecurity.\n  Article II of the Constitution requires that the Senate ratify any \ntreaty the President signs with a two-thirds vote. I take this \nresponsibility very seriously, as I am sure all my colleagues do. This \nresponsibility requires us to review any proposed treaty to ensure it \nis in the national interest of the United States of America.\n  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a member of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, I have participated in the review of \nthis treaty to date. While I appreciate the efforts of my chairman and \nmy ranking member, I am not convinced that the treaty, in its current \nform, is in the national interests of the United States of America.\n  I might add I am not alone in this view. To hear debate on the floor \nfrom time to time today, one would think all the learned authorities, \nall the collective wisdom of the United States of America, present and \npast, are in favor of the hasty ratification of this treaty. I simply \npoint out that there is a wide variety of information and opinion out \nthere that should be brought to the attention of Members of the Senate \nand the American people.\n  First of all, I point out to my colleagues an op-ed by former \nSecretary of State Condoleezza Rice, which appeared in the December 7, \n2010, issue of the Wall Street Journal, entitled ``New Start: Ratify, \nwith Caveats.'' Secretary Rice is generally in favor of the direction \nwe are headed in the ratification of the START treaty. But she does say \nwe need two caveats before ratification takes place. First, she states \nthat smaller forces make the modernization of our nuclear \ninfrastructure even more urgent. She commends the valiant efforts of \nMembers of the Senate, including Senator Jon Kyl, to gain more robust \nmodernization of our nuclear weapons. Secondly, the former Secretary of \nState says the Senate must make absolutely clear that in ratifying this \ntreaty, the United States is not reestablishing the Cold War link \nbetween offensive forces and missile defenses. She says it is troubling \nthat New START's preamble is unclear in this respect.\n  I wonder, if we do decide as a Senate to move toward consideration of \nthis treaty, if we will be allowed to offer amendments to the preamble \nto address the concerns of our immediate past Secretary of State.\n  Further, I commend to my colleagues a Wall Street Journal op-ed, \ndated November 15, 2010, by R. James Woolsey. As my colleagues know, \nand many Americans know, Mr. Woolsey has a distinguished record as a \ndelegate at large to the START and defense-based negotiations, back \nduring the mid-1980s, as ambassador and chief negotiator for the \nConventional Armed Forces of Europe Treaty from 1989 to 1991, and was \nPresident Clinton's Director of Central Intelligence from 1993 to 1995. \nSo this bipartisan, experienced, former government official lists four \nconcerns that he has with regard to the New START treaty. No. 1, he \nwonders about this administration's commitment to modernization. No. 2, \nhe says it needs to be made clear that the United States, in ratifying \nNew START, will not be limited at all in its missile defense, and he \ndoes not believe that has been taken care of. No. 3, Director Woolsey, \nPresident Clinton's Director of Central Intelligence, says this treaty \nrepresents a step backward in the verification process between the \nUnited States and Russia. Finally, Mr. Woolsey cites the need for a \nbinding resolution on Russian submarine-launched cruise missiles. So I \nthink there is information Members of the Senate need to hear about and \nneed to consider.\n  Further, I will mention two opinion pieces. One is by Stephen \nRademaker, an Assistant Secretary of State from 2002 to 2006. It is a \nWashington Post op-ed on Friday, August 20, 2010. Secretary Rademaker \nauthored an opinion piece saying this is no way to approve the New \nSTART treaty. In his opinion piece, Mr. Rademaker said Senate critics \nof New START have largely been cut out of the process.\n  I know this from personal experience as a member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee. He goes on to say that all but two Republicans on \nthe Foreign Relations Committee formally asked the administration to \nshare with them the negotiating record of the treaty. They were told \nno, even though there is precedent for accommodating such requests.\n  A simple request--had it been accommodated--perhaps could have \nallayed some of the concerns we have.\n  In another op-ed, Mr. Rademaker, on December 10 of this year, said \nSTART will not stop nuclear proliferation. He points out that the claim \nthat progress in United States-Russian arms control will help stop \ncountries such as Iran from getting nuclear weapons isn't just an \nargument offered in support of New START, it is also one of the key \npremises underlying President Obama's embrace of global nuclear \ndisarmament. There is just one problem. He said the notion that faster \ndisarmament will lead to greater progress against nuclear proliferation \nhas never added up.\n  Then, further, I will quote from a September 8, 2010, Wall Street \nJournal piece by John Bolton, a senior fellow at the American \nEnterprise Institute and former Under Secretary of State for Arms \nControl and International Security from 2001 to 2005. Secretary Bolton \nobserves that the treaty's return to outmoded Cold War limits on \nweapons launchers, which will require the United States but not Russia \nto dismantle existing delivery systems, is a problem. He goes on to say \nthis could cripple America's long-range conventional warhead delivery \ncapabilities, while also severely constraining our nuclear flexibility. \nHe said: ``We will pay for this mistake in future conflicts entirely \nunrelated to Russia.''\n  I say to my colleagues that the jury is still out on this issue. \nThese are experienced public servants, experts, and current observers \nof the international scene and the nuclear negotiation process. They \nhave given us words that give me pause. It makes me think there is no \nreason to rush into a hasty ratification of this treaty.\n  With regard to the process, hearings first started in May of this \nyear. I was one of the Foreign Relations Committee members to request \nnine witnesses we believed were important and necessary to cover the \nextent of our concerns.\n  This request was denied. There is no reason such a request would have \nbeen denied. In 12 hearings, there were two witnesses who spoke in \nopposition to this treaty. Members of the minority party requested \nothers, but it nowhere came anywhere near the normal precedent given to \nthe minority to have at least one witness on each panel. I was \nconcerned that no former National Lab Directors were invited to \ntestify.\n  It is essential that an appropriate amount of time be spent on the \nSenate floor considering this treaty. Members who have serious concerns \nmust be permitted the opportunity to offer amendments that would \naddress the full range of problems.\n  I would simply point out, this is the last quote of this speech \ntoday. In endorsing the START treaty, the Washington Post, on November \n19, said:\n\n       Positive steps had been made and the treaty ought to be \n     approved.\n\n\n[[Page S10369]]\n\n\n  But it went on to say, the Editorial Board of the Washington Post \nwent on to say:\n\n       But no calamity will befall the United States if the Senate \n     does not act this year.\n\n  I could not agree more with the Washington Post. It will not be a \ncalamity if we are given adequate time to fully discuss, to fully \nexamine, to fully debate all of the ramifications about an issue so \nprofound as our nuclear weapons capability. The worst thing this body \ncould do is shirk our constitutional responsibility by rushing this \nthrough in the final days of this lameduck session simply to check the \nbox before the new team, the newly elected team comes to Washington and \ntakes office in January.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Wall Street Journal article I \nreferenced be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 7, 2010]\n\n                    New Start: Ratify, With Caveats\n\n                         (By Condoleezza Rice)\n\n       When U.S. President Bush and Russian President Putin signed \n     the Moscow Treaty in 2002, they addressed the nuclear threat \n     by reducing offensive weapons, as their predecessors had. But \n     the Moscow Treaty was different. It came in the wake of \n     America's 2001 withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile \n     Treaty of 1972, and for the first time the United States and \n     Russia reduced their offensive nuclear weapons with no \n     agreement in place that constrained missile defenses.\n       Breaking the link between offensive force reductions and \n     limits on defense marked a key moment in the establishment of \n     a new nuclear agenda no longer focused on the Cold War face-\n     off between the Warsaw Pact and NATO. The real threat was \n     that the world's most dangerous weapons could end up in the \n     hands of the world's most dangerous regimes--or of terrorists \n     who would launch attacks more devastating than 9/11. And \n     since those very rogue states also pursued ballistic \n     missiles, defenses would (alongside offensive weapons) be \n     integral to the security of the United States and our allies.\n       It is in this context that we should consider the potential \n     contribution of the New Start treaty to U.S. national \n     security. The treaty is modest, reducing offensive nuclear \n     weapons to 1,550 on each side--more than enough for \n     deterrence. While the treaty puts limits on launchers, U.S. \n     military commanders have testified that we will be able to \n     maintain a triad of bombers, submarine-based delivery \n     vehicles and land-based delivery vehicles. Moreover, the \n     treaty helpfully reinstates on-site verification of Russian \n     nuclear forces, which lapsed with the expiration of the \n     original Start treaty last year. Meaningful verification was \n     a significant achievement of Presidents Reagan and George \n     H.W. Bush, and its reinstatement is crucial.\n       Still, there are legitimate concerns about New Start that \n     must and can be addressed in the ratification process and, if \n     the treaty is ratified, in future monitoring of the Obama \n     administration's commitments.\n       First, smaller forces make the modernization of our nuclear \n     infrastructure even more urgent. Sen Jon Kyl of Arizona has \n     led a valiant effort in this regard. Thanks to his efforts, \n     roughly $84 billion is being allocated to the Department of \n     Energy's nuclear weapons complex. Ratifying the treaty will \n     help cement these commitments, and Congress should fully fund \n     the president's program. Congress should also support the \n     Defense Department in modernizing our launchers as suggested \n     in the recent defense strategy study coauthored by former \n     Secretary of Defense Bill Perry and former National \n     Security Adviser Stephen Hadley.\n       Second, the Senate must make absolutely clear that in \n     ratifying this treaty, the U.S. is not re-establishing the \n     Cold War link between offensive forces and missile defenses. \n     New Start's preamble is worrying in this regard, as it \n     recognizes the ``interrelationship'' of the two. \n     Administration officials have testified that there is no \n     link, and that the treaty will not limit U.S. missile \n     defenses. But Congress should ensure that future Defense \n     Department budgets reflect this.\n       Moscow contends that only current U.S. missile-defense \n     plans are acceptable under the treaty. But the U.S. must \n     remain fully free to explore and then deploy the best \n     defenses--not just those imagined today. That includes \n     pursuing both potential qualitative breakthroughs and \n     quantitative increases.\n       I have personally witnessed Moscow's tendency to interpret \n     every utterance as a binding commitment. The Russians need to \n     understand that the U.S. will use the full-range of American \n     technology and talent to improve our ability to intercept and \n     destroy the ballistic missiles of hostile countries.\n       Russia should be reassured by the fact that its nuclear \n     arsenal is far too sophisticated and large to be degraded by \n     our missile defenses. In addition, the welcome agreements on \n     missile-defense cooperation reached in Lisbon recently \n     between NATO and Russia can improve transparency and allow \n     Moscow and Washington to work together in this field. After \n     all, a North Korean or Iranian missile is not a threat only \n     to the United States, but to international stability broadly.\n       Ratification of the treaty also should not be sold as a way \n     to buy Moscow's cooperation on other issues. The men in the \n     Kremlin know that loose nukes in the hands of terrorists--\n     some who operate in Russia's unstable south--are dangerous. \n     That alone should give our governments a reason to work \n     together beyond New Start and address the threat from \n     tactical nuclear weapons, which are smaller and more \n     dispersed, and therefore harder to monitor and control. \n     Russia knows too that a nuclear Iran in the volatile Middle \n     East or the further development of North Korea's arsenal is \n     not in its interest. Russia lives in those neighborhoods. \n     That helps explain Moscow's toughening stance toward Tehran \n     and its longstanding concern about Pyongyang.\n       The issue before the Senate is the place of New Start in \n     America's future security. Nuclear weapons will be with us \n     for a long time. After this treaty, our focus must be on \n     stopping dangerous proliferators--not on further reductions \n     in the U.S. and Russian strategic arsenals, which are really \n     no threat to each other or to international stability.\n       A modern but smaller nuclear arsenal and increasingly \n     sophisticated defenses are the right bases for U.S. nuclear \n     security (and that of our allies) going forward. With the \n     right commitments and understandings, ratification of the New \n     Start treaty can contribute to this goal. If the Senate \n     enters those commitments and understandings into a record of \n     ratification, New Start deserves bipartisan support, whether \n     in the lame duck session or next year.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, as we take up the consideration of the \nNew START, we not only have the opportunity, but also an obligation to \nprovide consent on the ratification of this treaty. It is long overdue. \nWe need to regain our ability to provide boots-on-the-ground \nverification of the Russian nuclear complex.\n  Over the past 8 months, we have all had ample opportunity to review \nthe documents and reports related to the New START. We have conducted \n20 hearings, taken over 900 questions. They were questions asked by \nMembers of the Senate, mainly to the administration, in which those \nanswers have been provided; 900 questions, over 900 for the record.\n  In short, we have given significant consideration to the ratification \nof New START. I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are \ncommitted to guaranteeing the security of our country and also \nrecognize the obligation to ratify this arms control agreement \nimmediately.\n  I want to take you back a little bit because I hear my colleagues \ntalking about not having enough time. I want to take you back to a hot \nday this summer in the Foreign Relations Committee, where--Madam \nPresident, you were at that meeting in which those who are now saying \nwe do not have enough time, asked for just a little bit more time, \nduring the impending recess, so we could orderly consider the \nratification process.\n  That was a hot summer day. It is now a snowy day in December, and \nthey are still saying the same thing: Just give us more time. We have \nhad plenty of time.\n  I compliment Senator Kerry and Senator Lugar for the manner in which \nthey have considered this treaty. This is a very important treaty for \nAmerica, and they have made sure that the Senate has had, and each \nSenator has had, ample opportunity to get all of the information we \nneed--all of the information we need from administration individuals or \nfrom experts or from anyone. They have been very open in this process.\n  They have also given every Member of the Senate ample time to get \nevery question answered, to get all of the material they need, and it \nis now time for us to take on our responsibility; that is, to take up \nthis treaty for ratification and vote it up or down.\n  I certainly hope my colleagues will vote to ratify this treaty. I \nthink it is critically important to our national security. In addition \nto its contributions to American security, one of the most compelling \nreasons we should ratify this treaty, and do so before we recess, is to \nregain our insight into Russia's strategic offensive arms.\n  Since START I expired over a year ago, we have had no comprehensive \nverification regime in place in order to help us understand Russia's \nstrategic nuclear force. We need the transparency to know what Russia \nis doing to provide confidence and stability, and we need that \nconfidence and stability to contribute to a safer world. We will\n\n[[Page S10370]]\n\nonly regain that transparency by ratifying this treaty, and we are in \ndangerous territory without it.\n  Let me repeat. We need this treaty for verification. We need this \ntreaty to know what Russia is doing, so we can verify what Russia tells \nus, to make sure, in fact, that it is true. Not only will this treaty \nenhance the national security of the United States, it will serve as a \nsignificant step forward in our relationship with Russia, a key partner \nin the overall U.S. strategy to reduce the spread of nuclear weapons \nworldwide.\n  Let's be perfectly clear about this. There are still two nations that \nhave the majority of the nuclear weapon capacity in this world; it is \nRussia and the United States. Working together, we can make this world \nsafer. Working together, we can move forward with reductions in \nstrategic arms around the world. Working together, we provide the \nleadership so we can move forward against proliferation of nuclear \nweapons. In fact, we have done that.\n  But the failure to ratify this treaty could have a major negative \nimpact on the leadership of the United States in this area. The U.S. \nrelationship with the Russian Federation is key in our efforts to \ncurtail Iran's nuclear ambitions. In June, Russia voted for the latest \nU.N. Security Council sanctions on Iran and later canceled the sale of \nan advanced arms defensive missile system.\n  The ratification of New START is essential in reinitiating \nverification inspections and, more importantly, for the United States \nand Russia to lead the way in reducing the world's nuclear arms \nstockpile. This is for leadership. We all talk about making sure Iran \ndoes not become a nuclear weapons state. Ratifying the New START treaty \nwill help us in making sure Iran does not become a nuclear weapons \nstate. It keeps the United States and Russia focused on strategic arms \nreduction and focused on nonproliferation.\n  The failure to ratify this treaty is a setback in our ability to \neffectively stop Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons state. New START, \nthe first treaty with Russia in almost a decade, calls for both sides \nto reduce their deployed warheads modestly from 2,200 to 1,550. The new \ntreaty would restore verification, inspections, and other exchanges of \ninformation about the American and Russian arsenals. New START could \npay dividends not only by improving nuclear security but by paving the \nway to greater cooperation between the two powers in dealing with such \nhot spots as Iran and Afghanistan.\n  Let me just point out one other part, if I might; that is, previous \narms treaties have been ratified with overwhelming bipartisan support. \nSTART I was passed 93 to 6 in 1994. The Moscow Treaty passed 95 to 0 in \n2003. Legislators recognized then that arms control agreements between \nRussia and the United States are not just good for the security of our \ntwo nations but can lead the way to the world to reduce proliferation \nof nuclear weapons.\n  During last month's NATO Summit in Lisbon, the NATO Secretary General \nstated:\n\n       The New START treaty would also pave the way for arms \n     control and disarmament initiatives and other areas that are \n     vital to Euro-Atlantic security.\n\n  So I think this is a key moment in the history of the Senate. I know \nthere are many important votes that we take in the Senate. There are \nmany votes we take that have very significant consequences. The \nratification of this treaty is just one of those moments. It keeps us \non path and enhances our credibility to make the world safer, and does \nit in a way that enhances the security of the people of the United \nStates of America.\n  This is a treaty that needs to be ratified and needs to be ratified \nnow. I urge my colleagues to vote in the interests of national \nsecurity, to move swiftly, and pass this treaty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I understand Senator Thune is the next \nto speak on the Republican side. I ask unanimous consent to follow him \nafter he has spoken, and Senator Chambliss would then follow me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. I thank the Senator from Illinois for locking in the time. \nI want to start by saying here we are, jammed against the Christmas \nbreak with the majority using Christmas as a backstop to rush through \nan arms control treaty with the Russians and a trillion-dollar spending \nbill on a dual-track basis.\n  What that means is that we are considering, at the same time, two \ndocuments encompassing thousands of pages with very little ability to \noffer meaningful amendments or devote meaningful time to consider the \nfull impact of these documents that will have a far-reaching and long-\nterm impact on our Nation.\n  As I wrote recently in an op-ed that appeared in National Review \nOnline:\n\n       New START misses one opportunity after another to maintain \n     a stable nuclear relationship between our two countries. To \n     remedy this will require significant time on the floor of the \n     Senate. Trying to force it through without ample time for \n     debate and amendments would amount to a Christmas gift to the \n     Russians.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the op-ed I wrote for National Review \nOnline entitled ``Don't Force New START,'' dated December 9, 2010, be \nprinted in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, the Nation's attention is fixed firmly on \nthis travesty of an omnibus trillion-dollar appropriations bill which \nwe should be debating now because the current funding resolution for \nthe government ends tomorrow. We should not be debating a significant \narms control treaty at this late date and trying to dual-track what I \nsaid earlier are thousands of pages of documents that need appropriate \ntime on the floor of the Senate.\n  I want to speak, if I might, briefly today to the substance of the \nSTART agreement and my concerns about that agreement in its current \nform. First of all, I want to speak to the issue of missile defense.\n  The New START treaty not only contains specific limitations on \nmissile defense in article V but also reestablishes an unwise linkage \nin the preamble to the treaty between offense and defense that was \nbroken when the ABM treaty came to an end.\n  Moreover, Russia's unilateral statement that the treaty ``can operate \nand be viable only if the United States of America refrains from \ndeveloping its missile defense capabilities, quantitatively or \nqualitatively'' is extremely troubling.\n  When viewed together, the New START treaty's preamble and Russia's \nunilateral statement amount to a Russian attempt to find a leverage \npoint and exert political pressure upon the United States to forestall \ndeploying a robust missile defense capability, by threatening to \nwithdraw from the treaty if we seek to increase our missile defense \ncapabilities.\n  The remedy for this concern is for the Senate to strike the offensive \npreamble language. That is why I would wholeheartedly support an effort \nto strike the preamble as well as an amendment to strike paragraph 3 of \narticle V of the treaty.\n  Now, with regard to delivery vehicle modernization, and I want to \nspeak specifically in that regard to bombers, nearly 2 years ago I \nbegan to have serious concerns about the administration's commitment to \ndeveloping a follow-on bomber aircraft and its overall commitment to \nthe triad of nuclear delivery vehicles. These concerns were aggravated \nby the administration's decision to terminate the development program \nfor a new bomber and reexamine the need, the requirement, and the \ntechnology.\n  I was also troubled by Secretary Gates's statement on April 6, 2009, \nthat we will examine all of our strategic requirements in light of \npost-START arms control negotiations, which leads me to be concerned \nthat this administration would allow the Russians to have a say in \nwhether we would develop a new bomber.\n  I was gratified to see that the Nuclear Posture Review determined \nthat the United States should sustain the nuclear triad for decades.\n  However, as the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments \nrecently stated in a report entitled, ``Sustaining America's Strategic \nAdvantage in Long-Range Strike,'' the triad is in\n\n[[Page S10371]]\n\ndanger of becoming a dyad by default because nearly half of the bomber \ninventory of the United States, 47 percent, predates the Cuban missile \ncrisis, and the only aircraft the United States possesses today with \nreach and survivability to have a chance of successfully executing \nmissions more than 1,000 nautical miles into enemy territory from the \nlast air-to-air refueling are 16 combat-ready B-2 bombers.\n  Madam President, the B-2 was designed in the 1980s and achieved \ninitial operational capability over a decade ago, and they will \neventually lose their ability to penetrate advanced air defense \nsystems. The need, the requirement, and the technology for the next-\ngeneration bomber is well understood. The need for a new long-range \nstrike capability is urgent because the conflicts of the future will \nlikely feature heavily defended airspace due in large part to the \nproliferation of relatively inexpensive but extremely sophisticated and \ndeadly air defense systems. We have heard testimony before the Armed \nServices Committee from intelligence officials that Russia is the \ndeveloper of most of these advanced air defense systems and is \nexporting those systems both to China and to other countries in the \nworld.\n  Various past and present combatant commanders of the Pacific Command, \nStrategic Command, and Joint Forces Command have each testified in \nsupport of the capability the next-generation bomber will provide.\n  As Senator McCain summarized in his letter to the Foreign Relations \nCommittee on the treaty, the 1251 plan and even the updated plan lack \ncritical details about decisions related to the follow-on ICBM, the \nnext-generation bomber, or a follow-on air-launched cruise missile.\n  General Chilton, the most recent STRATCOM commander, has spoken about \nhow conversations about these matters need to start now.\n  Development of replacement delivery vehicles for all three legs of \nthe triad need to begin during the life of New START. Decisions need to \nbe made and development needs to begin within the next 10 years or \nreplacement systems will not be available when current systems reach \nthe end of their service lives. There is no assurance that the next \nlong-range bomber will be nuclear capable. Therefore, I plan to offer \nan amendment which will require the administration to certify that the \nPresident has made a commitment to develop a replacement heavy bomber \nthat is both nuclear and conventionally capable.\n  With regard to delivery vehicle numbers, on July 9, 2009, at an Armed \nServices Committee hearing, I asked GEN James Cartwright, the Vice \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs, about the administration's commitment at \nthat time to reduce our strategic delivery vehicles to somewhere in the \nrange of 500 to 1,100 systems and to specify at what point in this \nrange would he become concerned that delivery vehicle reductions would \nnecessitate making our nuclear triad into a dyad. General Cartwright \nresponded, ``I would be very concerned if we got down below those \nlevels about midpoint,'' meaning he would be concerned if the \nnegotiated number fell below 800 delivery vehicles. This treaty caps \ndelivery vehicles at 700--substantially below the number General \nCartwright stated a year and a half ago.\n  The administration makes this odd distinction between deployed and \nnondeployed delivery vehicles and points out that the total cap for the \ntreaty is 800 deployed and nondeployed systems. Of course, there is a \nletter from General Cartwright in the Record stating he is comfortable \nwith the distinction between deployed and nondeployed delivery vehicles \nand the overall limits to delivery vehicles. But the real number we are \nworking with here is 700.\n  I think it is worth noting that former Defense Secretary Schlesinger \ntestified to the Foreign Relations Committee on April 29, 2010, that, \n``as to the stated context of strategic nuclear weapons, the numbers \nspecified are adequate, though barely so.''\n  With regard to this limit of 700 deployed delivery vehicles, I find \nit very troubling that the administration has yet to articulate how it \nwill deploy a nuclear force conforming to the number of 700. The \nadministration has informed the Senate how it might field a force of \n720 delivery vehicles, which Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen \nacknowledged in a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on \nJune 17, 2010, would still require further reductions to meet the \ntreaty's central limits.\n  They went on to argue that because the United States will have 7 \nyears to reduce its forces to these limits, they did not find it \nnecessary to identify a final force structure at this point, meaning \nthe Senate will commit the United States to a delivery vehicle force of \n700 without knowing how that force will be composed. This problem is \ncompounded by the fact that the treaty was so poorly negotiated, that \nfor every ICBM or SLBM deployed with a conventional warhead, one less \nnuclear vehicle will be available to the United States.\n  The treaty essentially requires the United States to make unilateral \nreductions in delivery vehicles, as Russia is already well below the \ndelivery vehicle limits and would drastically reduce its arsenal with \nor without this treaty. As the Congressional Research Service writes:\n\n       Russia currently has only 620 launchers, and this number \n     may decline to around 400 deployed and 444 total launchers. \n     This would likely be true whether or not the treaty enters \n     into force because Russia is eliminating older missiles as \n     they age and deploying newer missiles at a far slower pace \n     than that needed to retain 700 deployed launchers.\n\n  Therefore, in light of all these facts, I will seek to offer an \namendment or two regarding the delivery vehicle numbers in this treaty. \nI am also working on several other amendments that I may seek to offer \nregarding prompt global strike and other issues.\n  Ultimately, this is a very significant treaty that deserves full and \nfair consideration, and we should not be jamming the consideration of \nthis treaty up against the Christmas break. As I have indicated, there \nare substantial issues here that need to be fully vetted, and we \nobviously do not have the time to consider these issues this year. We \nshould wait until next year to fully consider this treaty and have a \nfull, free, and wide-open debate on this matter, with no restrictions \non amendments.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the National Review, Dec. 9, 2010]\n\n                         Don't Force New Start\n\n\n        The treaty should not be a Christmas present for Russia\n\n       Twenty-four years ago, Pres. Ronald Reagan traveled to \n     Reykjavik, Iceland, to negotiate an arms control treaty with \n     the Soviet Union. When the Soviets insisted that the treaty \n     must limit America's missile defense program, which was \n     designed to guard against intercontinental ballistic \n     missiles, Reagan walked away. He later explained, ``We prefer \n     no agreement than to bring home a bad agreement to the United \n     States.''\n       Apparently times have changed. President Obama wants to jam \n     a deeply flawed arms-control treaty with Russia, known as New \n     START, through a lame-duck session of the Senate just to rack \n     up an accomplishment before the end of the year.\n       New START misses one opportunity after another to maintain \n     a stable nuclear relationship between our two countries. To \n     remedy this will require significant time on the floor of the \n     Senate. Trying to force it through without ample time for \n     debate and amendments would amount to a Christmas gift to the \n     Russians.\n       First and foremost, missile defense remains a major point \n     of disagreement between the United States and Russia, and \n     this treaty only makes the situation worse. Russia has \n     threatened to withdraw from the treaty if we expand our \n     missile-defense capabilities. It made a similar threat when \n     the original START was completed under the first President \n     Bush. At that time, President Bush said directly that our \n     missile-defense activities have no bearing on Russia's arms-\n     control obligations. I am concerned that President Obama's \n     response to the Russian threat this time is weaker.\n       Moreover, the treaty contains a direct limitation on U.S. \n     missile-defense-system deployments. Why does a treaty \n     ostensibly about offensive weapons mention missile defense at \n     all? It appears to have been included only to appease Russia.\n       Treaty proponents argue that New START furthers the legacy \n     of Ronald Reagan's vision of a world without nuclear weapons. \n     Let's be clear about one thing: President Reagan never would \n     have sacrificed missile defense on the altar of arms control.\n       Second, Russia has an estimated ten-to-one advantage over \n     the United States in tactical nuclear weapons, a situation \n     that was not addressed at all by New START. These are the \n     kinds of weapons that are most susceptible to theft or \n     diversion to emerging threats, including terrorists and rogue \n     nations such as North Korea and Iran. They are the weapons \n     Russia has reportedly moved closer to our NATO allies. One of \n     our top\n\n[[Page S10372]]\n\n     goals going into negotiations on this treaty should have been \n     to close that gap, so why wasn't it mentioned? Because the \n     Russians didn't want to talk about it.\n       Third, treaty proponents argue that the Senate must rush \n     consideration of New START because we now lack the ability to \n     verify what Russia is doing. This would make sense if the \n     verification provisions in the treaty were something to be \n     celebrated and worth rushing into place.\n       However, New START's verification provisions are much \n     weaker than what we had under the previous treaty. This is a \n     serious concern, because experts say Russia has essentially \n     cheated in one way or another on pretty much every major \n     arms-control treaty to which it is a party.\n       What's more, as the expiration date of the previous START \n     approached last year, the administration promised it would \n     come up with some sort of ``bridging agreement'' to keep \n     verification efforts going until the new treaty could be \n     ratified. The parties never finished that agreement, and so \n     any verification gap has been created by the administration.\n       The Senate has a responsibility to consider treaties \n     thoroughly to ensure they are in our country's best interest. \n     It should not rush its duty now to make up for the Obama \n     administration's mistakes. We lose nothing by postponing \n     consideration of this treaty until the new Congress convenes \n     in a few weeks.\n       This flawed treaty has too great an impact on America's \n     national security to be taken lightly or rushed for the sake \n     of political pride.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, before the Senate at this moment is the \nNew START treaty, an agreement between the United States and Russia. \nThis is an effort to try to make this a safer world, to make certain \nthat the nuclear weapons that are in this world are carefully \nmonitored, that they are watched and inspected, and that we reduce any \nurge to expand nuclear weaponry. It is an attempt to make this is a \nsafer world.\n  The President worked long and hard on this. He brought it for \nconsideration months ago, almost 7 months ago, and we have had \nhundreds--at least 200 hearings. I am sorry, let me restate that. We \nhave had many Senate hearings--I don't have the exact number before me, \nbut I will get it--on this matter. We have had many efforts at every \nlevel to bring experts from across America and from around the world to \nsupport our effort and bring this matter before us.\n  What troubles me, Madam President, is the same thing we discussed \nearlier at a press conference. We brought this matter to the floor of \nthe Senate over 24 hours ago. Yet speaker after speaker on the \nRepublican side has used this time on the floor of the Senate to come \nand complain that they do not have any time to speak on the floor of \nthe Senate. They can't have it both ways. They can't come and give a \nspeech about the treaty, yet say the reason we shouldn't take it up is \nthey don't have an opportunity to speak on the treaty. They do have an \nopportunity to speak on the treaty, and they have had it for more than \n24 hours.\n  I asked Senator Kerry, as he left the floor: I know the Republicans \nwant to offer amendments to this treaty. How many amendments have been \nfiled?\n  He said: I will check, but I think only one amendment has been filed.\n  His staff has said that is the current situation--one amendment by \nSenator McCain. Here we are, 26 hours into this debate, and one \namendment has been filed and no amendments have been called. Yet \nspeaker after speaker comes from the Republican side of the aisle and \nsays: The problem with this treaty is we don't have time to speak--as \nthey speak--and we don't have time to offer amendments--as they fail to \noffer amendments.\n  So one has to step back and say that maybe the problem is not a \nproblem of time; maybe the problem is they just don't want to see this \ntreaty passed.\n  Thank goodness for Senator Lugar of Indiana, who has spoken up in \nfavor of this treaty. I said earlier at the press conference and would \nsay again with him on the floor that there aren't a handful of people \nin America who are as expert as he is on this issue of nuclear arms and \nthe safety of those that currently exist. There was a time when people \nacross America thought his name was Senator Nunn-Lugar because they \nkept hearing Nunn-Lugar, Nunn-Lugar. It was a time when Senator Sam \nNunn, a Democrat from Georgia, and Senator Lugar, a Republican from \nIndiana, really led this Nation and this world in taking an honest look \nat nuclear weapons to see how we can make sure they are safe and don't \nthreaten our future. Senator Lugar knows--because he said as much \npublicly--that this treaty moves us in the direction of a safer world.\n  During the height of the Cold War, there were enough nuclear weapons \non our planet to destroy all life many times over. Thank goodness the \nSoviet Union is gone and we are in a new era, a more peaceful era. \nStill, 20 years later, both Russia and the United States have thousands \nof nuclear weapons in their arsenals--far more than either side needs \nfor maintaining security.\n  In an era of terrorist threats, we are faced with new challenges, \nincluding a nuclear-armed Pakistan with al-Qaida operating within its \nborders and countries such as Iran and North Korea pursuing their own \nnuclear programs.\n  This week, we have a chance to make a difference--to reduce the \nnumber of U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons in a way that not only makes \nus safer but also strengthens America's authority in persuading other \nnations around the world to halt their destabilizing practices.\n  Senator Lugar said:\n\n       START would strengthen our nonproliferation diplomacy \n     worldwide, limit potential arms competition, and help us \n     focus our defense resources effectively.\n\n  What a succinct description of a critically important measure before \nus. Yet day after day--2 days now--hour after hour, Senate Republicans \ncome to the floor and say we just don't have time to do this.\n  Efforts to reduce the number of nuclear weapons have always been \nbipartisan in the past, and they should be bipartisan today. As they \nsay, partisanship should end at the water's edge whether the President \nis a Democrat or a Republican. If it is good for America, if it makes \nus safer; if it moves us forward in the goal of a more peaceful world, \nwe should stand together with both parties working on it. \nUnfortunately, the opposition we have heard over and over on the floor \nhas been from the other side.\n  I thank Senator John Kerry. I tell you, this man is a dogged and \ndetermined legislator, and he has been working this issue harder than I \nhave ever seen him work anything in my life, for the last several \nweeks, to get to this moment where we bring it up on the floor. He \nunderstands that last December when the START I treaty expired, it left \nthe United States without key inspectors in Russia and reduced \nimportant security transparency.\n  I would say to Senator Kerry, the modern patron saint of the \nRepublican Party is Ronald Reagan, and Ronald Reagan, in a few words, \nsummarized his view when it came to negotiating: Trust, but verify. For \n376 days, we have been unable to verify what is going on in Russia with \ntheir nuclear weapons. We don't know if they are being held safely--\ntreaty compliant. We just don't know. How can we be safer as a nation \nin blissful ignorance of what is happening?\n  This New START treaty President Obama brings to us will put \ninspectors on the ground in Russia and in the United States to make \ncertain both sides live up to the treaty obligations. That is \nessential. It is something Russian President Medvedev called a ``truly \nhistoric event.'' President Obama said at the signing that this is ``an \nimportant milestone for nuclear security and nonproliferation, and for \nU.S.-Russia relations.'' I couldn't agree with them more.\n  Here is the number I was searching for earlier. The Senate has \nconducted 21 hearings and briefings on the New START treaty--a \nsignificant number of opportunities to debate and assess the treaty.\n  In September, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations \noverwhelmingly approved the treaty on a bipartisan basis. The people \nsupporting this treaty across the board, Democrats and Republicans, \nrepresent the best minds in America in recent history on the \nsubject. They include current administration officials, Secretary of \nState Hillary Clinton, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, as well as Madeleine \nAlbright, former Senator Chuck Hagel, Henry Kissinger, Sam Nunn, Colin \nPowell, James Schlesinger, George Shultz, Brent\n\n[[Page S10373]]\n\nScowcroft, and John Warner. At least seven generals and admirals who \ncommanded our nuclear forces feel the same way.\n\n  This does not restrict the United States when it comes to missile \ndefense. It is very clear it does not. It is one of the things that has \nbeen said, but the people who say it ignore the obvious. It was several \nweeks ago when we had a NATO meeting on missile defense moving forward \nto make our Nation safer, and the Russians were engaged in that dialog. \nIt was a historic breakthrough. They ignored that when they raised that \nissue.\n  As Secretary of Defense Bob Gates has said, the new treaty will \nimpose ``no limits on us'' when it comes to missile defense.\n  There is a concern, as well, expressed that the treaty does nothing \nto address the issue of tactical nuclear weapons, where the Russians \napparently outnumber us. I agree it is a serious issue that needs to be \naddressed, especially from a nonproliferation viewpoint, since many of \nthese weapons are deployed in undisclosed locations. However, this \ntreaty, like the Moscow Treaty and the original START agreement, \ndeliberately and rightly focuses on strategic nuclear weapons.\n  Bipartisanship on issues of national security has been the hallmark \nof our Nation. Even in the toughest of times and in the most desperate \npolitical circumstances we have come together.\n  For example, in 1992, just after the Cold War came to an end, the \nSenate ratified the first strategic arms reduction treaty by an \noverwhelming vote of 93 to 6. Of my Republican Senators who are still \nhere today who were in attendance for the vote--Senators Bond, Cochran, \nGrassley, Hatch, Lugar, McCain, McConnell, and Shelby--all voted in \nsupport.\n  In 1996, the Senate voted 87 to 4 in support of START II, including \nthe votes of Republican Senators Bennett, Bond, Cochran, Grassley, \nGregg, Hatch, Hutchison, Lugar, McCain, McConnell, and Snowe.\n  In 2002, the Senate voted 95 to 0--that is right, 95 to 0--in support \nof the Moscow Treaty, and 26 of the 27 Republicans there at the time \nare still here today and they voted in support of that treaty.\n  At the peak of the Cold War, the stockpile of nuclear weapons held by \nall nuclear weapons states was some 70,000 warheads, 1.6 million times \nthe power of the bomb at Hiroshima. We have reduced the number of those \nweapons by more than two-thirds. Yet today the combined nuclear weapon \ncapability is still equal to 150,000 of the nuclear bombs used in World \nWar II.\n  Today we have an opportunity to further reduce this threat in a \nresponsible bipartisan way. I do not know when this session will end \ntonight, but I will say to my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle: You have ample opportunity to debate. You have ample opportunity \nto offer amendments.\n  Time is not a good excuse. We have been in session now, this day and \nyesterday--we started at about 3:30. Only one amendment has been filed \non the Republican side. If they truly want to engage us in an important \ndebate about this treaty issue, do it now. Don't put it off.

The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                              The Omnibus\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I want to speak for a few minutes \nabout the START treaty. Before I do, there is another issue that has \nbeen debated on this floor that we are going to continue debating over \nthe next several days, and that is the issue of the funding of the \nFederal Government. There is an omnibus bill that has been laid out \nthere now, which is something that happens from time to time that is \nsimply not the way business ought to be done in this body.\n  As we move into the debate on the omnibus bill, there are a lot of us \nwho want to see, obviously, the government remaining open and running \nat full speed. All of us within this body want to make sure as we do \nthat, we do it the right way.\n  Frankly, to run in an omnibus bill at the last minute out here that \nhas thousands of earmarks--some of which folks like me requested months \nand months ago, and until 2 or 3 days ago had no idea those requests \nwould be honored and are now included in there, amounting to billions \nof dollars. With the issues we have now, including the election that \ntook place on November 2 where the American people spoke loudly and \nclearly about the way Washington spends money, this is not the way to \ndo business.\n  I intend to vote against the omnibus bill. I will speak more about \nthat at a later date.\n\n\n                          The New START Treaty\n\n  I want to speak for a minute on the START treaty, and I want to start \noff by commending both Senator Kerry and Senator Lugar who, as the \nchairman and ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee, have \nworked long and hard on this particular measure.\n  This treaty was signed by the President after negotiations were \ncompleted back in the spring. By the time we got the text, and then the \nadditions to the text, I would say it was probably into April or May, \nwhenever it was.\n  Since that time, I know both Senator Kerry and Senator Lugar have \nworked very hard. They have been open for discussion. I have had \nseveral discussions with Senator Lugar about it and have explained my \nproblems with it early on to him. He has been very receptive. I \nreceived another letter from him today further explaining some of the \nissues that are out there.\n  But that is an indication of how complex this issue is. As a member \nof the Armed Services Committee and the Intelligence Committee, I have \nhad the opportunity to have any number of briefings. I have been in \nhearing after hearing. I have been in meeting after meeting with \nmembers of the administration as well as outside experts who believe \nthis is right, and those who believe it is wrong. I have been involved \nin phone calls. I have traveled abroad to visit with our friends in \nboth France and Great Britain to learn about what they are doing with \nrespect to their nuclear inventory.\n  It is not like folks like me who have to make a decision whether to \nsupport this have not been working on it and trying to understand the \ncomplexities of this treaty. Gosh, those Members of the Senate who do \nnot serve on Foreign Relations, Armed Services, or Intelligence do not \nhave the benefit of the extensive briefings those who serve on those \ncommittees have had, and they have been trying to understand the \noperatives that are involved in this treaty also.\n  My concerns were laid out to Senator Lugar early on in a letter. I \nhave been very clear in conversations and hearings, including in an \nextensive conversation that I had with my longtime good friend, Senator \nSam Nunn, who, along with Senator Lugar, in my mind are the two \ngodfathers of the Russia-United States nuclear issue.\n\n[[Page S10374]]\n\n  The issues that are out there are in the process of being dealt with \nand resolved--but we are not there, in my mind. I cannot speak for the \nother 59 folks here, but I can tell you this: There are five major \nissues I have been concerned with from day one.\n  First is missile defense and what impact this treaty is going to have \non missile defense. I will be honest, I expressed concern about it, \nincluding in a hearing in the Armed Services Committee with Secretary \nGates, who is an individual for whom I have such great admiration and \nrespect--we can have a difference of opinion on policy from time to \ntime, but I know where Secretary Gates stands when it comes to the \nnational security interests of the United States.\n  In response to a question I asked him in an Armed Services hearing, \nhe satisfied me with respect to the missile defense issue. Then, like \nhappens with so many other issues when there is a complex treaty like \nthis, we have comments that were made in Portugal in recent weeks about \nphase 4 of our missile defense plan that all of a sudden raises another \nissue, or at least a potential issue, that has to be addressed and has \nto be resolved, in my mind, before I can vote for a treaty I want to \nsupport. I continue to work through that particular issue.\n  The second issue is the issue of modernization of the weapons in the \nUnited States. We can look ourselves in the eye, Members of this body \nand Members of the House, and take part of the blame. We have not \nfunded a modernization program for the updating of nuclear weapons of \nthe United States. Now we have called on the administration to make a \ncommitment, and that commitment is going to have to be a financial \ncommitment as well as a policy commitment. To the credit of the \nadministration, they have worked in a very diligent way--I know with \nthe prodding of Senator Kerry and Senator Lugar--to address this issue \nboth from a budgetary standpoint as well as a policy standpoint. Again, \nit is not just this administration that has to be involved. It is \nfuture administrations as well as future Congresses that are going to \nhave to address that issue.\n  As we decide whether to vote for or against this treaty, we have to \nsatisfy ourselves that future Congresses, future administrations are \ngoing to do that. How do we resolve that? I do not yet know. But it is \nanother issue that we have to go through in our minds and satisfy \nourselves on the issue of modernization before we can vote for it.\n  Third is an issue of verification. This is probably the major issue, \nat least in my mind. The Senator from Illinois just spoke about the \nfact that we have gone for a year or so now without having the \nopportunity, under the treaty that expired in 2009, to look at what the \nRussians are doing and likewise to give the Russians the opportunity to \nlook at what we are doing.\n  It is important when there is a complex issue like this, and an issue \nwhere you have to trust the other side to do certain things, that you \nhave the opportunity to verify after you enter into that trusting \nrelationship with them.\n  The verification process that is set forth in this New START treaty \nis frankly significantly different from the verification process that \nwas in the treaty that just expired. There are reasons it needed to be \ndifferent, and I understand that. But there still is an issue relative \nto: Do we have the right kind of verification measures in place in this \ntreaty to be able to satisfy our community, both the defense community \nand the intelligence community, that this treaty gives us everything we \nneed to have to be sure that the Russians are doing what they are \nsupposed to do?\n  In that vein, one way we are going about the issue of making sure the \nverification requirements that are set forth in here are adequate is to \nlook at the National Intelligence Estimate that was put out 2 months \nago, 6 weeks ago--whenever it was. When it did come out, I sat down and \nread through it. It is a rather detailed document that sets forth each \nof the issues in the minds of the intelligence community. And those \nconcerns are dealt with in an appropriate way. There are still some \nquestions in my mind with the classified portion of this treaty that I \nhave to be satisfied with.\n  I started going through the NIE again, and over the weekend, when it \nlooks like we are going to have plenty of hours to sit down with not \nmuch going on, I am going to do that. Hopefully, I am going to satisfy \nmyself on the classified portions.\n  Last, what is not in this treaty is just as much of concern to me as \nwhat is in the treaty; that is, a total lack of addressing the issue of \ntactical weapons. I understand, because I have asked the question to \nthe State Department, to the intelligence community, the Defense \nDepartment--about this issue of tactical weapons. Their rationale is, \nlook, we cannot deal with tactical weapons until we get this treaty \nagreed to and signed and deal with the strategic side. Then we can deal \nwith the tactical side.\n  I don't buy that. I think there was an opportunity that was missed. \nWe are dealing with a country that has fewer strategic weapons than we \nhave. They are going to be huge beneficiaries under this bill from the \nstandpoint of the sheer numbers. On the other hand, they have hundreds \nand hundreds, perhaps even thousands--we really don't know--more \ntactical weapons than what we have. It is the tactical weapons that \nbother me just as much as the strategic weapons because the tactical \nweapon can be put in a suitcase and delivered to a location that could \ndestroy something domestically, or U.S. assets somewhere else around \nthe world, or people.\n  The lack of addressing the tactical weapons issue is a problem. Is it \nenough to say we should not do this? Maybe not. But there are those of \nus who are wrestling with the issue and trying to do it in the right \nway. I will have to say that in concluding my eighth year here, I have \nnever had to vote in favor of a treaty that was this complex, this \nimportant, and had this much influence on what is going to happen with \nrespect to the safety and security of our country for my children and \ngrandchildren.\n  I commend Senator Kerry and Senator Lugar and their staffs for a \ntremendous amount of work and their openness. We have never asked a \nquestion they have not attempted to respond to. I am hopeful, over the \nnext couple days, a week, however long we are going to be here, if we \nconclude it or if we conclude it next year, that we will be able to \nultimately come together as a body and address this issue in a right \nand positive way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am here to join my colleagues who \nbelieve that now is the time to ratify the New START treaty. The New \nSTART treaty is a continuation of a long history of bipartisan arms \ncontrol cooperation and it is the culmination of President Ronald \nReagan's consistent appeal, as mentioned in previous remarks, to trust, \nbut verify when we are dealing with Russia. At a time when much of \nAmerica is fed up with this body's inability to work in a bipartisan \nfashion, I hope we can still work across the aisle to strengthen \nAmerica's national security and deal with the threat that is posed by \nnuclear weapons. I certainly applaud the leadership of Senator Kerry \nand Senator Lugar and the work they have done on this issue heading the \nForeign Relations Committee.\n  Much like previous arms control treaties, including the old START \ntreaty signed by President George H.W. Bush and the SORT treaty signed \nby President George W. Bush, the New START treaty is squarely in the \nnational security interests of the United States. The New START treaty \nwill reduce the limit of strategic nuclear arms aimed at the United \nStates. The United States and Russia will be bound to a lower number of \nnuclear weapons, which will be 30 percent fewer than the current limits \nunder the SORT treaty. The treaty's new rules allow us to count \nRussia's nuclear weapons more accurately. That is a critical piece as \nwe listened to the concerns of Senator Chambliss about whether we can \nverify what is going on. These new counting rules give us the ability \nto more accurately figure out what is happening with Russia's nuclear \narsenal.\n  In addition, New START leaves us the flexibility to determine our own \nforce structure and maintain a robust deterrent capable of protecting \nus and our allies.\n  Despite all the concerns raised, this treaty does nothing--let me \nrepeat\n\n[[Page S10375]]\n\nthat, this treaty does nothing--to constrain our missile defense plans. \nFurther, it allows for the modernization of our nuclear weapons \ncomplex. We have already heard from the three directors of our nuclear \nlabs that they are happy with the commitment this administration has \nprovided to modernization of our nuclear arsenal. The treaty restores a \ncritical verification regime that was lost when the old START treaty \nexpired. We have gone over a year without important intelligence from \nthese on-the-ground inspections. This gap hinders our insight into \nRussia's program.\n  Much like previous agreements, this treaty deserves broad bipartisan \nbacking in the Senate. Past treaties have benefited from overwhelming \nsupport in this body. The original START treaty was ratified by a vote \nof 93 to 6. We can see that on this chart. START II was ratified 87 to \n4. The SORT treaty, negotiated by George W. Bush, was ratified by a \nvote of 95 to 0. That is incredible--no opposition to that treaty. New \nSTART has earned the backing of an overwhelming number of foreign \npolicy experts and national security officials across a broad political \nspectrum, both Republican and Democratic. New START has the unanimous \nbacking of our Nation's military and its leadership, including \nSecretary Gates, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the commander of \nAmerica's Strategic Command, and the Director of the Missile Defense \nAgency. America's military establishment is joined by the support of \nevery living Secretary of State from Secretary Jim Baker to Secretary \nCondoleezza Rice, as well as five former Secretaries of Defense, nine \nformer National Security Advisers, and former Presidents Clinton and \nGeorge H.W. Bush. I know people cannot read this because the writing is \nso small, but this is the column of former Presidents and Cabinet-rank \nofficials who support New START. Look how long the list is. This is the \nlist of those Cabinet-rank officials who oppose it.\n  America's intelligence community also strongly supports the New START \ntreaty. It has now been 376 days since we last had inspection teams on \nthe ground in Russia monitoring its nuclear program. Every day we go \nwithout this critical intelligence is another day that erodes our \nunderstanding of Russia's intentions, plans, and capabilities. New \nSTART gives us on-the-ground intelligence we currently do not have and \nalso, for the first time, includes a new unique identifier system which \nallows us to better track Russia's missiles and delivery systems.\n  I heard the Senator from Georgia expressing a question about whether \nthis gives us the ability we need to verify what Russia is doing. New \nSTART gives us more inspections per facility per year than the old \nSTART treaty did. Without this critical information, our intelligence \ncommunity is hindered from an accurate assessment and our military is \nforced to engage in costly worst-case-scenario planning.\n  Our NATO allies also support New START. As chair of the subcommittee \nresponsible for NATO, I am mindful of the defense and security of our \nNATO alliance members living in Eastern Europe. I was pleased that at \nthe recent NATO Lisbon summit, all 28 NATO allies gave their strong \nunanimous support for ratification of the New START treaty. In fact, \nsome of the treaty's strongest backers are those countries that are our \nallies along Russia's borders. The NATO Secretary General said: ``A \ndelay in the ratification of the START treaty would be damaging to \nsecurity in Europe.''\n  Finally, ratification of this treaty should be important to those who \nare concerned with the nuclear threats posed by Iran and North Korea or \nwho are worried about the threat that is posed by terrorists around the \nworld who are seeking a nuclear weapon or nuclear materials.\n  I know some critics look at the New START treaty in isolation and say \nthis arms agreement has nothing to do with these proliferation threats. \nI couldn't disagree more. What does it say to our allies and partners \naround the globe if we turn our back on a long history of bipartisan \nsupport for working with Russia to reduce the nuclear threat? Delaying \nratification of a treaty with so much bipartisan support from our \nmilitary and the national security and foreign policy establishments, a \ntreaty that is so obviously in our national interest, tells the world \nwe are not serious about the nuclear threat. It says we are not serious \nabout our responsibilities under the nonproliferation treaty. I know my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle agree we should do everything in \nour power to make sure Iran and North Korea and al-Qaida do not have \nnuclear weapons. If we abdicate our position as a leader on nuclear \narms control, we risk losing the authority to build international \nconsensus and stopping rogue nations and ending nuclear proliferation \naround the globe.\n  Earlier this year, Brent Scowcroft, former National Security Adviser \nunder President George H.W. Bush, testified to the Foreign Relations \nCommittee that ``the principal result of non-ratification would be to \nthrow the whole nuclear negotiating situation into a state of chaos.'' \nIt is much too dangerous to gamble with nuclear weapons or our national \nsecurity at a time when we are working with our international partners \nto press Iran and North Korea on their nuclear weapons programs.\n  In testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee, former Defense \nSecretary James Schlesinger said that a failure to ratify this treaty \nwould ``have a detrimental effect on our ability to influence others \nwith regard to, particularly, the nonproliferation issue.''\n  That sentiment was echoed by five former Republican Secretaries of \nState in an op-ed written for the Washington Post a couple weeks ago.\n  One of the arguments we have heard this afternoon is that we are \nrushing consideration of this treaty. This is not true.\n  This chart is an outline that shows how much time has been spent in \nthe past as treaties have come to the floor. The fact is, the Senate \nhas thoroughly considered the New START agreement. We have had plenty \nof time to review the treaty. Since it was signed in April, the treaty \ntext has been available for everyone to read. It has not changed. We \nhave had over 250 days to examine the treaty and ask questions of the \nadministration. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee held 12 hearings \non the treaty.\n  There were another nine held by other committees. In contrast, there \nwere only four committee hearings held on the SORT treaty and only \neight held on START II. The Foreign Relations Committee also \naccommodated some Members' concerns earlier this year by delaying a \nvote on the treaty during the August recess. The Obama administration \nhas answered over 900 questions for the record on New START. Nearly \nevery major foreign policy or national security expert has weighed in \non the treaty, either in testimony, briefings or in the press.\n  The history of treaties such as New START shows that the concern that \nthere isn't enough time on the floor to consider this treaty is not \naccurate. In general, arms control agreements take an average of 2 to 5 \ndays of floor time. The original START treaty, which was much more \ncomplicated and complex and the first of its kind, took only 5 days of \nfloor debate. START II took 2 days of floor consideration. The most \nrecent SORT treaty took 2 days of floor debate. We have already had \nalmost 2 days of floor debate. Other arms control agreements, such as \nthe Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe and the Chemical \nWeapons Convention, took 2 days of floor time. We have had more than \nenough time to consider this treaty on the floor.\n  Finally, some have expressed concerns that the Senate should not be \nforced to work so close to their holiday vacations. I think it is \nimportant to repeat what retired BG John Adams said in response to that \nconcern. He said:\n\n       We have 150,000 U.S. warriors doing their job over \n     Christmas and the New Year. The U.S. Senate should do its \n     job--and ratify this treaty.\n\n  I could not agree more with Brigadier General Adams. The Senate \nshould get its work done. We should ratify New START. We should do it \nbefore the holidays, before we go home, in this session of Congress. It \nis time to vote on this critical national security concern.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order to \nreturn to legislative session be delayed and occur at 7 p.m., with the \norder then\n\n[[Page S10376]]\n\nfor recognition of the majority leader still in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. It is a delight to see you in the \nchair.\n  Mr. President, let me make a brief comment on the last comment from \nmy colleague about the work schedule of the Senate because I have been \none of those folks who have decried the fact that we are dual-tracking \nthe START treaty and the Omnibus appropriations bill here with just a \nweek left before Christmas.\n  I do think it is an imposition on our families and our staff that we \nneed to be working during this period of time. I do not think there is \nanybody in this body who works any harder than I do. I do not claim to \nbe the hardest working, but I am no stranger to hard work, and I am \nhappy to be here right up to Christmas Eve if that is what it takes.\n  But my complaint is that this is a problem that has been brought on \nby the Democratic leadership. All year long, we had the opportunity to \ndo a budget. Did we ever do a budget? No. All year long, we had the \nopportunity to pass appropriations bills. This is the first time in my \nmemory that the Senate never passed a single appropriations bill--not \none.\n  So now here we are, with a week to go before Christmas, trying to \ncram everything into the same short period of time. We have to pass a \nbill to fund the operations of government which will cease on Saturday \nat midnight. We could have done that in the last 300 days of this year, \nbut, no, we wait until the very last minute. We wait until the last \nminute to do the tax legislation that just passed out of the Senate and \nthe House is considering this afternoon. In addition to that, we are \ntrying to consider the START treaty. That is the concern a lot of us \nhave.\n  But let me return to where I was earlier today when I was talking \nabout some of my concerns about the treaty, laying the predicate for \nsome of the amendments we will have as soon as we are done with our \ncomments, our opening statements about the treaty itself.\n  I had last talked about the modernization program, and Senator Kerry \nand I had a brief conversation about that, agreeing that this was a \nvery important part of the ability of the United States to have a \ncredible nuclear deterrent. We were talking about the nuclear weapons \npart of that.\n  There is a second part of our nuclear deterrent, and that is the \ndelivery vehicles--the missiles, the submarines, the long-range \nbombers, the cruise missiles--those components of our so-called nuclear \ntriad that enable us to effectively deliver the warheads in the event \nthat should ever be required.\n  The problem with this part of the modernization package is that we do \nnot have the degree of certainty that I think we need to have the \nassurance that moving forward with an even lower number of warheads is \na safe thing to do. Specifically, we have asked the administration for \nbut have not received assurances with respect to the long-range bomber, \nthe ICBM, and the Minuteman III. Let me just mention those two things.\n  With regard to the long-range bomber, we have repeatedly asked: Will \nwe have a nuclear capable long-range bomber? That is what the bomber \nleg of the triad is--a nuclear-capable bomber. Now, it could be a \npenetrating bomber, it could be a manned bomber, it could be a bomber \nthat carries cruise missiles to get to the target, but it needs to be \nnuclear capable. We have no assurance. So while everybody in the \nadministration continues to say: ``We believe in our nuclear triad, we \nmust have a nuclear triad,'' we are not getting any satisfaction on the \nquestion, What about the bomber leg of the triad?\n  Our current long-range bomber cruise missiles are due to be retired \nin 2025. Will there be a follow-on? Again, no reassurance. No funding \nhas been provided in the 1251 plan that I spoke of earlier for \nreplacement of an ICBM Minuteman III.\n  There is some very troubling language in the 1251 update on a follow-\non assessment study. I am going to quote what this assessment study \nwill be predicated on. This is for the ICBM. It is a study that--and I \nam quoting--``will consider a range of deployment options, with the \nobjective of defining a cost-effective approach for an ICBM follow-on \nthat supports continued reductions in U.S. nuclear weapons while \npromoting stable deterrence.''\n  That supports continued reductions in the U.S. nuclear weapons. So \nthe key criteria here is not to carry whatever weapons we think are \nnecessary but, rather, an ICBM force that will be determined and sized \nin order to achieve those reductions. What I am wondering is whether \nthat suggests that the administration might not maintain an ICBM \ncapability so that it can pursue further reductions or that the ICBM \nfollow-on system will be based on plans for reductions.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator--\n  Mr. KYL. Let me just complete this thought, if I could.\n  The administration's arms control agenda--my belief--should not be \nthe key factor in determining the level of our ICBM capability.\n  I will make a note here and allow my colleague to interrupt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator very much. I just \nthought it would be helpful if we can talk about a few of these things \nas we go along.\n  What I want to ask the Senator is what he thinks is inadequate in the \nresolution of ratification. Declaration 13 makes it clear that the \nUnited States is committed to accomplishing the modernization and \nreplacement of the strategic delivery vehicles.\n  The service lives of the existing strategic delivery vehicles run \nwell past the 10-year life of this treaty. So my question would be, \nsince the DOD has already scheduled study and decision deadlines, \ntimelines, for the replacement of all of these systems--so since that \nis outside of the four corners of the treaty, so to speak, why would \ndeclaration 13 not state that we are committed to proceeding to the \nfull modernization and replacement of the adequate delivery vehicles?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will be happy to respond to that.\n  Let me respond first by quoting two key officials from the Obama \nadministration: Secretary Gates and Under Secretary of Defense Jim \nMiller. This is what I gather their decision is going to be based on.\n  First, Secretary Gates:\n\n       There are placeholders for each of the modernization \n     programs because no decision has been made. They are \n     basically to be decided, and along the lines that Admiral \n     Mullen is just describing, those are decisions we are going \n     to have to make over the next few years in terms of we are \n     going to have to modernize these systems and we are going to \n     have to figure out what we can afford.\n\n  Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Jim Miller:\n\n       We think the current ICBMs are extremely stable and \n     stabilizing, particularly as we de-MIRV to one warhead each.\n\n  I would interject, remember, we are doing that while the Russians are \nMIRVing, which, of course, creates more instability under this treaty.\n  But to go on with the quotation:\n\n       But we will look at concepts that would make them even more \n     survivable over time, which would allow them to be part of a \n     reserve force.\n\n  My point in reading these two quotations is to suggest to my \ncolleague that it is troubling that the administration is not willing \nto commit to making a decision, is not willing to commit to having a \nnuclear-capable bomber force, is not willing to say that the ICBM force \nwill support the delivery of the warheads required for that leg of the \ntriad but, rather, will be based on what we can afford and be based on \nour desire to continue to reduce U.S. nuclear weapons, and that perhaps \nwe are developing them in order to be part of a reserve force.\n  All of this suggests that the one quotation that was read by my \ncolleague is a nice statement but does not reflect the reality of what \nthe administration is actually planning on.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. As the Senator knows, a legitimate certain amount of \nanalysis has to be made by DOD in order to be able to submit to the \nCongress a plan that is realistic both in cost and judgment about what \nthe size will be.\n\n[[Page S10377]]\n\nEvery single testimony, from the Joint Chiefs of Staff through \nSecretary Gates, has committed to the maintenance of a viable triad. \nThat could not be more clear in this record.\n\n  Mr. KYL. If I could just interrupt my colleague, who interrupted me.\n  Mr. KERRY. Absolutely.\n  Mr. KYL. A viable triad at a minimum, per se, has to include nuclear \ncapability or it is not part of our nuclear triad, right? And what I am \nsaying here is that the administration is not assuring us that the \nlong-range bomber will be nuclear capable. So maybe we have a dyad now, \nnot a triad.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, again--\n  Mr. KYL. Go ahead. I will yield to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. This is very important to the sort of understanding of \nwhere we are here and what the real differences are.\n  All of these systems, all three--DOD has scheduled and put out a \ntimeline. Now, they have to go through that process. The fact is, they \nhave stated in the 1251 report that they are going to replace the Ohio \nclass submarine when it commences scheduled retirement in 2027. I do \nnot think President Obama is going to be there in 2027, unless there is \nsome extraordinary transition in America. So this goes way beyond this \nadministration in terms of a decision and in terms of a Congress. The \nNavy is going to sustain the existing Trident II through at least 2042. \nThat is on the books right now with the robust life extension program. \nThe current Minuteman life extension program will keep the fleet in \nservice through 2030. And DOD has already begun the preparatory studies \non replacement options, which will begin in 2012. And the soon-to-be-\ncompleted long-range bomber issue the Senator just raised is only on \nwhat type of new bomber is needed, not whether there will be a new \nbomber.\n  So the future Congresses and future administrations are really going \nto make this decision. So to suggest that somehow the Obama \nadministration can right now have this treaty held accountable to \ndecisions where every one of those delivery platforms is going to be in \nexistence well beyond the life and public service of any of us here I \nthink is a completely inappropriate standard.\n  I would ask my colleague, why a 2027 date and a 2042 date and a 2030 \ndate and a commitment to a bomber, even though they do not know what \nkind of bomber, why that is not satisfactory?\n  Mr. KYL. Let me answer a question with a question.\n  First of all, given the fact that I think we are taking 30-minute \nsegments each and we are having a debate here, can we agree that we \nwill debate until 7 o'clock, and you can have half the time and I will \nhave half the time? Either that or I am going to have to quit yielding \nto make my points.\n  Mr. KERRY. No, no, no. I appreciate that. And the Senator is always \ngood about engaging in this.\n  Mr. KYL. And I am happy to do it either way.\n  Mr. KERRY. I just think it is important to get it out. I do not need \nthat time. I think it is important. I want Senator Kyl to have his \ntime--\n  Mr. KYL. Let me respond to this question.\n  Mr. KERRY. And I will not interrupt him, but I wanted to try to see \nif we could not engage a little in what the Senate does, which is \ndebate.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first of all, this is the kind of engagement \nwe need on this treaty and on so many other issues in this body. Too \nmany times it is a Senator coming down and giving a speech, and half of \nus or more are not listening. And this kind of colloquy can develop \nmore useful material for our colleagues and for the record than \nanything else. So I am very happy to engage in it. I just want to make \nsure I do not run out of my time with my colleague's questions.\n  But here is how it relates, and here is the importance.\n  We are being told that even though the delivery systems--and \nremember, this treaty deals with warheads and delivery systems. Let's \nleave the warheads off to the side for a moment. The delivery systems--\nwhich are the submarines with their missiles, the long-range bombers, \nwith cruise missiles in some cases, and our ICBM force and the Russian \ncounterparts--those delivery systems are constrained in this treaty. \nThe numbers are brought down to 700 deployable systems. So the question \nwe have asked, naturally enough is, Is that enough? Will that work to \ncover all of the targets we need to cover?\n  I talked this morning about--and the answer to that question depends \nin part on what our future plans are because--take the B-52. Most of \nthe pilots who are flying B-52s--I think we are two generations beyond \nthe time these B-52s were built. These are old, aging aircraft. And \neverybody realizes even the B-1s and to some extent the B-2s need to be \nreplaced. So the decisions to do that need to be made very soon.\n  Whether 700 is a good number will depend on whether we have an \nadequate triad to deliver these weapons when the time comes. So \nnaturally we ask the question, What is our triad going to look like? It \nis true that some of these systems--the new systems that replace what \nwe currently have--will not be available until outside the 10-year \nlimit of the treaty.\n  But it is also true that every one takes an inordinate amount of \ntime. How do they take so much time? I don't know. It seems as though \nin World War II we had all kinds of weapons systems come together to be \nbuilt and fight the war and it is over in 5 or 6 years, but nowadays it \ntakes 5 or 6 years just to get something ready to go, and then it takes \nthem that long to deploy. So these are long timeframes for development \nand deployment.\n  It is true the Navy has already made the basic decision for the \nsubmarine, but I haven't mentioned the Navy. That is not my concern. \nBut my concern is the IBM force and the bomber force.\n  I will leave the point with this: What is troubling to me is that on \nthe bomber force, our administration is unwilling to commit we will \nhave a bomber triad nuclear capable. That is an important decision, \nbecause if we are talking about 700 delivery vehicles that will not \ninclude nuclear-capable bombers, I have a problem. The reason is, \nbecause when you get briefed on how we are going to deliver these \nweapons if, God forbid, they ever have to be delivered or how we are \ngoing to deal with a potential Russian breakout, for example, or how we \nare going to deal with a problem if, let's say, we have an issue with \none of our submarine or ICBM components to the triad, if we don't have \na bomb-carrying or cruise missile-carrying nuclear capability with our \nbombers, then it is quite obvious the viability of our triad is \nimplicated.\n  So we have to know these things. It is not some esoteric question. We \nare talking about delivery systems being brought down to 700 and is \nthat too low. It is not too low if we have a very viable triad, but it \nbecomes too low if our triad is not viable.\n  In the time remaining, let me talk about missile defense. This is \nsomething a lot of my colleagues have talked about. It is kind of core \nto the concerns a lot of us have with the treaty and, frankly, my \nultimate support or not will depend, to some extent, on how we resolve \nthis issue, whether it is by amendment to the preamble or the treaty or \nthe resolution of the ratification or a combination of things. But, \nclearly, this treaty implicates U.S. missile defense, and that is \nwrong.\n  One of the chief achievements of the Bush administration was to \nfinally decouple missile defense and strategic offensive weapons and \nthe treaties that deal with strategic offensive weapons. It was \nsomewhat limited in the START treaty, but in the Moscow Treaty of 2002 \nwe said: We are going to reduce our weapons. If the Russians want to do \nthe same, that is fine with us. We don't need a treaty to deal with \nthat. The Russians essentially said: We want a treaty, and we want you \nto limit your missile defenses. We said no, and they eventually \nrelented and said OK.\n  I have spoken with Secretary Rice and Under Secretary Feith and other \npeople in the administration who count it as one of their achievements, \nthe fact that we finally decoupled those two issues. In this treaty, \nthey are right back together again and in a way that is inimicable to \nother defenses by the United States. That is what I want to focus on. \nWe don't think there should be any limitations on U.S. missile defense. \nYet the New START treaty not only contains specific limitations, though \nwe were told there wouldn't be any, but it also reestablishes this \nunwise linkage I talked about in the preamble.\n\n[[Page S10378]]\n\n  Let me quote three things that Under Secretary Tauscher said as of \nMarch 29 of this year:\n\n       The treaty does nothing to constrain missile defense . . . \n     this treaty is about strategic weapons. There is no limit on \n     what the United States can do with its missile defense \n     systems.\n\n  The third quote:\n\n       There are no constraints to missile defense.\n\n  Those three statements are not true because it turns out there are \nlimitations and constraints specifically in the treaty. Article V, \nsection 3 specifically constrains a particular kind of missile defense, \nthe United States using a strategic offensive silo, for example, to use \nfor defense. We have done that before. Our current plans are not to do \nit again because it is expensive. We might not do it in the future. \nThis administration says it doesn't want to, but it is certainly \nconstraining. How can you say those three statements by Under Secretary \nTauscher are true? They are false. The administration simply says: \nWell, yes, there are limits, but we don't intend to do that anyway, so \nit is kind of a theoretical limit.\n  Well, in the first place, why is there a limitation on any missile \ndefense capability in this treaty? We thought this was about, as \nSecretary Tauscher said, strategic weapons. Well, it turns out the \nRussians, of course, want to make it also about missile defense. One \nway they make it about missile defense is by article V, section 3 or \nparagraph 3, specifically constraining a particular way we would \ndevelop missile defense.\n  That is what we object to, that linkage. Why is that important? \nBecause the Russians have always wanted to limit U.S. missile defenses, \nand this now gets the foot in the door for them to argue that under the \ntreaty, they would have a right to withdraw if we improve our missile \ndefenses. That gets to the real issue, and that is the preamble to the \ntreaty.\n  I wish to quote from Richard Perle and Ed Meese, both of whom served \nin the Reagan administration. Richard Perle was with President Reagan \nat Reykjavik, a seminal moment in arms control history and for the \nReagan administration. It was a time when President Reagan decided \nmissile defenses for the United States were so important that he would \nwalk away from a major strategic offensive weapon proposal that had \nbeen made to him by President Gorbachev. Here is what they write:\n\n       With this unfortunate paragraph, New START returns to the \n     old Cold War `balance of terror' and assumes that attempts to \n     defend the U.S. and its allies with missile defenses against \n     strategic attack are threatening to Russia and thus \n     destabilizing. Limiting missile defenses to preserve U.S. \n     vulnerability to Russian strategic nuclear strikes (as \n     defined by the Russians) will result in less effective \n     defenses against any and all countries, including Iran and \n     North Korea.\n\n  That is the problem.\n  How does that problem arise? Because of the language in the preamble. \nThis is the language followed by two signing statements from Russia and \nthe United States that define the intentions of the two countries with \nrespect to this issue of missile defense. Here is what the preamble \nstates:\n\n       The current strategic defensive arms do not undermine the \n     viability and effectiveness of the strategic arms of the \n     parties.\n\n  That is what it says, in part.\n  Quote:\n\n       Current strategic defensive arms do not undermine the \n     viability and effectiveness of the strategic arms of the \n     parties.\n\n  ``Current,'' that is new language. That was not in the START I \ntreaty. So what they are doing is defining the current systems. Why is \nthat important? Because later they talk about any additions that would \nqualitatively or quantitatively improve our system would allow the \nRussians to withdraw.\n  Here is what--well, let me just make one point before I quote that. \nThe administration says the preamble is not important because you can \nalways walk away from a treaty, and even though the Russians say this \npreamble language gives them the right to walk away from the treaty, \nthey can do it anyway, so what is the big deal?\n  Well, you can't just do it on a whim. We agree that if there is a \nmatter that is so important to either country that it constitutes an \nexceptional circumstance referred to in article XIV which is the \nwithdraw clause, then a party could withdraw. So, yes, it is true, that \neither party can define anything as an exceptional circumstance and \ntherefore withdraw, but that is bad faith and it clearly is something \nthat would be very difficult for a country to do, unless a country had \nbuilt into the treaty the very excuse that they are talking about as \ngrounds for leaving the treaty. What would that extraordinary event be? \nWell, it would be the improvement of U.S. missile defense systems.\n\n  Here is what Foreign Minister Lavrov said on March 28:\n\n       [T]he treaty and all obligations it contains are valid only \n     within the context of the levels which are now present in the \n     sphere of strategic defensive systems.\n\n  That is their position. That is their legal position. That is what \nthey mean by ``current'' in the preamble. The reason that legal opinion \nis important is because the United States does intend--if you believe \nSecretary Gates and I certainly do--does intend to develop missile \ndefense capabilities that could qualitatively advance our protection \nagainst a missile coming from Russia. It is not necessarily designed \nfor that purpose. It may be designed to thwart an ICBM from Iran or \nfrom North Korea, but it has that capability and the Russians can \neasily define it as such.\n  Here is the Russian legal opinion:\n\n       The treaty between the Russian Federation and the United \n     States of America on the reduction and limitation of \n     strategic offensive arms signed in Prague on April 8, 2010, \n     can operate and be viable only if the United States of \n     America refrains from developing its missile defense \n     capabilities, quantitatively or qualitatively.\n\n  Well, we will develop our missile defense capabilities quantitatively \nand certainly qualitatively. That is what the phased adaptive approach \nSecretary Gates has announced is all about: a qualitative improvement \nof our missile defense capabilities. So how would the Russians treat \nthat? Their statement, their signing statement, signed at the time that \nthe treaty was signed, says the exceptional circumstances referred to \nin article XIV, the withdrawal clause of the treaty, include increasing \nthe capabilities of the U.S. missile defense system in such a way that \nthreatens the potential of the strategic nuclear forces of the Russian \nFederation.\n  That is why this preamble is so important. They treat it as the legal \nbasis for their withdrawal if we improve our missile defenses \nqualitatively, which we most certainly will, and potentially \nquantitatively.\n  They have already built this into the record. From my point of view \nand a lot of my colleagues, this can only be read as an attempt to \nexert political pressure on the United States to forestall continued \ndevelopment and deployment of our missile defenses, and there is \nevidence it has already worked. First of all, we have pulled back from \nthe deployment of the ground-based interceptor system that the Bush \nadministration had developed and was prepared to deploy in Poland with \nthe radars associated in Czechoslovakia, and we have also said now that \nwith respect to our NATO deployment of the so-called phased adaptive \napproach, the first three phases will be deployed, but the fourth \nphase, the one that is most effective against an ICBM coming from long \nrange, which could include a country such as Russia, is available--not \ndeployed but available--by 2020.\n  Instead of having a firm rebuttal in response to what the Russians \nsaid in the preamble and in their signing statement accompanying the \nsigning of the treaty, what was our response? It was not a firm \nrebuttal. We didn't say: No, that is not correct. That is not our \nunderstanding. That is not what we did, even though we had done that, \nby the way, with the START treaty. We pushed back very firmly on the \nRussians' signing statement. But instead, the State Department response \nto the Russian unilateral statement is as follows:\n\n       The United States of America takes note of the statement on \n     missile defense by the Russian Federation. Defense. The \n     United States missile defense systems are not intended to \n     affect the strategic balance with Russia. The United States \n     missile defense systems would be employed to defend the \n     United States against limited missile launches, and to defend \n     its deployed forces, allies and partners against regional \n     threats. The United States intends to continue improving and \n     deploying its missile defense systems in order to defend \n     itself against limited attack and as part of our \n     collaborative\n\n[[Page S10379]]\n\n     approach to strengthening stability in key regions.\n\n  In other words, don't worry, Russia. We are not going to develop \nmissile defenses that could thwart your strategic offensive \ncapabilities. We are only developing missile defenses that would be \neffective against regional threats, against limited missile launches, \nagainst limited attack.\n  So it appears to me that while the Russians have built into this \ntreaty and into the preamble the perfect argument for withdrawal and \nthey have directly said it constitutes exceptional circumstances under \ntheir interpretation of article XIV, the United States has not \nresponded with a negative but rather with a statement that says: Don't \nworry.\n  Might I inquire, is the original 30 minutes which this side was \nallotted consumed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has no time \nlimitation right now because there is no one following.\n  Mr. KYL. Let me do this, since I do see Senator Casey on the floor, \nand Senator Kerry may have something more to say. Let me try to sum up \nwhat I am saying about missile defense, although there is much more to \ntalk about, and this will very definitely be the subject of maybe even \nthe first amendment that is offered on our side because there has been \nsuch a cavalier attitude about this on the other side: We don't need \nany amendments. We don't need any missile defenses. This is serious \nbusiness. You would never enter into a contract to buy a car or a \nhouse, for example, with a degree of uncertainty or disagreement \nbetween the parties as to what the terms mean. Think about this treaty. \nThis is a very serious proposition that starts with a fundamental \ndisagreement between the parties and clearly could create enormous \ncomplications in our relationships in the future.\n  If I could just finish this point. Instead of creating a more stable \nrelationship, a relationship built on the reset, a relationship which \nis built on very clear, transparent views of things on how we are \nmoving forward together, built into this treaty is an inherent conflict \nthat can cause nothing but trouble in the future unless the United \nStates says: Fine. We will not develop any missile defenses that could \nconceivably be effective against Russia, which then means that they \ncouldn't be effective against an ICBM from Iran or an ICBM from Korea.\n  This is the dilemma presented by this treaty and its preamble terms. \nThis is what causes us such great concern. I am happy at this point to \nyield to my colleague, and if he would like to engage in a colloquy, \nthat would be fine.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona. I want to \ntake a moment, though, to address this point he made--I think it is \ncentral--and then we can talk about it. Then I want to give Senator \nCasey an opportunity to speak.\n  I say to my colleague from Arizona that a lot of us are scratching \nour heads trying to figure out what we have to do to get the Senator \nfrom Arizona to accept yes for an answer--yes on modernization, yes on \nour willingness to go forward and build a missile defense.\n  It has been said again and again and again by the highest officials \nof our government--and I think the President will make some further \nstatement about this, hopefully, within the next hours or the next \nday--that can indicate the absolute total commitment to proceed forward \nand the irrelevance of what the Senator is referring to in the context \nof a statement that is not within the four corners of the agreement, \nthat has no legal binding authority at all--none.\n  Don't accept my word for it. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, whom \nI know the Senator respects enormously, said the following on May 25:\n\n       So you know the Russians can say what they want. But as \n     Secretary Clinton said, these unilateral statements are \n     totally outside the treaty, and they have no standing. They \n     are not binding. They never have been.\n\n  That is one statement.\n  LTG Patrick O'Reilly is the Director of the Missile Defense Agency. \nHe testified on June 16, and this is a yes:\n\n       I have briefed the Russian officials in Moscow, a rather \n     large group of them, in October of 2009. I went through all 4 \n     phases of the phased adaptive approach, especially phase 4. \n     And while the missiles that we have selected, as far as the \n     interceptors in phase 4, as Dr. Miller says, provide a very \n     effective defense for a regional-type threat, they are not of \n     the size that have a long-range to be able to reach strategic \n     missile fields.\n\n  He says:\n\n       It's a very verifiable property of these missiles, given \n     their size, and so forth. It was not a very controversial \n     topic of the fact that a missile given the size of the \n     payload, could not reach their strategic fields. I have \n     briefed the Russians personally in Moscow on every aspect of \n     our missile defense development. I believe they understand \n     what it is and that those plans for development are not \n     limited by this treaty.\n\n  So in the treaty ratification resolution--here I will make the \nSenator from Arizona happy, but I will also not please him. The happy \npart: If we want to be purely technical and sort of be kind of literal \nas to technical writing of some particular thing, can we say that \narticle V has a limitation on strategic defense? Yes, in the most \nlimited technical way we can say there is a limitation. The limitation \nis that we can't take intercontinental ballistic missile silos, other \nthan the four already grandfathered--the new ones--and convert them \ninto an interceptor missile silo.\n  In that sense, we have limited something, but have we limited missile \ndefense? As we think about it in its larger strategic context, the \nanswer is, no, not one iota. Why? Because those particular silos cost \nmore money, and in a deficit-conscious age, where we are trying to cut \nspending, it is a heck-of-a-lot smarter to dig a new hole, build a new \nsilo that is more effective, more efficient, less costly, and does the \nsame thing. That is our plan.\n  So there is no limitation on the ability to actually deploy missile \ndefense. So if we want to play a technical game on the floor and run \naway and say: Oh, there is a limitation here; that is terrible, well, \nyou can do that, but it doesn't make sense. It doesn't actually limit \nthe plans of this administration to go forward with real missile \ndefense and with a system that allows us to intercept missiles fired \nfrom a silo in a missile field in the United States.\n  What is more, if we do convert those other silos, we don't have a \nmechanism for determining what kind of missile is coming out of there. \nIs it an ICBM or an interceptor? What happens if we are firing one of \nthose missiles to intercept a rogue missile from North Korea or \nwherever, and the Russians happen to misinterpret it and they don't \nknow what it is--there is no plan or anything that says we can do that.\n  In fact, we are safer, given the way the administration has decided \nto deploy this. Here is what the resolution of ratification says: It \nsays in understanding No. 1, missile defense--and this is what we will \nvote on. It says it is the understanding of the United States that the \nNew START treaty does not impose any limitations on the deployment of \nmissile defenses other than the requirements of paragraph 3 of article \nV that I just referred to about the silos that we don't want to do \nanyway, which costs the American people more and will make us less \nsafe. We don't want to do that. So that is in there. That is all that \nis in there.\n  It then goes on to say that this provision shall not apply to ICBM \nlaunchers that were converted prior to the signature of the treaty. \nThen paragraph (b) says any additional New START treaty limitation on \nthe deployment of missile defense, beyond that one I just referred to \nthat we are talking about, including any limitations that come out of \nthe Bilateral Consultative Commission, those would require an amendment \nto the New START treaty which could only enter into force with the \nadvice and consent of the United States Senate. That is it. We have \ncontrol over whatever might happen beyond that one simple silo issue.\n  I respectfully suggest we ought to listen to the folks who are \ntelling us what they have accomplished. The Secretary of Defense said, \nfrom the very beginning of this process more than 40 years ago, the \nRussians have hated missile defense. It is because we can afford it and \nthey can't; and we are going to be able to build a good one and are \nbuilding a good one, and they probably aren't. They don't want to \ndevote the resources to it, so they try to stop us from doing it \nthrough political means.\n  This treaty doesn't accomplish that for them. That is what Secretary \nGates has said. This treaty doesn't accomplish it. I believe Secretary \nof Defense\n\n[[Page S10380]]\n\nGates. I believe GEN Patrick O'Reilly, who serves our country with one \npurpose. He is not a member of a party or here for politics. He \nbelieves he is defending the Nation. He says he told the Russians in \nfull that we are doing phase 4. We are going forward.\n  Finally, Secretary Clinton said to the Foreign Relations Committee \nthat the Obama administration has consistently informed Russia that, \nwhile we seek to establish a framework for U.S.-Russian BMD \ncooperation, the United States cannot agree to constrain or limit U.S. \nBMD abilities operationally, numerically, qualitatively, \ngeographically, or in other ways. I don't know how much more ``yes'' \nyou can have in statements.\n  One last thing with respect to the comment about how they can \nwithdraw: Mr. President, they can withdraw for any reason they want, at \nany point in time, just by noticing us that they are going to do that. \nGuess what. So can we. Both parties have the right to withdraw. So this \nisn't some new component they can withdraw from. The point I make to my \ncolleague--and he is very intelligent and knows these issues very \nwell--the Senator from Arizona knows we can't unilaterally get another \ncountry to change its perception of how they may feel threatened. That \nis what drove the arms race for 50 years.\n  If the United States of America has an ability to knock down their \nmissiles that they think defend them, and all of a sudden they no \nlonger believe those missiles can defend them because we can knock them \ndown, what do you think they are going to do? They are going to scratch \ntheir heads and say: Wow, we ought to develop some method to guarantee \nthat they can't knock them down, or that we have enough of them so that \nwe can overwhelm whatever system they have that knocks them down.\n  We went through this with President Reagan, and we have spent \nbillions trying to pursue this. We understand that.\n  The fact is, they are just stating a truism. Those are not my words; \nthose are Dr. Henry Kissinger's words, who said all the preamble does \nis acknowledge that they believe there is a connection. We have stated \nsimultaneously that we don't care if they believe there is a \nconnection. We stated that. Secretary Clinton stated it, Secretary \nGates stated it, and the President has said we are going forward with \nour phase 4.\n  Now, it is not connected. There is no legal, binding connection \nwhatsoever in this treaty. This treaty does not constrain America's \ncapacity to develop a robust, qualitatively superior, improved system. \nIf we do, we are going to make a decision, when we deploy it, to accept \nwhatever consequences come with whatever shape and form we do deploy. \nBut there is no restraint on our ability to do it.\n  In fact, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle ought to be \nleaping at this opportunity because it, in effect, codifies America's \nintent and codifies our independence and capacity to go off and do what \nwe are going to do. I wish I could get the Senator from Arizona to \naccept yes.\n  Mr. KYL. I have a brief response. There are concerns by a lot of \ncolleagues on my side of the aisle, so it is not just a matter of \nsatisfying John Kyl. Let's understand that. I would be happy to take \nyes for an answer--if that were the answer.\n  My colleague confuses two things. First, the preamble has been agreed \nto by both parties. This is not just a Russian statement of intent. The \npreamble is part of the treaty that we have agreed to. For the first \ntime, it connects missile defense with strategic offensive limitations \nby saying the current strategic defensive arms do not undermine the \nviability and effectiveness of the strategic arms of the parties.\n  Secondly, my colleague says it is a technical argument that the \ntreaty otherwise constrains missile defenses. It is more than a \ntechnical argument. It specifically does--and there was no place in \nthis treaty for any limitation on missile defenses or how important or \nunimportant they are. Why would the Russians insist on putting that in \nthere except to establish the beachhead? The point is that, yes, a \nstrategic arms control treaty will deal with missile defense. It does, \nand the preamble does too by linking the two.\n  Why is this important? There is not a technical statement in the \ntreaty that says the United States will limit its missile defenses. \nThat is true. But because the Russians interpret the extraordinary \nevents--the technical term under article IV that would permit a country \nto withdraw--as specifically including the U.S. development of missile \ndefenses that are qualitatively better than we have now, better than \ncurrent policy, because that is their interpretation, whether or not we \nagree with that interpretation, we have created a dichotomy between the \ntwo parties to a very important contract. They interpret it one way and \nwe interpret it another. What will the inevitable result be? \nDisagreement between our countries about a fundamental point, one \nwhich, according to the Russians, will require them to engage in a new \nround of the arms race that will begin, according to President \nMedvedev.\n  They are saying: If you don't agree with this, under the \ncircumstances we are going to engage in another round of strategic \noffense weapon building.\n  What we on our side are concerned about is that President Obama, who \nhas already backed off the deployment of the GBI system, which was the \nmost robust American missile defense system, and has qualified, it \nappears, the deployment of the fourth phase of the phased adaptive \napproach, and who other people in the administration speak in terms of \nthat--I am talking about the State Department and our signing \nstatement--they suggest we would only develop a missile defense against \na limited or regional threat.\n  Those are reasons to believe this position of Russia is already \nworking to cause the United States to back away from what would have \notherwise been a much more robust development of missile defenses to \nprotect the people of the United States.\n  So that is the argument we are making. We can say that, technically, \nanybody can withdraw from the treaty all they want to and the preamble \ndoesn't mean anything or so on. Well, it appears to have already had a \nsignificant meaning within this administration is the point we are \ntrying to make.\n  Mr. KERRY. Well, Mr. President, I want the Senator from Pennsylvania \nto be able to have his chance, and we are running out of time, but I \ndisagree with the Senator with respect to the judgment he has made with \nregard to what it does or does not do, and we will have an opportunity \nto be able to further discuss that component of it.\n  But let me remind the Senator of what Secretary Gates said this May. \nHe said, under the last administration as well as under this one, it \nhas been the U.S. policy not to build a missile defense that would \nrender useless Russia's nuclear capabilities. It has been a missile \ndefense intended to protect against rogue nations, such as North Korea \nand Iran or countries that have very limited capabilities. He went on \nto talk about the expense and capacity we have today.\n  We are going to continue to develop whatever the best system is we \nare able to develop that could protect the United States of America. We \nsupport that. The administration could not be more clear in its \ndetermination to continue to do that, including phase IV. I will \nsubmit, when we get time and come back, further statements and further \nclarification to the Senator that hopefully can give him a comfort \nlevel that there is no dichotomy, that we are proceeding forward, and \nthe Russians understand what we are doing.\n  We should not misinterpret. Preambles have historically incorporated \nstatements that one side or the other need for domestic consumption for \ntheir politics. There is no misinterpretation here about where we are \nheaded, what we are committed to do, and I would think the recent \nannouncement by the administration in Lisbon and the embrace of this \neffort through the European countries, our allies, would be strong \ntestimony to the direction we are moving with respect to this missile \ndefense.\n  We will continue this. I look forward to doing that with my \ncolleague. I thank him for his courtesy, and I look forward to further \ndiscussion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I am grateful for the work our chairman, \nChairman Kerry, has put into this\n\n[[Page S10381]]\n\ntreaty over many months now--in fact, many years when you consider his \nwork as a member and now chair of the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  We are grateful for the debate we have just heard. These are \ncritically important issues we are talking about, and that is one of \nthe reasons why it is critically important we make sure the American \npeople know what the stakes are. Without ratification of this treaty, \nwe are, in fact, less safe than we should be. I think the American \npeople understand that. I also believe the American people want to make \nsure that even upon ratification of this treaty, the New START treaty, \nthat in no way will our security be undermined as relates to our \nnuclear arsenal. We can say, without qualification and without \nhesitation, that ratification of the New START treaty doesn't in any \nway undermine the safety, security and effectiveness and even the \nreliability of our nuclear arsenal.\n  So these are critically important issues. We know there has been kind \nof a side debate about time and timing. We know that in addition to all \nthe living Secretaries of State who have supported ratification, former \nPresident George Herbert Walker Bush, Secretary Gates, and Admiral \nMullen, our leading national security team--but also I think the \nAmerican people--want to tell us in a very direct way that we are going \nto continue to work up to and through the holidays, if that is \nnecessary, because I think a lot of Americans agree with what BG John \nAdams recently said:\n\n       We have 150,000 United States warriors doing their job over \n     Christmas and the new year. The U.S. Senate should do its job \n     and ratify this treaty.\n\n  That is not a comment by a public official, that is from BG John \nAdams.\n  We know similar treaties in the past have been overwhelmingly \nbipartisan. I think when we finally get to the vote, this will be as \nwell, and there is evidence of that both in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee--a committee I am proud to be a member of, working with \nChairman Kerry on this treaty ratification and the work done in the \ncommittee--but also we are seeing a lot of bipartisanship as well in \nthe Senate as we are discussing the eventual ratification.\n  I wished to talk about two or three issues but, first of all, \nratification as it relates to verification.\n  I think in our own lives, no matter who we are, when we are making an \nimportant decision and we are reaching conclusions, we want proof. We \nwant information that is conclusive so we can make important decisions \nin our own lives. The same is true, and certainly even more urgent, \nwhen we are talking about nuclear weapons. When we talk about a treaty \nthat we are working to ratify, we are talking about a couple of basic \nissues. One of them is verification.\n  What does verification mean? Well, it means that, for example, the \nAmerican people hope we have in place--and they know we will upon \nratification--a verification and tracking system that will give us the \nassurance that will allow us to be secure in the knowledge we are going \nto be able to do everything humanly possible to verify. The treaty \ncontemplates ways to do that, and there are four or five I will \nmention.\n  First of all, invasive onsite inspections, as you would want in any \nsituation in your own life. You would want to make sure you can be \nonsite. The problem right now is, we have gone all these months without \nverification in place. So we want to have boots on the ground and \nexperts trained to verify what the situation is when they are reviewing \nthe Russian nuclear weapons.\n  Second, it allows us to use the wonders of American technology to \nhelp us on this--the so-called national technical means.\n  Third, what is referred to as ``unique identifiers'' placed on each \nweapon so you can track each weapon because of that identifier. That is \na critically important part of this.\n  The data exchanges between our two countries and certainly the prompt \nnotification of the movement of weapons.\n  This treaty permits up to 18 short-notice, onsite inspections each \nyear to determine the accuracy of Russia's data and to verify \ncompliance. We will talk more about that later.\n  But of course when the American people talk to us, they tell us they \nexpect us to get this right. They want to make sure there is a very \nstrong verification structure in place as we go forward. Without \nratification, we would not have that verification in place, and I think \na lot of people in the country expect us to ratify for that reason \nalone, in addition to the other reasons.\n  We had a good debate today about missile defense--a second issue I \nwill address--and I know we are short on time, but the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee made it absolutely clear in the resolution of \nratification of the treaty that the treaty itself would not constrain \nmissile defense. Two understandings within that--understandings No. 1 \nand No. 2--as well as declarations No. 1 and No. 2 specifically address \nand reiterate the U.S. commitment to developing and deploying missile \ndefenses.\n\n  Nothing in this treaty will prevent us from having a safe, secure, \nand reliable nuclear arsenal and nothing will constrain our ability to \nhave missile defense. In fact, as Chairman Kerry noted--and it is \nimportant to repeat this--the committee's resolution that brought the \ntreaty to the floor goes to great lengths to reaffirm and further \nclarify the treaty's preamble, and Russia's unilateral statement \nimposes no limits on our ability to develop and deploy these missile \ndefense systems.\n  I would note also, in connection with missile defense, that our \nmilitary and civilian leaders--the ones who have studied the treaty, \nwho have vast experience with national security and, in fact, \nexperience with nuclear weapons treaties of the past--have stated that \nneither the language in the preamble referencing any interrelationship \nbetween strategic offensive and defensive forces nor this unilateral \nstatement by the Russians places legally binding obligations on the \nUnited States.\n  In fact, that summary of their position appeared in the Wall Street \nJournal on April 20, 2010. So that is not just a statement by people on \nthis floor, it is cited in the Wall Street Journal.\n  I think when you step back from this, especially on missile defense, \nin order to reach the conclusion that some have reached and the \ndetermination they have made against the treaty--I guess on missile \ndefense grounds alone--you would have to believe it is a logical \nconclusion that Secretary Gates doesn't seem to be too concerned about \nmissile defense. But apparently he is, and he has spoken to this. You \nwould have to conclude Admiral Mullen, who has said we should ratify \nthis, hasn't made a determination about missile defense. I think he has \nand I think that is why we can rely upon that support and certainly the \nsupport of the Missile Defense Agency Director, LTG Patrick O'Reilly, \nsomeone whose job it is to be concerned about this and someone who has \nexperience with and involvement in what missile defense means and what \nit means to our security.\n  So I think there is ample evidence and ample testimony on the record \nbefore our committee and otherwise that indicates in no way does this \ntreaty constrain our ability to develop and deploy missile defense.\n  I know we are short on time, and I will wrap up, and I will have more \nto say as we go forward. But when you consider the implications for our \nsecurity that this treaty involves and also think in a larger sense in \nterms of how people view this debate in Washington, there are a lot of \npeople who are concerned about our economy. They are concerned about \ntheir own jobs and concerned about their own family's economic or \nfinancial security. That is a chief source of their anxiety. But I \nthink they also worry about our national defense. They are worried \nabout terrorism and they are worried about attacks and they are worried \nabout national security and their own security. We need to give them \nassurances that at least as it relates to nuclear weapons pointed at \nthe American people, that we are taking a significant step here--a \nhistoric step--that will ensure we have both a safe, secure, and \neffective nuclear arsenal to go at any nation that would cause us harm, \nbut at the same time we are taking steps to reduce nuclear weapons \nacross the world to make us, in fact, safer.\n  We all believe this. Both sides of the aisle believe this. We want a \nstrong national defense and we want to be safe. What we have to do in \nthe next couple days--after thousands and thousands of questions being \nasked of and answered\n\n[[Page S10382]]\n\nby the administration, after 15 or so hearings just in the Foreign \nRelations Committee, after months and months of debate, months and \nmonths of testimony, after all that--is complete our work. We have to \nratify this treaty, give the American people some peace of mind in this \nholiday season that our defense is strong, that our nuclear arsenal is \nstrong, and that we can come together and ratify a treaty that has been \nendorsed across the board by experts in national defense, people who \ncare deeply about our security.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I support the New Strategic Arms Reduction \nTreaty, also called the New START Treaty. New START, if ratified, will \nhave several major and positive impacts on our national security and on \nglobal nonproliferation. I must express my deep disappointment that the \nSenate has not yet ratified this treaty, and I join my friends Chairman \nKerry and Senator Lugar in appealing to all Senators for their \ncooperation and support in ratifying this treaty. The New START treaty \nis the right move for our country and for our world.\n  New START builds on a long history of strategic nuclear arms treaties \nbetween the United States and Russia and Russia's predecessor, the \nSoviet Union. Beginning with the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks \nratified in 1972, we have entered into three strategic arms control \ntreaties with the Soviet Union and Russia. This number does not include \nSTART II, which was ratified by the Senate in 1996 but never entered \ninto force due to subsequent treaty mandates from the Russian Duma. The \nmost recent arms control treaty, the Strategic Offensive Reductions \nTreaty, or SORT, was ratified unanimously in March 2003.\n  Unfortunately, both the SALT and original START treaties have \nexpired, with START concluding last December. The expiration of these \ntreaties means that the United States presently has no fully \nimplemented arms control treaty governing the nuclear weapons \nstockpiles of the United States and Russia. This circumstance is \ndangerous to our national security and needs to be rectified as soon as \npossible.\n  I am not alone in holding that position. A bevy of experts have \nstrongly urged support for the New START treaty, from all points on the \npolitical spectrum. Every senior leader and expert in the current \nadministration supports the quick ratification of New START, from \nSecretaries Gates and Clinton to a whole range of uniformed leaders \nsuch as Admiral Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs; General \nO'Reilly, the Director of the Missile Defense Agency; and General \nKlotz, the Commander of the Air Force Global Strike Command. General \nKlotz is joined by many of his predecessors who commanded the Strategic \nCommand and Strategic Air Command, including General Welch, General \nChain, General Butler, Admiral Ellis, General Davis, and more. Former \nSecretaries of Defense have come out in support of New START, including \nJames Schlesinger, William Perry, Frank Carlucci, and Harold Brown. \nFormer Secretaries of State of both parties are also advocating Senate \nratification: Colin Powell, Madeleine Albright, George Shultz, James \nBaker, and Henry Kissinger. The list of distinguished, trusted and \nexperienced advocates goes on and on, reading like a ``Who's Who'' of \nthe U.S. diplomatic and military communities.\n  One of the biggest reasons why so many experts are arguing for \nratification of this treaty is because it will do a great deal to \ncontrol Russian nuclear arms and resume verifiable inspections. New \nSTART would reduce Russia's deployment of strategic nuclear warheads by \nabout 25 percent. U.S. inspectors have not held an inspection of \nRussia's nuclear arsenal for a year; New START would resume \ninspections. Specifically, U.S. inspectors will have 18 annual \ninspections of Russian delivery vehicles and warheads. No previous \ntreaty has allowed direct U.S. monitoring of Russian warheads for \nverification purposes. In fact, the close perspective that U.S. \ninspections would allow under this treaty will eliminate the need to \nshare information about missile flight testing since that information, \nalso called telemetry, was used to determine the number of warheads \nthat a missile carried. New START will let us determine that by \ncounting the warheads themselves, not by evaluating missile flight \ndata. Secretary Gates has confirmed that New START is sufficiently \nverifiable that the United States could determine if Russia made any \nattempts to cheat on our break out of the treaty.\n  Perhaps one of the greatest benefits of New START is its contribution \nto global nonproliferation, which all of us can agree would be strongly \nbeneficial to our national security interests. The United States will \nnever convince other states to forgo a nuclear program if we do not \nshow our own commitment to ending the nuclear scourge. More \nimportantly, we will not be able to reach agreement with our partners \nabout punitive nonproliferation measures without ratifying New START.\n  It is difficult to discuss this subject without raising the issue of \nIran's nuclear program. Today the international community has put in \nplace deservedly harsh sanctions against Iran's governing regime. These \nsanctions are so tough that Kenneth Pollack quotes former Iranian \nPresident Ayatollah Rafsanjani as calling them ``no joke'' and warning \n``that [Iran's] situation is dire.'' These sanctions required patient \ninternational cooperation that cannot survive American preventive \nattacks. And without sanctions we should give up any hope of ending \nIran's nuclear program.\n  Instead, we must continue to isolate Iran by garnering international \nsupport for further escalating sanctions. The United States, not Iran, \nis the indispensable nation, and to gather support for punitive non-\nproliferation we must lead by example. New START demonstrates our \ncommitment to limiting the threat of nuclear weapons--even those in our \nown arsenal. And it bolsters our further requests to other countries to \nsqueeze Iran in ways that the ayatollahs cannot tolerate.\n  Even while New START will renew our leadership in nuclear \nnonproliferation, the treaty reserves our right to pursue missile \ndefense options and maintain an effective nuclear deterrent. A nuclear \nweapon in the hands of a terrorist is extremely unlikely to arrive on \nthe tip of a missile. Even so, the most ardent supporters of spending \nbillions more on strategic missile defense must acknowledge that New \nSTART's provisions were so well negotiated as to bar limitations on \nAmerican defensive technologies. Similarly, the treaty will not prevent \nus from deterring other nuclear powers. New START allows the United \nStates to maintain a highly credible deterrent.\n  Expansive and unchecked Russian and American nuclear arsenals are \ndangerous, expensive, and unnecessary. Eliminating the threat of stolen \nor illegally purchased nuclear weapons must be among the very gravest \nthreats that the United States faces today. New START will help us \ndiminish and contain that threat. At a time when leaders of both \nparties are seeking ways to cut the budget deficit, our nuclear program \nseems like an unnecessary and burdensome vestige of the Cold War. It is \ndifficult if not impossible to credibly argue today that the massive \nnuclear arsenal we built to deter the Soviet Union serves our needs in \ntoday's changed world, where terrorism and the support of terrorism \nloom so large as threats to our security.\n  The time has come to do the right thing for the right reasons. Both \nparties should cooperate, as we have in the past, on issues that will \nmake our country safer. No one should doubt that the New START treaty \nwill do exactly that. Especially on an issue so vitally important to \nour security, and to the security of our children and grandchildren, \nthe American people want and deserve a fair and straightforward debate. \nPartisan point-scoring should be checked at the door. Let us vote to \nratify New START.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have done a lot of important work this \nyear. We have reformed our health care system to give families more \noptions and more control. We have brought accountability to Wall \nStreet; and reigned in the reckless behavior that led to the economic \ncrisis. We have given relief to millions of Americans hurting because \nof the economy. Now, it is time for us to protect the national security \nof the United States.\n  First of all I want to say that I was pleased that we were able to \nmove forward and start debate on the treaty today. I hope we can \ncontinue to have a process that allows for real discussion and debate.\n\n[[Page S10383]]\n\n  This treaty is critical to the national security of the United \nStates. We know that one of the greatest security threats America faces \nis a nuclear weapon in the hands of a terrorist. A nuclear-armed \nterrorist would not be constrained by doctrines of deterrence or \nmutually assured destruction but could attack and destroy one of our \ncities without warning. By ratifying this treaty, we can help stop that \ntragedy from happening.\n  This treaty would secure nuclear stockpiles by taking nearly 1,500 \nU.S. and Russian nuclear weapons--weapons that now sit pointed at \ncities like Washington and Moscow, Chicago and St. Petersburg--and put \nthem on ice. It has been more than a year since American inspectors \nwere on the ground monitoring the Russian nuclear weapons arsenal. It \nis critical that we ratify this treaty so we can get that window into \nexactly what the Russians are, or are not, doing.\n  This treaty preserves a strong U.S. nuclear arsenal. As treaty \nnegotiations were underway, U.S. Military leaders provided analysis and \ndetermined the number of nuclear weapons we needed to retain to keep us \nsafe here at home.\n  With the United States and Russia controlling over 90 percent of the \nworld's nuclear weapons, we need the stability and transparency this \ntreaty would provide.\n  We aren't ratifying this treaty because we want to be Russia's best \nfriend. But we do need to work together with Russia to stop the most \ndangerous nuclear threats from around the world, including Iran and \nNorth Korea.\n  By ratifying the START treaty, we will increase our ability to work \nwith other countries to reduce nuclear weapons around the world and to \nmake sure that those weapons are kept safe and secure.\n  Given the obvious advantages of this treaty to our national security, \nI hope we will be able to continue this institution's tradition of \nbipartisan support for arms control. The START treaty builds on a long \nhistory of bipartisan support for treaties which limit the strategic \noffensive weapons of the United States and Russia.\n  The Senate, as well, has a long history of broad bipartisan support \nfor these types of treaties.\n  Continuing that tradition, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \noverwhelmingly approved the resolution of ratification of the START \ntreaty with a bipartisan vote of 14 to 4.\n  The U.S. military leadership unanimously supports the treaty, and \nSecretary of Defense Robert Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff Admiral Mullen have spoken in favor of the treaty in their \ntestimony before the Senate.\n  Secretaries of State from the last five Republican Presidents support \nthe treaty because they know, in their words, the world is safer today \nbecause of the decades-long effort to reduce its supply of nuclear \nweapons.\n  A wide range of Republican and Democratic national security leaders \nhave come out in support of the treaty, including former President \nGeorge H.W. Bush, Colin L. Powell, Madeleine K. Albright, LTG Brent \nScowcroft, James Schlesinger, Stephen Hadley, Sam Senator Nunn, and \nSenator John Warner.\n  As we enter this historic debate, we want to ensure that all voices \nare heard. We plan to allow our Republican colleagues the opportunity \nto express their views and concerns about the treaty and to have a \nreasonable number of germane and relevant amendments.\n  Republicans have been included in the process from the beginning--the \nresolution recommended by the Foreign Relations Committee that we will \ndebate was, at the urging of Senator Kerry, crafted by Senator Lugar to \nreflect the views of Republican colleagues, and the Foreign Relations \nCommittee then adopted in its markup two additional Republican \namendments.\n  Senator Kyl raised legitimate concerns about the state of the U.S. \nnuclear weapons complex, and the administration responded with a \ncommitment of $85 billion to upgrade that complex over the next 10 \nyears.\n  But there is a difference between legitimate policy concerns and \nthose who simply wish to use procedural tricks to keep the treaty \nmoving forward.\n  We can easily complete this treaty with a reasonable amount of time, \nas the Senate has in the past. We can continue our institution's long \nhistory of bipartisan support for arms control. And we can take 1,500 \nnuclear weapons off their launchpads and make the future far safer for \nthe children of America and the world.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I think we have had a good opportunity \nthroughout today and yesterday to open some of the issues and give \ncolleagues a sense of what is in the treaty, the resolution of \nratification, and how it addresses many of the concerns. My hope is, \nperhaps, as we go out of executive session and into legislative session \nfor a period of time, it will give some of us an opportunity to sit \ndown and work together to see if we can find some of the clarifications \nthat might resolve some of those issues for people.\n  Senator Lugar and I are both prepared to sit with our colleagues and \ntry to do that, and obviously we look forward to being able to get back \nto begin the process of legislating on whatever understandings, \ndeclarations, and clarifications Senators may have. I would ask my \ncolleagues to carefully read the resolution and look at the many places \nin which rail-mobile missile defense and all these other issues have \nbeen addressed by that resolution.\n  I see the hour of 7 has arrived, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "16", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/16/senate-section/article/S10383-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10383-S10385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FUNDING THE GOVERNMENT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Members on both sides anticipated my filing \ncloture tonight on the spending bill that would take us through next \nyear. Everyone knows we are operating under a continuing resolution \nthat expires Saturday night at midnight. Senator Inouye has worked so \nvery hard for the entire year, working on a bipartisan agreement and in \na bipartisan manner, to put together a bill that will responsibly fund \nthe government for the next fiscal year. He has not done this as king. \nHe has done it working with Democrats and Republicans. Senator Cochran \nhas been in on all the efforts Senator Inouye has made. The product was \nfiled a few days ago. The overall spending level was supported by 40 \nRepublicans earlier this year.\n  In addition, the bill contains priorities for Members, Democrats and \nRepublicans. Although some of my Republican colleagues in recent days \nhave publicly distanced themselves from the idea that Members have a \nrole to play in the appropriations process, all of them did nothing \nprivately to withdraw their priorities from this bill.\n  I will not take a long time tonight, but I will say a few things \nabout this. It is no surprise because I have said it before. I, like \neveryone here, support the Constitution of the United States. I don't \ncarry this with me every day but nearly every day. I don't read it \nevery day, but I have a pretty good idea what is in it. One of the \nthings I understand and support is that the Founding Fathers decided we \nshould have a unique form of government, with three separate and equal \nbranches. I believe, as one of the legislators here in the framework of \nthe government set up by the Founding Fathers, that I have a number of \nresponsibilities. One of those responsibilities set forth in that \nConstitution is to make sure that the executive branch of government \ndoes not take power away from us. Three separate, equal branches of \ngovernment, not three branches of government with one stronger than the \nother. I think my Republican friends are giving up so much to the \nexecutive branch of government in doing away with congressionally \ndirected spending.\n  It wouldn't matter if George Bush the first, George Bush the second, \nJimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, President Clinton, or Barack Obama were \nPresident. I don't like this grab of power. That is what it is. I don't \nknow why people in this branch of government are willing to give that \npower up.\n\n[[Page S10384]]\n\nThis bill, put together by Senator Inouye and Senator Cochran, is a \ngood bill. It is an important piece of legislation. It has priorities \nthat are so vitally important to children.\n  Mr. President, 300,000 children in America, as a result of our not \nmoving forward, are going to be treated much differently. The Head \nStart Program has been proven to be something that is vital to the \ncountry, and 300,000 children will not be eligible for Head Start \nbecause of this. Programs in our schools will be much less than they \nshould be. Senior citizens will be significantly harmed. We have in \nthis legislation programs that will create jobs, jobs through \ndeveloping infrastructure that is so desperately needed. This action \ntaken by my friends on the other side of the aisle is going to cause \npeople to lose their jobs.\n  Military construction. I have important bases vital to the security \nof this Nation in Nevada. They are all going to be damaged as a result \nof what has happened here. One reason I feel so put upon, which is \nprobably a word that people don't much care whether I am put upon, but \nI tried to make this something that was good for the Congress. I was \nelated that one of my Republican friends said: Here is who is going to \nsupport you. Here is who is going to support you, up to nine.\n  I have talked to a number of those Senators. I will not identify \nthem. I know who they are. I have it right here. I won't tonight or any \ntime publicly ever say anything about who they are, but they know who \nthey are. In the last 24 hours they have walked away from the ability \nfor us to complete this legislation. I was told within the last 24 \nhours that we had bipartisan support to pass this bill. ``Many'' is a \nword that is too large, but a number of Republican Senators told me \nthey would like to see it passed, and they couldn't vote for it.\n  Those nine Senators--I have called some of them tonight and visited \nwith them--will not support this legislation. We now have a simple \nchoice. Are we going to help the people in America--I have listed some \nof the people who desperately need this help, and it appears that the \nanswer will be no--or will we wind up passing a short-term CR to keep \ngovernment running. In reality, we only have one choice, and that is a \nshort-term CR.\n  I asked my friend Senator McConnell if I should file cloture on the \nCR we got from the House. He said no. And one thing about Senator \nMcConnell, I have found that he levels with me on issues. There is no \nneed to go through that procedure. It is not worth it to anybody. We \nwill not get a vote on that.\n  So in the next 24 hours or so, Senator McConnell and I will work to \ntry to come up with a CR to fund the government for a certain period of \ntime. That is where we are right now. I am sorry and disappointed.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, may I make a few observations about \nwhere we are?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I am going to file cloture tonight on the DREAM Act. \nWe will have a cloture vote on that Saturday morning fairly early. I am \ngoing to file cloture on don't ask, don't tell tonight. So those will \nbe sequenced for Saturday or whenever we get to them. But we have to \nmove this along. Following that I was told by a number of Republican \nSenators that they needed 6 or 7 days to debate and offer amendments on \nthe START treaty. That will certainly be available. We will finish, if \nthe math works out the way I believe it will, early Monday morning.\n  First of all, tomorrow we can debate START to everyone's heart's \ncontent. They can offer as many amendments as they want, and then \nMonday we can go to that again. This would be 3 days already completed \non that, 3 or 4 days, whatever is appropriate next week to complete the \nSTART treaty. We would wind this up by taking care of the nominations \nthat Senator McConnell and I have been working on. That is the range of \nthings we have to do. I have told the two Senators from New York that I \nwill move to reconsider their vote at some time, but that is going to \nhappen fairly quickly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me respond briefly to the majority \nleader. I too want to commend the members of the Appropriations \nCommittee for all the work they have done, particularly Republican \nmembers of the Appropriations Committee who did spend an enormous \namount of time crafting and developing the 12 different appropriations \nbills that we should have been acting on all year long. This is the \nfirst time in modern history that not a single appropriations bill went \nacross the floor of the Senate--not a one. So the Appropriations \nCommittee members on a bipartisan basis did indeed do their job. The \nproblem was the full Senate didn't do its job. What we ended up with \nwas this, this almost 2,000-page Omnibus appropriations bill which we \nonly got yesterday.\n\n  The point is, the work the Appropriations Committee did in many \nrespects was squandered because the full Senate didn't do its job. This \nis precisely the kind of thing the American people have gotten tired \nof.\n  The message we ought to take out of this is that next year, we are \ngoing to listen to the American people. We are going to do our work, do \nit in a timely fashion. There is no more basic work than the funding of \nthe government. That is the first thing we ought to be doing.\n  Here we are trying to do it right at the end, as an old Congress goes \nout of office and a new Congress comes in. The message is, let's don't \ndo this anymore. Let's make a bipartisan decision at the beginning of \nthe next session that the basic work of government is going to be done \nin a timely fashion for an opportunity out here on the floor of the \nSenate for Members of both parties to offer amendments, make \nsuggestions, and improve the bill.\n  I too respect the work the Appropriations Committee has done. I don't \nagree with the priorities we have had here in the Senate about what \nthings are important. As a result of not doing the basic work of \ngovernment, here we are at the end struggling with this issue. There is \nonly one reason why cloture is not being filed and the majority leader, \nto his credit, has already said it. He doesn't have the votes. The \nreason he doesn't have the votes is because Members on this side of the \naisle increasingly felt concerned about the way we do business. For \nmany of our Members it was not so much the substance of the bill but \nthe process. Let's learn from this. We will get together, as the \nmajority leader said, and determine what appropriate time for a \ncontinuing resolution makes sense to offer to govern on an interim \nbasis, and let's come back here after the holidays with a renewed \ndesire to do our business in a timely fashion and avoid this kind of \nthing in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it doesn't take a person with a PhD to \nunderstand that I differ with what my friend, the senior Senator from \nKentucky, said, things that don't indicate what history is in the \nSenate. We have been facing 87 filibusters this Congress. For anyone to \nsuggest that the reason the work of Senators Inouye and Cochran was not \ncompleted is because we didn't do the appropriations bills is \nfarfetched. Senators Inouye and Cochran, in good faith, worked toward \nwhat they were told the Democrats and Republicans wanted to do; that \nis, have a bill that took in the priorities of Democrats and \nRepublicans. The bill that we are talking about isn't a bill that is a \nDemocratic bill. It is a Democratic and Republican bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will my good friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I wish to ask the majority leader, does he recall the \ntime I returned from the Appropriations Committee and said Senator \nMcConnell had come to the committee and said he was going to establish \nthe maximum amount that he would vote for in all the appropriations \nbills, the 203(b) allocation of $1.108 trillion? And I said to the \nmajority leader, I think ultimately that is what we are going to be \nvoting for, Senator McConnell's number. Is the Senator from Nevada \naware of the fact that the bill we were going to consider was at that \nnumber that was asked for by Senator McConnell in the Appropriations \nCommittee?\n\n[[Page S10385]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Yes, and it satisfied what we had debated here on a number \nof occasions and voted on, the so-called Sessions-McCaskill number. So \nwe did that. This is not a big balloon that we just threw up to see how \nit would work out. Senator McConnell, who has had a longstanding \nassociation with the Appropriations Committee, that was a number he \ntold us we should work with.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. As a former member of the Appropriations Committee, is \nthe Senator aware of the process in that committee, a bipartisan \nprocess where the ranking Republican member and the Democratic chairman \nof each subcommittee sit down to literally have a hearing, mark up a \nbill, and accept earmarks from both sides of the aisle? That is the \ncommon practice and has been followed with the bills that are currently \nsitting in front of the minority leader?\n\n  Mr. REID. Yes. To Senator Cochran's credit, there were things he \nthought should not be in the bill that Senator Inouye was putting \ntogether. Senator Inouye, to his credit, said: OK, it does not go in. \nEverything people wanted in this bill--in addition to the work that \nwent on on the subcommittee level, the full committee level--anything \nthat was added at a later time had to be approved by both Senator \nInouye and Senator Cochran.\n  Mr. DURBIN. On a bipartisan basis.\n  Mr. REID. That is right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. In every subcommittee.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. And things that Senator Cochran did not want in, \nSenator Inouye, being the gentleman he is, said: OK. That is what I \nwill tell my caucus.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I will yield for a question, and, of course, I \nmaintain the floor.\n  Go ahead.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask the Senator to yield for a \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would ask the leader through the Chair, \nis he aware that the bill that is before us, that apparently we do not \nhave enough votes for now, has gone through a very long committee \nprocess? The transportation and housing bill that I worked with my \nRepublican colleague on, I did not agree with all of his requests, but \nI gave him a lot in this bill, as we worked our way through it and \npassed it out of subcommittee, passed it out of the full committee, a \ncommittee of which the minority leader is a member.\n  All of the bills that are involved in this omnibus bill--every one of \nthem--went through a long, long process of committee hearings, \nsubcommittee markups and passage, and full committee markups and \npassage.\n  The changes to this bill that have come to the floor have come as a \nresult not of a change in policy, but because we all were told that in \norder to get an omnibus passed, we had to reduce the amount of that \nbill that passed out of committee--each of those bills a significant \namount--to meet the McCaskill-Sessions level. So we went back and cut a \nsignificant amount out of each one of our bills. The result is the \nomnibus bill before us.\n  So the 2,000 pages that we are referring to have worked their way \nthrough a process. I would ask the leader if he knows this. And the \ndifference is, we had to cut money to meet the level of Sessions-\nMcCaskill. That is what we have before us. And that is what we are \nbeing told, after a year's worth of work, that somehow we do not have \nthe capability of knowing what is in the bill. Is the leader aware of \nthat?\n  Mr. REID. I am aware of it. But my friend, the Republican leader, \nwants to ask a question or make some statement. But I would say this to \nmy friend from Washington, remember, this bill, which is 1,900 pages \nlong, consists of the work of 12 subcommittees.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Right.\n  Mr. REID. It is work that has been done over the last year, or more \nin some instances, to come up with a product. So if you break it down \nper subcommittee, it is certainly a reasonable number of pages on each \nsubcommittee. Remember, there are 12 subcommittees that are a part of \nit.\n  I would be happy to yield, without losing the floor, to my friend, \nthe Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I was just going to ask my friend--it is hard to ask a \nquestion without making something of a statement in connection with it, \nif that is OK.\n  Mr. REID. That is fine.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I was not talking about the process by which the bill \nwas developed in committee. And I started off, I would say to my friend \nfrom Nevada, commending the committee for its work. What I was \ncommenting upon was the lack of taking the bill up on the floor of the \nSenate--over $1 trillion, the basic work of government.\n  And so, Mr. President, I would ask my friend, why, if these bills \nenjoy bipartisan support--and they did--why were they not brought \nbefore the full Senate and passed? I think I would say to my friend, I \nexpect it is because you had other priorities. And this is the basic \nwork of government. Why did we not bring any of these bills before the \nSenate floor?\n  Mr. REID. I hope the court reporter will take down the smile I have \non my face because the answer to the question is kind of easy. We have \nhad to file cloture 87 times in this Congress because, on everything we \nhave tried to do, we have been obstructed. So that is the reason.\n  Everyone knows we have had some very big issues. When President Obama \nwas elected, we found ourselves in a deep, deep hole. It was so deep, \nso deep. During the prior administration, we lost 8 million jobs. The \nmonth that President Obama and President Bush shared the Presidency, in \nJanuary--that month--we lost 800,000 jobs. So we had a lot to do.\n  Now, I know people criticize our doing health care for various \nreasons. There is criticism we did the bank reform bill, Wall Street \nreform. We did housing reform. We had a very, very busy Congress to try \nto dig ourselves out of the hole.\n  So I say to my friend, who, like me, has been on the Appropriations \nCommittee--I am not on it now but he is--the Appropriations Committee \nis a wonderful committee. Everyone here knows why we did not have the \nindividual appropriations bills. I say to my friend, I hope next year \nwe can get them done. But I think there is more of a chance next year \nbecause we have gotten a lot done to help get ourselves out of the hole \nwe found ourselves in because of the previous 8 years which created the \nbig hole we had to kind of dig out of.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to lay before the Senate a \nmessage from the House with respect to H.R. 5281.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold for a second?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "16", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/16/senate-section/article/S10385-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the members \nof America's Armed Forces who are deployed during this Christmas \nseason. The sacrifices of our military and those of their families are \nalways great, but especially so during wartime and the holidays. As \nmost Americans celebrate this time of joy and good cheer it is \nimportant that we take a moment to honor and remember the brave men and \nwomen in uniform who are defending our well being overseas and to thank \ntheir families as well.\n  Kentucky's military installations have been in the thick of the fight \nin the war on terror. The 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, for \nexample, is once again overseas. The unit is fully deployed and is \nexecuting a critical mission in Afghanistan.\n  The Army's 3rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division is \ncurrently deploying from Fort Knox to Afghanistan. The Duke Brigade, as \nit is known, is the first unit of its kind at Fort Knox since the \n1990s.\n  And the Kentucky National Guard continues to deploy to theater. Just \nlast week, members of the 123rd Civil Engineer Squadron left for \nSouthwest Asia.\n  I am profoundly grateful for the sacrifice of our servicemembers and \nmilitary families. And, as a Kentuckian, I swell with pride at the \ncontributions made by units from the Commonwealth's military \ninstallations and by Kentucky servicemembers. During this holiday \nseason our prayers are with them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "16", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/16/senate-section/article/S10387-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10387-S10388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOHN BELSKI\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Louisville, \nKentucky's, longtime meteorologist John Belski, whom a large swath of \nKentuckians have relied on for accurate weather forecasts for over 23 \nyears. After a long and successful career, John has retired. This \nSeptember 8 he presented his final weather broadcast.\n  John began at WAVE-3 TV in Louisville in July 1987 and has been \nwelcomed into Kentuckians' homes ever since. A typical morning for \nresidents of the greater Louisville area began by tuning in to John for \nimportant details about the day's forecast.\n  Before joining WAVE-3, John worked in Louisville at WLKY-TV and also \nat stations in St. Louis and Columbia, MO. John's professionalism has \nearned him several awards, including 15 different Best of Louisville \nMagazine honors, the Best of Kentucky award by Kentucky Monthly \nmagazine and the LEO Readers' Choice Award, just to name a few.\n  John was at the center of the hard-hitting winter storm in 1994, when \nKentucky was blanketed with a record snowfall of more than 15 inches. \nIn August 2009 he stood watch when a massive rainstorm produced large \nhail and flash flooding that caused major damage to some of Kentucky's \nmost well known attractions, including Churchill Downs. And who could \nforget this time last year, when one of the most severe ice storms in \nKentucky's history crippled the area, leaving 760,000 residents without \npower and causing 36 deaths across the State. Throughout it all, John's \nwas a calm and steady voice, providing viewers with critical \ninformation.\n  Now that he has retired, I hope John will have more time to spend \nwith his wife Lynn and his two daughters. John is not just known for \nhis abilities as a meteorologist in Louisville. Whether it be partaking \nin one of the many county fairs or being present at the Kentucky Derby, \nJohn was always there, reporting. He is going to be missed enormously, \nand I would ask my colleagues to join me in thanking him on behalf of \nall Kentuckians for his service.\n  Mr. President, WAVE-3 TV recently published a story on the retirement \nof their friend, John Belski, and I ask unanimous consent that the full \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From WAVE3.com, Aug. 18, 2010]\n\n            Meteorologist John Belski Retires from WAVE 3 TV\n\n       Louisville, KY (WAVE).--WAVE 3 Meteorologist John Belski \n     will retire from WAVE 3 TV on September 8, 2010, it was \n     announced by Regional Vice-President & General Manager Steve \n     Langford.\n       ``Retirement for a deserving friend should always be looked \n     upon with happiness,'' said Langford. ``While I regret to see \n     John leave the airwaves, I respect his decision and wish him \n     and his family much happiness.''\n       ``This is an opportunity for me to explore some new \n     possibilities outside of the TV business,'' Belski said. \n     ``After all these years at WAVE 3 it's time for Kevin Harned \n     to take the reins and lead the weather team.''\n       Kevin Harned and John Belski first met when Kevin was in \n     high school. Harned wrote to Belski asking him to speak to \n     his 4-H Club in Nelson County. That meeting left an indelible \n     mark on Harned who persistently pursued his new career goal \n     to become a television meteorologist. ``John has been a great \n     mentor and a great friend,'' said Harned. ``We've covered a \n     lot of severe weather together and hopefully have helped to \n     keep our community safe from harm.''\n       John Belski first joined the WAVE 3 weather team in July \n     1987. Prior to that, he worked at WLKY-TV in Louisville and \n     also at stations in St. Louis and Columbia, Missouri. In \n     addition to his television forecasts John makes multiple \n     daily postings to his blog, Twitter and Face book sites. Over \n     the years John has been on the air on 18 different radio \n     stations and currently on 84 WHAS-AM and WMPI 105.3 FM. His \n     weather book ``Backyard Weather Folklore'' sold thousands of \n     copies.\n       ``For the past 23 years John Belski has been the calming \n     voice in the storm while protecting our viewers during severe \n     weather,'' said Langford. ``His folksy, friendly style of \n     forecasting has made him a favorite in our community.''\n       John Belski has received numerous awards from community \n     organizations and publications including 15 different Best of \n     Louisville Magazine honors, the Best of Kentucky by Kentucky \n     Monthly magazine and the LEO's Readers' Choice Award. He has \n     anchored Emmy Award winning coverage of severe weather and \n     received the Special Service Award from the National Weather \n     Service and the Mark Trail Award for public awareness of NOAA \n     weather radios.\n       John Belski will present his last weather broadcast during \n     WAVE 3 News at 6:00 p.m. on September 8, 2010.\n       WAVE-TV is owned by Raycom Media, Inc., an employee-owned \n     company which is now one of the nation's largest \n     broadcasters. Currently the company owns and/or operates 42 \n     television stations in 18 states. Raycom Media stations cover \n     more than 10.6 percent of the U.S. television households and \n     employ 3,500 individuals in full- and part-time positions. \n     Through Raycom Sports, the company owns and operates the \n     Continental Tire Bowl in Charlotte and two LPGA golf \n     tournaments, as well as produces pre-season NFL football \n     games for non-owned stations.\n\n[[Page S10388]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "16", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/16/senate-section/article/S10388-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10388-S10400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO RETIRING SENATORS\n\n\n                               Evan Bayh\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a colleague \nand friend of mine--Senator Evan Bayh--who will be retiring from the \nU.S. Senate when the 112th Congress convenes in January. I would like \nto take this moment to thank Evan for his service, and wish him, his \nwife Susan, and their twin boys Beau and Nick, the very best as they \nembark on the next chapter in their lives.\n  Evan comes from a family tradition deeply rooted in public service \nand committed to improving the lives of our fellow citizens. Our \nfathers, Birch Bayh and Tom Dodd, served together in the U.S. Senate, \nand instilled in both of us the desire to serve as we grew older.\n  Evan has dedicated the better part of his adult life to serving the \npeople of Indiana. He began his career in public service when he was \nelected Indiana's Secretary of State in 1986. He then served as \nGovernor of Indiana for two terms starting in 1988. As Governor he \nfocused on fiscal responsibility, lower taxes, job creation and lean \ngovernment. In 1998, Hoosiers once again demonstrated their faith in \nEvan Bayh by electing him to the U.S. Senate.\n  Throughout his career in public service, Evan has been particularly \nvocal on issues related to our national security, economic \ncompetiveness, and job creation. He has demonstrated his willingness to \nwork hard, a fact underscored by his membership on six Senate \ncommittees--Aging, Armed Services, Banking, Energy and Natural \nResources, Intelligence, and Small Business. He has developed a broad \nrange of subject matter expertise, and has time and again demonstrated \nhis willingness to reach across the aisle to get things done for the \npeople of Indiana.\n  This Congress, as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, I had the \nopportunity to work with Evan on several vital issues, such as his \ncontributions to the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and \nDisclosure, CARD, Act and Wall Street reform.\n  When Evan leaves the Senate in just a few short weeks, I believe he \nwill be remembered as a public servant who was devoted first and \nforemost to advancing the interests of Hoosiers, and who was willing to \nwork across the aisle whenever he saw an opportunity to do the right \nthing for our Nation.\n  Once again, I would like to thank Evan for his years of service, and \nwish him well as he leaves the Senate. It has been a pleasure working \nwith him over the years, and I firmly believe that this body will not \nbe the same without him.\n\n\n                              Bob Bennett\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a friend and longtime \ncolleague Senator Bob Bennett who, like me, will be departing from the \nU.S. Senate in just a couple of weeks. I would like to take this \nopportunity to wish Bob, Joyce, and the rest of his family the very \nbest as he leaves the Senate and embarks on this new chapter in his \nlife.\n  Since he was first elected to this body in 1992, Bob has served the \npeople of Utah well as their Senator. Bob comes from a long line of \nindividuals dedicated to public service, and it is no surprise that he \nhimself decided to go down that path. Bob's grandfather, Heber J. \nGrant, was the seventh President of the Church of Jesus Christ of \nLatter-day Saints in Salt Lake City. And Bob's father, Wallace F. \nBennett, represented the state of Utah in this very Chamber between \n1951 and 1974, serving alongside my father, Tom Dodd.\n  Throughout the time that I have known and worked with him, I have \nalways found Bob to be receptive to the ideas of others and careful and \ndeliberate in his own evaluation of complex policy questions.\n  Of course, that is not to say that Bob Bennett isn't also a \ndetermined partisan. Indeed, throughout his three terms here, Bob has \nbeen one of the Senate's most consistently conservative voices. But in \nspite of that, Bob has frequently reached across the partisan divide to \nseek out areas of common ground and mutual interest with Democrats.\n  That willingness to engage and cooperate with colleagues has perhaps \nbeen most evident in his work on the Senate Banking Committee. \nThroughout our years of service together on that panel, Bob and I have \nfrequently been among the first to reach out across the aisle and \nsearch for solutions to the challenges facing our Nation's financial \nservices sector. And from our work together during the savings and loan \ncrisis, to passage of legislation that provides a safety net for our \neconomy in the event of a devastating terrorist attack, we have \nachieved some important results.\n  Bob chaired and I served as vice chairman of the Y2K Committee, to \nensure the integrity of our Nation's financial services sector. More \nrecently, in the fall of 2008, when the global financial system was on \nthe verge of collapse and our country was standing at the precipice of \nan economic depression, Bob took a significant political risk by \nsupporting the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which established \nTARP. I realize that this was an incredibly difficult vote for Bob and \nevery other Member of this Chamber at the time.\n  But I am convinced that without elected officials who are willing to \ncast those kinds of tough, yet necessary votes, this country would be a \nvery different place.\n  So I would like to once again thank Bob for his 18 years of service \nin this body and for his willingness to listen to and work with \ncolleagues with whom he hasn't always agreed. And I would like to once \nagain wish Bob and his family the very best as he leaves the Senate \nthis January.\n\n\n                            Blanche Lincoln\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Senior Senator from \nArkansas, Blanche Lincoln, who, like me, will be leaving the U.S. \nSenate in the coming weeks. I would like to take this moment to thank \nBlanche for her service, and wish her, her husband Dr. Steve Lincoln \nand her two twin boys Bennett and Reece, the very best as they embark \non the next chapter in their lives.\n  As a seventh generation Arkansan, Blanche has dedicated the better \npart of her adult life to serving the people of Arkansas. She was \nelected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1992. After two terms \nrepresenting Arkansas's first district she retired briefly to give \nbirth two her twin sons. However, the call of public service led her to \nrun for a vacant seat in the U.S. Senate and in 1998, at the age of 38, \nthe people of Arkansas elected her to serve them as their U.S. Senator \nthe youngest woman ever to be elected.\n  As a young woman growing up on her family farm in the small town of \nHelena, AR, Blanche developed a strong appreciation and understanding \nfor American farmers and ranchers and the important work they do for \nour country. She carried the lessons she learned, and the values they \ninstilled in her, with her to Congress. Throughout her career in public \nservice, Blanche has been particularly vocal on issues related to \nagriculture, hunger, working families and children.\n  In 2009, Blanche became the first ever woman to chair the Senate \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee. She played the key role \nin brokering the compromise that led to passage of the Food, \nConservation, and Energy Act of 2008, otherwise known as the farm bill, \nwhich reauthorizes U.S. agriculture policy every 5 years and is of \nvital importance to farmers and food producers across the country.\n  Senator Lincoln and the Agriculture Committee also played a vital \nrole in shaping the derivatives provisions in the Dodd-Frank Wall \nStreet reform bill. These were difficult, highly complex matters, and \nSenator Lincoln worked tirelessly to lead her committee throughout the \nprocess. Her seriousness and hard work were a tremendous asset to the \noverall process, and I commend her and her committee for helping to \nshape the legislation.\n  In addition to her work on the Agriculture Committee, Blanche has \nbeen focused on our country's children. She formed the Senate Caucus \nfor Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children and the Senate Hunger \nCaucus. She recently worked to pass the child nutrition bill, which \nwill improve the lives of millions of children in our country.\n  After Blanche leaves the Senate, I believe she will be remembered as \na tireless public servant who was devoted first and foremost to \nadvancing the interests of the people of her beloved home State, \nArkansas.\n  Once again, I would like to thank Blanche for her years of service, \nand\n\n[[Page S10389]]\n\nwish her well as she leaves the Senate. It has truly been a pleasure \nworking with her over the years, and I firmly believe that this body \nwill not be the same without her.\n\n\n                                Kit Bond\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes today to pay \ntribute to a longtime colleague, the senior Senator from Missouri, who \nlike me will be leaving this body in a few short weeks. It has been an \nhonor to serve with him, and I wish him, his wife Linda, and his son \nSamuel--who is bravely serving his Nation as a 1st lieutenant in the \nU.S. Marine Corps and the rest of his family the best of luck in the \nfuture.\n  Senator Bond, or ``Kit'' as many of us know him, knew at an early age \nthat his calling was public service. After earning his law degree and \npracticing for a few years here in Washington, DC, he returned to \nMissouri to run for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1968. While he \nwas unsuccessful in that first run, at the young age of 29 he caught \nthe eye of the then-Missouri Attorney General John Danforth, who hired \nhim as an assistant attorney general.\n  After heading the Attorney General's Office of Consumer Protection, \nKit was elected in his own right to serve as Missouri's State Auditor, \nand later went on to two terms as Governor of Missouri. He still holds \nthe distinction of having been the youngest Governor elected in his \nState's history at the age of 33.\n  Kit was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1986. During his time in this \nbody, he has established himself as a strong advocate for the people \nand interests of the State of Missouri. He has also established himself \nas a national leader on issues that are important not only to his State \nbut to our Nation as a whole.\n  For years, as a member and later chairman of the Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship Committee, he has served as a leading voice for small \nbusinesses.\n  As the vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, \nSenator Bond has worked continuously to ensure our Nation's \nintelligence community has the tools and resources necessary to keep us \nsafe. Throughout his career in the Senate, he has also been a \nknowledgeable, leading voice on matters of importance to veterans, and \nhas time and again proven his unwavering support for our men and women \nin uniform.\n  As a member of the Appropriations Committee, and chairman and ranking \nmember of the Transportation and Housing Subcommittee, he has played a \nsignificant role in advocating for improvements to our nation's roads \nand other vital infrastructure.\n  These are just some of the areas which Senator Bond will no doubt be \nremembered. But I would like to take a moment to speak to an issue \nwhich he and I have worked together for many years, for which he may \nnot receive the attention he deserves--his strong advocacy for the \nhealth of our nation's children and families.\n  Senator Bond and I have worked together on these issues for many \nyears. In 1991, his support was vital to gaining enactment of a piece \nof legislation of which I am most proud--the Family and Medical Leave \nAct. To date, this bill has been used more than 100 million times to \nensure that workers can care for ailing loved ones, or care for a new \nchild, without the fear of losing their job. This seems like common \nsense now, but it took 7 years, and 2 Presidential vetoes to finally \nsee this important law enacted.\n  That wouldn't have happened without the involvement of Kit Bond.\n  He was also one of the key supporters of the successful effort in \n2009 to ensure that airline workers have full access to their Family \nand Medical Leave Act benefits.\n  Senator Bond and I have also partnered over the years to improve \nmaternal and child health and end preventable birth defects. I was \nproud to be a cosponsor of the Birth Defects Prevention Act of 1998, \nwhich he authored. I was also honored to partner with him and others \nagain in 2003, when we were successful in passing the Birth Defects and \nDevelopmental Disabilities Prevention Act. These measures helped to \nestablish, and then expand, the role of the Centers for Disease Control \nin researching and developing solutions to the problems posed by birth \ndefects and developmental disabilities.\n  He was also a key Republican sponsor, along with Senator Hatch of \nUtah, of the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act, which I authored in the \n110th Congress. This legislation is the next step in our work together, \nand seeks to educate every parent, and provide access for every \nnewborn, to a battery of life-saving prenatal tests. This landmark \nlegislation helps build on the successes which we have had on this \nissue in the past, and I was pleased that Senator Bond was a supporter \nyet again, as he has been throughout his career in the Senate.\n  While we did not always see eye-to-eye on every issue, Senator Bond \nwas always someone with whom those policy disagreements were never \npersonal. He has been an honorable legislator, and a valued colleague \nduring our time serving in the Senate together.\n  Once again, I would like to wish Senator Bond, his wife Linda, his \nson Samuel and his family, and all their extended family the very best \nin all their future endeavors.\n\n\n                             Sam Brownback\n\n  I woul'd like to say a few words in honor of Senator Sam Brownback, \nmy colleague from Kansas for these past 14 years. Like me, he will be \nending his service in the U.S. Senate at the conclusion of this \nCongress. I would like to congratulate him on his election as Governor \nof the State of Kansas, and I wish him and his family the very best in \nhis new endeavor.\n  His election to the governorship should come as no surprise--he has \nproven time and again that his first priority is serving the people of \nKansas. He has a long track record of service, beginning with his 1986 \nelection to the position of State Secretary of Agriculture. At the time \nof his election, he was only 30 years old, the youngest person ever to \nhold the position.\n  After serving as Agriculture Secretary, Sam was elected to the House \nof Representatives as part of the famous Republican class of 1994. He \nquickly ascended to the Senate in 1996 with the departure of a Senate \nand Kansas legend, then-Majority Leader Bob Dole. Sam had some big \nshoes to fill, and he has done so admirably.\n  Senator Brownback will be remembered for many things, his \nconservatism and his passion to name a few, but perhaps the most \nimportant is his dedication to his faith. His religious values provided \nan anchor for everything he did, and led to his pursuit of issues that \nprovided assistance for those in need.\n  Senator Brownback's commitment to ending the genocide in Darfur is an \nexample of one of those issues. Tragically, more than 200,000 people \nhave died in Darfur and more than 2.5 million have been displaced as a \nresult of the unrest in Sudan. Senator Brownback's expertise and \ndedication to this critically important issue has made a real impact on \nthe fight to end this horrific crisis. With his retirement, the Senate \nwill lose one of its great human rights champions.\n  Senator Brownback and I may not have always seen eye-to-eye, but no \none ever questioned his commitment to principle, or his commitment to \nthe people of Kansas.\n  I wish him, his wife Mary, and their five children all the best. \nWhile the Senate will miss him, I wish him luck as he embarks on his \nnext journey as the Governor of Kansas.\n\n\n                             James Bunning\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words of farewell to my \ncolleague from Kentucky, Senator Jim Bunning. We will both be retiring \nfrom this Chamber when this Congress concludes, and I wish him and his \nwife Mary Catherine, their sons and daughters and the rest of their \nfamily the very best in the future.\n  As we all know, prior to becoming a politician Jim Bunning was a \nworld-class baseball pitcher. He had a distinguished career primarily \nwith the Detroit Tigers and Philadelphia Phillies, during which he \nbecame the second pitcher in Major League history to record 1,000 \nstrikeouts and 100 wins in both the American and National Leagues. He \nwas inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1996.\n  Of course, after such a distinguished career he could have simply \nhung up his cleats, moved back to his home state of Kentucky, and \nenjoyed a quiet retirement with his family.\n  Instead, he decided to take the work ethic and competitive spirit \nthat drove\n\n[[Page S10390]]\n\nhim in baseball and use his energy to give back to his community as a \npublic servant. In 1977, he ran for and won a city council seat in Fort \nThomas, KY. He was then elected to the Kentucky State Senate in 1979. \nAfter serving in the State Senate as Republican leader, he ran to \nrepresent Kentucky's 4th Congressional District in 1986. He also won \nthat election, and served for 12 years in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives.\n  In 1998, Jim ran to replace Senator Wendell Ford, who was retiring. \nHe kept his winning streak alive, not only winning that initial Senate \ncontest, but also reelection in 2004. When he retires this year, Jim \nBunning will have amassed an impressive winning streak in politics, \njust as he did in baseball.\n  As you know, life in the U.S. Senate is about working out \ndisagreements through deliberation and debate. This process of \nlawmaking has served to ensure that the voices of a broad range of \nAmericans are heard as we work to craft the laws and policies we must \nultimately all abide by.\n  As a Senator, Jim Bunning has always stood up for his beliefs, and \nfought for what he thought was right. As a member of the Senate \nBanking, Budget, Energy, and Finance Committees, Senator Bunning has \nbeen a staunchly conservative voice on economic policy.\n  While he and I seldom have seen eye to eye on these matters, his deep \nconvictions have given voice to the concerns of citizens who share his \npoint of view, and thereby have helped to shape and enrich our debates \non the important questions we have faced over the years.\n  I wish him further success in whatever endeavors he pursues, as well \nas many happy, healthy years to come with his family.\n\n\n                             Russ Feingold\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a longtime colleague \nand friend of mine, Senator Russ Feingold, who will be leaving the \nSenate this January after 18 years of service. I would like to take \nthis opportunity to wish Russ and his family the very best as they \nembark on this new chapter in their lives.\n  Born and raised in the city of Janesville, WI, Russ has dedicated the \nbetter part of his career to serving the people of his home State. \nPrior to his first election to the U.S. Senate in 1992, Russ served as \na Wisconsin State senator for nearly a decade. Throughout his career in \npublic service, Russ has proven to be a passionate and articulate \nadvocate for the people of Wisconsin and their needs.\n  Since he first entered the Senate, Russ has perhaps become best-known \nas one of this body's most stalwart progressives. Indeed, on any number \nof issues, from campaign finance reform, to the Iraq war, to our work \ntogether during Senate consideration of legislation reauthorizing the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act, Russ has demonstrated a strong \ncommitment towards ensuring that respect for human rights, the rule of \nlaw, and democracy remain cornerstones of American policy, both at home \nand abroad.\n  Over the course of his three terms in the U.S. Senate, Russ has \nperhaps become most closely identified in the minds of many Americans \nwith his work on campaign finance reform with Senator McCain. In 2002, \nwhen the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill was being \nconsidered, Russ took a very courageous position in pushing legislation \nthat, at the time, was relatively unpopular with some of our colleagues \non both sides of the aisle. I was proud to join those efforts as the \nfloor manager of McCain-Feingold, and would like to express my \ngratitude to Russ for his strong and consistent leadership on that \nissue.\n  I have long appreciated Russ's strong, principled stands on those \nissues, and have welcomed the opportunity to work with him over the \nyears. I know that Russ's commitment to justice, fairness, and the rule \nof law will be missed come January, and I would once again like to wish \nhim the best as he leaves this institution.\n\n\n                              Byron Dorgan\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a longtime colleague \nand friend of mine Senator Byron Dorgan who will be retiring from the \nU.S. Senate when the 112th Congress convenes in January. I would like \nto take this moment to thank Byron for his service, and wish him, his \nwife, Kim, and the rest of his wonderful family the very best as they \nembark on this new chapter in their lives.\n  Byron has dedicated the better part of his adult life to serving the \npeople of his State. When he was just 26 years old, Byron became the \nyoungest constitutional officer in North Dakota history when he was \nappointed to serve as the State's Tax Commissioner. In 1980, Byron once \nagain demonstrated his commitment to public service when he was elected \nto the State's lone House seat. Twelve years later, after six terms in \nthe House, the people of North Dakota once again returned Byron to \nWashington, this time as their U.S. Senator.\n  Throughout his career in public service, Byron has been particularly \nvocal on issues related to U.S. agricultural policy. As a young man \ngrowing up in the small town of Regent, ND, Byron developed a strong \nappreciation for American farmers and ranchers and the important work \nthey do to keep our country fed. Indeed, Byron's own family worked in \nthe farm equipment business and raised cattle and horses. As a result, \nhe has been a consistent advocate for greater economic security and \nopportunity in rural America.\n  Since 2005, Byron has also served as chairman of the Senate \nDemocratic Policy Committee, where he has played an important role in \nhelping to craft the Senate Democratic policy agenda over the last \nseveral years. But after Byron leaves the Senate in just a few short \nweeks, I believe he will be remembered as a public servant who was \ndevoted first and foremost to advancing the interests of the people of \nhis beloved home State, North Dakota.\n  Once again, I would like to thank Byron for his many years of \nservice, and wish him well as he leaves the Senate. It has truly been a \npleasure working with him over the years, and I firmly believe that \nthis body will not be the same without him.\n\n\n                               Judd Gregg\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell to my colleague, a fellow \nNew Englander and Banking Committee member, the senior Senator from New \nHampshire, Judd Gregg.\n  It has been an honor and a pleasure serving with him in this body for \nthe past 18 years. As we both prepare to leave the Senate this year, I \nwould like to take this opportunity to wish him and his family the very \nbest in the future.\n  Throughout his tenure in the Senate, Senator Gregg has been an ardent \nadvocate for his home State of New Hampshire, and a knowledgeable \nlegislator. Time and again, during floor debate and committee \nproceedings, he has demonstrated his sharp intellect and deep knowledge \nof a broad range of issues--particularly on economic and budget policy.\n  He is a deeply committed public servant, who has been elected by the \npeople of New Hampshire to serve them for 9 years in the House of \nRepresentatives, for 4 years as Governor, and as their U.S. Senator for \nthe last 18 years. In fact, they returned him to the Senate in 2004 \nwith the highest number of votes in New Hampshire history. It is clear \nthat his constituents have a great deal of faith in this man, and \nduring his time in Congress, he has represented them and their values \nextremely well.\n  As one would expect from a man of New Hampshire, Senator Gregg has \nalways demonstrated his independence, commitment to hard work, and \nself-sufficiency. Yet he has also been someone that has sought \ncompromise and has been ready to collaborate with those willing to \ntackle the difficult problems facing our Nation.\n  In 2001, he was one of the lead Republicans working on the No Child \nLeft Behind law to improve education across the Nation for generations \nof Americans. In 2003, he and I worked together with Senator Ted \nKennedy, Senator Lamar Alexander, and Senator Susan Collins to craft \nthe Keeping Children and Families Safe Act, which updated our nation's \nlaws to meet the serious problem of child abuse.\n  Of course, improving education and ending child abuse are issues on \nwhich both liberals and conservatives broadly agree, so bipartisanship \nand collaboration on these matters is easy.\n  Of course, in the fall of 2008, our Nation was faced with a nearly \nunprecedented economic collapse--and the\n\n[[Page S10391]]\n\nviews of liberals and conservatives on how to respond could charitably \nbe described as divergent, at best.\n  It was at that moment, when our Nation faced a calamity of historical \nproportions, that Senator Gregg grit his teeth and set to work, \nnegotiating with me, Treasury Secretary Geithner, Federal Reserve \nChairman Bernanke, and others, to fashion a legislative response to the \ncrisis.\n  Despite the heavy criticism that came with being a party to those \ndiscussions, he remained a key negotiator, and in the end, the House \nand Senate approved the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. Today, \nour economy, though far from recovered, is far better off than it would \nhave been without this bill and many of the institutions which received \nassistance have repaid the Treasury with interest.\n  Let me be clear that was a bill that none of us ever, in our wildest \ndreams thought we would have to write, or vote to pass. However \ndistasteful, it would have been wrong to allow our financial system to \ngo into full cardiac arrest, with little chance of survival.\n  The politically expedient route to take would have been to walk away, \nvote against the bill, and join the pundits, commentators, and bloggers \nwho've said ``It never should have passed, and we would have been fine \nwithout it anyway.''\n  But that wouldn't be leadership. That wouldn't be statesmanship. And \nthat isn't the type of legislator that Judd Gregg is.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Gregg for his work as a member of \nthe Banking Committee. He joined the committee late in his tenure, but \nhis deep knowledge of the economy and expertise in financial matters \nwas greatly appreciated. He played an important role in helping to \ncraft what became the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \nProtection Act.\n  Though he was a staunch opponent of some of the bill's provisions, he \ndidn't see that opposition as an impediment to continuing to offer \nideas and thoughtful debate in order to shape the legislation into what \nhe thought was a better product.\n  Yet, as fierce a partisan as Senator Gregg is, he is also a \nconsummate legislator. He knows that the people of New Hampshire sent \nhim here to work hard, and work with the other members of this body. He \nhas shown that at the end of the day, even if you work hard on \nsomething, you may not be able to support it--but you will know that \nyou have done your best to advocate for your positions and shape the \ndebate.\n  The Senate will miss his knowledge and work ethic, and I hope that \nnewly elected members--of both parties--will follow his example.\n  I wish him, his wife Kathleen, his children and granddaughter the \nvery best.\n\n\n                             George LeMieux\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my colleague, the \nSenator from Florida, George LeMieux, who will be leaving the U.S. \nSenate before the 112th Congress convenes. I would like to take this \nmoment to thank George for his service, and wish him, his wife Meike, \nand their four children the very best as they embark on the next \nchapter of their lives.\n  George is a native Floridian who has served as deputy attorney \ngeneral, and later as Governor Charlie Crist's chief of staff.\n  When Senator Mel Martinez retired in 2009, George was appointed to \nfulfill the remainder of the term. Since then he has worked to help the \npeople of Florida through his work as a member of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, the Commerce Committee, and the Special Committee \non Aging.\n  Though he has only been in the Senate for a short time, Senator \nLeMieux has been an engaged and hard-working Member of this body. He \nhas emerged as a strong advocate for solving our long-term Federal debt \nconcerns, and a devoted advocate for the people and businesses of his \nhome State of Florida.\n  While we did not share the same views on a number of issues, Senator \nLeMieux proved that he was a man of deep conviction who was not afraid \nto stand up for what he believed. He spoke often on the floor to \nadvocate for his positions. However, he showed that he was a serious \nlegislator, and leader, on issues of vital importance to our Nation.\n  For example, he was the lone Republican to cast a vote in favor of \nthe Small Business Jobs Act. This legislation was designed to expand \naccess to credit, and provide tax incentives, for small businesses. \nGeorge recognized that these were two things that Florida's businesses \ndesperately needed--much more than partisan gridlock.\n  After George leaves the Senate in just a few short weeks, I believe \nhe will be remembered as a public servant who was devoted first and \nforemost to advancing the interests of the people of his home State, \nFlorida.\n  Once again, I would like to thank George for his service, and wish \nhim well as he leaves the Senate. It has been a pleasure working with \nhim.\n\n\n                             Arlen Specter\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor my friend and longtime \ncolleague, Senator Arlen Specter, the longest serving U.S. Senator in \nPennsylvania history.\n  As many of you know, Arlen and I were freshmen Senators together 30 \nyears ago. I was the only Democrat newly elected to the Senate in 1980. \nSenator Specter was one of 12 new Republicans elected that year, in the \nso-called ``Reagan Landslide,'' that gave his party the Senate for the \nfirst time in 28 years.\n  I bring this up because, even though I was a new Senator in the \nminority, we quickly began working on a bipartisan basis. For those \nlistening today, the idea of a bipartisan Senate may seem strange. Back \nthen, it was commonplace and I know that Arlen and I both hope that \nnewly elected Members of this body will revive this tradition in the \ncoming years.\n  Early in our Senate careers, Arlen and I started the Senate \nChildren's Caucus. We believed that as the largest nonvoting \nconstituency in the country, children had the greatest need for \nchampions to advocate on their behalf. The Children's Caucus has \nprovided strong leadership on early childhood education, funding for \nchildcare programs, and making passage of the Family Medical Leave Act \nreality. I want to thank Senator Specter for being one of my partners \non these critically important issues for almost 30 years.\n  Senator Specter's accomplishments carry beyond his defense of \nchildren. Over the course of his career, he has served as the chairman \nof three important and influential Senate committees: the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the \nCommittee on the Judiciary. In each of these capacities he has worked \nto ensure that America's legal system is true to our best traditions \nand ideals, while ensuring that we have the tools to prevent terrorism \nand protect our citizens. He has also used his role on the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation to increase research funding for the National Institutes of \nHealth. His work here in the United States Senate has improved the \nlives of countless Pennsylvanians and countless Americans.\n  Of all of Senator Specter's achievements, I have yet to mention the \nmost impressive: Since 2005, he has continued to serve while fighting \nHodgkin's lymphoma. Twice since being diagnosed, Arlen has undergone \nchemotherapy for the disease. Yet he continued serving the people of \nPennsylvania.\n  I have worked with Senator Specter both as a Democrat and a \nRepublican, and I can tell you this his commitment to bipartisanship \nand independence should be a model for all current and future Members \nof the U.S. Senate.\n  I would like to thank Arlen for his many years of service, and wish \nhim and his wife Joan well as he leaves the Senate. It has truly been a \npleasure working with him over the years. I know the State of \nPennsylvania will miss their senior Senator and I firmly believe that \nthis body will not be the same without him.\n\n\n                            George Voinovich\n\n  I rise today to honor Senator George Voinovich, my colleague from \nOhio who has served with me in this body for 12 years. Senator \nVoinovich has had a distinguished career in Ohio politics, spanning \nevery level of government. His work as a public servant began when he \nwas a bright young assistant attorney general, and has taken him \nthrough the Ohio House of Representatives, the mayor's office in \nCleveland, the Ohio Governor's Mansion and the U.S. Senate.\n\n[[Page S10392]]\n\n  Not only will Senator Voinovich be remembered for the more than four \ndecades of service to his fellow Ohioans but also for his \nbipartisanship. He was never afraid to put his beliefs ahead of party, \nopposing President Bush's $750 million tax cut proposal in 2003 for \nexample.\n  I was especially proud to work with Senator Voinovich on legislation \nto help ensure the United States' continued dominance in the world \naeronautics industry. Our bill, the Aeronautics Competitiveness Act of \n2007, increased research funding, technology transfer, and workforce \ndevelopment, all of which are vital to maintaining the United States' \ncompetitive edge. I was also proud to have served on the Foreign \nRelations committee with him for 5 years, working to strengthen the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO.\n  Senator Voinovich was known as the resident Senate ``debt hawk'' and \nhas long stood for fiscal responsibility at the local, State and \nFederal levels.\n  It has been a pleasure to serve with Senator Voinovich. As we depart \nthe Senate, I know this body will miss the presence of one of its more \nesteemed members and the people of Ohio will miss one of their most \ndedicated servants. I wish him and his wife Janet many more years of \nhappiness.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell to a number of \nour friends and colleagues who are ending their service in the Senate. \nTheir contributions are too numerous to mention, therefore I would like \nto take just a few minutes to highlight some of the memories of the \nSenators I came to know personally.\n  Some of the departing Senators I have served with for decades. Others \nwere here for only part of a term. All of them worked hard for their \nconstituents and our country.\n\n\n                              Ted Kaufman\n\n  Senator Ted Kaufman served for the past 2 years on my Senate \nSubcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the Federal \nWorkforce, and the District of Columbia.\n  Throughout Senator Kaufman's time with the subcommittee, he made a \nremarkable effort to honor the critical work of Federal employees. His \nregular statements on the Senate floor highlighting their work were an \ninspiration and I know were greatly appreciated by the dedicated \nFederal employees in Delaware and across this great Nation. I also \nappreciated Senator Kaufman's strong leadership on addressing \nlongstanding shortcomings in Presidential transition planning, \nculminating in the enactment of the Pre-Election Presidential \nTransition Act this year.\n\n\n                             Roland Burris\n\n  Senator Roland Burris served on the Senate Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, which I have the honor of chairing. Throughout his months with \nthe Committee, he made time in his busy schedule to attend and \nparticipate in numerous committee hearings and meetings. His \nparticipation played an important part in the committee's ability to \nconduct oversight and, ultimately, to improve benefits and care for our \nNation's veterans. Senator Burris's work on the committee was a great \nservice to the men and women of Illinois who wore the Nation's \nuniforms, as well as to servicemembers, veterans, and their families \nnationwide.\n\n\n                             Carte Goodwin\n\n  Senator Carte Goodwin handled a tough assignment and filled in like \nan experienced professional. He is a gentleman who knows about and \ncares for West Virginia deeply, so much so that he moved to Washington \nto serve and advocate for his State in an emergency situation. Senator \nGoodwin was friendly and cordial and made himself as helpful as \npossible during his short tenure.\n\n\n                            Blanche Lincoln\n\n  My good friend Senator Blanche Lincoln was a passionate advocate for \nArkansas throughout her Senate service. She is recognized as a fighter \nwho speaks her mind. She cares deeply about American families. She \nworked hard on her committee assignments. She has been a champion for \nfarmers, veterans, seniors, and Americans of all stripes. She can be \nproud of her service. I thank her for her contributions to this \ninstitution and her friendship.\n\n\n                               Evan Bayh\n\n  Senator Evan Bayh served with me on the Committees on Armed Services \nand Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. He showed his commitment to \nour national security when he took over the Armed Services Readiness \nSubcommittee at the beginning of this Congress. He was a strong \nmoderate voice for the people of Indiana.\n\n\n                             Arlen Specter\n\n  I served with Senator Arlen Specter for many years on the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee. He twice served as the committee's chairman, and, in \nrecent years as I chaired the committee, he remained a strong and vital \nforce working on behalf of our Nation's veterans, on both sides of the \ndais. He has been an institution in the Senate for many years, and it \nhas been a genuine pleasure working with him. I appreciate and applaud \nhis long, dedicated service to those who have worn our Nation's \nuniforms.\n\n\n                             Sam Brownback\n\n  I will miss my good friend Senator Sam Brownback. Despite sitting \nacross the aisle from me, he was always approachable and friendly. I \nknow him to be committed to helping people in Kansas and across the \ncountry. He felt so strongly about ending homelessness that I remember \nhim spending the night on the street with a group of homeless people to \nexperience first hand the obstacles they face. That is dedication. He \ncares about people. Senator Brownback should feel proud about all that \nhe has accomplished to make life better for people in our country.\n\n\n                             Russ feingold\n\n  I want to thank Senator Russ Feingold for his 18 years of service in \nthe U.S. Senate and his time in public service before that. Senator \nFeingold has worked with me as an outspoken advocate for so many of the \nissues that I hold dear, such as protecting Americans' personal privacy \nand good government.\n  In the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, there was \na rush of strong executive branch moves for authority. Senator Feingold \nrepeatedly joined me and other Members in ensuring civil liberties and \nprivacy protections of all Americans were observed. He was a leader in \nprotecting liberties during debate over reforming the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act. When the Department of Homeland Security \nwas established, we worked to ensure that it had a strong official \ndedicated to protecting privacy. In 2007 I authored the POWER Act, \nwhich provided the Homeland Security Chief Privacy Officer with \nadditional powers, and Senator Feingold was a strong supporter, \ncosponsoring that bill which then became law in 2008.\n  I must also mention how proud I was to support Senator Feingold on \nperhaps his most lasting accomplishment--campaign finance reform. The \nelection process can be opaque, and it is full of more money than ever. \nHowever, in the last decade, many of the new campaign finance rules \nchampioned by Senator Feingold have curbed many abuses which used to be \ncommon. While much work is left to be done in this area, especially \nwith the recent Citizens United ruling, this country and voters owe a \ntremendous thank-you to Senator Feingold.\n\n\n                              Byron Dorgan\n\n  It has been a pleasure to serve with Senator Byron Dorgan of North \nDakota, and I will miss him greatly. I have had the honor to work \nalongside Senator Dorgan on two committees of great importance to both \nof our States, the Committee on Indian Affairs and the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Senator Dorgan and I served on the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs \ntogether beginning in the 104th Congress. During his tenure as chairman \nduring the last 4 years, I saw firsthand the leadership skills and \ncompassion he possesses. Chairman Dorgan has shown his dedication to \nall of our Nation's indigenous people: American Indians, Alaska \nNatives, and Native Hawaiians. Thank you Senator Dorgan for your \nefforts to improve the quality of life for America's native people.\n  I am grateful that Chairman Dorgan has been a strong ally to Hawaii's \nindigenous people, the Native Hawaiian people. He has stood with \nSenator Daniel Inouye and me as we have worked to have the United \nStates fulfill its obligations to all of its Native people, including \nNative Hawaiians. Mahalo, Chairman Dorgan, for your aloha to the people \nof Hawaii.\n\n[[Page S10393]]\n\n  Senator Dorgan is a great statesman and a gentleman who has served \nthe people of North Dakota in the U.S. Congress for three decades. \nDuring our combined service on the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources, I repeatedly saw Senator Dorgan's passion for the people of \nNorth Dakota as he worked to make his State a pioneer in renewable \nenergy efforts. For those of us who serve in the Senate, we work \ntirelessly to advance the needs of not only our home States, but the \nwhole Nation. Senator Dorgan has proven himself both a great North \nDakotan and a great American.\n  The Senate will be a much different place without his leadership, and \nI know that I am joined by many of my colleagues in wishing him many \nsuccesses in the future. Many of my constituents in Hawaii will miss \nhis leadership just as his own constituents in North Dakota will.\n  Mahalo for your friendship and for your service to our Nation. On \nbehalf of Millie and our family, I send our aloha to you and Kim and \nyour family. We wish you the best as you begin a new chapter in your \nlives.\n\n\n                               Chris Dodd\n\n  I am proud to express my great appreciation and gratitude for Senator \nChris Dodd's service to our country. He brought extraordinary \nleadership to the Senate that enabled us to make meaningful \nimprovements to the education and economic security of Americans.\n  I traveled with Senator Dodd to South America early in my tenure here \nin the Senate. Although I enjoy traveling, each time I go abroad I \nworry about my ability to communicate with my foreign hosts. But, on \nthat trip, the language barrier was not an issue because, as I quickly \nfound out, Senator Dodd is fluent in Spanish.\n  Senator Dodd recognizes the importance of language skills and \ncultural knowledge, not only to survive in the world but to prosper in \nit. I have truly appreciated his great respect for other cultures and \npassion for learning. Senator Dodd has lent tremendous support to my \nnational foreign language coordination bill, which aims to equip \nAmericans with foreign language skills and knowledge of other cultures. \nIt is just one example of Senator Dodd's outstanding work to provide \nour children with the knowledge and skills they need to achieve \nprosperity and economic security.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Dodd for his leadership in the \n111th Congress. We are making historic and substantial improvements to \nthe health care delivery system and the regulation of our financial \nsystem, and neither would have been possible without Senator Dodd's \nguidance, persistence, good judgment, and support.\n  Senator Dodd has been selfless and generous in his efforts to \nincrease access to health care services everywhere in our country, \nincluding Hawaii. I am grateful that Senator Dodd has always recognized \nthe unique health care needs and challenges of my home State. His \ncontributions have been vital to the protection of Hawaii's system of \nemployer-provided health insurance and ensuring that health care \nproviders in Hawaii are more capable of meeting the uncompensated costs \nof providing care for the poor and uninsured.\n  I am proud to have served alongside Chairman Dodd on the Senate \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, where he has been a \ntireless leader and an outstanding consumer advocate. The Dodd-Frank \nWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act rightfully bears his \nname because no one has done more to educate, protect, and empower \nconsumers and investors. Through his support, the act makes significant \ninvestments in financial literacy and education, and it provides \nmeaningful disclosures and protections that will allow consumers to \nmake better financial decisions. Americans are now better protected \nagainst abusive, predatory, and anticonsumer business practices than \nthey were because of Senator Dodd's unmatched contributions. Senator \nDodd is a great champion of consumers, investors, and financial \nliteracy, and I am honored and humbled to have had the opportunity to \nwork together with him on the Banking Committee.\n  Since I joined the Senate 20 years ago, Senator Dodd has been a great \ncolleague and ally. More importantly, he is kind, generous, \ntrustworthy, and a loving family man, and I am proud to call him my \nbrother and my friend. Although I am saddened to bid him farewell \ntoday, I wish Senator Dodd well in all of his future endeavors.\n  Before I close, I would also like to thank and applaud Senator Dodd's \nfamily Jackie, Grace, and Christina. They have been a source of \nstrength, happiness, and calm for their husband and father.\n  Mahalo nui loa, Chris, for your service and friendship. Millie and I \nsend our warmest aloha to you and your family, and we wish you well as \nyou begin this new chapter of your lives together.\n\n\n                            George Voinovich\n\n  Finally, I would like to pay tribute to my dear friend and brother, \nSenator George Voinovich, as he prepares to retire from public life \nafter more than 40 years of dedicated public service.\n  Senator Voinovich's retirement is a sad occasion for me, and it is \ndifficult to put into words what Senator Voinovich's friendship has \nmeant to me over the years. Senator Voinovich and I have worked so well \ntogether on the Senate Subcommittee on Oversight of Government \nManagement, the Federal Workforce, and the District of Columbia for \nmany years, where we have both had the honor of serving as chairman. It \nhas truly been a pleasure to serve with him as we have addressed so \nmany difficult government management issues.\n  Senator Voinovich's background as the Governor of Ohio and the mayor \nof the city of Cleveland provided him with a unique perspective on the \nFederal Government's management and workforce challenges, and I believe \nhis vast experience made our subcommittee more effective. On a light \nnote, I know that one of Senator Voinovich's proudest moments as \nGovernor was watching his beloved Cleveland baseball team reach the \nWorld Series for the first time in over 40 years. I am sure that \nSenator Voinovich will enjoy having more time to spend in his hometown \nof Cleveland during his retirement.\n  Senator Voinovich can take his grandchildren to see parks, buildings, \nand other improvements he helped bring about in Ohio during his time as \nmayor and Governor, but there are few similar opportunities in Federal \nGovernment oversight and management. The tough management issues we \nhave tackled seldom make front-page news. But that is what makes \nSenator Voinovich remarkable he chose to focus on the details of the \ngovernment's toughest management challenges rather than more glamorous \nissues.\n  Like me, Senator Voinovich has always recognized that the Federal \nGovernment's most valuable resource is its workforce of dedicated men \nand women. I often refer to him as the ``father of human capital.'' We \nhave worked closely together on a large number of workforce \ninitiatives, with the common goal of making the Federal Government the \nemployer of choice in this country. I am especially proud of our work \nto reform the broken Federal hiring process. I will keep fighting in \nCongress for our bill--the Federal Hiring Process Improvement Act, S. \n736. In the meantime, I am pleased that our joint oversight on this \nissue has spurred considerable progress in the executive branch.\n  Senator Voinovich and I also worked together on an amendment to last \nyear's National Defense Authorization Act, which included my Non-\nForeign Area Retirement Equity Assurance Act, along with several other \nFederal workforce provisions. I cannot overstate how much Senator \nVoinovich's support for providing retirement equity has meant to the \nthousands of Federal employees in my home State of Hawaii.\n  Senator Voinovich simply has too many Federal workforce \naccomplishments to discuss all of them today. However, I would like to \npoint out that he authored the Federal Workforce Flexibility Act to \nmodernize Federal human capital planning, pay, and benefits; the \nFederal Employee Student Loan Assistance Act; the Senior Executive \nService Performance Improvement Act; and many other important bills \nthat have improved the government's ability to provide services.\n  In addition to his focus on important workforce issues, Senator \nVoinovich\n\n[[Page S10394]]\n\nhas worked tirelessly on complicated management challenges. Our \nsubcommittee has held a total of seven hearings on reforming the \nsecurity clearance process. This work has been a tremendous success, \neliminating the clearance backlog, dramatically reducing processing \ntimes, and improving investigation quality. These improvements enhance \nour national security and help the Federal Government hire the right \npeople for the right jobs.\n  I am also proud of our work together in establishing Chief Management \nOfficers at the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. It is vital that we maintain strong focus on management at \nthese critical departments. I could easily point to so many other \nthings that Senator Voinovich has accomplished during his Senate \nservice.\n  I want to express my deep appreciation to Senator Voinovich for his \nfriendship and partnership over the years. He has been a model public \nservant, and our country is a better and safer place because of his \nwork. I wish Senator Voinovich, his lovely wife Janet, and his entire \nfamily joy and happiness during his richly deserved retirement.\n  In closing, the end of this Congress is bittersweet, with so many \ntalented and dedicated public servants leaving this institution. All of \nthem made a lasting impact on the Senate and on our country. Mahalo nui \nloa, thank you, for all your work.\n\n\n                              Jim Bunning\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my \ncolleague, Senator Jim Bunning. After 12 years in the U.S. Senate, \nSenator Bunning is retiring from this chamber at the end of this \nsession.\n  Jim has led a remarkable life. As a baseball fan, I am especially \nenvious of his first career as a Major League pitcher. He was a \nclassic, hard-nosed competitor, which foreshadowed his style as a \npublic servant later in life. My favorite story about Senator Bunning's \nbaseball career is that he was the only pitcher to strike out Ted \nWilliams three times in a single game. He is also one of only seven \npitchers to throw a perfect game and a no-hitter. Senator Bunning \nretired from the sport in 1971 with 2,855 career strikeouts, which, at \nthe time, was the second highest total of all-time. He was rightfully \ninducted into the Hall of Fame in 1996.\n  Following his outstanding baseball career, Jim went into politics. \nAnd, once again, he was a winner. He has held office at the local, \nState, and Federal level. After serving Kentucky's 4th District for 12 \nyears in the House of Representatives, Senator Bunning began his \nservice in this Chamber in 1999. I have served with him on the Budget \nand Finance committees, and have always known him to freely speak his \nmind and ask tough questions. He remained true to the fierce style he \nfirst demonstrated as a young pitcher who was not afraid to brush back \na hitter.\n  Nor was Senator Bunning intimidated by the often arcane and technical \nissues we confronted as members of the Finance Committee. Over the \nyears we have served there as colleagues, we have worked productively \non a wide range of legislative proposals that included the taxation of \nlife insurance companies, shortening the depreciation period for farm \nequipment, and capital gains treatment for songwriters, just to name a \nfew. He was always willing to reach across the aisle to help achieve a \ncommon objective a longstanding Finance Committee tradition.\n  Senator Bunning will now enter a new phase in his life, and I am \ncertain he will now have the luxury of spending time with his wonderful \nfamily. Jim has the good fortune of being married to his childhood \nsweetheart, Mary. They met in grade school, and I am impressed that Jim \nknew at such a young age that he found a truly special person. I find \nMary to be an absolutely lovely woman and admire their lasting love for \neach other. Mary is the mother of their nine children, and Jim and Mary \nnow share 40 grandchildren. I wish Jim, Mary, and their entire family \nmany years of health and happiness.\n\n\n                            BLANCHE LINCOLN\n\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor today to recognize one of our \ndeparting colleagues, the senior Senator from Arkansas, Mrs. Blanche \nLambert Lincoln.\n  A 7th generation Arkansan and a native of Helena, AR, Senator Lincoln \ngrew up on a cotton and rice farm. She spoke often of her experiences \non the farm, and fondly recalled how she was a farmer's daughter. It \nwas her experience helping her father work the land that taught her the \nsame core values she brought to the Senate--honesty, fairness, hard \nwork, and common sense.\n  Senator Lincoln is the kind of colleague you want to have in the \nSenate. She is pragmatic. She is rational. And she is reasonable. If \nyou ever had an issue with her you needed to resolve, you could count \non her to be someone you could work with. In fact, she is well known as \nsomeone who tried to bridge the partisan divide. She even cofounded and \ncochaired an organization dedicated to working across the aisle to \nbridge differences and create practical solutions.\n  Senator Lincoln first came to Congress in 1992 as a Representative \nfor Arkansas's First Congressional District, serving two terms. \nFollowing the birth of her twin boys, Reece and Bennett, she made a \nsuccessful run for the Senate in 1998.\n  During her time here in the Senate, she served her home State of \nArkansas with great distinction, serving in the same seat as the late \nSenator Hattie Caraway, the first woman ever elected to the Senate. \nLike Senator Caraway, who also made history for being the first woman \never to be chairman of a Senate committee, Senator Lincoln made history \nin 2009 by becoming the first woman in the 184-year history of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee to be named chairman.\n  Senator Lincoln and I were able to collaborate on many issues during \nher time in the Senate because we served together on two committees--\nAgriculture and Finance. On the Agriculture Committee, she was a fierce \nadvocate for her State's agriculture interests, particularly rice and \ncotton producers. Since farm bills tend to be more regional than party \ndriven, she always represented her producers with vigor. She was a key \nplayer in the 2002 and 2008 farm bills, both of which have been widely \npopular throughout the countryside in the North and the South.\n  She also looked out for those who are less fortunate, making hunger \nin our country a signature issue of hers. This year she pushed through \nthe Senate a landmark bill to improve school lunch programs. The child \nnutrition reauthorization bill she authored contains almost 10 times \nmore new funding than the 2004 child nutrition reauthorization. It \nincludes $3.2B for the first school lunch program base-level \nreimbursement increase since 1973. I hope the House will follow the \nSenate's lead and pass this important bill yet this year.\n  She also served as the chair of Rural Outreach for the Senate \nDemocratic Caucus. It was in this role that we collaborated to \nintroduce the Rural Revitalization Act, a bill to boost the economy in \nrural America in the wake of the recent recession. This bill made \nsignificant investments in rural development priorities, including \ninfrastructure projects, energy programs, housing assistance and rural \nhealth care.\n  Senator Lincoln also has been a champion for rural health care issues \nas a valued member of the Senate Rural Health Caucus. During her time \nin the Senate, she successfully fought to protect small businesses, \nhealth care providers, and, most importantly, seniors in rural \ncommunities. Because of Senator Lincoln's dedication, critical \nimprovements to the Medicare Program were enacted into law. In \nparticular, senior women now have improved access to bone density \ntests, osteoporosis screenings, and other preventive services.\n  Senator Lincoln also authored the Elder Justice Act, legislation \nenacted into law this year which authorizes new efforts to prevent, \ndetect, treat, and prosecute elder abuse and exploitation. Her work as \na lead author of the SHOP Act led to the adoption of tax credits and \nsmall business health insurance exchanges in health reform. These \nlegislative accomplishments and many others will leave this country \nwith a lasting legacy of Senator Lincoln's commitment to improving the \nhealth of Arkansans and of all Americans.\n\n[[Page S10395]]\n\n  On the Finance Committee, Senator Lincoln was a strong and effective \nadvocate for working families. She worked hard to make sure that the \nfull child tax credit was available to as many low-earning workers with \nchildren as possible. She knows how valuable that benefit is for \nparents who really have to struggle to support their families.\n  Senator Lincoln and I share a commitment to promoting savings for \nretirement. She shares my concern that retirement income security is a \ngrowing challenge for the baby boomers who are beginning to head into \nretirement right now as well as the generations that are following. An \nimportant focus for her has been the promotion of employee stock \nownership plans, which not only help small businesses--including many \nsuccessful ones in my State of North Dakota--to grow but also help the \nemployee-owners build a separate pool of retirement savings that they \ncan use during their retirement years.\n  It is unfortunate that we are losing such a capable and pragmatic \ncolleague as Senator Lincoln. It will be sad to see the Senate without \nher next year, but I know nothing but good things await her in her \nfuture. I wish her the best.\n\n\n                             Russ Feingold\n\n  I would like to pay tribute and recognize the accomplishments of my \ngood friend Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, who will be leaving the \nSenate at the end of this session.\n  Senator Feingold has faithfully served the people of Wisconsin for \nthe last 28 years, serving three terms in the Wisconsin State Senate \nand three terms in the U.S. Senate. During all of that time, he has \nnever forgotten who put him in office. Every year, Senator Feingold has \nheld listening sessions in all 72 counties of Wisconsin. The input he \nreceived in those sessions was his guide for every issue he worked on \nin the Senate.\n  Russ Feingold has also been guided by his tremendous intellect. After \ngrowing up in Janesville, WI, he graduated from the University of \nWisconsin-Madison and went on to receive a Rhodes Scholarship from \nOxford University and a law degree from Harvard Law School.\n  To say that Senator Feingold has been independent-minded in the \nSenate is an understatement. He has been a true maverick. He never let \nparty or political pressure influence his efforts here.\n  The clearest example of this was his work on campaign finance reform \nwith Republican Senator John McCain. After years of struggle, the \nBipartisan Campaign Reform Act, known to most as the McCain-Feingold \nAct, was enacted in 2002. Although the Act continues to evolve and face \nchallenges, it will forever change the landscape of political campaigns \nin this country. And Senator Feingold has led other efforts to promote \nclean government, such as moving to electronic filing of campaign \nfinance reports and fighting against lobbyists' gifts to lawmakers.\n  Senator Feingold has also been an independent voice in the area of \nforeign policy. He spoke out eloquently against the Iraq war and was \none of 21 Democratic Senators to vote against the Iraq war resolution. \nAnd, as a member of the Intelligence Committee and chairman of the \nForeign Relations Africa Subcommittee, his opinion on matters related \nto Africa have carried an added weight.\n  Of course, I have known Senator Feingold best from his work with me \non the Senate Budget Committee. Since he joined the panel in 1997, he \nhas been a powerful voice on the committee for fiscal responsibility. \nHe was one of the leading advocates for restoring the paygo, or pay-as-\nyou-go, requirement to ensure any new mandatory spending or tax cuts \nare fully paid for. And, in 2009, he introduced a comprehensive Control \nSpending Now Act, including several important spending reforms that \nhave since been adopted.\n  It has been a true honor to serve alongside Senator Russ Feingold. He \nhas made a tremendous contribution to this body, to his State of \nWisconsin, and to our Nation. He will certainly be missed. I wish him \nall the best in his future endeavors.\n\n\n                                Kit Bond\n\n  Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues in paying tribute to \nSenator Bond as he prepares to leave the Senate.\n  Senator Bond and I came to the Senate together in 1987. While we have \nnot seen eye to eye on some issues, I have admired his passion and \nconvictions as he worked to faithfully represent his State.\n  Even before coming to the Senate, Senator Bond had a distinguished \ncareer in public service for the State of Missouri serving as assistant \nattorney general, State auditor, and later as Governor. He cares deeply \nabout his home State, which is evidenced by his long list of \naccomplishments in the Senate--a robust highway bill, targeted \ninvestments in public housing and infrastructure, and a strong national \ndefense to name just a few.\n  Senator Bond and I have long shared a common interest in the Missouri \nRiver. Though we disagree on how it should be managed and the ability \nof our State's to utilize this resource, I have enormous respect for my \ncolleague for his passion in defending Missouri's claims to this \nresource.\n  In particular, I deeply appreciated Senator Bond's work with me on \nthe Dakota Water Resources Act. This legislation was critical for the \neconomic future of North Dakota. During discussions on the bill, he was \na tenacious advocate for his State's interests. His diligence in \nrepresenting his State, coupled with his willingness to gain a better \nunderstanding of the water needs of my State, ultimately helped us \nreach a compromise acceptable to both States. The people of Missouri \ncan be proud of his work fighting for their interests.\n  Senator Bond has been a man of his word who served his State and \ncountry with distinction. I wish him well in his future endeavors.\n\n\n                            George Voinovich\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize our \nretiring colleague from Ohio, Senator George Voinovich.\n  George Voinovich has led a remarkable life of public service, \nstretching across all levels of government. Beginning in 1963, Senator \nVoinovich has made the people of Ohio his priority, serving as an \nassistant attorney general in Ohio, a member of the Ohio House of \nRepresentatives, Cuyahoga County commissioner, Lieutenant Governor of \nOH, Mayor of Cleveland, Governor of Ohio, and finally, U.S. Senator.\n  Throughout his career, Senator Voinovich has been a steady hand, \nguiding Ohio through difficult times. As mayor, he led the city of \nCleveland out of bankruptcy and mismanagement through smart budgeting \nand pragmatic governing. As Governor, he led Ohio out of a recession \nand into more prosperous times, holding the State budget's growth to \nits lowest level in 30 years and overseeing the state's lowest \nunemployment rate in 25 years.\n  As Senator, he continued his commitment to fiscal responsibility, \nfocusing on this country's exploding debt and long-term challenges. \nSenator Voinovich also fought for reform of our tax and entitlement \nsystems as author of the SAFE Commission Act and cosponsor of the \nConrad-Gregg Bipartisan Task Force for Fiscal Responsibility Act. \nWarning about our Nation's fiscal crisis at a Budget Committee hearing \nin 2009, he testified courageously: ``We must find a compromise and we \nmust act now. Many people believe that this generation of Americans \nwill be the first whose standard of living will be less than those \nbefore them. Our failure to act now will guarantee that they are \nright.'' With Senator Voinovich's retirement, the Senate is losing one \nof its strongest and clearest voices on the importance of fiscal \nresponsibility today to keep our country strong and growing into the \nfuture.\n  I was also pleased to join with Senator Voinovich in introducing the \nTruth in Budgeting Act. Our bill would have put a stop to the fiscally \nreckless practice of using trust fund surpluses to pay for tax cuts and \nother spending priorities. Senator Voinovich always recognized that our \ncurrent fiscal policies are putting future generations in the position \nof having to borrow trillions of dollars to make good on our Social \nSecurity, Medicare and other commitments.\n  I have always respected his commitment to principle and his \nwillingness to take independent positions, regardless of popularity or \npolitical expedience. He has rejected the knee-jerk partisan politics \nthat unfortunately\n\n[[Page S10396]]\n\nhave taken hold of Washington over the past decade, opting instead for \nreasonable, level-headed discourse. Always willing to reach across the \naisle, Senator Voinovich has spent his 12 years in the Senate being an \nhonest broker and a true public servant. He will be greatly missed.\n  I wish a happy and healthy retirement to George and his wife of 47 \nyears, Janet, and congratulate him on an outstanding career.\n\n\n                               judd gregg\n\n  Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to pay tribute to \nSenator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, who will be leaving the Senate at \nthe end of this session.\n  Although I am happy for Judd and his wife Kathy, as they set off on \nthe next stage of their lives, Judd's retirement represents a great \nloss for the U.S. Senate, for the people of New Hampshire, for the \nentire Nation, and for me personally.\n  Simply put, Judd has been an outstanding public servant. He has \nworked tirelessly and effectively on behalf of his State, first as a \nCongressman, then as Governor, and then as a Senator. The people of New \nHampshire rewarded his faithful service by repeatedly electing him by \nwide margins. When he was reelected to the Senate in 2004, Judd \nreceived the highest number of votes in New Hampshire history.\n  Judd has been a true leader in the Senate. Few Members have the \nbreadth of knowledge and insight that he holds on the key issues that \ncome before this body. Whether it be the budget, education policy, or \nbanking reform, he has been at the center of the debate, and Members on \nboth sides of the aisle seek out and respect his judgment.\n  I have come to know Judd best for his work on the Budget Committee. \nHe has been on the committee for all of the 18 years he has been in the \nSenate. He served as chairman in 2005 and 2006, after Senator Nickles \nretired, and has been the ranking member ever since.\n  I could not have asked for a better partner on the committee. It has \nbeen a pleasure to work closely with him. Our staffs have also worked \nvery well together, which is a testament to the leadership of Judd and \nthe example he set in his work with me.\n  And Judd has tremendous integrity. His word is his bond.\n  Although we haven't always agreed on policy, Judd has always upheld \nthe highest standards of the Senate by knowing how to disagree without \nbeing disagreeable. We have had fierce debates over the years, but we \nhave never let that affect our ability to work together.\n  Of course, the highlight of our work together came in our legislative \neffort to adopt a bipartisan fiscal task force to address the country's \nlong-term debt crisis. That joint effort was truly one of the most \nrewarding experiences of my career in the Senate. I will never forget \nthe days we spent discussing the proposal during a trip in 2006.\n  While we were not able to pass our legislation in the Senate, our \neffort resulted in the creation of the President's fiscal commission. \nIt has been an honor to work alongside Judd in this fight. Like me, \nJudd cares deeply about our nation's fiscal future and understands the \ndanger of rising Federal debt. He has been a tenacious advocate of \nfiscal discipline and putting the budget on a sustainable long-term \npath.\n  Judd is a true-blue fiscal conservative. But that has never stopped \nhim from reaching across the aisle to work with Democrats. In addition \nto working with me, Judd teamed up with Senator Ted Kennedy in 2001 to \nco-author the No Child Left Behind Act. More recently, he teamed up \nwith Senator Wyden to write the first major bipartisan tax reform \nlegislation in decades, the Bipartisan Tax Fairness and Simplification \nAct.\n  Notably, Judd also played a key role in the bipartisan negotiations \nthat led to the creation of the TARP legislation. TARP was widely \ncriticized during this past election season, but the results are now \nin, and it is clear that the TARP program was successful in stabilizing \nthe financial sector and helping to prevent the economy from dipping \ninto a full-blown depression. The success of the program and the \nrepayments now coming into the Treasury can be attributed, at least in \npart, to Judd's insistence on including provisions in the legislation \nto protect American taxpayers.\n  Finally, Judd's retirement means more to me than just losing a great \npartner on the Budget Committee. I am also losing a great friend. At a \ntime when Washington is filled with so much partisan rancor and \ndisagreement, we need more individuals from across the aisle to form \nfriendships like ours.\n  Judd, I wish you all the best in your retirement. You will truly be \nmissed.\n\n\n                              Bob Bennett\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in appreciation and \nadmiration of Senator Bob Bennett.\n  Senator Bennett understood the perspectives of America's small \nbusiness owners. After all, he was one of them. As CEO of Franklin \nQuest, Bob grew the company from 4 employees to over 1,000. During his \ntenure the firm became one of the best known providers of time \nmanagement seminars and products, and became listed on the New York \nStock Exchange.\n  Reducing obstacles for small business owners has been one of Senator \nBennett's top priorities in Washington. In his first 6 months of \nservice, he took to the floor to identify three ways the Federal \nGovernment was growing at the expense of the entrepreneur. Those three \nobstacles--increased regulation, increased taxation, and increased \ndifficulty in capital formation--remain challenges to job creators \ntoday, and Bob has never stopped voicing their concerns.\n  Senator Bennett was elected to the U.S. Senate from his beloved State \nof Utah, which his father, Senator Wallace Bennett, represented for \nmany years. And by the time I was elected to the Chamber, Senator \nBennett had already been one of the ``wise ones'' in his own right for \nmany years. I have long admired Bob's sincere appreciation and respect \nfor the traditions and history of the Senate--to which he and his \nfather have both contributed tremendously.\n  Throughout his service here in Washington, Bob's family has helped \nkeep him grounded--all 6 children and 20 grandchildren. Sandy and I \nwish the best for Bob and his wife Joyce.\n\n\n                             Sam Brownback\n\n  Mr. President, I join my colleagues in appreciation and admiration of \nSenator Sam Brownback.\n  Sam's commitment to public service grew out of the farmlands where he \nwas raised and where his parents still reside. As a student, Sam earned \nthe respect of his peers as State president of the Future Farmers of \nAmerica and student body president at Kansas State University. The \npeople of Kansas have put their trust in Sam multiple times: as their \nSecretary of Agriculture, as one of their members in the House of \nRepresentatives, and for 14 years in the U.S. Senate.\n  Sam drew upon his experience in Kansas to shape legislation here in \nWashington. He offered legislation to create more opportunity for \nAmerica's farmers, and to reduce foreign trade barriers to their \nproducts. In time Sam rose to become a leader on the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, as well as the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee.\n  Sam also has a heart for victims of disease and human rights \nviolations all over the world. He proposed incentives for drug \ncompanies to offer discounts for life-savings medications for people of \ndeveloping nations. He boldly called for the end to human rights \nviolations in Darfur and Iran. I have been proud to stand with him on \nnumerous pieces of human rights legislation, including the Iran \nDemocratic Transition Act in this Congress.\n  Sam's tenure in the Senate has come to an end, but not his service to \nthe people of Kansas. They overwhelmingly called him back home to serve \nas their Governor, and begin the next chapter in his remarkable career. \nSandy and I wish him and his family all the best.\n\n\n                               Judd Gregg\n\n  Mr. President, today I would like to join with my colleagues in \nappreciation and admiration of Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire.\n  Judd is a native of New Hampshire and after practicing as an attorney \nin Nashua, where he was born, he began a devoted career of public \nservice to his State. Before coming to the Senate, Judd served as a \nmember of his State's executive council, as a Representative, and then \non to become, as his father Hugh Gregg had been before him, Governor of \nthe Granite State.\n\n[[Page S10397]]\n\n  Judd was a successful and accomplished Governor. When he left Concord \nto join the Senate, he left his State with not only a balanced budget \nbut a surplus as well. His leadership and record of fiscal \nresponsibility has served as an example for our entire Nation to \nfollow.\n  His expertise on budgetary and fiscal issues has benefitted all his \nfellow Senators on the Budget Committee. As both chairman and ranking \nmember of the committee, Judd put together both excellent staff and the \nresources necessary to advance our goals of cutting spending, balancing \nthe budget, and reducing our nation's debt. With steps such as his \nsuccessful sponsorship of the fiscal year 2006 budget resolution, which \nreduced mandatory spending for the first time in years, hard-working \nAmerican taxpayers have saved billions thanks to Senator Gregg's \nefforts.\n  Senator Gregg and I worked hard together in fighting to reduce our \ngovernment's burden on taxpayers and the excessive spending that fuels \nit. We have both fought hard for our government to take our financial \nfuture seriously and to make the tough decisions necessary for it to be \nsecured for our generation and for many more to come.\n  I would like to thank Senator Gregg again for his leadership on these \nimportant issues, and his extensive service to the people of New \nHampshire. My wife Sandy and I wish Senator Gregg, his wife Kathy, and \ntheir family all the best.\n\n\n                                Kit Bond\n\n  Mr. President, I join my colleagues in appreciation and admiration of \nSenator Kit Bond. Kit has been a faithful public servant to the people \nof Missouri for many years. I feel privileged to have had the \nopportunity to serve alongside him in the U.S. Senate.\n  Before being elected to this body, Kit made a strong impression as a \nstudent, a lawyer, and a public servant. He graduated Cum Laude from \nPrinceton University, and was first in his law school class at the \nUniversity of Virginia. He practiced law as an assistant attorney \ngeneral for the State of Missouri under John Danforth, who himself was \na future Senator from the ``Show-Me State.'' His colleagues at that \ntime included John Ashcroft, who also went on to serve in this Chamber, \nand future Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.\n  Kit often jokes that he transitioned from the second most hated \ncareer--a lawyer--to the first: a politician. The people of Missouri \nhave repeatedly affirmed that he made the right choice. They elected \nhim to be their State Auditor. They elected him as the youngest \nGovernor in Missouri's history. And they have elected him four times to \nrepresent them in the U.S. Senate.\n  Senator Bond brought many of his passions as Governor to this \nChamber, including his longtime support for Missouri's successful \nParents as Teachers Program. He also kept a special place in his heart \nfor issues relating to children. In time he rose to become a senior \nmember of the Appropriations Committee as well as the Environment and \nPublic Works Committees.\n  Senator Bond and I worked most closely together on issues relating to \nnational defense and foreign affairs. In this Congress alone, he and I \njointly introduced the Military Voting Protection Act of 2009, the Iran \nDemocratic Transition Act of 2010, and a resolution affirming Israel's \nright to self-defense. His leadership as vice chairman of the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence has been a lasting contribution to the \nsecurity of our Nation,\n  Kit has helped shape legislation that will govern our Nation for \nyears to come, but his spirit is what I will miss the most. As he has \nsaid: ``Serving Missouri has been my life's work. I have walked the \nland, fished its rivers and been humbled by the honesty and hard work \nof our people. The highest honor is to receive and safeguard the public \ntrust.''\n  In his retirement, Kit will now have the opportunity to focus his \ntime on his other loves: his wife Linda, his son Sam, and his new \ndaughter-in-law Margaret. The Mizzou Tigers and the St. Louis Cardinals \nwill also likely see him in the stands more often. Sandy and I wish \nboth Kit and Linda the very best as they continue their journey \ntogether.\n\n\n                              Jim Bunning\n\n  Mr. President, I join my colleagues in appreciation and admiration of \nSenator Jim Bunning.\n  Millions of American baseball fans know Jim as one of the most \naccomplished athletes of his generation. Jim pitched for both the \nDetroit Tigers and Philadelphia Phillies during his 17-year career. He \nwas the second pitcher in history to notch 100 wins and strike out \n1,000 batters in both the American and National Leagues, and when he \nretired he was second on the all-time strikeout list. His impressive \ncareer earned him a spot in the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n  While he wore the uniforms of teams in Michigan and Pennsylvania, \nJim's heart never left his native Kentucky. Six years after retiring \nfrom baseball, Jim decided to run for public office and won a city \ncouncil seat in Fort Thomas, KY. He was later elected to the Kentucky \nState Senate and became the Republican leader. Kentuckians then elected \nJim to the U.S. House of Representatives for the 4th District of \nKentucky where he served until 1998. During his time in the House, Jim \ncommitted himself to defending Social Security as chairman of the \nSocial Security Subcommittee. His unwavering stance on protecting \nSocial Security contributed to the establishment of the Social Security \nAdministration as a separate agency.\n  Jim was elected to the Senate in 1998 and quickly became a strong \nvoice for fiscal responsibility. He became the first native Kentuckian \non the Finance Committee in 40 years, and also served on the Budget \nCommittee--and in both capacities I had the opportunity to work with \nhim. Jim also served as chairman of the Banking Committee's Economic \nPolicy Subcommittee, where he authored legislation that reformed the \nNational Flood Insurance Program and made it possible for millions of \nAmericans to protect their homes affordably.\n  Jim's passion for policymaking has helped him shape legislation that \nwill govern our Nation for years to come, but his greatest legacy is \nhis family. He and Mary raised 9 children and have 35 grandchildren and \n4 great-grandchildren. Sandy and I offer our best wishes to the entire \nBunning family, and we thank him for his years of service to our great \nNation.\n\n\n                            George Voinovich\n\n  Mr. President, I join my colleagues in appreciation and admiration of \nSenator George Voinovich.\n  Senator Voinovich represents the great State of Ohio--and in some \nsense he has never left. He was born and raised in Cleveland, earned a \nbachelor of arts degree in government from Ohio University, and \nreceived a law degree from the Moritz College of Law at the Ohio State \nUniversity. After more than four decades of public service, he and \nJanet still live in Cleveland with their family.\n  Before coming to Washington, Senator Voinovich established a long \nrecord of service to the people of the Buckeye State: as a member of \nthe State legislature, a Cuyahoga County Commissioner, the Lieutenant \nGovernor of Ohio, mayor of Cleveland and Governor of Ohio. As mayor of \nCleveland, he helped turn around the local economy after the city \ndeclared bankruptcy in the 1970s. As Governor, George spearheaded \neconomic recovery efforts after Ohio fell into a recession during the \nearly 1990s. He helped reduce Ohio's unemployment rate to a 25-year low \nand maintained the lowest budgetary growth levels in 30 years. Along \nthe way, he became the only person to hold the highest leadership \npositions in both the National Governors Association and the National \nLeague of Cities.\n  The people of Ohio sent George to Washington to serve in the U.S. \nSenate in 1998 and then reelected him 6 years ago in a landslide \nvictory. Senator Voinovich's policy accomplishments reflect his \ndedication to maintaining fiscal responsibility, enhancing national \nsecurity, increasing America's global competitiveness, and improving \nthe federal government's efficiency. His Mortgage Relief Act of 2007 \nwas the first piece of legislation to be signed into law that aimed to \nlessen the impact of America's foreclosure crisis.\n  Senator Voinovich has also been a strong voice for America's \ninterests and values all over the world. He has been a strong proponent \nof NATO expansion, U.N. reform, and U.S. public\n\n[[Page S10398]]\n\ndiplomacy efforts. He has also spoken out strongly against global anti-\nSemitism, racism and other forms of intolerance.\n  Sandy and I wish all the best to George and Janet, as well as their \nthree children and eight grandchildren. And we thank George for his \nmany years of service in the U.S. Senate.\n\n\n                              Jim Bunning\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise in tribute to Senator Jim Bunning, \nwho is retiring after honorably serving the people of Kentucky for 24 \nyears.\n  Throughout his political career, Jim has been a fierce taxpayer's \nadvocate. A bold defender of life and protector of families. A small \nbusiness ally. And, a courageous critic of bad government policy.\n  As the targets of his criticism have learned, Jim's words can \nsometimes be sharp. That is because cold, hard truths have sharp edges \nand Jim Bunning speaks in cold, hard truths.\n  Even when it comes to his own party.\n  In the summer of 2008, shortly after a Republican Treasury Secretary \nobtained the authority to pump unlimited money into Freddie Mac and \nFannie Mae, Jim was rightfully upset. ``When I picked up the newspaper \nyesterday, I thought I woke up in France,'' he told the Secretary in a \nhearing. ``But no,'' Jim said, ``it turned out it was socialism here in \nthe United States.''\n  Jim often asked simple questions that were easy to answer truthfully \nand didn't tolerate equivocation. In the case of the Fannie and Freddie \nbailouts, he asked the Treasury Secretary, ``Where will the money come \nfrom?''\n  The Treasury Secretary said it was better to ``be unspecified and \nenhance confidence in the market.''\n  Jim asked again saying that ``doesn't answer the question. Where is \nthe money going to come from if you have to put it up?''\n  There was more waffling, but Jim finally pushed the Treasury \nSecretary to admit the money was going to come from the taxpayer. The \ntaxpayers were going to pay.\n  He later called for the resignation of that Republican Treasury \nSecretary because he was, as Jim put it, ``acting like the minister of \nfinance in China.''\n  ``No company fails in Communist China, because they're all partly \nowned by the government,'' Jim noted.\n  Jim has also been a brave critic of the Federal Reserve. He has told \nthe Fed Chairman, who was appointed by a Republican President and \nhelped orchestrate bailouts for those considered too big to fail that, \n``You are the definition of a moral hazard.''\n  ``Your Fed has become the creature from Jekyll Island,'' Jim said. \nAnd then he asked for the Fed Chairman's resignation, too.\n  Jim has performed a great public service by bringing attention to the \neconomic damage being caused by the Fed with cheap money when no one \nelse would. He was there calling for more oversight of the Federal \nReserve long before it became a Tea Party cause and he deserves credit \nfor driving the issue into the mainstream.\n  As Senator, you could say Jim's approach has been direct as the \nfastballs he threw that made him a major league, Hall of Fame pitcher. \nWhen the Democrats tried to pass off phony paygo rules as real reform, \nJim exposed it as a trick pitch. It was a gimmick to fool Americans \ninto thinking they would pay for their big-spending plans.\n  The Democrats said paygo would obligate Congress to offset any new \nspending with new revenues or spending cuts elsewhere in the budget. \nSoon after, they tried to pass $10 billion in unpaid for unemployment \nextensions Moreover, the Democrats wanted to pass it by unanimous \nconsent. Meaning, no public debate. No rollcall vote. No \naccountability.\n  The Democrats bet no one would oppose benefits for the unemployed in \nthis bad economy. They believed, as they continue to, that they can \nkeep giving out money without paying for it and without any \nconsequences.\n  Jim did not concede. He objected and stood his ground on the Senate \nfloor. And by doing so, he showed everyone what a sham paygo is. The \nWall Street Journal called it ``his finest hour.''\n  Bunning announced his retirement in July 2009, more than a year ago. \nHe could have taken it easy during his last years in the Senate. He \ndidn't have to tackle the Treasury, the Fed or insist unemployment \nextensions be paid for.\n  But, he did. Jim Bunning, the Hall of Fame Pitcher, the distinguished \nSenator, father of 9 and grandfather of 40 cared too much for this \ncountry to sit this one out.\n  He said in his farewell speech that he prays the Members of Congress \nwill stop spending our future generations into higher taxes and a lower \nstandard of living than we have now. I pray for that, too.\n  Finally, I express my gratitude to Senator Bunning for supporting the \nnew Republican from his state who will inherit his Senate seat next \nyear. Jim campaigned for someone to take his place who would say no to \nbailouts, stop the takeovers, end the wasteful spending and bring down \nthe national debt. The nation will benefit greatly by continuing to \nhave a senator at Jim's desk who believes as much in the principles of \nfree markets and freedom as Jim.\n  Thank you Jim for giving America your best until the very last \ninning.\n\n\n                             Sam Brownback\n\n  I rise in tribute to my good friend, Senator Sam Brownback, who will \nsoon be Governor Sam Brownback.\n  Senator Brownback leaves this Chamber as a man of character and \nsuccess. He made a promise to the citizens of Kansas to only serve two \nterms in the U.S. Senate and he is honoring it.\n  He will continue to serve his constituents well, as he will soon join \nthe ranks of Republican Governors who are committed to saving freedom \nand free-markets. Sam and his fellow Republican Governors will stand \nsentry in their state capitols, defending Americans from unaffordable \nmandates and unprecedented intrusions by the Federal Government.\n  The current Secretary of Health and Human Services, Democrat Kathleen \nSebelius, left Topeka to come to Washington and impose an \nunconstitutional health care takeover on all Americans. I am confident \nRepublican Governor-elect Sam Brownback, who is leaving Washington for \nTopeka, will successfully fight for state rights in court and preserve \nfreedom for Kansans.\n  Sam won on a platform of opportunity, accountability and \nresponsibility--the very principles his State was founded upon.\n  His ``Road Map for Kansas'' is built on ideas to grow the economy, \ncreate private-sector jobs, improve education, reform the state \ngovernment and support Kansas families. This is exactly the kind of \nleadership our nation so desperately needs. His five-point plan is a \nclear and bright as the tips of the stars on the Kansas flag.\n  In addition to the roadmap for Kansas, Sam has promised to institute \na spending freeze for his State his very first month in office.\n  It has been an honor to serve alongside Sam, one of our nation's \npremier pro-life leaders. He knows no one should be denied the right to \nlife--especially the unborn. As he said in a speech at the 2004 March \nfor Life, ``If we demean and degrade one human life, we demean and \ndegrade all human life.''\n  As a U.S. Senator, Sam relentlessly fought to protect the unborn. He \nwas the principle sponsor of the Unborn Child Pain Awareness Act, the \nPrenatally Diagnosed Conditions Awareness Act, the Human Cloning \nProhibition Act, and others. He has also worked to advance the Partial-\nBirth Abortion Ban Act, the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, and the \nBorn-Alive Infants Protection Act.\n  Sam has increased awareness about the joy of adoption. He can \npersonally attest to it. He and his wife Mary and three children Abby, \nAndy and Elizabeth have welcomed two children in need of a loving home \ninto their lives. The Brownback's youngest son Mark is from Guatemala. \nTheir youngest daughter Jenna is from China, where families are \nsubjected to grave and callous one-child policy.\n  Thank you Sam for fighting for a better life for all of God's \nchildren.\n  As we bid him farewell, I would like to reflect on one short passage \nfrom his book, ``From Power to Purpose.'' In it, Sam wrote ``The heart \nof the matter is the human heart, which is where human goodness \nbegins.''\n  That shows the kind of heart Sam has for public service. His tenure \nin the U.S. Senate is marked by his compassion and care for his fellow \nman.\n\n[[Page S10399]]\n\n  He will be dearly missed here in Washington. But, as Jesus said, \n``There are many rooms in my Father's house.'' And Sam is just moving \nto another room where he will continue to serve God.\n\n\n                            george voinovich\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, when George Voinovich came to the Senate \nin 1998, he brought with him a wealth of experience as a State \nlegislator, county commissioner, mayor, and Governor. More important, \nhe brought an independent mind, common sense, and a commitment to \nresults.\n  Through more than four decades of public service, he has always been \nguided by the principle that a fundamental obligation of government is \nto honor its responsibilities to citizens. His goal has always been to \nensure that those in public office ``work harder and smarter, and do \nmore with less.''\n  But Senator Voinovich is revered here and at home for deeds, not \nwords. As mayor, he brought Cleveland back from bankruptcy and led its \ntransformation into a three-time All-America City. As Governor, he \nsteered Ohio through the recession of the early 1990s, turned a State \nbudget in the red back to black, and helped rebuild Ohio's industry and \ninfrastructure for the 21st century.\n  From his executive background in local and State government, Senator \nVoinovich knew that any government is only as good as the people \nworking for it. He has been a strong advocate for improved government \nmanagement, and for recruiting, retaining, rewarding, and recognizing \nthe best government workforce.\n  It has been my privilege to work closely with Senator Voinovich on \nthe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. He is devoted \nto protecting our Nation and our people.\n  Our committee's work was aided greatly by his leadership of the \nSubcommittee on Oversight and Government Management, and his conviction \nthat government works only when it ensures that the right people have \nthe right resources to get the job done. He has been instrumental in \nvirtually every major civil service issue for more than a decade and \nhas championed 17 pieces of legislation to transform and improve our \nFederal workforce.\n  Since coming to Washington, the ``Workforce Senator'' has been a \nwatchdog for the interests of the taxpayers and of government \nemployees. Early in his service, the Senior Executive Service \nPerformance Improvement Act and the Chief Human Capital Officers Act \nrecognized that the Federal Government must compete if it is to attract \nthe best. In this Congress, the Federal Hiring Process Improvement Act \naddressed the need to streamline recruiting so that the right person \ncan be hired at the right time.\n  And his efforts have been successful. A recent Federal employee \nsurvey on the best places to work found that the top three agencies--\nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission, GAO, and NASA--are the agencies with \nthe personnel flexibilities Senator Voinovich worked to achieve.\n  I know how deeply George Voinovich cares about the men and women who \nserve as Federal employees because on many issues we have fought \ntogether. In particular, I want to recognize his role in pressing for \npay for performance reforms in our Federal workforce. If we want an \neffective government, we must encourage excellence in our workforce, as \nSenator Voinovich clearly understands.\n  He has been an effective voice for fiscal discipline, for \ncomprehensive tax and entitlement reform, and for enhancing America's \ncompetitiveness in a global economy. All of these issues and so many \nmore demonstrate his commitment to honoring responsibilities and \nachieving results.\n  When Senator Voinovich announced early last year that he would not \nseek reelection, the outpouring of tributes was heartfelt and \nbipartisan. As one Ohio newspaper wrote, ``Once he latches on to an \nissue, he doesn't let go until he is satisfied with the outcome.''\n  Senator Voinovich's determination, combined with wisdom, experience, \nand decency, made him an outstanding U.S. Senator and public servant. I \nthank George Voinovich for his years of service and for his friendship, \nand wish him and Janet all the best in the years to come.\n\n\n                             Russ Feingold\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I take a moment to say a few words about the \njunior Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Russ Feingold, who will be \nleaving the Senate at the end of this session. We have served together \nin the Senate, working for the people of Wisconsin every day, since he \nwas elected in 1992. But now Wisconsin is losing a powerful and \nthoughtful advocate that carried on the proud progressive tradition of \nRobert LaFollette.\n  Russ came to the Senate by winning an upset election, running as an \noutsider. He famously wrote a promise to the people of Wisconsin on his \ngarage door, and people responded to his sincerity. Keeping that \npromise has kept him close to the people of Wisconsin as he traveled to \nevery county in the State once a year to hold a listening session. That \nkind of accessibility, and his pledge to raise his campaign money \nmostly from the people of Wisconsin, gives him a credibility and \nintegrity that no one in the State can question.\n  Money and politics has always been an issue that Russ felt \npassionately about. So it should be no surprise that his biggest \nlegislative win was when he worked with Senator John McCain to put \nrestrictions on campaign financing with the historic Bi-Partisan \nCampaign Finance Reform Act, better known as the McCain-Feingold bill. \nThat legislation, like many of his stands over the years, didn't always \nmake him popular with his colleagues, but it was the right thing to do \nto try and root out corruption and roll back the influence of the \nspecial interests. The American people will never have confidence in \nour system as long as they believe that a politician's support can be \nbought and sold. Russ worked to restore confidence in our government \nand he should be commended for that.\n  He took a lot of unpopular positions over the years. Most notable was \nhis sole opposition to the Patriot Act. He stood up for his ideals when \nit would have been easy to brush them aside. But that is the kind of \nperson Russ is. He was never willing to sacrifice his principles to do \nthe politically easy thing. Our country is safer because of his work.\n  Russ also has been a tough budget hawk, working tirelessly to bring \ndown spending and give the next generation a debt-free future. He also \nhelped form the current lobbying rules that restrict gifts, employment, \nand perks that can be given to members and staff by special interest \nlobbyists. These policies didn't always make him popular around here--\nand sometimes caused problems inside his own party--but he was willing \nto buck the system when he felt he had to.\n  Janesville should be proud of their hometown son who has accomplished \nso much. He leaves the Senate, but I hope he doesn't leave public \nservice. His character and intelligence are needed by his community, \nState and country. We will miss him.\n\n\n                               Chris Dodd\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, occasionally in the career of a U.S. \nSenator, one is given the opportunity to shape legislation that will \nbring historic change to our Nation. The Senators who have seized such \nopportunities stand among the Senate giants of our lifetime: ``Scoop'' \nJackson. Hubert Humphrey. Everett Dirksen. Ted Kennedy.\n  As this Congress comes to a close, we must say goodbye to Chris Dodd, \na Senator who has seized such opportunities, one whose drive and \ndedication and wisdom have enabled us to bring great and needed change. \nSenator Chris Dodd has been a good friend to me. He has been a leader \nto those who seek an America that is stronger, fairer and more just.\n  Senator Dodd will be rightly remembered for his essential role in \npassage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection \nAct. In the aftermath of a financial crisis that brought the nation's \neconomy to a halt and threatened a second Great Depression, the need \nfor Wall Street reform was clear, but so were the enormous obstacles to \npassage. In addition to honest disagreements about how best to proceed, \nwe faced determined opposition from Wall Street, which wanted to \nmaintain a status quo that put profits ahead of economic stability. All \nof us who participated in the debate over that bill know how complex \nand difficult it was to craft it, and we all have enormous hopes that \nthis landmark\n\n[[Page S10400]]\n\nbill will curb the excesses that cost so many Americans their jobs and \nhomes and businesses in the financial crisis.\n  History also will mark Senator Dodd's key role in passage of the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a landmark step in the \ndecades-long fight to ensure that every American has access to \naffordable health care. Taking up the baton for his dear friend, \nSenator Kennedy, Senator Dodd provided strong and sure leadership, \nagain in the face of obstacles that at times threatened the bill's very \nsurvival. Thanks to his dedication, health coverage is more secure and \naffordable for families who have it, and more accessible to families \nwithout it.\n  If Senator Dodd had accomplished no other legislative victories than \nthese two, he could rightly claim a place among the Senate's most \neffective legislators. But Chris Dodd accomplished much more.\n  Millions of American families have benefitted from his work in \nenacting the Family and Medical Leave Act. Before this legislation \nbecame law in 1993, Americans faced wrenching choices between their \nresponsibilities at home and at work. Despite two Presidential vetoes, \nSenator Dodd continued fighting until he had succeeded. And today, \nAmerican workers are able to give their families the time and attention \nthey need without fear of losing their job.\n  Families and children have been at the heart of much of his work. The \nchild care and development block grant program, which he fought to \nestablish, has helped millions of low-income families get the child \ncare they so desperately needed. The Head Start program has been a \ncareer-long priority, and his hard work to ensure that Head Start \nremains strong has made a huge difference in countless lives.\n  His work on behalf of families extends to protecting them from \npredatory credit card companies. I worked closely with him in the fight \nfor passage of the Credit Card Accountability and Disclosure Act, which \nprovided tough new protections against unfair practices in the credit \ncard industry.\n  Part of the reason for Chris Dodd's extraordinarily successful \nlegislative career is that people simply like working with him. He is \ngood-natured, open and non-defensive, willing to listen to differing \npoints of view. His openness is accompanied by an infectious sense of \nhumor that has eased tense moments and helped us all take ourselves a \nlittle less seriously, which in turn has helped overcome some mighty \nserious impasses.\n  A common thread runs through all his signature accomplishments. \nThroughout his career, Chris Dodd has been dedicated to the idea that \ncompassion has a place in this chamber; that as we do our work, we \nshould keep in mind that real families, with real problems, are looking \nto us for solutions; and that a Senator, with hard work and \nresourcefulness and teamwork, can make a difference in the lives of \nthose families.\n  As Chris Dodd's Senate career draws to a close, speeches will be \ngiven, portraits will be hung, someday statues will be raised, but the \nultimate monument to his Senate career will be the mother or father who \nhas time to care for a sick child because of the Family and Medical \nLeave Act. It will be the parent who doesn't have to choose between \nputting food on the table or providing health insurance for his \nchildren. It will be the child who excels in the classroom because of \nHead Start. The monuments to Chris Dodd will be the millions of \nAmericans whose lives are safer, more secure and more prosperous \nbecause of the work he has done here. No Senator could ask for more \nmeaningful tributes. I will miss his wisdom and his humor as we conduct \nbusiness here, but I will continue to value his friendship. I wish him \nand his wonderful family the happiest of times in all the years to \ncome.\n\n\n                             Russ Feingold\n\n  Mr. President, true bipartisanship has been in sadly short supply in \nthis Chamber recently. Sadly, at the end of this Congress, the supply \nof bipartisanship will be a little lower, because we will no longer \nhave the benefit of Russ Feingold's presence in the Senate.\n  Senator Feingold's service to the Senate demonstrates that one need \nnot abandon strongly held convictions to reach bipartisan solutions. \nHis example proves that disagreeing with someone on one issue need not \nprevent working with them on another issue. He has shown that one can \nact as a good steward of taxpayer dollars and a careful advocate for \nfiscal responsibility without leaving behind the working families who \nneed us to stand up for them.\n  There are many examples of Senator Feingold's search for bipartisan \nsolutions, but justifiably, he is best known for the McCain-Feingold \ncampaign finance legislation. The assault on this legislation in the \ncourts should not distract us from its wisdom. This bipartisan \nlegislation was based upon the inherently American and inherently \ndemocratic notion that elections should be decided by the will of the \npeople, and not because of the influence of wealthy donors or moneyed \ninterests. This is a notion that is not Republican or Democratic, not \nliberal or conservative. It relies not on party loyalty or ideological \nfervor, but on a sense of justice. That sense of justice is central to \nwhat Russ Feingold has brought to the Senate.\n  Likewise, the civil rights of American citizens are not a matter of \nparty or ideology. I admire Senator Feingold's unflagging commitment to \nthose rights, and his efforts to find a reasonable balance between \nprotecting our safety and preserving our freedom.\n  Now, Senator Feingold and I have not agreed on every issue. While we \nboth believed the Iraq war was a mistake, he believed we should respond \nby ending funding for the war. I disagreed, and believed that such a \nmove would harm our troops in the field whom we should support. But I \nnever doubted that Senator Feingold came to his conclusions only after \ngiving careful consideration to the arguments opposing them.\n  We will miss Russ Feingold, miss his intellect, his independence, and \nhis dedication. I will always call him my friend. The Senate will be \npoorer for his absence. But I know that the Nation will continue to \nenjoy the benefits of his service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "16", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/16/senate-section/article/S10400-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10400-S10401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MUSEUM AND LIBRARY SERVICES ACT\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this week, with little fanfare, we completed \nwork on an important bill, through a bipartisan process, by passage of \nS. 3984, the Museum and Library Services Act of 2010.\n  This bill updates museum and library services funded through the \nInstitute for Museum and Library Services, IMLS, to better meet the \nneeds of Americans of all ages and in all types of locations.\n  The Museum and Library Services Act represents our national \ncommitment to the institutions that are essential to building strong \nand vibrant communities. Through a relatively modest federal \ninvestment, this law helps build capacity to support and expand access \nto library and museum services at the State and local level.\n  We were able to complete this legislation because we worked \ntogether--across the aisle and across the Capitol, and with the input \nof the museum and library community.\n  I would like to take a moment to recognize and thank our HELP \nCommittee Chairman Tom Harkin, Ranking Member Mike Enzi, and Senator \nRichard Burr for working with me to craft this bipartisan legislation. \nI would also like to recognize our cosponsors, Senators Cochran, \nCollins, and Tester. In addition, I would like to express my \nappreciation to House Education and Labor Committee Chairman George \nMiller and Ranking Member John Kline for quickly guiding this bill \nthrough the House.\n  No piece of legislation can be enacted without the diligent work of \ndedicated staff. I would like to thank Kristin Romero and Margaret \nBomba of the office of legislative counsel who worked with us to draft \nthe bill. I would also like to recognize the efforts of staff: Thomas \nShowalter, Pam Smith, and Bethany Little with Chairman Harkin; Beth \nBuehlmann and Kelly Hastings with Senator Enzi; Celia Sims with Senator \nBurr; Lory Yudin with the HELP Committee; and in my office, Elyse \nWasch, Moira Lenehan-Razzuri, Andrew Odgren, and Jason Kanter.\n  Additionally, all of us who worked on this bill appreciate the \ntechnical assistance and feedback we received from the staff of IMLS. \nFinally, I would like\n\n[[Page S10401]]\n\nto commend the American Library Association and the American \nAssociation of Museums for developing thoughtful recommendations and \nworking with us to improve museum and library services across the \nNation. I especially appreciate the wisdom and input I have received \nfrom the vibrant library and museum community in Rhode Island.\n  I look forward to this legislation being swiftly signed into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "16", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/16/senate-section/article/S10401-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10401-S10404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRUCK WEIGHTS ON MAINE INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I have an amendment to the continuing \nresolution, H.R. 3082.\n  My amendment will rectify an impediment to international commerce \nflowing through Maine, and protect Maine drivers and pedestrians. For \nthe past year, Maine truckers have operated under a pilot program that \nallows trucks over 80,000 pounds to move from local roads to safer \ninterstate routes, far from schools and homes. The pilot project has \nbeen a great success, and I seek to make it permanent.\n  Unless we take action before December 17, trucks over 80,000 pounds \ntraveling to or from the Canadian border or within upstate Maine will \nbe forced onto secondary roads, many of them two-lane roads, which run \nthrough towns and villages. Trucks traveling between Houlton and \nHampden, ME, on these local roads will pass more than three thousand \nhomes, several schools, and hundreds of intersections. Tanker trucks \ncarrying fuel will again be traveling past elementary schools and \nlibraries, and competing with local traffic. Not only is this an \ninefficient method of moving goods, but it also unnecessarily increases \nrisks on narrow local roads.\n  What is the result of such truck traffic on local roads? According to \na study conducted by the Maine Department of Transportation, traffic \nfatalities involving trucks weighing 100,000 pounds are 10 times \ngreater on secondary roads in Maine than on exempted interstates. \nSerious injuries are seven times more likely. The past year's pilot \nprogram has proved that Maine's rural interstate is a safer place for \nlarge trucks.\n  Maine Department of Transportation officials strongly support this \nprogram. Extensive studies and infrastructure inspections have left \nState DOT officials confident that heavier trucks carrying interstate \nand international loads belong on the interstate.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this straightforward amendment.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for the \ntax legislation that will not only enable millions of American families \nto keep more of their paychecks, but will also provide a stable and \npredictable economic platform upon which American businesses can \noperate, and pull our economy from the economic morass of the past 2 \nyears.\n  This legislation certainly cannot remedy all of our economic \nstruggles, but it is essential that we provide necessary certainty in \nFederal tax policy, which is the foundation upon which our Nation's \nentrepreneurs make decisions about taking risks, investing in the \nfuture, and creating jobs. As the end-of-the-year deadline looms for \nthe biggest tax increase in history, American employers have been \nretrenching and bracing for the possibility of Washington taking a \nlarger share of taxes out of their businesses--and that is inhibiting \nour economic potential at a time when we can least afford to fetter the \nforces of our private sector.\n  Frankly, the debate over whether extending these tax provisions is \nthe right thing to do is now past. What we are experiencing right now \nis a jobless recovery, which isn't a true recovery at all if you cannot \nfind a job or earn a paycheck. For 2 years of debating and legislating \nin Washington about how to fix the economy, our economy should be in \nmore than just the ``holding pattern'' Harvard Economics Professor, \nMartin Feldstein, has described. I am afraid that at this historic \njuncture--with the unemployment rate of 9.8 percent, or roughly 15 \nmillion people out of work, poverty in America is at its highest in \nover a generation, and we are experiencing historically low investor \nand consumer confidence--we do not have the luxury to take the gamble \nand increase taxes.\n  A consensus has developed among economists and policymakers that \nextending these tax provisions will benefit the economy. Indeed, \naccording to the White House, extending these tax provisions will \nresult in more than 1.5 million jobs. Back in September, Mark Zandi \nreleased data indicating that increasing taxes from 33 and 35 percent \nup to 36 and 39.6 percent on small business and high-income taxpayers \nwould reduce gross domestic product by 0.4 percent in 2011 and would \nreduce payroll employment by 770,000 jobs by mid-2012, precipitating a \ndouble-dip recession in the first half of 2011. Mr. Zandi is now \nestimating that this legislation will create 1.6 million jobs. Further, \neven the Center for American Progress estimates job growth at 2.2 \nmillion jobs as a result of this legislation.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has been stating since September that \nextending the tax rates through 2012, as this legislation would do, \nwould add between 600,000 and 1.4 million jobs in 2011 and between \n900,000 and 2.7 million jobs in 2012. Further, CBO estimates that this \nlegislation would enhance the gross national product by 1.1 percent. \nAlso back in September, a group of 300 economists recognized this \nreality and sent a letter to Congress imploring an extension of the \ncurrent rules. Perhaps the phrase ``better late than never'' is most \napplicable to the impending passage of this legislation that will avert \nthe tax increases that loom a mere 3 weeks away and would lead to a \ndouble-dip recession, and drive our unemployment rate even higher.\n  It is simply long past time that we extend the 2001/2003 tax relief \nand expiring provisions such as the R tax credit and the child \ncredit. It is incumbent upon this Congress to enact stable tax rules \nthat will help Americans to get back to work and plan their lives--our \npolitical Hippocratic Oath of ``First Do No Harm'' should apply at this \nmoment, just as there are glimmers that our national economy is past \nits low ebb. At this juncture we cannot veer onto a dangerous path and \nincrease taxes, which is exactly what would happen if this legislation \ndoes not become law. Indeed, the tax increases scheduled to take effect \nin a matter of 3 weeks would be the biggest tax increase in history--an \n$800 billion tax increase that will be averted by this legislation.\n  And the agreement on which this legislation is based is something \nthat has been rare in Washington in the last 2 years--a hard fought \nconsensus among the leaders of both parties. Both sides of the \nnegotiating table were required to make concessions to reach this point \nand, as a result, a significant majority of 83 to 15 voted to move this \nlegislation forward.\n  Undeniably, one of the key components of this legislation is the 10-\npercent tax rate that was a hallmark of the original 2001 legislation. \nWhile other tax rates have been the object of more heated--and highly \npolarizing--debate, it is undeniable that this 10 percent rate is the \nmost significant. If this legislation is not enacted into law, roughly \n27 million tax returns will witness a 50 percent increase in taxes, \nfrom 10 percent to 15 percent. With consumer spending representing 70 \npercent of gross national product, we must be cognizant of how this tax \nincrease would eradicate any sign of economic recovery. This is not \neven an issue of individuals bracing for a higher tax bill--on January \n1 employers would withhold more taxes from paychecks leaving less for \nthe rent, grocery bills, a tank of gas or utilities.\n  Of course, all taxpayers benefit from the initial 10-percent tax \nrate, but for these low-income individuals and families, having the 10-\npercent rate revert to a 15-percent rate would be particularly \nburdensome. For individuals making less than $8,000 per year and \ncouples making under $16,000, this 10-percent rate is a lifeline. For \ntaxpayers slightly higher up the income stream, having this initial \nportion of their income taxed at only a 10-percent rate can \nsignificantly help reduce their effective tax rate.\n  Another hallmark of the 2001 tax legislation that would be extended \nis marriage penalty relief. The initial two tax rates, those at 10 \npercent and 15 percent rates, allow for twice the amount of income for \na married couple than is taxed for an individual, so individuals \nearning up to $34,000 are taxed at 15 percent and couples can earn up \nto $68,000 and still remain in the 15-percent bracket. This was \ncertainly not\n\n[[Page S10402]]\n\nthe case before the 2001 law, and thus an extension of this provision \nis nothing short of an imperative for low income and middle income \nmarried couples today.\n  Indeed, if this legislation is not enacted, rather than having up to \n$68,000 taxed at a 15-percent rate, couples would face a 28-percent \nrate on family incomes over $58,200. For families where both the \nhusband and wife are working, at a 28-percent rate rather than a 15-\npercent rate, that second income starts to face diminishing returns all \ntoo quickly--especially if the second income involves placing children \nin expensive day care.\n  And speaking of children and daycare, there are two more significant \nprovisions in this bill that are being extended--the child tax credit \nand the dependent care tax credit. In 2008, the most recent year for \nwhich data is available, there were 25,287,874 children claimed for \nchild tax credits. As the primary sponsor of the child credit in 2001, \nI am particularly proud of the fact that American families received an \neconomic boost of $1,000 for 25 million children. The child tax credit \nbenefits working parents and their dependent children and it is \nessential to note that the Maine Children's Alliance of my home State \nreports that, in Maine, 21.8 percent of young children are poor and \n16.5 percent of all children are poor. Currently, these families are \neligible for a refundable credit--15 percent of earned income capped at \na maximum of $1,000 per child--once they have earned at least $3,000.\n  The legislation we are debating will maintain the threshold--set in \n2009--at $3,000 rather than allowing it to triple to roughly $13,000, \nwhich would nationally result in millions of low-income working parents \nbeing excluded from receiving the refundable portion of the tax credit \naltogether, or having their benefit significantly reduced.\n  In Maine, for example, the Maine Children's Alliance reports that \n34,651 children who were members of 21,346 families in Maine benefitted \nfrom this expansion in 2009. This $3,000 threshold is an extraordinary \none, which was not and is not envisioned to be permanent. Senator \nLincoln and I have supported bringing the $13,000 threshold down to a \nmore sustainable $8,500 level and then indexing that for inflation. In \nthe next Congress, when we address tax reform and enter into a full \nnegotiation about income tax burdens, I will be attentively working to \nensure that tax policies for working families with children are \nprogressive and mindful of these families' needs.\n  The dependent care tax credit is also extended in this legislation. \nThis year, the provision allows a taxpayer a 35-percent credit, rather \nthan just 30 percent, of child care expenses for children under 13 and \ndisabled dependents. The 2001 tax bill increased the amount of eligible \nexpenses from $2,400 to $3,000 for one child and from $4,800 to $6,000 \nfor two or more children.\n  Under this legislation, these policies on dependent care will be \nextended for an additional 2 years, through 2012. Again, with Senator \nLincoln, we have introduced legislation that would have improved rather \nthan just maintained the dependent care credit. The most significant of \nthese changes would be to increase the thresholds so that up to $5,000 \nper child or $10,000 for two or more children would be creditable. The \nlegislation would also amend the flexible spending account rules for \ndependent care to increase the amount of pre-tax income that can be set \naside for dependent care so that it is $7,500 for one dependent and \n$10,000 for two or more.\n  Another major component of the legislation before us is relief from \nthe alternative minimum tax--or AMT. In fact, the AMT relief in this \nlegislation makes up roughly one quarter of all the relief--roughly \n$137 billion for just the 2-year ``patch''--that effectively holds \nharmless taxpayers from the unintended consequences of this alternative \ntax system. This is not taking into account the additional relief that \nholds harmless taxpayers who would otherwise have their child credits \nreduced as a result of the AMT.\n  The onerous AMT is tax policy run amok--and I can find no \npolicymakers who defend the manner in which it would be imposed on at \nleast an additional 21 million taxpayers. AMT is essentially a flat tax \nat 26 and 28 percent tax rates for couples with combined incomes as low \nas $45,000 per year. Perhaps this is the understatement of the year, \nbut these are not the super wealthy who were the intended targets of \nthis tax. When the 112th Congress addresses the question of fundamental \ntax reform, this reckless component of tax policy must be our top \nsingle priority to be repealed and rationalized so that the tax rate is \nthe tax rate, and we cease to have a parallel tax system that is simply \nout of control.\n  As the former chair and now ranking member of the Senate Small \nBusiness Committee and a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, \nthe issue of how individual tax rates affect small business is of \nprofound concern to me. Whether it is on Main Street tours or from \nother constituent contacts with businesses large and small, the \nuncertainty of the Tax Code is the primary issue on the minds of \nbusiness owners and managers. At that December 2 hearing on tax reform \nin the Finance Committee, we were presented data regarding the growth \nin the number of ``flow through'' businesses--those businesses that pay \ntax at the individual tax rates rather than at the corporate rate. \nSince the Tax Reform Act of 1986, but particularly since 2001, the \ngrowth in this form of ownership has been expanding. Further, we \nlearned that S Corporations have supplanted C Corporations as the \npreferred form of business other than sole proprietorships.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation has reported that 50 percent of all \nincome in the top two individual income tax brackets is attributable to \nflow-through businesses. These are the entrepreneurial firms that are \ngenerating the jobs necessary to pull us out of this recession, and it \nis imperative that we not increase taxes on these businesses from 33 \nand 35 percent up to 36 and 39.6 percent. According to the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, over 70 percent of U.S. manufacturers \nfile as S Corporations or other pass-through entities and NAM reports \nthat most would be significantly and adversely impacted by increasing \ntax rates to 39.6 percent. Moreover, this legislation will reduce tax \nrates on capital gains and dividends that will boost capital investment \nand economic growth.\n  According to the Small Business Administration, small businesses \nemploy half of all private sector employees, and generated 65 percent \nof net new jobs over the past 17 years. These flow-through small \nbusinesses employ 20 million Americans and it is these business owners \nwho must reinvest the profits of their businesses to continue serving \nas the economic engines of this Nation. The reinvested profits from a \nbusiness are the lifeblood of these entrepreneurs and, at a time when \naccess to capital from lending institutions is still difficult, current \nearnings must be available to business owners rather than sending those \nfunds to Washington. Indeed, in the National Small Business \nAssociation's 2009 Year-End Economic Report, 38 percent of respondents \nto their survey noted Federal taxes as one of the most significant \nchallenges to the future growth and survival of their businesses--a \ncategory trumped only by the ongoing economic uncertainty pervading our \nNation. Small business owners across America can better deploy this \ncapital than can policymakers in Washington.\n  Although I believe that this package will demonstrably enhance GDP \ngrowth and critically lower unemployment, regrettably this package also \nunnecessarily adds to our Federal debt by retaining energy tax policies \nthat are quite simply an ineffective use of taxpayers' money. \nSpecifically, instead of considering the effectiveness of individual \nenergy tax policies scheduled to expire this year, the Tax Relief, \nUnemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 \nsimply extends all policies that had Congress extended previously. By \nthat standard the legislation conveniently continues subsidies at their \ncurrent levels for ethanol, biodiesel, refined coal, natural gas and \noil production--all at a cost of more than $11 billion in lost revenue \nfor the Federal Government at a time of record deficits.\n  These tax policies were enacted years ago, are extremely costly to \nU.S. taxpayers, and the merits of their extension have not been \ndemonstrated to the Senate Finance Committee. In fact, according to a \nJuly 2010 study by the Congressional Budget Office, the ethanol tax \ncredits cost taxpayers $1.78 for each gallon of gasoline consumption\n\n[[Page S10403]]\n\nreduced, and $750 for each metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent \nemissions avoided. The continuation of this tax credit is an \nineffective method at reducing our consumption of foreign oil and will \nunfortunately cost taxpayers nearly $5 billion.\n  In addition, the legislation extends the 1603 grant program for \nqualified renewable energy projects. While I support renewable energy, \nthis program is far from standard tax policy and was developed to be \ntimely, targeted and temporary in the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act as a direct result of the paralysis of the tax equity \nmarkets in 2009. Unfortunately, the Finance Committee has not reviewed \nthe effectiveness of this policy and, as a result, I am not supportive \nof providing an additional $2.9 billion without government analysis \ndemonstrating that this program's extension is an effective use of \ntaxpayers' money.\n  Again, the decision to include these costly energy provisions was \nmade without Finance Committee hearings, mark-ups, discussions, or \nanalysis. Energy markets are dynamic and technology develops rapidly--\nCongress must demonstrate our capacity to end obsolete energy tax \npolicies, and develop effective policies that will improve America's \nenergy security.\n  It is regrettable that the Middle Class Tax Relief Act includes these \ncostly and misguided policies and hope that next year Chairman Baucus \nand Ranking Member Hatch hold Finance hearings to assess the best use \nof tax policy to reduce energy prices in a fiscally responsible manner.\n  Finally, I have been an ardent supporter of extended unemployment \nbenefits during this economic calamity. At a time when the official \nnational unemployment rate is 9.8 percent and 7.4 percent in Maine, and \nmany industries and States clearly are experiencing rates that are \nalarmingly higher, it is imperative that we provide a safety net for \nthese individuals. Rather than the halting, short term and month to \nmonth extensions that we have managed this year, the legislation before \nus would provide extended unemployment benefits through 2011--\nrecognizing that these unemployment numbers are not expected to rebound \nas quickly as any of us would hope.\n  I support this legislation to extend current tax relief for two \nadditional years. But it is critical to understand that this is merely \na short term patch and that our Tax Code is woefully outdated, \nmercilessly complicated, and wildly out of control. While the extension \nof these tax rates is a step in the right direction, let us not forget \nthat it is only a first step in a long journey to overhaul our broken \nTax Code as our corporate tax rate is the highest in the world--Japan \nis reforming their tax system--and the Tax Code is so horribly complex \nthat, according to the August 2010 report from the President's Economic \nRecovery Advisory Board, that taxpayers spend 7.6 billion hours and \nshell out about $140 billion trying to comply with tax filing \nrequirements in 2008, which is roughly equivalent to 1 percent of the \nGDP. Further, the Treasury Department testified at the recent Finance \nCommittee tax reform hearing that the instruction book for the primary \nindividual income tax form has grown from 52 pages for 1980 to 174 \npages for 2009. The income tax regulations have doubled, from less than \n7,500 pages in 1980 to nearly 15,000 pages today. Between 1980 and \n2008, tax returns filled out using paid preparers have increased from \n38 percent of returns to 58 percent of returns. When software users are \nadded in, about 85 percent of individual income tax returns rely on \nsome form of assistance, either software used by the taxpayer or a \npractitioner.\n  That, my colleagues, is what awaits us in the 112th Congress. I urge \nyou to pass this legislation now so that we can focus on the big \npicture in the new year and the new Congress. Indeed, this legislation \nwill provide the much needed building blocks for our future efforts.\n  The legislation we will pass today gives us a brief but realistic \nwindow to address the multitude of flaws in the current Tax Code, and I \nhave stated that my guiding principles for reform are as follows--\n  First, we should establish a progrowth Tax Code with the fewest \nnumber of economic distortions that raises sufficient revenue to \nfinance our Nation's spending priorities.\n  Second, our Tax Code should be simplified to reduce the burden of \ncompliance.\n  Third, we must end the fiscal ``shell game'' where we extend tax cuts \nfor only a year or two at a time or make them temporary to mask their \ntrue long-term costs.\n  Fourth, the Tax Code should promote savings and investment, the \ndrivers of long-term growth.\n  Fifth, the Tax Code must not be a barrier to American business \ncompetitiveness in the global economy. We have the second highest \ncorporate tax burden in the industrialized world today.\n  Finally, our Tax Code must remain progressive and distribute the tax \nburden fairly.\n  With that, I urge my colleagues to extend existing tax relief--and \nplan to move expeditiously to enact a sustainable tax system very soon.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate voted on the tax bill \ncompromise that was fashioned by the President and Republican leaders \nin the Congress.\n  I voted against the compromise.\n  I recognize that the Republicans in Congress put the President in the \nposition of having to agree to things in the compromise that he \nstrongly objected to. And I also realize that compromise is essential \nto move forward and to try to fix what is wrong with our economy.\n  But here is the dilemma. We have two very serious problems that can \nundermine America's economic future. First is the crushing debt in our \nfiscal policy. Our debt is currently over $13 trillion with a yearly \ndeficit of over $1 trillion. This proposal will substantially increase \nthat debt which I believe will continue to undermine the confidence \npeople have in this country's future.\n  The estimate that this agreement will increase the debt by over $1 \ntrillion is far short of what will actually happen. The tax cut \nextensions are for 2 years and I am certain that in 2 years, in the \nmiddle of an election campaign, the tax cuts will be further extended. \nThe total cost of those tax cuts for a decade will be to add $4 \ntrillion to the Federal debt. Again, I think that will undermine any \nconfidence the American people or, for that matter, others in the world \nwill have about our ability to rein in a fiscal policy that has us \nborrowing 40 percent of everything we spend in the Federal Government.\n  The second serious problem that we face is the slow rate of economic \ngrowth that is unlikely to create jobs at a pace that we need. I \nunderstand that in order to address this problem we would want to have \na further economic stimulus to extend the growth of the economy. \nHowever, this economy has been about as stimulated as any economy in \nhistory. Adding more stimulus through borrowing seems to me is not the \nway to promote confidence or economic growth.\n  Earlier in the week I voted for cloture because I did not want to \nblock a compromise on these matters. However, the specific compromise \nwhich we voted on yesterday I believe falls short of what the country \nneeds, especially in dealing with what I believe is the controlling \nissue of a crushing Federal debt and therefore an erosion of confidence \nin our economy.\n  The fact that this agreement was flawed was not the President's \nfault. Rather, it was due to the position of the Republicans insisting \non the extension of tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. Without that \nconcession, the Republicans made it clear they were going to block any \ncompromise.\n  If our country is going to remain a world economic power we need to \nmake good decisions and courageous decisions to fix the things we know \nare wrong. In order to do that, the President is going to need help. It \nrequires more willingness to compromise on the part of the Republicans \nthan they have shown recently.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this week, the U.S. Senate took an \nimportant vote to prevent the largest tax increase in American \nhistory--and help get America's job creators off the sidelines.\n  I voted for this bill for one simple reason: raising taxes during a \nrecession on anyone is not a good idea.\n  This bill prevents tax increases on every American who pays income \ntaxes, because it keeps the lowest\n\n[[Page S10404]]\n\nbracket at 10 percent; keeps the highest bracket 35 percent; preserves \nrelief from the marriage penalty--as well as the $1,000 per child tax \ncredit; blocks higher taxes on capital gains and dividends; protects at \nleast 21 million families from the alternative minimum tax; and reduces \nthe ``death tax'' by 20 percent from what it would have been on January \n1.\n  Some of my fellow conservatives have reservations about this bill, \nand I share them. This bill certainly falls far short of what I think \nwe would see if Republicans controlled both Chambers of Congress and \nthe White House. I think we would see a permanent extension of all the \n2001 and 2003 tax relief; a much lower estate tax; and zero new \nspending or tax breaks for special interests.\n  But given that President Obama will hold the veto pen for at least 2 \nmore years--and given all the class-warfare rhetoric that the President \nand the majority have indulged in over the last few years--I consider \nan extension of tax relief for every American taxpayer to be a \nremarkable legislative achievement for Republicans. One pundit summed \nup the agreement this way: ``If someone had told me, the day after \nElection Day 2008, that tax rates on income and capital would not \nincrease for the next four years, I would have laughed at them. Now \nit's about to come true, and Presidents Obama and Clinton are helping \nmake it happen.''\n  The only thing I would add to that statement is that several of my \ncolleagues deserve credit for making this agreement happen--especially \nSenator McConnell, Senator Kyl, and Senator Grassley.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have also raised \nobjections to this legislation--and I would like to respond to just one \nof those objections: the claim that it is hypocritical to say you are \nconcerned about the deficit but then vote to keep taxes low on American \nfamilies and small businesses.\n  Let me set the record straight on what actually happened to the \ndeficit once the tax relief Congress originally passed in 2001 and 2003 \nbegan to kick in to our economy. As our colleagues remind us \nconstantly, deficits did go up during the first years of the Bush \nadministration--in part due to the collapse of the dot-com bubble, the \nrecession, and 9/11. In fact, by fiscal year 2004, the deficit was up \nto $413 billion, or 3.5 percent of GDP.\n  But then, just as the 2001 and 2003 tax relief started to kick in, a \nstrange thing happened to the deficit: It went down to $318 billion in \nfiscal year 2005, then down again to $248 billion in fiscal year 2006, \nand then down to $161 billion in fiscal year 2007. By then our deficit \nwas only 1.2 percent of GDP.\n  Now why did the deficit go down in those years? One big reason is \nthat tax relief helped grow the economy; got about 8 million more \npeople on the payroll between 2003 and 2007; and therefore generated \nmore tax revenue.\n  I think the person who said it best was Austin Goolsbee, the chairman \nof the President's Council of Economic Advisers. On ``Meet the Press'' \nSunday, he had this to say: ``You cannot reduce the deficit if the \neconomy is not growing, period.'' I agree.\n  Now I also agree that preventing a massive tax increase is not the \nonly thing we must do to get our national debt under control. We must \ncut government spending--and that means killing the $1.3 trillion \nomnibus spending bill the majority introduced yesterday. We must study \nthe proposals of the President's Debt Commission--and take action to \nprevent the looming fiscal catastrophe that they described. We must \naddress head-on the need for reform in our entitlement programs like \nSocial Security and Medicare--and put them on a sustainable path. And \nwe must pass a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n  We can begin addressing all of these tough decisions in just a few \nweeks--once the new Congress elected by the American people is sworn \nin. Today, our urgent decision is whether we want taxes to go up on \nJanuary 1, or rather extend the tax relief and remove a huge element of \nuncertainty among our job creators.\n  I believe the choice is clear, and so do the American people. 69 \npercent of the American people support this legislation, according to a \npoll released yesterday by the Washington Post and ABC News.\n  As usual, the American people have got it right.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "16", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/16/senate-section/article/S10404-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RECOGNIZING THE FBI\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the men and women \nof the FBI's Baltimore field office who have prevented yet another \ncatastrophic terrorist attack on our Nation. Similar to the plot to \nbomb the tree lighting ceremony in Portland, OR, over the recent \nThanksgiving holiday weekend, the outstanding work of the men and women \nof the FBI's Baltimore field office was successful in infiltrating and \nthwarting the planned bombing of a military recruitment center in \nCatonsville, MD. This deplorable scheme was meant to harm the young men \nand women who sacrifice so much for our country by serving in the Armed \nForces. That is why I am grateful for the FBI's months of careful, \ncovert and skillful investigations and operations to disrupt this plot, \nput the terrorist behind bars, and keep Marylanders safe.\n  This is the second time in as many weeks that the FBI has stopped a \nterrorist plot to harm Americans here at home, reminding us they are on \nthe job 24 hours a day 7 days a week keeping the United States safe. \nWhether they are catching sexual predators who exploit children on the \nInternet, targeting scammers who prey on hard-working, middle-class \nfamilies with mortgage fraud schemes, stopping cyber crooks from \nhacking into U.S. networks, or preventing terrorists bent on murder and \ndestruction from acquiring weapons of mass destruction, the FBI is \ncommitted to protecting our communities with fidelity, bravery and \nintegrity. This job is not easy and most of the time the good work done \nby FBI employees does not make headlines, but they remain committed to \ntheir mission of fighting to protect 300 million Americans nonetheless.\n  A tremendous amount of detective work was carried out by the FBI and \ntheir Federal, State and local law enforcement and homeland security \npartners to prevent this attack and save lives. The takedown went \nexactly as planned, and that can be attributed to professionalism and \ndiligence displayed by the many agencies involved. Leading the charge \nwas the Joint Terrorism Task Force, which was integral in coordinating \na multiagency team that investigated the threat thoroughly and ensured \nthe safety of Marylanders. In addition, I want to praise the critical \ncontributions to the investigation by the Baltimore City Police \nDepartment, Baltimore County Police Department, Maryland State Police, \nNaval Criminal Investigative Service, Army Recruiting Command, Air \nForce Recruitment Command, Air Force Office of Special Investigations, \nArmy 902d Military Intelligence Group, Defense Criminal Investigative \nServices (DCIS) and other DOD components, U.S. Marshals Service, and \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement.\n  As chairwoman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, \nJustice, and Science, I know firsthand the importance of the national \nsecurity responsibilities shouldered by the FBI as they protect us from \nboth homegrown and international terrorism. In a time when many \nAmericans eye the Federal institutions with wariness and disapproval, \nthe FBI continues getting the job done and restoring confidence in our \ngovernment's ability to keep us safe. Again, I congratulate the FBI's \nbrave men and women for their tireless efforts in protecting our \ncommunities, and say to them, ``Keep up the fight!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "16", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/16/senate-section/article/S10404-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10404-S10405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ARGENTINA DEBT DEFAULT\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the debt default \nof the Republic of Argentina. Since it defaulted on its debt 9 years \nago, the nation has ignored the judgments of American courts even \nthough Argentina committed to honor such judgments when the debt was \noriginally issued.\n  In 2001, Argentina defaulted on over $81 billion in sovereign debt, \nthe largest default in modern history. American creditors were heavily \nexposed to the losses that resulted from that default and Argentina's \ndebt restructuring. Despite paying off certain creditors in full, \nArgentina still owes U.S. bondholders over $3 billion while holding \nnearly $54 billion in reserves.\n\n[[Page S10405]]\n\n  Bondholders have won over 100 U.S. Federal court judgments against \nArgentina. Additionally, Argentina has not paid claims brought by U.S. \ncompanies and other bondholders in international forums, which have \ncollectively issued over $900 million in judgments against Argentina.\n  I have been approached on this matter by my constituents in \nMississippi who are concerned about the outstanding court judgments. \nThe issue of Argentina's default also reaches beyond my state's borders \nto every U.S. taxpayer because some of these losses are qualified tax \ndeductions.\n  In light of my concerns, I am considering introducing legislation \nnext year to address this issue. This is a step I hope I do not have to \nmake, but I believe previous obligations should be honored.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "16", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/16/senate-section/article/S10405-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PORTEOUS IMPEACHMENT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to address two matters \nconcerning the impeachment of Judge Porteous. As a former Federal \nprosecutor and State attorney general, I have reviewed and drafted a \nnumber of indictments. I do not believe that evidence of acts committed \nbefore confirmation should be withheld from consideration in the \nimpeachment process or that it is inappropriate to aggregate claims \ntogether.\n  The Constitution does not require that all conduct be committed post \nFederal appointment nor does it stipulate at all when the conduct must \noccur. Whether treason or bribery occurs before or after confirmation \nis not the question, but whether or not it occurred. If this were not \nso, individuals like Judge Porteous, who are very capable of practicing \nthe art of deception and are confirmed, could not be removed from \noffice.\n  I believe that all four counts against Judge Porteous were well \ndrafted. The Senate has previously stated that ``the House has \nsubstantial discretion in determining how to aggregate related alleged \nacts of misconduct in framing Articles of Impeachment and has \nhistorically frequently chosen to aggregate multiple factual \nallegations in a single impeachment article . . . Judge Porteous \nengaged in a number of elaborate schemes. Having prosecuted fraud, \nconspiracy, and racketeering cases, I understand that the facts in \nthese types of cases can be extensive and can build up over a period of \nyears.

M. President, it is with a heavy heart that I honor the \nlife and heroic service of SPC Matthew W. Ramsey. Specialist Ramsey, \nassigned to the 101st Airborne Division, based in Fort Campbell, KY, \ndied on November 29, 2010, of injuries sustained when his unit faced \nsmall arms fire. Specialist Ramsey was serving in support of Operation \nEnduring Freedom in Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan. He was 20 years \nold.\n  A native of Quartz Hill, CA, Specialist Ramsey graduated from Quartz \nHill High School in 2008 and enlisted in the Army. He served two tours \nof duty in Afghanistan, both with decoration. Among many other awards, \nSpecialist Ramsey earned the National Defense Service Medal, the Global \nWar on Terrorism Medal, and the NATO Medal.\n  During over 2 years of service, Specialist Ramsey distinguished \nhimself through his courage, dedication to duty, and unremitting \ncommitment to family. Shortly after enlistment, Specialist Ramsey \nlearned from his wife that he was to become a father. He saw the Army \nas a path to attaining a bright future for his new family. His wife, \nMirella, is expecting a second child in early 2011.\n  Specialist Ramsey worked on the front lines of battle, serving in the \nmost dangerous areas of Afghanistan. He is remembered by those who knew \nhim as a consummate professional with an unending commitment to \nexcellence. His family remembers him as a dedicated son, husband, and \nfather.\n  Mark Twain once said, ``The fear of death follows from the fear of \nlife. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.'' \nSpecialist Ramsey's service was in keeping with this sentiment by \nselflessly putting country first, he lived life to the fullest. He \nlived with a sense of the highest honorable purpose.\n  At substantial personal risk, he braved the chaos of combat zones \nthroughout Afghanistan. And though his fate on the battlefield was \nuncertain, he pushed forward, protecting America's citizens, her \nsafety, and the freedoms we hold dear. For his service and the lives he \ntouched, Specialist Ramsey will forever be remembered as one of our \ncountry's bravest.\n  To Wayne and Melissa, Specialist Ramsey's parents, Mirella, his wife, \nZachary, his son, and his entire family I cannot imagine the sorrow you \nmust be feeling.

He was serving in support \nof Operation Enduring Freedom in Khost Province, Afghanistan.

Sergeant Thode \nserved as an officer in the Farmington, New Mexico, police department \nfor 14 years. He was a senior member of the SWAT team and also served \nin the Army National Guard, deploying for tours in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  During his years of service, Sergeant Thode distinguished himself \nthrough his courage, dedication to duty, and willingness to take on any \njob.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a good friend \nand former colleague of mine, former Congressman Stephen Solarz, who \npassed away late last month at the age of 70. I would like to take this \nmoment to convey my heartfelt condolences to Stephen's wife, Nina, the \nrest of his family, and everyone else who knew, worked with, and \nenjoyed Stephen during his life.\n  Stephen and I were both elected to the House of Representatives for \nthe first time in 1974, members of a historic class of 75 Democratic \nfreshmen who came to Washington in the wake of the Watergate scandal. \nStephen remained a stalwart of the House, serving the people of his \nBrooklyn-based congressional district with distinction for nearly two \ndecades.\n  Throughout his tenure in Congress, Stephen was always attentive to \nthe needs of his constituents, even going so far as to nickname himself \n``Representative Pothole'' for his work on local issues. But in spite \nof this, Stephen's tenure was perhaps most clearly defined by his work \non foreign policy issues. As a member of the House Foreign Affairs \nCommittee throughout his nine terms, Stephen demonstrated a strong and \nabiding passion for world affairs. Indeed, during his first month in \noffice, Stephen went on an 18-day congressional delegation trip to the \nMiddle East, meeting with the leaders of Israel, Syria, Jordan, and \nEgypt.\n  Beginning in 1979, Stephen took on some important leadership \npositions within the committee, serving first as chairman of the \nSubcommittee on African Affairs, and subsequently as chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs. During that time, Stephen \nwas absolutely committed to ensuring that human rights and respect for \nthe rule of law remained key pillars of U.S. policy in those regions.\n  He was an uncompromising supporter of sanctions against the apartheid \nregime in South Africa; one of Congress's most vocal and persistent \ncritics of the authoritarian government led by Ferdinand Marcos in the \nPhilippines; and a tireless advocate of peace in Cambodia. Stephen was \nalso a strong proponent of diplomacy and engagement, becoming the first \nUnited States Congressman to visit North Korea in nearly three decades \nin 1980. And perhaps just as significantly, Stephen was a committed \ndefender of the House of Representatives who worked extremely hard to \ncarve out a more prominent place for that body in foreign policy \ndiscussions.\n  As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee myself, I had \nthe opportunity to work with Stephen on a number of occasions. And I \nmust say that I was consistently impressed by Stephen's tenacity, \nintelligence, and commitment to justice and democracy. In nearly \neverything he did as a Member of Congress, Stephen was always well-\nprepared, knew the issues inside and out, and was not afraid to \nchallenge those with whom he disagreed. That is the Stephen Solarz that \nmy colleagues and I got to know over the years, and that is, in my \nview, the kind of Congressman Stephen will most be remembered as.\n  Once again, I would like to express my sincere condolences to \nStephen's family and all those individuals who, like me, had the \nprivilege of knowing him over the years. And I take this opportunity to \nthank Stephen for his many years of service to this country and his \ntireless efforts to create a more just and peaceful world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "16", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/16/senate-section/article/S10406-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10406-S10407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING RICHARD HOLBROOKE\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I pay \ntribute to the memory of my friend Richard Holbrooke, who passed away \nearlier this week. Richard was a masterful diplomat who brought his \nextraordinary skills to bear on some of the thorniest issues in U.S. \nforeign policy. Every step of the way, from his tremendous \naccomplishments at the Dayton Accords to his work as U.S. Special Envoy \nfor Afghanistan and Pakistan, he showed his deep commitment to our \ncountry, and to serving the greater good the world over.\n  I came to know Richard when we travelled to Africa together in 1999, \nwhen he was serving as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. He had \nnever been to Africa before, and yet on the trip he was able to \nthoroughly grasp the complex issues facing the continent immediately. \nHis brilliance was apparent, and it enabled him to identify emerging \nissues quickly and push for critical action. On that trip our purpose \nwas to focus on the crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo, but we \nalso saw the incredible devastation of the HIV/AIDS crisis firsthand. \nRichard called then-U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and told him that \nthe Security Council needed to address AIDS directly. When the \nSecretary-General responded that the Security Council only addressed \nsecurity issues, Richard replied that this was, indeed, a security \nissue. He was right, and the Security Council's subsequent discussion \nwas a turning point as the world community began to understand the \ndepth and severity of the crisis on the African continent.\n  In the years since, Richard always made time to discuss foreign \npolicy issues with me, and he always truly listened and wanted to \nunderstand my point of view, even when we disagreed. This was \nespecially true of his work on Afghanistan and Pakistan. We didn't \nalways see eye to eye about U.S. policy in the region, but he always \nreached out to me and solicited my views, and I was so appreciative of \nthat. Those efforts on his part said volumes about him and his \nthoughtful approach to the complex issues he worked on with such \ncommitment and such skill.\n  We had breakfast the morning after one of his last trips. I could see \nthe toll his work was taking on him, but he was terrific to be with as \nusual. He was completely engaging and interested in my perspective, yet \nstill managed to work the whole room, multitasking as always.\n  Richard Holbrooke was an extraordinary man of many talents who spent \nhis life building a better, more just\n\n[[Page S10407]]\n\nworld for us all. His many accomplishments will live on as a testament \nto his profound commitment to our nation and to a life of public \nservice. But for me, I will simply miss him as a friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "16", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/16/senate-section/article/S10407-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THANKING STAFF\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Her \nphenomenal attention to detail and thoroughness, in addition to her \ndedication and good humor has made her an invaluable asset to the \ncommittee.\n  I would also like to recognize Samantha Hamilton, Susan Oursler, as \nwell as Gail Coppage for their hard work and dedication.\n  Last, I would like to thank Frank Lowenstein, staff director of the \ncommittee, whom I have gotten to know over the years, including during \na trip we took together to the Middle East. I had the privilege of \nknowing Frank's father, Al Lowenstein, and I can say without a doubt \nhow proud he would be of his son Frank.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "16", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/16/senate-section/article/S10407-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           MILWAUKEE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL\n\n Mr. KOHL.

The \nMBCTC remains true to its founding principles to represent its members \nin the building and construction trades for justice on the job, better \nwages and never sacrificing quality for its customers.

Mr. President, today I wish to introduce to you \none of my constituents, Lawrence ``Rip'' Kirby of Rutland, VT, who has \nwritten to me outlining his ideas on how Congress can and should \naddress our $13.8 trillion national debt in a fair and sensible way. I \nam pleased the citizens of Vermont are engaged on this issue, which is \nof critical importance to not only our State, but indeed the Nation. \nThe decisions that we make on the Senate floor today will impact \ngenerations of Americans to come. That is why I would like to share \nwith you what Mr. Kirby wrote:\n\n       To reduce the deficit and accumulated debt we must \n     understand their root causes and history:\n       Short-term problem: The near-collapse of the economy was \n     arrested by means of deficit spending, including corporate \n     bailouts, extended unemployment benefits, and stimulus \n     initiatives. While arguably necessary to stave off an even \n     worse catastrophe, these measures have added to the deficit \n     and the debt.\n       Solution(s): Our emphasis should not be on recovery of sunk \n     costs but on prevention of future disasters. Break up ``too \n     large to fail'' businesses through anti-trust laws. Regulate \n     imprudent, secretive, or unfathomable financial arrangements \n     like derivatives. Increase regulated safety margins like \n     reserve requirements for banks and loan limits based on \n     borrower credit ratings. Eliminate conflicts of interest like \n     permitting bond rating agencies to have a financial stake in \n     the companies they rate.\n       Medium-term problem: Our wars overseas have been funded by \n     massive deficits with no real strategy for repayment. The \n     unexpected length and intractability of these conflicts \n     exacerbates the problem.\n       Solution(s): Stop the financial bleeding and provide a \n     financial transfusion. To stop the bleeding we must get out \n     of these conflicts within a short time (two years at most). \n     Continue intelligence-gathering and maintain air power, but \n     get the boots off the ground. To provide a transfusion, enact \n     a temporary and progressive ``war surtax'' with a sunset \n     provision.\n       Long-term problem: Entitlement spending (Medicare, Social \n     Security, etc.) has exceeded its funding as America's \n     longevity has climbed faster than its typical retirement age \n     without tax increases to keep up. The mass retirement of the \n     baby boomers will aggravate this problem as they become \n     greater consumers of entitlements and a lesser source of \n     taxes.\n       Solution(s): Recognize that longevity is really an \n     advantage, and make better use of people's lengthening \n     ability to work and to contribute. In short, this means \n     gradually raising the age of entitlement eligibility. We must \n     also end the regressive and irrational Social Security tax \n     exemption for earnings above $108,000.\n       Long term problem: Our K-12 school system has deteriorated \n     while foreign students have surged ahead in critical subjects \n     like math, science, and language skills. The underlying cause \n     is debated endlessly, but I believe we have replaced the hard \n     work of learning with trendy feel-good initiatives that \n     represent the path of least resistance for both educators and \n     students. We also underfund education, thereby encouraging \n     the employment of second-rate teachers, curricula, and \n     facilities. This exacerbates the deficit by degrading our tax \n     base as emerging generations of Americans are prepared for \n     only menial jobs paying low wages.\n       Solution(s): Stop experimenting and do what works--get back \n     to basics and pay for excellence. Reward teachers who \n     cultivate competence. Emphasize math, science, and language \n     skills, as well as less tangible, but important skills like \n     inquiry and logic. Recognize sports programs as a way to \n     teach critical social skills, not as a career path. Treat \n     standardized testing as a means to excellence, not as an end \n     in itself. And finally, forget self esteem--it will come on \n     its own when it is earned.''\n       Lawrence ``Rip'' Kirby\n       Rutland, Vt.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President, for allowing me to share with you these \nwords of wisdom from an average Vermonter. I hope my colleagues in the \nSenate take note of Mr. Kirby's sage advice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "16", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/16/senate-section/article/S10407-4", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10407-S10408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING HARBOR FARM\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, every holiday season, Americans head \nto stores in droves to buy the perfect gift for their loved ones or \nfriends during the holiday season. Many will visit small businesses, \nsuch as gift shops and local retailers, which offer a variety of \nproducts. There is one such store in my home State of Maine, Harbor \nFarm, that helps keep the Christmas spirit alive year round through a \nvariety of products that celebrate the season.\n  Harbor Farm is located on Little Deer Isle, a tiny island located off \nMaine's coast in Penobscot Bay. The island is both a picturesque summer \nvacationland as well as the year-round home to 300 residents. And \nHarbor Farm caters to locals and tourists alike with a variety of \nregional and international gifts, from candles to apparel and most \neverything in between. The store also carries gifts made by another \nlocal small business, the Deer Isle Granite Company, including \nbeautiful clocks in the shape of the State of Maine as well as cutting \nboards and coasters.\n  Additionally, Harbor Farm has a unique ``Christmas Room,'' with a \nplethora of thoughtful and creative goods and wares. More than simply \nholiday-themed gifts, the Christmas Room features exceptional items \ninspired by Maine, including blueberry jewelry\n\n[[Page S10408]]\n\nmade using blue sponge coral as well as moose and snowman ornaments. \nHarbor Farm also offers delightful Christmas wreaths, made from Maine \nbalsam and beautifully decorated with traditional cones, berries, and \nbows. In that same vein, the store also sells a number of centerpieces \nof cedar, balsam, and pine, adorned with candles and faux fruits. \nHarbor Farm readily ships these special holiday gifts and decorations \nacross the country to a growing list of customers each year.\n  Another item Harbor Farm specializes in is remarkable tile. The \ncompany offers customers a wide array of beautiful tile from 17 States \nand 17 countries for any room in the home. The designs range from \ndelicately painted lighthouses and landscapes to flowers and farmyards. \nThe staff at Harbor Farm takes the time to assist clients looking to \nmix tiles for a more elegant and eclectic visual display.\n  It is evident that the employees of Harbor Farm take great pains to \noffer their customers high quality items for a broad swath of uses in \neveryday life. From its reproductions of early American furniture to \npottery to clothing accessories, Harbor Farm is a quintessential New \nEngland gift shop that has something for everyone. I thank everyone at \nHarbor Farm for their dedicated efforts to provide shoppers with a \npleasant experience, and I wish them many years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "16", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/16/senate-section/article/S10408-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING THE VENERABLE ROS MEY\n\n Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, today I commemorate the \nextraordinary life of Venerable Ros Mey, the head Buddhist monk and \npresident of the Wat Thormikaram Khmer Temple in Providence. Although \nhe passed away on December 12, 2010, at age 85, his teachings of peace \nwill live on in the vibrant Cambodian community of Rhode Island in \nwhich he served.\n  Venerable Mey was ordained as a Buddhist monk in Providence at age 62 \nand dedicated himself to his faith, his congregation, and to praying \nfor peace in Cambodia with his fellow worshipers.\n  Venerable Mey's journey to Rhode Island was a perilous one. He and \nhis family endured forced labor under the Khmer Rouge regime in \nCambodia from 1975 until their escape to Thailand four years later. \nThey made their way to Rhode Island as part of the first wave of \nrefugees from Cambodia. Only several thousand of the 80,000 monks in \nCambodia survived the Khmer Rouge.\n  Venerable Mey turned the adversity he experienced into peaceful \nteachings by dedicating his life to the Cambodian community in our \nState. In 1998 he became head monk and president, succeeding the \nVenerable Maha Ghosananda, also a renowned peace activist. Venerable \nMey was a driving force behind a new worship hall at the Wat \nThormikaram Temple, which is a spiritual center for Cambodian Buddhists \nin Rhode Island and across the Nation.\n  His surviving family, the thousands of Rhode Islanders whose weddings \nand births he officiated, the Cambodian community, and the people of \nour State will remember his teachings of peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "16", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/16/senate-section/article/S10408-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10408-S10409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:33 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1774.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \ngrants for community-based mental health infrastructure improvement; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce, along with my colleague, \nSenator Stabenow, the Community-Based Mental Health Infrastructure \nImprovements Act.\n  Multiple research studies have shown that people with mental illness \nare at greater risk of preventable health conditions such as heart \ndisease and diabetes and are more likely to die sooner than healthy \nindividuals--in some instances up to 25 years sooner. In order to \naddress this troubling trend, I authored language in the new health \ninsurance reform law to ensure that individuals with multiple co-\noccurring mental, behavioral, and physical health conditions have \naccess to a coordinated and integrated health care delivery system. \nUnder this provision, Community Mental Health Centers are authorized to \nprovide patients with mental, behavioral, and primary health care all \nin one location.\n  Recently, I was pleased to learn that two Community Mental Health \nCenters in Rhode Island received funding to begin to offer these co-\nlocated services. However, many Community Mental Health Centers are \nunable to provide this broader range of services due to the limited \nphysical space they occupy. The Community-Based Mental Health \nInfrastructure Improvements Act would authorize grants to states for \nthe construction and modernization of these facilities. Indeed, for \nsome Community Mental Health Centers, facility updates are the first \nstep to enhancing patient care.\n  I am also pleased that this legislation has been included in a \nbroader piece of legislation that I joined Senator Stabenow in \nintroducing today, the Excellence in Mental Health Act. As a member of \nthe Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, I will \ncontinue to work to include these important initiatives in legislation \nthat renews and improves Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration, SAMHSA, programs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4035\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

COMMUNITY-BASED MENTAL HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE \n                   IMPROVEMENT.\n\n       Title V of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 280g et \n     seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n  ``PART H--COMMUNITY-BASED MENTAL HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS\n\n     ``SEC. 560.

Mr. President, I would like to note that we just saw a \nrather extraordinary event on the floor of the Senate. I first came to \nthe U.S. Senate in 1987, and I saw the practice of earmarking and \nporkbarrel spending grow and grow and grow, to the point where last \nNovember 2 the American people overwhelmingly rejected this practice of \nout-of-control spending and debt that we have laid on our children and \nour grandchildren.\n  I also, along with the Republican leader, would like to thank our \nmembers of the Appropriations Committee, who clearly heard that message \nand heard the outcry when the American people began to become aware of \nwhat was contemplated to be done in the Congress of the United States. \nThis outcry reverberated all over America, including the State of \nArizona. And the outcry was finally heard by at least 42 Members on \nthis side of the aisle.\n  So I appreciate the fact the majority leader has agreed to a \ncontinuing resolution. But have no doubt as to why it happened. It \nhappened because the majority leader didn't have the votes. He didn't \nhave 60 votes that would have then allowed for this monstrosity to be \nfoisted off on the American people.\n\n  So I wish to thank Members here on this side of the aisle, and some \non the other side, who also said they were ready to stand up against \nthis. But most of all, I wish to thank the American people. I thank \nthose who made the calls, those who sent the e-mails, those who stood \nup and called in to the talk shows all over America and said: We have \nhad enough. Haven't they listened to the message we were trying to send \non November 2?\n  So I think this is a great victory for the American people today \nbecause we would have spent $1.1 trillion, at least $8 billion of it, \n$8.3 billion, in earmarks that had never had a hearing, that had never \nhad any scrutiny, had never seen the light of day, but had been put in \nby very powerful Members of this body on the Appropriations Committee.\n  So I would like to extend my gratitude to the American people, the \ntea partiers, those who have aligned themselves with the cause to stop \nthe spending and the mortgaging of our children's and grandchildren's \nfuture. We have amassed a $40,000 debt for every man, woman, and child \nin America. The latest commission that reported out clearly indicated \nwe are on a collision course that could bring down the very economy of \nthis country.\n  So I am encouraged greatly by the action taken tonight to do away \nwith this monstrosity and go back to maybe a one-page continuing \nresolution to keep the government in business until the new Members of \nCongress and the new Members of this body who were elected last \nNovember can have their voices heard in the deliberations of this body \nand how their tax dollars are dispensed with and how those that are \nborrowed are dispensed.\n  I see the Senator from Missouri is about to speak. I wish to thank \nher for her efforts in trying to bring about an end to this spending \nspree.\n  So I again wish to express my gratitude to all Members, including \nespecially the tough decision made by the Republican members of the \nAppropriations Committee, to stand so we could stop this thing in its \ntracks. I want to thank the American people whose voices were heard in \nthis body, and that forced the decision that was made today.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  Mr. KIRK. As the most junior people, for those who don't understand \nwhat just happened, did we just win?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think there is very little doubt. The majority leader \nof the U.S. Senate would not have taken the action he just took if he \ndidn't have 41 votes to stop this monstrosity.\n  Mr. KIRK. So for economic conservatives, a 1,924-page bill just died?\n  Mr. McCAIN. A 1,924-page bill just died.\n  Mr. KIRK. And 6,000 earmarks will not now move forward?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes. I feel badly about some of those earmarks because I \nhad so much fun with them.\n  Mr. KIRK. All of the GOP Senators just signed a letter to the \nleadership this morning saying we should not move forward with this as \nrepresentatives of the new mandate. It seems that change has come to \nthe Senate tonight with the death of this $1.1 trillion bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have no doubt.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I----\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am not finished. Do I have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, the Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I appreciate the regular order.\n  This may be a seminal moment in the recent history of the Senate. \nThis may be a seminal moment that stops the practice which has moved \npower all to the appropriators in this body--a few--and taken it away \nfrom the rest of us and may return us to an authorizing and then \nappropriating process. But most importantly, I think it is a seminal \nmoment because for the first time since I have been here, we stood up \nand said: Enough. Stop.\n  Mr. KIRK. I congratulate the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I agree with my colleague from Arizona \non many things when it comes to appropriations, including that I have \nmade a decision that earmarking is not a process that I think is the \nappropriate way to spend public money. But I am a little confused about \nsome of the righteous indignation coming from the Republican side of \nthe aisle about this bill.\n  The omnibus 2010 they have sitting out there--they are wanting the \nAmerican people to think this document came from Democrats. They want \nthe American people to think that omnibus 2010, all of those pages \nsitting there, were done by Democrats. They weren't done by Democrats. \nThose pages were done by Democrats and Republicans. Every bit of that \ndocument was drafted by Republicans and Democrats, right down to the \nearmarks. And for the minority leader to stand here and act as if this \ndocument is something that is the fault of the Democratic Party when he \nwell knows he has been involved--I have been involved in terms of \ntrying to get the number down, and I am glad we succeeded in getting \nthe number down, as has been referenced, to the Sessions-McCaskill \nnumber, but this was a bipartisan effort to get the number down.\n  The irony is, guess who has earmarks in there. The minority leader, \nwho just voted on a moratorium for earmarks 10 minutes ago. Did he pull \nhis earmarks out? No. Did any of the Republicans who voted for a \nmoratorium on earmarks pull their earmarks out before this bill came to \nthe floor? We could have eliminated a few pages. So I just don't think \nthe righteous indignation works.\n  This was a bipartisan effort, drafted by Republicans and Democrats. \nIt came to the floor after months of work by Democrats and Republicans. \nIt was presented to this body in a bipartisan way to vote on. I wasn't \ngoing to vote for it. I am against it. So I think I have a slight bit \nof credibility to call these guys on this notion that this is something \nthat sprung from nowhere out of some back room on the Democratic\n\n[[Page S10417]]\n\nside of the aisle. This sprung from a bipartisan effort of the \nAppropriations Committee, and every Member on that side of the aisle \nknows it. They know it. And they know the earmarks in there--there are \nalmost $700 million of earmarks in there from people who voted on a \nmoratorium on earmarks. That is like being half-pregnant.\n  They should have said, before this bill ever came to the floor--and \nthey were asked: Would you like your earmarks pulled out? No, no. They \nwere perfectly willing to vote no and take those earmarks home.\n  So, on one hand, I would have voted no had we had the vote, and I \nsaid that from day one. I voted no on the omnibus last year. I voted no \non another omnibus because I don't think it is the right way to \nappropriate. But this is an equal-opportunity sin. The problems with \nthis process don't lie on one side of the aisle; they lie on both sides \nof the aisle. And the notion that the Republicans are trying to say \nthis is just about the Democrats is the kind of hypocrisy that gives us \nthe lowest ratings we have in terms of confidence of the American \npeople.\n  We need to own up here. This is not about the Democrats. This is \nabout both sides of the aisle and a flawed appropriations process that \ncouldn't get to the floor because of a lot of obstructionism, and when \nit finally did get to the floor, it came in one package. But it is not \nfair for the Republicans to act as though all those pages came from the \nDemocratic side of the aisle. They certainly did not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Missouri \nfor her work in setting the ceiling that was adhered to. I don't \nsupport this bill, and I didn't ask for any earmarks, and I know the \nSenator from Missouri did not ask for any earmarks.\n  I think there have been a lot of frayed feelings, no question. I \nthink we all know that even at the levels--and I would say that I think \nthe appropriators did agree to a number that was passed out here on the \nfloor. But I think we know that even at those levels, spending is \nhigher than it should be.\n  What I would ask is that the Senator from Missouri and I continue to \nwork together. I know we have an amendment that was going to be a part \nof whatever passed to really cap spending and drive it down to the \nappropriate level of spending relative to our gross domestic product. I \nknow it is going to take both sides of the aisle to do that. I know we \nhave had a deficit reduction commission that has just reported and has \ndone some great work. The Senator from Illinois, to his credit, \ncourageously supported that.\n  So there are a lot of frayed feelings right now. There is a lot that \nhas been attempted to be done here at the end. I know that has created \na lot of conflict.\n  The page is going to turn here soon. The year is going to end. The \nholidays will come, and we will be able to share a few moments with our \nfamilies and then come back. What I hope is that in spite of all that \nhas happened--and again, I did not support this piece of legislation \nfor lots of reasons--many, many reasons. I do agree, though, there was \na ceiling that was set. I agree this is going to cause some damage. But \nit was the right thing. It was the right thing for this bill not to go \nforward, and I hope what we will end up with and have is a continuing \nresolution that will take us for several months.\n  Then I would say to the Senator from Missouri that I look forward to \nworking with her. I look forward to working with the Senator from \nIllinois so we can put in place a construct so that we know where it is \nwe are going. Each year, it is not just that the appropriations bills \ndon't necessarily come forward, and it happens--it has happened in \nyears past. I understand that. They don't necessarily come forward in a \nway that allows us to spend time with them--one a week or maybe two a \nweek or whatever. But it is also that we don't really know where it is \nwe are going. We don't really have a construct that is taking us to a \nplace over time. So it is my hope that we will either vote on something \nbold relating to deficit reduction and tax reform or that we will put \nin place a construct to take us where we need to go.\n  I don't think it does any good to cast blame, candidly. We are where \nwe are. I think the Senate is taking actions that are appropriate and \nresponsible by moving to a short-term CR. The thing I think is most \nbeneficial to us about that is it allows us to very quickly, in \nFebruary or March, start moving toward a downward trending line that I \nthink is much better for our country.\n  I see the Senator from Missouri standing. I think there is a lot we \nas a body have to work on together. That, to me, is the most important \nthing before us, and I hope when we come back we will all work very \nhard to make that happen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Let me just say that had the tone of the minority \nleader's remarks been the same as the Senator from Tennessee, I \nprobably wouldn't have felt as passionately as I did. I agree with the \nSenator from Tennessee about the vote on this bill. I have publicly \nsaid I wouldn't support it. I didn't support it for a number of \nreasons. But if we want to work together, then we have to quit trying \nto score cheap political points.\n  The notion that the minority floor leader tried to give to the \nAmerican people that this bill was somehow concocted in some back room \nby Democrats--everybody knows that is not true. Everybody knows that \nuntil about 8 hours ago, there were a bunch of Republicans voting for \nthis. Now, am I glad they are not voting for it? Candidly, I am. I am \nglad you guys managed to get everybody to not vote for it because I am \nopposed to it. But what I think was most offensive was trying to trot \nthis bill out here and put a label on it and try to say to the American \npeople that this was something that was done at the eleventh hour to be \njammed down people's throats. This was something done in a bipartisan \nway. Thad Cochran had a huge role in that bill, as did every other \nranking member on all of the subcommittees on appropriations. So it is \noffensive to me--it is not that we are defeating the omnibus. I like \nthat. But what is offensive to me is that we have gotten into this bad \nhabit of trying to score cheap political points. And for Senators to \ncome to this floor and say ``we won'' and do this kind of stuff when \nyou know how many Republicans worked hard on provisions in that bill--\nand, in fact, Republicans worked hard--frankly, harder than our side \ndid on McCaskill-Sessions.\n  We had 17 Democrats supporting it. You had unanimous support. I was \npleased that we came together in that bipartisan way to bring the \nnumber down. We won in bringing the number down to the level \nRepublicans wanted, along with 17 Democrats. That is what Sessions-\nMcCaskill was. I think if we can go forward in the manner the Senator \nfrom Tennessee has spoken of, then it is important that we quit trying \nto mislead somehow the American people that the bill we were going to \nconsider was the product of the Democratic Party, because it wasn't. \nThat is what causes frayed feelings.\n  You know, the Senator from Tennessee and I have had long discussions. \nHe was surprised to hear about how angry we were on this side and some \nof the tactics that were being used. I was surprised to hear about how \nangry some of the Senators on the Republican side were at some of the \ntactics that were being used. If there is going to be a moment that we \ncome together, then we need to work a little harder at not scoring \ncheap political points such as were scored a few minutes ago by the \nminority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Tennessee, I \nsigned on to the Sessions-McCaskill bill because I think we need to get \nsomewhere with the deficit. We signed a resolution letter to get it \nunder control. I wasn't planning to speak. I was going to head home. \nBut it triggered me when one of our colleagues on that side said, ``who \nwins tonight?'' That is not what this should be about. It is not who \nwins or loses. The American people are losing every day that we have \nthis bickering that goes on. Honestly, I didn't see the pile of paper \nwith the logo on it until I got to my seat. That is not necessary for \nus to get on with our business.\n  I was listening to the Senator from Tennessee, who was a former \nmayor,\n\n[[Page S10418]]\n\nand I was a former mayor. He was talking like a mayor. That is what we \nneed here, people who think in the long term, how we get there. That is \nwhere we need to go. I didn't come here to hear the bickering that just \nwent on a little bit ago and see the prop that was brought out. That is \nnot why Alaska sent me here.\n  Who wins and loses? My State of Alaska is losing tonight, because we \ncannot get our work done after a year. Almost a quarter of the Senate \nsat and worked on this in multiple committees to get this bill to us. \nHere we are. We can argue the timing and all that, but the fact is, I \nlook to both Democrats and Republicans on the Appropriations Committee. \nI listen to them, and my staff works with them to hear about the bill \nthat is being put together. I am impressed all the time when I hear the \nvotes that come out of there. They are almost unanimous. That is rare \nin this world we live in here. We cannot continue to bring props like \nthat down and say who wins and loses, and then giggle about it as they \nleave the floor.\n  The public is fed up with that. If there is one thing they told us in \nNovember, it was to get busy and quit the gamesmanship. So I am looking \nforward to the Senator's comments. We had a very productive meeting \ntalking about tax reform, deficit management, and how we need to \ncontrol spending. That is the direction we have to go in. But we are \nnot going to get there with these games. I know both sides--and you are \nright, we should not cast blame. We are all at fault here. This may be \nthe moment that we finally say to ourselves, no more show and tell, no \nmore gimmicks. Let's get serious, and the winners should be the \nAmerican people. I sat here and listened to the Senator and I feel like \nthe mayor was coming out of him. As a former mayor, he has had to reach \nacross to both sides. Senator Gregg said in his farewell speech that we \nget work done between the 40 yard lines. He is right. We have to get \nback there and quit being on the fringes for the media that sits up \nhere, and wherever else they watch us from.\n  I am looking forward to maybe going home and getting a good night's \nsleep and coming back with a fresh attitude tomorrow. I am controlling \nmy emotions as best I can tonight. The words of the Senator from \nTennessee--I wish those were the words that started the debate tonight. \nThat is not what happened. I look forward to whatever we can do to get \nthrough this maze and get on with the show and get what the American \npeople are looking for, and that is results from the Congress maybe \nwill go from 13 percent popularity to 14 percent approval.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Tennessee for \nthe kind words about the deficit commission. It was a controversial \nvote. I think it was the right vote to deal with our deficit and the \nproblems we face.\n  I want to put what happened tonight into some perspective in light of \nthe deficit commission. First, the Omnibus appropriations bill. The \ntotal amount being spent there was $1.108 trillion. The amount of that \nbill that was earmarked for specific projects was less than 1 percent \nof that--$8 billion out of $1.108 trillion. That is less than 1 \npercent. And that was within the total amount we were limited to spend. \nIt wasn't as if we added it on. We were given a total amount, and less \nthan 1 percent of it was earmarked as to where it was going, with \ncomplete transparency and disclosure. Again, it was $8 billion.\n  It troubles me when I hear Members come to the floor, as some did a \nfew minutes ago on the other side, saying we put an end to porkbarrel \nspending, and now we are dealing with our deficit. Well, $8 billion is \na lot of money to anybody, but in the context of the debt we face as a \nnation and the need to address it, it is not significant. It is not \nsignificant in that context.\n  I think about the fact that yesterday most of us voted--81 of us--for \na tax bill, and included in that tax bill were tax cuts for people who \nwere pretty well off in America; $20 billion a year in tax cuts for the \nrichest estates in America to escape Federal taxation--$20 billion. We \nvoted yesterday, and there weren't a lot of high-fives and glorious \nspeeches given about the fact that we were adding $20 billion to the \ndeficit with that vote yesterday for the wealthiest people in America. \nAnd $70 billion of it was for tax cuts for people making over a million \ndollars a year. Nobody came here and talked about deficits then. In \nfact, it was considered out of bounds.\n  We decided yesterday, on a bipartisan basis--and I joined in--that \ngetting this economy moving again was critically important. That is why \nI voted for it--even though two of those provisions I particularly \nloathe. That is the nature of a compromise.\n  I want us to remember, as we talk about going to CRs and reducing \nspending, the tax bill we passed yesterday, which the House may pass \ntoday, is a stimulus to a weak economy, in an effort to help \nbusinesses, help individuals create more demands for goods and \nservices, and create more jobs and reduce unemployment. That is what it \nis.\n  As we take spending out of the Federal side of this equation, we are \nremoving money from the economy. The deficit commission was sensitive \nto this and said that before you start the cuts in spending for deficit \nreduction, get well, get the patient well first. Stop the bleeding \nbefore you address the fractured bone. Stop the bleeding of the \nrecession. That is why the deficit commission did not call for \nsignificant spending cuts until January of 2013. We talked about it for \na long time. If we let the deficit break--and that is what we are going \nto hear, I am afraid, for some time to come--too early, this economy is \ngoing to sputter and fail.\n  We cannot let that happen. It is not in the interest of either \npolitical party. We have to find the right combination that moves us \ntoward long-term deficit reality but the short-term economic reality we \nface. I think the deficit commission got the right balance. I hope we \ncan build on that. I say to Senator Corker and Senator Alexander, if at \nthe end of the day those of us in the Senate who voted for the deficit \ncommission--in this case, it would be Senator Conrad, Senator Crapo, \nSenator Coburn, and myself--if we could reach the point where we come \ntogether in a bipartisan budget resolution based on that deficit \ncommission, if we have a Senate budget resolution--and take the word \n``bipartisan'' out of it--that reflects the feelings of that deficit \ncommission, then that commission will have been a success and put us on \nthe right track, and we can stand strong together.\n\n  I hope you agree that would be the best thing for this country. I \nhope we can reach that point. I thank the Senator for his kind words.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague from \nTennessee, Senator Corker, for his usual common sense, as well as the \nassistant Democratic leader, Senator Durbin, for his courage on the \ndebt commission.\n  I believe that the decision made tonight about the omnibus bill is \nbest for the country, but there could have been a better result. It \nwould have been along the lines of what the Senator from Illinois \ndescribed. If we had been able earlier in the year to agree on a budget \nin the Senate, which is how much are we going to spend, and if we could \nhave gone committee by committee--and there are 13 subcommittees, and \nwe both serve on the Appropriations Committee--and we could have \nbrought those to the floor by August, voted on them, and got on with it \nso the government could run, that would by far be a better result.\n  There is no need to say why that didn't happen, whether it was a \nDemocratic or Republican fault. It didn't happen. So that falls on all \nof us to look ahead and see if it can't happen in the future. I believe \nit can. In fact, I believe that it must. We have a time coming up next \nyear when we will be asked to raise the debt ceiling. We will have \nbefore us a recommendation from the debt commission that five of the \nsix Senators who served on it voted for. They stuck their necks way out \nto do that. The Senator from Illinois, the Senator from North Dakota, \nand three Republican Senators, as well. So I think it is incumbent upon \nall of us--we can find points of division fairly easily. That is not \nhard to do. Finding points of consensus is harder. Cutting taxes is \neasier. Reducing the debt is going to be harder.\n  So in the next 3 or 4 months, when we come back, I hope we will build \non the\n\n[[Page S10419]]\n\nconversation that I heard earlier this week with Senators Warner and \nChambliss, and a group of nearly 20 Senators on both sides, who \ncommitted themselves to work on the debt commission. I hope we can, in \nthe Appropriations Committee, start out the year with some way of \nagreeing on a ceiling, and then work together to work within that \nceiling so we can run the government.\n  A continuing resolution for a year is a lousy way to run a \ngovernment. It wastes money, because you end up funding things that \nshould be cut and not funding things that need increases. I think this \nwas the right result for the American people of the choices we had \ntonight. But there could be a better choice. It is our responsibility \nto see next year if we can offer ourselves, and therefore the American \npeople, that choice.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. I also thank the Senator from Illinois. I thank the \nsenior Senator from Tennessee, who is always doing and saying the right \nthing from the floor and leads us in such a great way.\n  I say to the Senator from Illinois, through the Chair, I hope there \nis some way that we don't let what happened over the course of the last \n3 months on the deficit reduction commission go to waste. I fear that \nwhat is happening right now is that people are beginning to talk about \nsome kind of situation where we then revisit all of these things for \nthe next year or so. I know I am not privy to all the details that all \nof you worked on for so long, but I do think when this debt ceiling \nvote comes up, which will be in April, May, or maybe the first week in \nJune, it seems to me that is the next moment in the Senate.\n  I talked with some of the members of the deficit reduction commission \non my side and certainly look forward to talking to the Senator from \nIllinois about the same thing. I hope there is a way that we actually \nvote on something that is real and not kick this down the road with \nsome meaningless resolution that makes the American people think we \nhave done something, when in actuality we have done nothing and just \nkicked it down the road.\n  I thank the Chair and I hope that is the case.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
