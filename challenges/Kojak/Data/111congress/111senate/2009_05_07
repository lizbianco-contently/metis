The majority \nwill control the first half and the Republicans will control the second \nhalf.\n  Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of \nS. 454, the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act.\n  Last night we were able to reach an agreement to limit the number of \nfirst-degree amendments to the bill.

This is a \ncomplicated piece of legislation. They worked on it together. They \nworked with the White House, they worked with the minority staff, the \nmajority staff, and they were able to get this agreement with exemplary \nwork. I commend and applaud both of these fine Senators for allowing us \nto move to this extremely important legislation.

Madam President, 19 years ago, after narrowly \nwinning my first statewide race for Governor in Nebraska, I was \nconcerned about the significant budget challenges and economic downturn \nwe faced. Today, the United States is confronted by financial troubles \non a much larger scale.\n  Among them, we are suffering from the compounding economic impact of \nyears of steadily rising health care costs and millions of uninsured \nAmericans. This crisis is strangling businesses and throwing sand in \nthe gears of our economic engine, but the most troubling impact is on \nfamilies.\n  From 2001 to 2007, premiums for family insurance coverage surged 78 \npercent while income increased just 19 percent. Wages are lagging \nbehind not only premiums but also out-of-pocket costs which families \nmust pay for health care services.\n  In my view, meaningful health care reforms are within reach and \nshould be achieved in a bipartisan fashion without stifling minority \nviews or using reconciliation.\n  Although there are signs of progress in the reform debate, some seem \nready to stir partisan tensions. We should play down the divisions \nwhich ideologies present and focus instead on areas of consensus.\n  What could this middle ground look like?\n  I believe that two of the highest priorities should be reducing the \ncost of health care and improving efficiency in our delivery system.\n  Despite state-of-the-art treatment, some studies still show that \nAmericans receive appropriate care just 55 percent of the time.\n  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Congress approved this \nyear made a downpayment addressing health information technology and \ncomparative effectiveness research. As a result, doctors and patients \nwill receive access to improved health records and better evidence \nabout which medical treatments may best serve a patient's needs.\n  Senator Baucus and the Finance Committee have laid out a series of \nadditional delivery system reforms which I applaud them for. These \ncost-containment measures are the first order of business and a \nmission-critical component of reform which will immediately pay \ndividends on affordability and access.\n  In an additional sign of progress in covering the uninsured, \nAmerica's health insurers have agreed to guarantee health care coverage \nto all Americans and transition away from charging higher premiums to \nthose who are most ill, if Congress agrees to support a requirement to \nobtain coverage.\n  While I have an aversion to mandates, I recognize that we all have a \nresponsibility to obtain health care coverage because we all pay higher \npremiums when providers are forced to write off expensive, \nuncompensated care.\n  We often focus on the 45 million or more Americans who are uninsured, \na crucial problem to be sure. However, we also must make sure we are \nnot destabilizing care for the 200 million Americans who have private \nhealth insurance.\n  Some have called for establishing a public plan, but I think it \nwould undermine health care services for millions of Americans and \nsquander this unique opportunity for substantial reform.\n\n  Here are some of my concerns about a public plan run by the \nGovernment:\n  Washington runs our Medicare system which is already on its way to \ninsolvency.\n  Our delivery system could collapse if it had to rely more heavily on \nMedicare-like reimbursement rates. Today, one-third of physicians limit \nthe number of new Medicare patients they see.\n  A Government-run plan would further limit payments to doctors, \nnurses, health care workers and hospitals, and they would over time \nrefuse patients covered by this system.\n  That would worsen the current cost shift to private payers, which can \nrun in the neighborhood of 30 to 40 percent.\n  The result? Patients would lose access to health care, services would \ndecline for millions and competition would disappear.\n  In my State of Nebraska, uncompensated care and the cost-shift from \nlow Government reimbursements account for 15 percent of the average \nhealth insurance premium.\n  In sum, a one-size-fits-all Washington-run health care plan expands \nGovernment but will not fix the main problems people face every day: \naffordability, access and high quality care.\n  Several years ago, we debated whether private competition could \ndeliver affordable choices to cover seniors' prescription drugs. I was \nnot convinced there would be enough competition.\n  Well, the jury is in. The verdict? A recent independent poll showed \nthat 87 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are satisfied with their \nprescription drug coverage. And, vigorous competition among drug plans \nwill save taxpayers $243 billion over 10 years.\n  I believe private competition can work. I would suggest we empower \nconsumers and demand that private insurers compete on service to \nrestore a true marketplace for insurance. We need to make it easier for \nAmericans to compare health plans and the co-pays, networks, provider \nquality measures and access to medical records the plans offer.\n  In fact, President Obama has said Americans deserve the same health \ninsurance that their members of Congress receive. Well, Federal \nemployees and Members of Congress choose between a wide array of \ncoverage options offered by private health insurers, selecting the plan \nthat best fits their needs.\n  Ultimately, I want consumers, not Washington, to be in charge of \ntheir health care and to give them the ability to demand more from \ninsurers through the marketplace.\n  In the coming weeks, America will see a debate that tests our ability \nto confront this enormous challenge yet still preserve bipartisanship \nand reason. We can meet in the center on a reform plan making major \nimprovements in our health care system that puts us firmly on the path \ntoward cost containment, universal coverage and, ultimately, fairness \nfor all Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I understand now is the time for the \nmajority. If somebody appears, I will be happy to yield the floor. I \nask unanimous consent to proceed in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I congratulate Senator Nelson for his excellent statement. \nHis statement was very appropriate and on point on the issue of health \ncare and health reform and the need for a bipartisan effort in this \nChamber. He is one of the leaders in the ability to bring people \ntogether, and I congratulate him for a strong and thoughtful statement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/07/senate-section/article/S5250-4", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5250-S5252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I wish to talk a little bit about the \nbudget and specifically about the proposal\n\n[[Page S5251]]\n\nsent by the President yesterday. Yesterday the President sent us his \nformal budget. We have already voted on a budget, of course. We passed \na budget. The President doesn't have to sign the budget. That is one of \nthe ironies of our system. But he does present us with an outline. \nBecause this was a transition year, it is traditional that the \nPresident doesn't send us in-depth proposals. He sends sort of a \ntopical approach in early February and then sends us in-depth proposals \nlater in the year. In the last few days, he sent the in-depth \nproposals. Among the proposals, and what is being most obviously \nhighlighted, is requested rescissions in about 120 programs \nrepresenting approximately $17 billion. I congratulate him for that. \nThat is an attempt to reduce spending in those accounts and recover \nthose dollars back into the Federal Treasury.\n  But that has to be put in context, the initiative to save $17 \nbillion. That is a lot of money. It could run the State of New \nHampshire for at least 3 or 4 years. But in the context of the Federal \nbudget, it is not a dramatic amount. In fact, it represents less than \none-half of 1 percent of the Federal budget, which will be \napproximately $3.5 trillion this year. So taking $17 billion out of \nspending programs is not going to solve our overall problem, which \ninvolves the fact that we are headed into a nonsustainable government \nbecause of the size of spending we are doing and because of the size of \nthe debt we are running up. I do congratulate him for putting forward \nthis initiative. I hope it will pass. I hope the $17 billion will \nactually be passed by this Congress. But regrettably, most of the items \nhe sent to be rescinded had already been sent by President Bush, not \nmost but a significant amount. Forty percent had already been sent to \nus by President Bush and had been rejected by the Congress, which is \ntoo bad. It was unfortunate when they were rejected under President \nBush. I hope the Congress will take a second look and accept them now \nthat they have been given the imprimatur, the approval of President \nObama, so we have a bipartisan effort to rescind at least 40 percent of \nthe amount.\n  In the end, it doesn't change the outyear deficit figures at all. In \nfact, this amounts to less than an asterisk when it comes to the amount \nof debt and deficit which we will be running up as a government.\n  Even with this rescission of $17 billion, assuming it was passed by \nthe Senate and the House and signed by the President and these various \nprograms were reduced, we would still run a deficit of 4 to 5 percent \nof gross national product over the next 10 years under the President's \nproposals. We would still run a deficit that would average $1 trillion \na year over the next 10 years. We would still run a deficit which would \nadd to the debt at such a fast rate--in other words, deficits become \ndebt--that we would end up with a Federal debt that would be \napproximately 80 percent of the gross national product or doubling of \nthe Federal debt during the first 5 years of this Presidency. None of \nthose numbers will be changed by these rescissions because they don't \ngo to the core of the problem.\n  The core of the problem is, the Government is being expanded \ndramatically, even while these rescissions are occurring. The rate of \ngrowth of the Federal Government, as a result of expanded spending \nwhich has been initiated by this administration, in large part, will \ndwarf any savings that occur under this rescission proposal. It is as \nif we had a vast desert of sand. It is as if this was the Gobi Desert \nor the Sahara Desert and we came along and took a few pieces of sand \noff the desert. It will virtually have no impact on the deficit and the \ndebt as we move forward into the outyears because of the fact that \nwhile we are taking these few dollars out, which I congratulate the \nPresident for trying to do, we are adding back massive amounts of \nspending: $1.4 trillion in new discretionary spending compared to the \n$17 billion rescission, $1.2 trillion in new entitlement spending \ncompared to this $17 billion rescission. We are taking a little \nspoonful of water out of the ocean while we are dumping a whole river \ninto the ocean. So the water levels go up. The debt levels go up and \nthe burden on our children goes up. The cost of the Government and the \ndebt of the Government is and remains an unsustainable event for the \nNation and for future generations.\n  If the President wishes to be serious about spending restraint--and I \nhope he is, though it doesn't appear that way from his budget--he would \naddress the underlying problem, which is that we don't expand the \nGovernment to take up 23, 24, 25 percent of gross national product when \nit historically has been about 20 percent, that we don't radically \nexpand spending programs until we have an economy that is generating \nenough revenues so we can pay for them and that we basically try to \ncontain in the outyears the cost of entitlement spending by putting in \nplace proposals which will lead to limiting the costs in the outyears.\n  The Senator from Nebraska was recently talking about health care. \nHealth care is obviously at the core of issues of how we control costs \naround here and how we control the outyear growth of the Federal \nGovernment. We today spend 17 percent of the gross national product on \nhealth care. That is approximately 5 to 6 percent more than the next \nclosest industrialized nation. Yet the President's proposals are to add \nanother $1.4 trillion on top of what we already spend in the area of \nhealth care. That makes no sense fiscally. It makes no sense from the \nstandpoint of what the health care system needs. We already have enough \nfunds in the health care system. We should agree that what we are going \nto try to do is stabilize the cost of health care as a percentage of \nour gross national product and use the dollars that are already in the \nsystem to reform it.\n  We know we have a huge amount of surplus money in the health care \nsystem compared to any other industrialized nation. Rather than \nthrowing more money at the problem, adding to the debt and deficit, \nlet's try to be responsible about a reform program, to live within our \nmeans--they are not even our means--to live within what we are already \nspending and spend those dollars more wisely. Those are the types of \ninitiatives we need.\n  Obviously, it is helpful to reduce spending by $17 billion. I hope we \naccomplish it. Congress has rejected 40 percent of these proposals in \nthe past, but I hope we change our minds. Just yesterday, for example, \nthis Senate passed a housing bill which spent $11 billion outside and \non top of the budget, new spending. So we have already spent almost all \nthe money represented as being saved by the President's proposal. \nFiscal discipline does not seem to be the order of the day around here. \nI appreciate at least the effort, but I think it does have to be put in \nthe context of the overall problem.\n  It is akin to taking a teaspoon of water out of a bathtub while we \nkeep the spigot on at full speed and the bathtub doesn't fill up. It is \na spigot of spending, of Government growth. There is a belief, \nregrettably, in this Congress, because of the majority view and from \nthe White House, that by grandly expanding the Federal Government, by \nmoving it dramatically to the left in its size, by growing it \nsignificantly, we somehow create prosperity.\n  We can't do it that way. The only way we can create prosperity is if \nwe have a government we can afford. If we are running up deficits at 4 \nto 5 percent of GDP, if we are taking the national debt up to 80 \npercent of the gross national product, we will not create prosperity. \nWe will create significant hardship for the next generation which has \nto pay off all the debt.\n  I hope this proposal for rescission which has been sent up will be \nfollowed on with proposals that are serious in the area of controlling \nthe spigot which is dumping all the spending into the Federal account. \nTurn that down. Let's put some controls on the spending side of the \nledger that get to the broader problem of the size of the debt and the \nsize of the deficit in real numbers, not just at the margins.\n  I yield the floor, suggest the absence of a quorum, and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be equally divided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S5252]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/07/senate-section/article/S5252-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           CREDIT CARD REFORM\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I rise this morning to speak about an \nimportant plan to protect American consumers. Specifically, I call on \nthe Senate to pass tough new reforms in the credit card industry. I \nhave been working for months with my colleagues on the Senate Banking \nCommittee to write this important new legislation. I am proud to have \nplayed a part in Chairman Dodd's bill, the Credit CARD Act.\n  This bill includes legislation I introduced last year to outlaw what \nis called universal default. That is the term given when the credit \ncard companies raise interest rates on customers if their credit scores \nfall for any reason--even if those customers pay their credit card \nbills on time. They may call that universal default, but where I come \nfrom in Montana, they call that a ripoff.\n  This reform legislation puts common sense and honesty back into the \ncredit card industry. It will establish a new set of standards at a \ntime when hard-working, honest folks are getting squeezed in this tough \neconomy.\n  Simply put, Montanans are not happy with the credit card companies. \nAll of us are getting fed up with hidden fees, high interest rates, and \nconfusing small print. Every day, I get calls and letters and e-mails \nfrom folks back home who want the Senate to take action to rein in \nthese predatory practices of the credit card industry. I have here in \nmy hand a few of those examples.\n  The first one is from a man from Belgrade, MT, in Gallatin County. He \nwrites this--and I will quote him at length:\n\n       These institutions have bilked us. They took the bailout \n     money and had no qualms about undertaking more irresponsible \n     actions to loot the American taxpayers and consumers again. I \n     will use myself--a small business owner so small you might \n     call us a nano-business--as an example. Four or five months \n     ago, we hit a bump in the road and got behind with [our \n     credit card company]. Knowing that this was going to be a \n     temporary situation pending the closing on the sale of some \n     property we owned, I stayed in at least weekly contact with \n     [our credit card company] to keep them informed and assured \n     them that we had every intention of meeting our obligation, \n     which we did. What happened then is almost unbelievable. My \n     interest rate was increased to over 27%. I was charged \n     various fees for being late that amounted to over $1100.00. . \n     . .What really made me feel ripped off is that I had been a \n     card holder [with that company] FOR TWENTY-SIX YEARS!!!\n\n  Madam President, I am all about personal responsibility. Folks need \nto make good decisions on their purchase obligations. But plastic \npersonal debt can be very dangerous and addictive. Ordinary Americans \ncan get in over their heads very quickly, and that is why the Senate \nneeds to pass commonsense legislation to protect consumers from abuse.\n  A lady wrote me from Glacier County, MT, and said this:\n\n       I hope you will be willing to stand up to the banks when it \n     comes to credit card regulation and oversight. Consumers need \n     protection. In our home, we just saw interest rates on many \n     of our credit cards jump for no reason. . . .How are we \n     supposed to be participating in an economic recovery when our \n     cash is being siphoned off for these unfair charges? You have \n     a chance to do something about that--\n\n  She went on to say--\n\n       I hope that you will.\n\n  I, too, hope that we will. I hope the Senate will pass the Credit \nCARD Act. This bill will ban universal default, the jacking up of \ninterest rates even when the account in question is in good standing. \nIt will protect consumers who pay their bills on time by outlawing \ninterest charges on debt paid on time. It gives consumers another week \nto pay their monthly bills. It limits fees and penalties. It ensures \nthat cardholders will know the small print. And it protects young \nAmericans, who are often most vulnerable, from predatory practices by \nthe credit card companies.\n  I voted against the Wall Street bailout because handing bags of money \nto big Wall Street bankers and hoping the money would trickle down to \nMain Street small businesses and working families made no sense to me. \nNow we see some of the recipients of taxpayer bailouts jacking around \nthe regular working folks who make this country run and who are having \na hard time in this difficult economy, brought on by mismanagement here \nand by crooked deals on Wall Street.\n  It is important to note that not everyone in the banking industry is \nguilty of gross exploitation of the American consumer. But the bad \nactors on Wall Street and the credit card companies need to be reined \nin, and the rights of the regular public need to be protected.\n  I am pleased President Obama had the credit card executives down to \nthe White House the other day to encourage them to treat consumers \nfairly. I call on the Senate to step to the plate and deliver \nmeaningful legislation that will put in place commonsense consumer \nprotections.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Madam President, for the past several weeks, \nRepublicans in Congress have expressed serious concerns about the \nadministration's insistence on closing Guantanamo before it has a safe \nalternative. These concerns are rooted, among other things, in the fact \nthat roughly 10 percent of the detainees who have already been released \nfrom Guantanamo have returned to the field of battle. These concerns \nare rooted in the fact that the administration has talked about \nreleasing some of these trained terrorists into the United States--not \ninto detention facilities but directly into our communities. These \nconcerns are rooted in the fact that Americans like the fact that we \nhave not been attacked at home here since 9/11, and they do not want \nthe terrorists at Guantanamo back on the battlefield and certainly not \nin their backyards.\n  These concerns are real. Yet all we have gotten from the \nadministration on this issue is silence.\n  Five weeks ago, Senator Sessions sent the Attorney General a letter \nasking what legal authority the administration has to release trained \nterrorists into the United States. He sent another letter asking the \nsame question earlier this week. In response, he has gotten silence. \nSenator McCain and Senator Graham wrote an op-ed yesterday asking \nserious questions about what the administration plans to do with the \ndetainees it releases or transfers from Guantanamo. We have not heard \nanything in reply.\n  These are not academic questions we are asking. When Americans hear \nabout a former detainee named Said Ali al-Shihri, who was last seen \nserving as one of al-Qaida's top deputies in Yemen, calling on his \nSomali comrades to increase attacks on Americans ships, they have \nreason to be concerned. When Americans hear about a former detainee who \nwas last seen serving as the Taliban's operational commander in \nsouthern Afghanistan, they have reason to be concerned. These are just \na couple of the men previously deemed safe for transfer. They are \nliving proof that the dangers of closing Guantanamo without a safe \nalternative are absolutely real. Yet all we get from the administration \nis a request for funds to close Guantanamo. Does the administration \nreally think Congress will appropriate these funds before it presents \nus with a plan that keeps the American people as safe as Guantanamo \nhas? The administration needs to explain its actions to the American \npeople and their representatives in Congress. And Republicans will \ncontinue to ask these questions until they do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/07/senate-section/article/S5252-4", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5252-S5253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, it is clear the budget the Democrats\n\n[[Page S5253]]\n\npassed last week on a party-line vote spends too much, taxes too much, \nand borrows too much. As a result, the President has now proposed some \nmodest spending reductions totaling a fraction--a fraction--of a \npercent of the trillions his budget would add to the debt.\n  Well, that is a start, but with Democrats in Congress adding to the \nnational debt at a rate of more than $100 billion every month already \nthis year, and with a budget that triples the already unsustainable \npublic debt over the next decade, it is clear there is not much more we \ncan do to protect our children and grandchildren from the unprecedented \ntrillions in additional debt proposed by this administration.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I wish to thank our Republican leader \nfor so succinctly summing up the issue we face in regards to the \nterrorists--and, yes, they are terrorists--who are at Guantanamo Bay \nand for what I think is the almost unbelievable suggestion that we move \nthese folks to a homeland, USA, and my remarks will continue in that \nregard. I thank the leader for raising the subject.\n  I rise today to speak about Guantanamo Bay, but I wish to point out \nthat I am speaking about a Guantanamo Bay that some of my colleagues \nand some citizens of our great country might not recognize.\n  Obviously, the Guantanamo Bay I am speaking of houses ``terrorists.'' \nI have been there, and there are terrorists at Gitmo. I have seen them. \nAs a matter of fact, I have seen interrogation procedures with the \nterrorists. They are not ``enemy combatants'' fighting an ``overseas \ncontingency operation,'' but terrorists whom we must wage a war on \nterror against because they continually plan to launch attacks against \nus.\n  Senator McConnell spoke of the 10 percent who have been released and \nwho have shown back up on the battlefield. There is a wonderful \npicture--well, it isn't a wonderful picture; it is a very telling \npicture--of one of these terrorists who was incarcerated at Gitmo and \nwhom we released. He was treated and fitted with a prosthesis--with \nhealth care better than many of my small communities get.\n  There is a picture of him back on the battlefield waving his \nprosthesis in one hand and with an AK-47 in the other. If that doesn't \ntell the story, I don't know what would.\n  The reason I explain this is because we have seen a change in how \nthose who are incarcerated at Gitmo are now being defined and described \nboth in the media and in the administration, and as a consequence, by \nsome Americans. I understand there is a poor perception of Guantanamo \nBay, but to say there are no terrorists there, to say that there are \nnot even enemy combatants there is doing a disservice to us all by \ntrivializing the crimes committed by those who are incarcerated there.\n  I ask my colleagues: When did we start making terror politically \ncorrect? And why?\n  I understand this administration has great feelings about these \nissues, and many Americans have great feelings about these issues. Many \nAmericans disagree very strongly with the past administration. I know \nthis administration wants to draw a line of demarcation and say: This \nis not our policy, whether it is the war in Iraq, whether it is our \noperations in Afghanistan, whether it is our foreign policy, our \nnational security policy, or whether it is intelligence. These are all \nvery legitimate topics for debate and discussion, but in the process of \nthis debate and this discourse, we should not ignore reality.\n  This same question as to why we would do this was asked by Daniel \nPearl's father, Judea Pearl, in an article that ran in the Wall Street \nJournal this past February. I have the article here. It is called \n``Daniel Pearl and the Normalization of Evil.'' Every Senator and every \nAmerican should read this article and should take it to heart.\n  As I think most people know--and we should all remember--Daniel Pearl \nwas the American journalist captured and beheaded--beheaded on video--\nby the ``nonterrorist, nonenemy combatant'' Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in \n2002. He was beheaded by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who is actually \nsitting at Guantanamo Bay right now.\n  Listen to what Professor Judea Pearl, who is a respected professor at \nUCLA, has to say about that act of terror when he and Danny's mother \nlooked at a picture of their son, Daniel:\n\n       Those around the world who mourned for Danny--\n\n  His son--\n\n     in 2002 genuinely hoped that Danny's murder would be a \n     turning point in the history of man's inhumanity to man, and \n     that the targeting of innocents to transmit any political \n     message would quickly become, like slavery and human \n     sacrifice, an embarrassing relic of a bygone era.\n       But somehow,--\n\n  And I continue to quote Professor Pearl--\n\n     barbarism, often cloaked in the language of resistance, has \n     gained acceptance in the most elite circles of our society. \n     The words ``war on terror'' cannot be uttered today without \n     fear of offense. Civilized society, so it seems, is so numbed \n     by violence that it has lost its gift to be disgusted by \n     evil.\n\n  Well, I remain disgusted by evil, and more than that, I am fatigued \nby those who seemingly ignore it. I am disgusted by those who target \ninnocent civilians as they spew their hatred, and I refuse to adopt \nwhat Danny's father called ``the mentality of surrender.'' I think it \nis not too late. It is not too late for a wake-up call. We can all \nrefuse to surrender to the idea that terrorism is somehow a tactic. To \nrefuse to believe it is an acceptable tool of resistance.\n  There is still time for Americans to remember that there are men at \nGuantanamo Bay who cannot be released and most certainly should not be \non American soil. In fact, Americans must remember there are men at \nGitmo who planned the September 11 attacks, the USS Cole attack prior \nto that--this was before we even connected the dots--and the attacks on \nAmerican Embassies in Africa, causing great loss of human life. There \nare men at Gitmo who have perpetuated horrible crimes against humanity \nand would like to do so again because they don't like who we are or the \nway we live.\n  Terrorist detainees should be held, as they are now, at Gitmo, in \ncompliance with international law. That should be respected, of course.\n  Ask the Red Cross or our new Attorney General, Eric Holder. \nGuantanamo, despite what some might think, is a first-rate facility \nthat safely keeps these men out of civilized societies, affords them \nhuman treatment, and gives them religious respect. Again, I know. I was \nthere.\n  Certainly, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed did not afford Daniel Pearl those \ncourtesies. No, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and others like him were--and \nstill are--on a jihad against every man, woman, and child in our \ncountry. Yet we should bring these terrorists to American soil? Not \nonly is that just plain wrong, it is logistically a situation that will \nnot work. We can't do it without a tremendous infusion of funds and a \nlot of other problems.\n  In Dodge City, KS, at the coffee clatch that I attend, they call that \nflatout dumb. In fact, for those who would like to bring these \nnonterrorists, nonenemy combatants to hometown, USA, let me paint a \npicture.\n\n  Fort Leavenworth, KS, has been mentioned many times as a possible \nlocation for the 100 or so terrorists whom Defense Secretary Gates says \ncan't be released but can't be tried. Leavenworth: where we educate all \nfuture Army officers, where we host foreign military officers every \nyear to build relationships and foster military cooperation. \nLeavenworth: the intellectual center of the Army.\n  Do my colleagues think Army officers want to study at Fort \nLeavenworth if terrorists are there? Do they think they want to send \ntheir kids to school on the base minutes away from the most dangerous \nmen in the world? Do they think foreign countries, especially friendly \nMuslim nations, will want to send their best and brightest officers to \na place that houses men who we all agree are not appropriate for a\n\n[[Page S5254]]\n\ncivilized society? I don't think so. Not a chance.\n  Even worse, I can't believe we are asking the people of Leavenworth \nto hang out with the ``welcome terrorists'' banner or put out the \nwelcome mat to terrorists or to share their community not only with \nterrorists but with every protestor who will inevitably show up or with \nevery terrorist who will view a facility on the mainland as a target, \nas they do. And before someone says Fort Leavenworth is secure, let me \ntell you it is secure all right; but for military prisoners who are \ncompliant and for civilian prisoners who are not on a jihad against \nAmerica.\n  Guantanamo Bay is a fortress, a humane, Red Cross-approved fortress, \nbut a fortress nonetheless. Moving such a facility to hometown, USA, \nwill require security beyond reality. I can't even begin to imagine \nwhat it would look like at Leavenworth, but I do know it is unrealistic \nto think a place such as Leavenworth, which has a railroad running \nthrough it and a river running next to it and highways all around it, \nwould not be secure. No, it is not secure enough. In fact, the only \nplace that is would have to be a fortress in the middle of nowhere--or \nGuantanamo Bay.\n  Let's also not forget the cost to taxpayers if such a thing would \nactually happen. We would not be able to mix these prisoners with the \ngeneral prison population there, let alone the public. We would have to \nbuild a hospital and medical facilities, exercise and eating \nfacilities, places for religious worship, and the list goes on and on \nand on. We have that at Gitmo. If anyone thinks that is crazy, I \nrecommend they travel to Gitmo and take a look. They already have all \nof those facilities there. In fact, the medical facilities I saw are \nbetter than most in most of our small rural communities in this \ncountry.\n  Why we keep coming back to this ridiculous argument, why we keep \ntrivializing the crimes committed by those at Gitmo, and why we keep \noffering up our American communities as a reasonable alternative is \nbeyond me.\n  But I will say this: not in our backyard, not in Kansas, not on this \nSenator's watch, not on my watch. I don't know how many times I have to \nsay or shout this on the Senate floor before this misbegotten idea is \nput to rest. But trust me--trust me--I will continue to do it until we \ncome to our senses or until one of my colleagues who wants to close \nGitmo offers a site in their State as a reasonable alternative.\n  One Senator has a lot of tools in his toolbox for keeping the Senate \ntied up in knots. If someone gets the bright idea of moving these \nprisoners to Kansas, we can all cancel our summer travel plans because \nwe are going to be spending a lot of time here doing nothing. Come to \nthink of it, that might be a better alternative as to where we are \nheaded.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, it has come to my attention that I don't think we \nhave a quorum, so I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I am pleased to cosponsor the Weapon \nSystems Acquisition Reform Act, which would overhaul our defense \nprocurement system and improve mechanisms for identifying and \neliminating waste. I thank Senators Levin and McCain for introducing \nthis critical piece of legislation and recognize them for their effort \nmoving it through the Armed Services Committee.\n  This bill is an essential step toward eliminating wasteful \ninadequacies that have permeated the weapons procurement system. I am \nsure my colleagues share my deep concern about the Government \nAccountability Office's conclusion last year that ``. . . DOD \n[acquisition] programs continue to be suboptimal'' resulting in ``. . . \nlost buying power and [lost] opportunities to recapitalize the force.''\n  This is unconscionable and unacceptable for the world's strongest \nmilitary power, especially as we continue to have troops in harm's way.\n  Today, Senators Levin and McCain will discuss some of the most \negregious examples of a lack of oversight in the acquisition process \nand cost discrepancies that surfaced over time. This is why this bill \nrequires the Secretary of Defense to implement mechanisms that \nguarantee consideration of the tradeoffs between major weapon systems \ncost, schedule, and performance at each phase of the procurement \nprocess.\n  This bill would give the Department of Defense the tools it needs to \nimprove the acquisition process to avoid ``suboptimal'' results, reduce \nwaste, and ensure that the cost of developing specific weapon systems \nis commensurate with our defense needs.\n  According to Secretary Gates, this will require ``. . . a holistic \nassessment of capabilities, requirements, risks and needs'' which will \nentail, among other things, ``. . . a fundamental overhaul of our \napproach to procurement, acquisition and contracting.''\n  Both President Obama and Secretary Gates have indicated their strong \nsupport for this legislation because they want to do everything in \ntheir power to protect our troops, advance national security goals, and \nkeep America safe.\n  Unfortunately, we will not get a refund from the mistakes of the \npast, but we can make better decisions today that will lay the \nfoundation for more pragmatic decisionmaking in the future.\n  The military challenges we are facing today are unlike conventional \nwars of the past. Let me repeat. The military challenges we face today \nare unlike wars of the past and, therefore, require a reconfiguration \nof defense spending. I agree with the assessment of leading defense \nexperts that we must better prepare to win the wars we are in, as \nopposed to those we may wish to be in.\n  Last month, I had the privilege of traveling with Senator Jack Reed \nto Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq, where it was abundantly clear that \nwe must focus future spending on our growing counterinsurgency needs.\n  In Iraq and Afghanistan, we are engaged in a four-stage process of \nshaping the environment, clearing the insurgents with military power, \nholding the area with effective security forces and police, and \nbuilding through a combination of governance and economic development.\n  The four stages, again, are shaping the environment, clearing the \ninsurgents, holding the area, and building through a combination of \ngovernance and economic development.\n  In order to be successful in this complex process, we must ensure \nthat our commanders have the necessary tools to effectively engage in \ncounterinsurgency operations, and this requires a fundamental \nrebalancing of our defense priorities.\n  As we shift resources from Iraq to Afghanistan, we hear over and \nover, we are facing potential shortages of some of the high-demand \nequipment and ``critical enablers,'' such as UAV operators, engineers, \nair traffic controllers, and road-clearing units.\n  The allocation of these scarce resources forces our military \nleadership to make difficult decisions as it balances competing needs \nin Afghanistan and Iraq. These shortages underscore--underscore--why we \nmust eliminate waste and reshape our defense priorities.\n  It is in this regard that I wish to highlight section 105 of this \nbill which directs the Joint Requirements Oversight Council to seek and \nconsider input from combatant commanders prior to identifying joint \nmilitary requirements.\n  This provision is essential because it incorporates the views of our \ncommanders on the ground to ensure they have the tools they need to \nbetter protect our troops, defeat militants, and succeed in our \nmissions overseas.\n  As Secretary Gates wrote in ``Foreign Affairs'' earlier this year, we \nmust\n\n[[Page S5255]]\n\nbuild innovative thinking and flexibility into the procurement process, \nand ``the key is to make sure that the strategy and risk assessment \ndrive the procurement, rather than the other way around.''\n  This is why we must institutionalize these changes into the \nprocurement process which must be flexible enough to respond to \ndevelopments on the ground and better equip our troops to engage in \ncounterinsurgency.\n  I wish we had the procurement system set up under this bill years \nago, but it is never too late to institute needed change. I thank the \nauthors, Senator Levin and Senator McCain, of this important initiative \nand encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is critically important to the \ncountry and to my State of Wisconsin that we do everything we can to \npreserve an American auto manufacturing industry. The domestic auto \nindustry has been vital to the economic development of Wisconsin for \nmuch of the last century, but that industry is undergoing a rapid \nrestructuring right now, and I am very concerned about how this \nrestructuring will affect communities in Wisconsin.\n  We need an American auto industry, but it can't be American in name \nonly. American jobs must be protected. Unfortunately, the auto \nrestructuring plans that have been put forward contain proposals that \nship jobs overseas. That is not acceptable to me or to my constituents. \nThe taxpayer dollars that are propping up the industry should be used \nto preserve family-supporting jobs in Wisconsin and around the country.\n  My State of Wisconsin has been hard hit by the troubles in the auto \nindustry over the past year. There are two major auto plants located in \nmy State--a General Motors plant in my hometown of Janesville, and a \nChrysler engine plant in Kenosha. In addition, there are a dozen \ncompanies in Wisconsin that support these two plants, including supply \ncompanies and car dealers.\n  Both the Janesville and Kenosha plants have received grim news from \nGM and Chrysler over the past year, including last year's announcement \nthat production would cease at the GM Janesville plant and this week's \nstatement that the Kenosha engine plant would close at the end of 2010.\n  The Wisconsin community, including workers, economic development \nofficials, technical colleges, workforce development groups, Governor \nDoyle, the Federal congressional delegation, and others have mobilized \nto assist these communities in the larger region in responding to this \ntroubling news from both GM and Chrysler.\n  I supported carving out some of the Wall Street bailout funds to help \nU.S. automakers because unlike the money heading to Wall Street firms, \nthe money provided to the automakers actually had a chance of \npreserving essential jobs in the United States. But that doesn't mean \nwe should give auto companies a blank check, which is why I said that \nany Federal assistance provided to the automakers should come with \nrequirements that the industry reform itself, including producing more \nfuel efficient cars that Americans are now demanding. When Congress \nfailed to pass legislation to provide Federal loans to the auto \nindustry, I applauded then-President Bush for stepping in and using \nsome of the Wall Street bailout money to help the auto industry while \nalso requiring that the companies submit restructuring plans.\n  Frankly, I am appalled that the automakers that received taxpayer \nassistance are not prioritizing the retention of American jobs, \nincluding jobs in Wisconsin. Over the past several months, I have heard \nconcerns from the workers at the Chrysler Kenosha Engine Plant that \nwork that Chrysler had promised to assign to the Kenosha plant might no \nlonger actually be assigned to the Kenosha plant. At the same time, \nKenosha's workforce told me that the same work would likely continue as \nscheduled at a plant in Mexico.\n  In response to these concerns, I led a letter in early April, \ncosigned by Senator Kohl, Representative Ryan, and Representative \nMoore, to Secretary Geithner and National Economic Council Director \nLarry Summers. The letter urged the administration to consider \nincluding a priority for saving auto manufacturing jobs in the United \nStates as the administration worked with the auto companies to craft \nrestructuring plans. I received a response from Secretary Geithner that \nsaid it was the administration's hope that any Chrysler restructuring \ndeal ``will help ensure that we retain as many Chrysler jobs as \npossible in Wisconsin . . . .''\n  Despite this assurance, the Kenosha community found out through media \nlast week that in fact no Chrysler jobs would be retained at the \nKenosha Engine Plant. Instead the Kenosha community was informed that \nthe Kenosha plant would close by the end of 2010 while a Mexican plant \nslated to build the same product that has been promised to the Kenosha \nfacility would remain open.\n  This news, which was not heard directly from the company itself, \noutraged the Kenosha community and other Wisconsinites who believe that \ntheir tax dollars should not be used to save jobs overseas, but should \ninstead be used to save jobs in the United States and in Wisconsin--and \nrightly so. The Federal delegation, State and local officials, and the \nKenosha workforce are united in working together to try to persuade the \nadministration and Chrysler to reconsider this terrible decision.\n  I understand tough decisions need to be made as these companies \nrestructure themselves. But both Chrysler and GM have received billions \nof American taxpayer dollars since December and the companies as well \nas the administration need to take steps to help ensure that those \ntaxpayer dollars are being utilized for the purpose they were \nintended--to save American jobs. If Chrysler is going to close the \nKenosha plant as well as other domestic plants while keeping its \noverseas facilities open, then we need to think seriously about whether \nit is in the interest of the American taxpayers to provide continued \nfinancial assistance to the company.\n  There may still be some hope for the Chrysler Engine Plant in Kenosha \nand the GM Assembly Plant in Janesville, and other American plants--if \nthe administration steps up. The Janesville community is waiting to \nhear whether or not the incentive package it presented to GM will be \naccepted and the Kenosha community is waiting to hear whether \nChrysler's decision to close the Kenosha plant will be reconsidered. \nOver the years, both the Kenosha and Janesville workers have been \ncommended for their productivity, their creativity, and their \nwillingness to negotiate fairly with the management at each plant and \nboth communities are great locations for retooled auto companies to \nthrive in the future.\n  The first priority of any company receiving Federal taxpayer \nassistance should be to preserve jobs within the United States and I \ncall upon the administration, Chrysler, and GM to reexamine their \nrestructuring plans to make the preservation of U.S. jobs the top \npriority of these plans. I will continue to do all I can to support \nWisconsin's workers and local communities in their efforts both to \nrespond to these decisions and to ensure these auto companies \nprioritize saving auto manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin as the \nrestructuring process moves forward in the coming days and weeks.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S5256]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/07/senate-section/article/S5256-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I now send a modified Murray amendment to \nthe desk and ask that it be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for Mrs. Murray and \n     Mr. Chambliss, proposes an amendment numbered 1052, as \n     modified.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 207. EXPANSION OF NATIONAL SECURITY OBJECTIVES OF THE \n                   NATIONAL TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRIAL BASE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subsection (a) of section 2501 of title \n     10, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new paragraph:\n       ``(6) Maintaining critical design skills to ensure that the \n     armed forces are provided with systems capable of ensuring \n     technological superiority over potential adversaries.''.\n       (b) Notification of Congress Upon Termination of MDAPS of \n     Effects on National Security Objectives.--Such section is \n     further amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(c) Notification of Congress Upon Termination of Major \n     Defense Acquisition Program of Effects on Objectives.--(1) \n     Upon the termination of a major defense acquisition program, \n     the Secretary of Defense shall notify Congress of the effects \n     of such termination on the national security objectives for \n     the national technology and industrial base set forth in \n     subsection (a), and the measures, if any, that have been \n     taken or should be taken to mitigate those effects.\n       ``(2) In this subsection, the term `major defense \n     acquisition program' has the meaning given that term in \n     section 2430 of this title.''.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Senator Murray introduced an important \namendment yesterday and spoke about it last night. It is intended to \nmake certain that when the Secretary of Defense looks at the question \nof cost and whether weapon systems should be continued, that at least \nthe Secretary looks into the impact on the industrial base.\n  The amendment has been modified now in a way that makes this \nacceptable. The Senator from Washington has put her finger on a very \nsignificant issue, which is the industrial manufacturing base of the \ncountry. But it has been modified in a way that would not make it \ndifficult or impossible for us to do what we need to do relative to \nending the production of weapon systems which, for instance, are no \nlonger useful or have so outlived or outdone the expectations for the \nsystem and exceeded the expected expense that they are no longer \npractical in terms of their continued production.\n  So she has raised an important issue. It will be considered by the \nSecretary of Defense when these decisions are made. But the thrust of \nour bill is to make it possible to end the production of weapon systems \nif they are so costly that they no longer make sense or if they are not \nworking effectively. That is the thrust of this bill, the heart of the \nmatter. Her contribution does not detract or diminish that important \npoint of our bill.\n  So we support that modified amendment and ask that the Senate adopt \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1052), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To require a plan for the elimination of weaknesses in \n  operations that hinder the capacity to assemble and assess reliable \n  cost information on assets acquired under major defense acquisition \n                               programs)\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 207.

I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1057) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I believe there is a Senator coming over \nto speak, and I think that is the last speaker on this bill that I know \nof. So in the meantime, awaiting his arrival, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I agree with Senator McCain that we know of \nno more amendments that are going to\n\n[[Page S5257]]\n\nbe offered. But there are one or two Senators who may want to speak on \neither their amendments which have been adopted or on the bill itself, \nand we will know that within the next few minutes.\n  What we are exploring in both our cloakrooms is whether we could \npossibly have a vote on final passage in about 10 or 15 minutes. We do \nnot know if that is a possibility yet. If not, we would vote on final \npassage sometime probably early this afternoon. But we are trying now \nto identify what the time would be for a vote on final passage, and, \nhopefully, we will have more to say on that in the next few moments.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, first of all, let me relay my appreciation \nto both the chairman and the ranking member for this bill. It does a \nlot of things that needed to be done for a long time. I would also say \nit will not do anything unless the President puts in the right person \nwho has the right character; that is, mean as all get out, thorough, \nand comprehensive in what they are going to do and plans on staying \nthere for a long time.\n  The other points I wanted to make, and I will be brief--really there \nare two. I have listened to all of this debate, not necessarily here \nbut from my office. There is one thing that is missing in the debate. \nWe have had the problem with contractors, and there is a problem with \nthe Pentagon. But not once did I hear there is a problem with us.\n  The real reason we have gotten into trouble to the degree we have is \nbecause we have not done the oversight. We have not done our job. So we \nare seeing a great response now by the leadership of the Armed Services \nCommittee to do some of the right things. But had we been doing our \njob, much of what we see in terms of failed major procurement systems, \nlack of transparency, we could have had that transparency had we been \ndoing the oversight.\n  I will give you an example. Senator Carper and I did the transparency \non the C-5 retrofit, and we had a supposed Nunn-McCurdy breach when, in \nfact, there was not a Nunn-McCurdy breach. The people wanted there to \nbe a Nunn-McCurdy breach. The fact is, we could in fact cut down costs, \ncreate transparency, not just with the effects of what this bill is \ngoing to do, but if we are much more aggressive.\n  The last point I will make is that there is no question that the \nearmarking process hampers us far more than it helps us in the \nPentagon. When we see the amount of time that is spent on most projects \nversus oversight, the American taxpayers are getting shortchanged. They \nare just getting shortchanged.\n  I hope people will recognize that although sometimes earmarks turn \nout to be fantastic, the vast majority of times they do not, and we \nspend staff time doing that rather than managing what is happening \nthere today.\n  Our No. 1 charge under the Constitution is the defense of this \ncountry, and we do not just spend $500 billion on that or $600 billion. \nWhen we add up everything we spend, it comes--if we count nuclear \nweapons maintenance and we count the research for nuclear warheads, if \nwe count everything that goes through, we are about at $1 trillion. \nWhen we add everything else, that comes to that. And we are highly \ninefficient.\n  I am very appreciative with what is happening within this bill. But I \nthink the American public ought to recognize that the earmarking \nprocess in Congress has hurt the Defense Department because it has \ntaken away from us doing our regular job.\n  No. 2, Congress has hurt our procurement and our ability to defend \nourselves because we are not doing the work we need to be doing, the \noversight on a monthly basis on major programs. We cannot depend on IGs \nand the GAO. We have to ask them: Are you on time? Are you meeting the \nschedule we need to do this because we are putting one-third of our \nassets that we expend every year into defense? It is rich. And when we \npay out $7, $8 billion for performance contracts that the performance \ncontractor did not make, did not meet the requirements, but we pay it \nanyhow, we are the ones who allow that to happen.\n  Finally, the last point I will make: Until we address the revolving \ndoor of working in the Pentagon and going to work for a contractor and \nhow that impacts what people do in terms of procurement and major \ndecisions, we are not going to solve this problem. Whether it is an \nethical constraint or a positive statement of principles, somehow we \nhave to address that issue because we cannot blame the people who are \nlooking for their next job to be less than perfectly independent in \nthis job if, in fact, it is going to affect their future.\n  So we have not addressed that in this bill, but that is still one of \nthe things that has to be addressed because it is problematic not only \nin terms of how well we do but what we get for what we actually pay \nout.\n  Again, I thank the chairman and ranking member. I appreciate their \nwork. I appreciate them taking our amendment. My hope is that when we \ncombine what we have put forward with a--I cannot use the word I want \nto use on the Senate floor--but someone of significantly tough demeanor \nto ramrod this through there, that, in fact, we will see great savings, \nbetter performance, and better procurement for the American taxpayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let me thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his amendment. \nIt was just adopted. It is a very significant amendment, and what it \nreflects is the determination of the Senator from Oklahoma to get the \nDefense Department to do something that in law they are required to do, \nwhich is to give us a financial statement which receives a clean audit \nopinion.\n  They haven't done that for decades. We have tried various ways to do \nit. The voice of the Senator from Oklahoma is a welcome addition to \nthis effort, and we appreciate his amendment and his willingness to \nwork with us on the exact language thereof.\n\n\n                              nunn-mccurdy\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Some have expressed concerns that changes proposed by this bill could \ncause Nunn-McCurdy breaches even when a program is performing well and \nwhen the Department has provided well-defined requirements. In \nparticular these experts have pointed to the potential for unit cost \nbreaches that could be caused by policy decisions to reduce the number \nof units that would be purchased by the program. These policy decisions \ncould originate in the executive branch or Congress and could be made \nregardless of past program performance. Do you believe this legislation \nwill have that effect, and, if so, was that your intention?\n  Mr. Levin. I thank the Senator for her inquiry. This legislation \nwould not change the existing Nunn-McCurdy thresholds for unit cost \nbreaches. I do not believe that programs that are performing well have \nbreached Nunn-McCurdy thresholds in the past as a result of changes in \nthe quantity of units procured under a program, and I do not consider \nit likely in the future. In the case of a program that is not \nperforming well, a change in unit quantities may be sufficient to push \na program over the thresholds. This is a factor that the Department may \nconsider in deciding whether and how to continue with the program. For \nprograms performing well, however, the likelihood of a breach is \nextremely small. Nonetheless, it is certainly not our intention to \npenalize programs performing well, and I look forward to continuing to \nwork with the Senator as this bill proceeds through Congress to address \nthese concerns.\n\n\n                    NIP-Funded Acquisition Programs\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, S. 454, the Weapon Systems Acquisition \nReform Act of 2009, is important legislation to improve the \norganization and procedures of the Department of Defense for the \nacquisition of major weapons systems and other major defense systems. \nChairman Levin and\n\n[[Page S5258]]\n\nRanking Member McCain are to be congratulated for reporting this bill \nfrom their committee with strong bipartisan support.\n  As my colleagues know, many of our most important, and costly, \nnational intelligence programs are acquired by intelligence community \nagencies that are found within the Department of Defense. Like the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, the Select Committee on Intelligence, \nwhere the chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee \nsit as ex officio members, has been concerned for many years about the \nneed to improve the intelligence acquisition process and its oversight \nin order to ensure we are making maximum best use of intelligence \nresources.\n  The Congress looks to the Director of National Intelligence to manage \nand be accountable for major systems acquisitions funded by the \nNational Intelligence Program, NIP, even though these acquisitions are \nexecuted in other departments and agencies of the Federal Government. \nWhile many of us have had concerns about the implementation of the \nIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, IRPTA, of 2004, the \ncreation of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, DNI, \nand the establishment of the roles and responsibilities of that office \nwere important accomplishments that we on the Intelligence Committee \nwish to see strengthened through robust implementation of the \nprovisions of that act.\n  The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act gave the DNI \nbroad acquisition authorities over the NIP, but for NIP programs \nconducted within the DOD, the act required that the DNI and the \nSecretary of Defense share these authorities. Specifically, the act \nrequired: ``For each intelligence program within the National \nIntelligence Program for the acquisition of a major system, the \nDirector of National Intelligence shall . . . serve as exclusive \nmilestone decision authority, except that with respect to the \nDepartment of Defense programs the Director shall serve as milestone \ndecision authority jointly with the Secretary of Defense or the \ndesignee of the Secretary.''\n  Subsequently, Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell and \nSecretary of Defense Robert Gates agreed in a memorandum of agreement, \nMOA, signed in March 2008 that this joint milestone decision authority \nwould be extended to majority NIP-funded acquisition programs as well. \nThey agreed that wholly and majority NIP-funded acquisition programs \nwould be executed according to intelligence community acquisition \npolicy. The MOA states that its purpose is to provide for ``a single \nacquisition process'' for programs covered by it. I am sure that we \nwill all agree, as the DNI and the Secretary of Defense have done, that \nit is vitally important that these important intelligence acquisitions \nbe governed by a clear process with clear lines of responsibility as \nprovided for by the MOA.\n  The MOA of the DNI and Secretary of Defense was later implemented in \nDOD Instruction No. 5000.2 on December 8, 2008.\n  It should also be pointed out that in fact wholly and majority NIP-\nfunded major system acquisitions executed in accordance with \nintelligence community acquisition policies are now usually deemed to \nbe ``highly sensitive classified programs'' under title 10 U.S.C. 2430\n  Because S. 454 would cover all ``major defense acquisition programs'' \nwithin the meaning of title 10 U.S.C. 2430, not just major weapons \nsystems, I appreciate Chairman Levin agreeing to this colloquy to \nclarify the impact of the legislation on NIP-funded acquisition \nprograms executed within the Department of Defense.\n  Mr. Chairman, is it the case that S. 454 would not extend DOD's \njurisdiction to any programs over which it does not already have \nauthority and that to the extent that NIP programs are outside the DOD \nacquisition system today, they would not be brought into the DOD \nacquisition system by this bill?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is the case. This bill would neither extend nor \ncontract DOD's jurisdiction or authority over the acquisition programs \nof DOD components that are a part of the intelligence community.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. Chairman, do you further agree that this bill is \nnot intended to change the DNI's roles and responsibilities under the \nIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Protection Act of 2004 or to require \nrevision of the March 2008 memorandum of agreement between the DNI and \nSecretary of Defense concerning NIP-funded acquisition programs?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I agree with the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. \nS. 454 is not intended to amend IRTPA or to modify the respective \nauthorities of the DNI and the Secretary of Defense under that statute. \nS. 454 does not address the March 2008 memorandum of agreement between \nthe DNI and the Secretary of Defense concerning NIP-funded acquisition \nprograms. It neither ratifies that memorandum of agreement nor requires \nany modification to the memorandum of agreement.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee and manager of this bill.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate Committee \non Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I rise with my colleague \nSenator Collins, to file this vital amendment to correct disparities \namong the Small Business Administration's, SBA, small business \ncontracting programs and thus create a more equitable method for \nFederal agencies to fairly allocate Federal procurement dollars to \nsmall business contractors across the nation.\n  This targeted amendment reflects a proposed rule promulgated last \nyear, March 2008, by the Department of Defense, DOD, the Government \nServices Administration, GSA, and the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration, NASA, which requires the Federal Acquisitions \nRegulations, FAR, clearly reflect the SBA's interpretation of the Small \nBusiness Act and the SBA's analysis of its own regulations and provide \nan equal playing field for small business firms who participate in the \nFederal contracting marketplace. The SBA's own counsel asserts that \nparity legislation must be adopted because Federal agencies `` must be \nafforded some discretion in determining which small business program to \nutilize.'' Parties agree that small business should be treated \nuniformly.\n  Our amendment would provide Federal agencies with the necessary \nflexibility to satisfy their Government-wide statutory small business \ncontracting goals. It would provide these agencies with the ability to \nachieve their goaling requirements equally through an award to a small \nbusiness, a historically underutilized business zone, HUBZone, small \nbusiness concern, a service-disabled veteran-owned small business, \nSDVOSB, firm, or a small business participating in the 8(a) Business \nDevelopment Program. Of course this list should also include the \nWomen's Procurement Program once it finally becomes fully implemented \nby the SBA.\n  For years, it has been unclear to the acquisition community what, if \nany, is the true order of preference when determining which small \nbusiness contracting program is at the top of the agency's priority \nlist. This amendment will make clear to purchasing agencies that \ncontracting officers may award contracts to HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a) firms \nwith equal deference to each program.\n  This amendment represents the essence of true parity--where each \nprogram has an equal chance of being selected for an award. And during \nthese difficult economic times, it is imperative that small business \ncontractors possess an equal opportunity to compete for Federal \ncontracts on the same playing field with each other.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for the \nWeapons System Acquisition Reform Act, introduced by the two leading \nmilitary experts in the U.S. Senate today--Senators Carl Levin and John \nMcCain. This rapid passage, after years of delay and inaction, has \noccurred in part because of the strong support demonstrated by \nPresident Obama. The President, in public remarks recently on this \nissue, reaffirmed his strong commitment to be a wise steward of the \nAmerican taxpayer's dollars. That commitment to fiscal prudence and \nwise budgeting must apply equally to the Pentagon as it does any other \nCabinet Department. Those who argue that it is acceptable to tolerate \nsome waste\n\n[[Page S5259]]\n\nand inefficiency in our military budgets because we are talking about \nour national security have it wrong. It is precisely because our \nsecurity is at stake that we must ensure, as Secretary Gates has said, \nevery dollar wasted on cost overruns or inefficient contracting is a \ndollar that cannot be spent on our men and women in service and making \nsure they have the right tools to succeed.\n  Defense acquisition reform is one of those perennial Washington \nissues that everyone talks about, but nobody ever seems to get around \nto solving. Many of my colleagues, in the debate over the past 2 days, \nhave cited the GAO report last year chronicling $296 billion in \ncumulative cost overruns in the 96 major acquisition programs currently \nmaintained by the Pentagon. But I would like to quote from another \nreport:\n\n     public confidence in the effectiveness of the defense \n     acquisition system has been shaken by a spate of ``horror \n     stories''--overpriced spare parts, test deficiencies, and \n     cost and schedule overruns. Unwelcome at any time, such \n     stories are particularly unsettling when the Administration \n     and Congress are seeking ways to deal with record budget \n     deficits.\n\n  This other report was not published this year or last year. I am \nquoting from the legendary Packard Report, published in 1986, which \noffered a scathing indictment of the defense acquisition process. \nUnfortunately, little seems to have changed in the intervening 23 \nyears, and in some respects, our procurement system has only \ndeteriorated.\n  Year after year, we hear of cost overruns and schedule delays that \ncost the American taxpayer billions of dollars. Yet we never seem to \nmuster the political will to tackle the problem and crack down on the \nsystemic flaws that produce these chronic poor results. So I am very \npleased that this legislation has moved from introduction to committee \nmarkup to final Senate passage in a matter of months--after years of \nreports and blue ribbon commission of studies emphasizing the need for \nfundamental reform of the process by which the Pentagon purchases the \nweapons systems used every day by our brave men and women.\n  The Levin-McCain bill on the floor today seeks to address key \ndeficiencies in the early stages of the acquisition process for a \nweapons system, where many of the problems first materialize. The \nlegislation would support the Pentagon's efforts to rebuild its \nprocurement workforce, which has been dismantled over the past fifteen \nyears and contracted out. It would establish an independent office in \nthe Pentagon to assess initial cost estimates provided for weapons \nsystems, to ensure that rose-colored cost predictions are no longer \npermitted to pass muster. Finally, the bill reinforces so-called Nunn-\nMcCurdy provisions to ensure that programs that go seriously off track \nare terminated unless there is a compelling reason not to do so.\n  I was also proud to serve as a cosponsor on a series of important \namendments offered by my colleague from Missouri, Senator McCaskill. I \napplaud the Senator's single-minded determination to root out waste, \nfraud and abuse in our procurement and contracting systems, and I am \nvery pleased to collaborate with her on these important amendments, all \nof which have been accepted by voice vote. Briefly, the amendments \nensure that our war fighters in the field, as represented by the \nCombatant Commanders, provide input to the weapons acquisition process; \noffer an opportunity for the key Pentagon civilian official in charge \nof acquisition to sign off on all acquisition program decisions made \nsomething that oddly does not yet occur on a regular basis; and \nstrengthen safeguards to ensure competitive prototyping for all major \nweapons systems before final purchase decisions are made.\n  What matters, at the end of the day, is not just the dollars we save. \nAll of us have a fiduciary responsibility to safeguard the interests of \nour young men and women who serve our nation. We cannot continue paying \nexcess dollars on out of control weapons acquisition programs while we \nshortchange our troops on time at home from extended deployments and \nthe full range of benefits they and their families deserve. That is at \nthe heart of why the Levin-McCain acquisition reform legislation must \nbe enacted into law by Memorial Day, as called for by the President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we are approaching the end of our debate. I \nbelieve the Senator from Alabama wishes to speak for up to 5 minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that no further amendments be in order, that \nfollowing the remarks of Senator Sessions, the Senate proceed as \nprovided for under a previous order with respect to passage of S. 454.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object--and I will not object--I \nthank the chairman and all the staff for the hard work they have done \non this legislation. Many hundreds of hours have been put in, as well \nas hours of hearings. I thank the chairman for his leadership and the \nkind of nonpartisanship these important issues require for the good of \nthe country.\n  I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I join in thanking Senator McCain and our \nstaffs. The work that has gone into this bill has been extraordinary on \nthe part of both staffs. I will get into that after passage of the bill \nand have perhaps further thoughts. The role of Senator McCain has been \nabsolutely invaluable and essential. We have worked together very \nclosely; as he puts it, in a nonpartisan way. I thank him and his staff \nas well as my own.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senators Levin and McCain for \ntheir work. We do need to address wasteful spending. Both of these \nSenators understand it. Senator McCain has always been willing to \nchallenge programs he thinks are not justified for the warfighter.\n  I wish to note a few things before we vote on passage as well as urge \nsupport for the legislation. First, the legitimate concerns voiced by \nthe Department of Defense about the implications of this bill have been \nlistened to and have been reasonably accommodated. I wish to highlight \na few points identified by a report last month by the Government \nAccountability Office, the independent GAO, titled ``Defense \nAcquisitions, Assessments of Selected Weapon Programs.''\n  Since 2003, the number of major defense acquisitions programs has \ngrown from 77 to 96. All 96 programs were assessed by GAO. They found \ninvestment in these programs had grown from $1.2 trillion to $1.6 \ntrillion. Research and development costs are now 42 percent higher than \noriginally expected. The cumulative cost growth was $296 billion. I \nfind that to be a stunning number. I almost have to believe that \nsomehow they calculated it in an excessive way. Sometimes numbers can \nlook misleading. But if it is a third of that, we have a major problem. \nThey concluded the cost growth on these programs was almost $300 \nbillion. The average delay in delivering the initial capabilities has \nincreased to 22 months. So we have an excessive delay in producing our \ncapabilities. GAO found that only 28 percent of the programs were \nexpected to be delivered on time or ahead of schedule.\n  To combat cost growth, they found that quantities; that is, the \nnumber of the weapon systems and vehicles and other things that were to \nbe produced, had to be reduced by 25 percent or more for 15 of the \nprograms in the 2008 portfolio, and 10 of the largest acquisition \nprograms, which account for half the overall acquisition dollars in the \nportfolio, have seen quantities reduced by almost one-third.\n  When the price per item goes up significantly, often the compensating \naction is to reduce the numbers. But the net reality is, that the \ntaxpayer hasn't received as much as they expected out of the program. \nSo clearly these statistics are disturbing and underscore the need for \nthis important legislation and reform.\n  In summary, our warfighters are receiving less capability at a higher \ncost\n\n[[Page S5260]]\n\nthan was originally agreed upon. I believe this bill will improve the \nacquisition process by ensuring the Department and industry are more \nthoughtful when estimating the production cost at the beginning and the \ntotal life cycle cost of these programs. While I am mindful that \nacquisition reforms can continue to be improved, I encourage colleagues \nto vote in favor of this legislation. It is clearly a step in the right \ndirection.\n  I salute our chairman and our ranking member, Senators Levin and \nMcCain, for this accomplishment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the substitute \namendment, as amended, is agreed to.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is on the passage of the bill.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), the Senator \nfrom New Jersey (Mr. Lautenberg), the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nMenendez), and the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from West \nVirginia (Mr. Rockefeller) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. KYL.

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, very briefly, we have done extremely well \nwith this overwhelming vote for the passage of S. 454, the Weapon \nSystems Acquisition Reform Act. We have done it on a bipartisan basis, \nwhich is the way it should be done when it comes to matters of national \ndefense and a whole host of other issues. I am deeply grateful to my \nfriend, our ranking member, Senator McCain.\n  Of course, a large share of this moment belongs to our hard-working \nand very talented staff, led on our side by Rick DeBobes and on the \nRepublican side by Joe Bowab. Our special collective thanks must also \nbe given to Peter Levine and Creighton Green on the majority staff and \nto Richard Fontaine, Chris Paul, and Pablo Corrillo on the minority \nstaff. We thank them all for their hard work. It will bear fruit, we \nhope within the next month, when we work something out with the House. \nThen, over the coming years, we will not only save taxpayers' dollars, \nbut we will provide the right equipment to our troops who deserve the \nbest we can get. We will make sure we don't waste these defense \ndollars, because when we do that, we not only are hurting the taxpayer \nbut we are depriving our troops of funds they need for needed weapon \nsystems.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, the bill we passed contains provisions that \nI support and others that I oppose. I want to indicate why I voted aye. \nIn the end, I think it is critical for Congress to increase the FDIC's \nborrowing authority to reduce a costly special assessment that the FDIC \nintends to impose on distressed banks, and therefore I supported the \nbill.\n  Over the last 2 years the FDIC has had to take over 41 different \nfailed depository institutions and in the process has depleted its \ninsurance fund. At its current level, the FDIC is required by law to \nincrease its insurance premiums on banks to recapitalize the fund. \nHowever, increasing banks' costs now would only worsen the current \nrecession.\n  Congress can reduce the size of this assessment by 50 percent if it \nincreases the FDIC's borrowing authority from $30 billion to $100 \nbillion. Doing so will help banks hold onto capital that they can use \nto absorb future losses and make it through these difficult economic \nconditions.\n  Unfortunately, this bill would increase the FDIC's borrowing \nauthority at the same time that it would expand the HOPE for Homeowners \nProgram--a $300 billion program designed to allow up to 400,000 \nborrowers to refinance into an FHA-backed loan. The FHA mortgage \nprogram has exploded with the decline of the subprime industry as \nborrowers have flocked to the Government program. FHA loans are \nattractive due to the high loan limits--up to $729,250 in high cost \nareas--and only a 3.5-percent downpayment requirement. According to \nInside Mortgage Finance, the FHA's market e jumped to nearly a third of \nall mortgages in the fourth quarter of 2008 from about 2 percent in \nearly 2006.\n  At the same time, FHA mortgage defaults have increased sharply and \nare diminishing the FHA's reserve fund. Roughly 7.5 percent of FHA \nloans were seriously delinquent at the end of February, up from 6.2 \npercent a year earlier. The FHA's reserve fund fell to about 3 percent \nof its mortgage portfolio in fiscal year 2008, down from 6.4 percent in \nthe previous year. By law, the reserve fund must remain above 2 \npercent. Recently, HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan told a Senate \nAppropriations subcommittee that he did not know whether the FHA would \nbe able to continue to pay its obligations. Many believe that Congress \nwill have to inject additional funding into the FHA.\n  The HOPE for Homeowners Program will sunset in 2011. I expect the \nObama administration to do everything in its power to guarantee the \nsolvency of the FHA mortgage program and will be watching how the \nSecretary of HUD implements HOPE the for Homeowners Program.\n  In the end, I believe the broader economy would benefit from an \nincrease in the FDIC's borrowing authority. We cannot recover from this \neconomic downturn until banks have the capital to lend freely to all \nborrowers. Therefore, I voted for S. 896 despite some reservations that \nI have with other provisions in the bill.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I voted in favor of the Weapon Systems \nAcquisition Reform Act of 2009 but I am disappointed that it does not \ninclude key reforms of our defense procurement system. While President \nObama and leaders in Congress deserve credit for beginning to address \nthe longstanding problem of wasteful and abusive defense contracting, \nwe need to go further.\n  Secretary Gates has stated that we ``must consistently demonstrate \nthe commitment and leadership to stop programs that significantly \nexceed their budget or which spend limited tax dollars to buy more \ncapability than the nation needs.'' Unfortunately, this bill falls \nshort in this regard. It permits programs to continue even if they have \nexperienced cost growth of over 25 percent. GAO has found that 42 \npercent of our programs have experienced cost growth and that, due in \npart to such cost overruns, we have scaled back the number of weapons \nwe are buying in 10 major programs by 30 percent. Congress's failure to \nmake tough choices and restructure troubled programs is therefore \nhaving a direct impact on our ability to deliver sufficient quantities \nto our fighting forces.\n  Secretary Gates has also stated that ``we must ensure that \nrequirements are reasonable and technology is adequately mature to \nallow the department to successfully execute the programs.'' This bill \nencourages such reforms, but unfortunately does not require them. For \nexample, it requires additional reporting on the Department's reliance \non immature, risky technologies but does not prohibit the Department \nfrom purchasing such equipment. GAO reported this year that of 40 \nprograms that it has reviewed, the Department will decide to move to \nthe production of nearly a fourth of them without requiring realistic \ntesting of their critical technologies.\n  No company would buy a plane before they have flown it. I don't know \nwhy it should be any different for the U.S. Armed Forces. Indeed, given \nthat our brave men and women in uniform are relying on these weapons \nsystems, stricter standards should be enforced.\n  Unfortunately, these are not new issues. I first objected to \ninadequate testing of weapons systems in 1998 when the Navy sought to \nrush the F-18 through its tests, notwithstanding the fact that \npreliminary tests had discovered serious problems in the aircraft. I am \ndisappointed that a decade has passed and we are still seeing the same \nproblems over and over again.\n  I suggested that we should require higher level review of alternative \nacquisition strategies before purchasing systems that have not been \ntested in a realistic environment but was informed that this would be \ntoo strict of a requirement. While I am pleased that the committee at \nleast accepted an amendment I cosponsored that will ensure that annual \nreports to the Congress identify programs moving into production \nwithout undergoing adequate testing, this is just a start.\n  Secretary Gates demonstrated his commitment to fixing these problems \nwhen he recommended the cancellation of several programs that were over \nbudget, were behind schedule, relied on immature technologies and were \ndesigned to combat a military-peer that does not exist. GAO had been \nreporting that these systems were in trouble for several years. If \nthese systems had been restructured when it first became obvious that \nthey were unnecessary and unrealistic, it would have saved the \ngovernment tens of billions of dollars and sped up our efforts to \nreplace our aging weapons systems.\n  It is my hope that Congress will eventually forgo the parochial \ninterests that have prevented it from making the tough choices that \nneed to be made and stop repeating the same mistakes of the past. I \nwill continue to work with my colleagues until we have achieved this \ngoal.\n\n[[Page S5267]]\n\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

GIL KERLIKOWSKE TO BE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL DRUG \n                             CONTROL POLICY\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of R. Gil \nKerlikowske of Washington to be Director of National Drug Control \nPolicy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until 2 p.m. is equally divided.\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, our Nation's next drug czar is going to \nface a number of key challenges. The Office of Drug Control Policy is \ngoing to play a leading role in addressing the drug-related violence in \nMexico and along the southwest border--an area where, if we don't take \nthe right steps to tackle problems today, we will most certainly see \nthe spread of violence and drugs into towns and residences thousands of \nmiles from the Mexican border.\n  We also know from history that as the economy falls, crime rises, and \nthat crime is growing at the same time law enforcement agencies across \nthe country face painful cutbacks and greater strains on their \npersonnel and resources. It is, therefore, incumbent upon the next drug \nczar to ensure that law enforcement at all levels is working smarter, \nforging new relationships, and leveraging the resources they have. We \nwill also have to address the rise in prescription drug abuse, the \ncontinued scourge of methamphetamine use, and the violence that affects \nso many of our communities due to drug trafficking.\n  Seattle Police Chief Gil Kerlikowske is the right man to address \nthese big challenges. Chief Kerlikowske brings a fresh new perspective \nto the job as the Nation's drug czar. He is a cop's cop, and his \nperspective was shaped patrolling the streets in Florida, New York, and \nWashington State. Along the way, he has helped thousands of people \ntouched by violence and drugs. He and the law enforcement officials \nthat he has led have been on the front lines of our Nation's war \nagainst illicit narcotics and in keeping our communities safe. And I \nknow that he will bring this hands-on perspective to his job as our \nNation's drug czar.\n  Chief Kerlikowske also understands the importance of partnerships \nbetween ONDCP and our State and local law enforcement communities, \nbecause he has been on the local level. As the head of the Major Cities \nChiefs Organization, which represents the 63 largest police departments \nin the United States, he sees the common problems facing cities across \nthe country. I have seen this firsthand in his work as Seattle police \nchief.\n  This past December, under Chief Kerlikowske's leadership, the Seattle \nPolice Department, in cooperation with county, State, and Federal law \nenforcement agencies, he was able to bust a drug ring that stretched \nfrom Mexico to Idaho to Seattle.\n  Chief Kerlikowske worked cooperatively to create a regional response \nto gang violence in Seattle and in King County. He built a coalition \nwith the King County Sheriff's Office and other King County police \nchiefs, with the Washington Department of Corrections, the ATF, and \nother community leaders to tackle persistent gang violence in our \nneighborhoods. These multiagency, Federal-local partnerships require \ncooperation and compromise, and they require a leader with Chief \nKerlikowske's experience to bring them all together. Local police \nchiefs and sheriffs have told me they are sorry to see him go, but the \nNation is gaining a true innovator in Gil Kerlikowske. I know he is \ngoing to continue to work on these relationships with State and local \nlaw enforcement across the country, and this approach will make all of \nour communities safer.\n  Chief Kerlikowske also understands that the drug war will not only be \nwon on the streets but in our classrooms and in our homes. For the past \n9 years, he has been the national board chairman for the group Fight \nCrime: Invest in Kids. Under the guidance of Chief Kerlikowske, this \ngroup has focused their efforts on the importance of prevention by \nfighting for early childhood intervention funding, afterschool \nprograms, and efforts to prevent child abuse. Chief Kerlikowske knows \nthe best way to end the use of drugs and spread of crime is to prevent \nit, and he will bring that commonsense approach to ONDCP.\n  Chief Kerlikowske has served the people of our State well, and he \nwill serve the people of the Nation well also. I am so proud to support \nhis confirmation. In a few short minutes, the Senate will be voting on \nthis confirmation, and I am very proud to stand here today to tell my \ncolleagues they will be glad they voted with us to confirm this \nnomination.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I would like to take a minute to briefly \ndiscuss my opposition to the nomination of Gil Kerlikowske to be \nDirector of National Drug Control Policy. Chief Kerlikowske has had a \nlong career in law enforcement, and he enjoys the support of many of \nhis colleagues. However, the concerns I have about certain aspects of \nhis record prevent me from being able to support his nomination to be \nDirector of ONDCP.\n  The principal purpose of ONDCP is to establish policies, priorities, \nand objectives for the nation's drug control program. The office has \narguably never been more important, as the United States seeks to deal \nwith the violent drug cartels whose influence has begun to cross into \nour borders. Yet Chief\n\n[[Page S5268]]\n\nKerlikowske has no experience with international drug interdiction, \nwhich is among my chief concerns with this nomination.\n  Although I suppose my concerns about Chief Kerlikowske's lack of \nexperience with international drug enforcement could be overcome by a \nstrong record of domestic enforcement, I am afraid that Chief \nKerlikowske lacks such a record. Instead, he has gained a reputation \nfor being soft on marijuana enforcement, once stating that pursuing \npossession offenses was ``not a priority.'' Despite local attitudes on \nthis issue, as the top law enforcement officer in Seattle, Chief \nKerlikowske has an obligation to make all crime a priority.\n  Chief Kerlikowske's lax record on marijuana enforcement has even led \nmany pro-marijuana groups to endorse his nomination. In this country, \nmarijuana remains a Schedule I drug and is known as the ``gateway \ndrug,'' because it can lead to the abuse of more dangerous substances. \nFor this reason, the next ONDCP Director must be a strong opponent of \nmarijuana and all illegal drugs, as well as act as an aggressive \nenforcer of the laws regulating these harmful narcotics. I am concerned \nthat Mr. Kerlikowske does not have such a record or reputation.\n  I have other concerns about Chief Kerlikowske's record that I will \nnot detail here. Those concerns include: his decision to withhold \npolice from a riot that broke out in 2001, in which a 20-year-old \ncollege student was murdered; his direction for police not to check \nimmigration status or take action on any such violations; and his \nrecord on gun control. With respect to the Second Amendment, at a time \nwhen facts about the influence of American guns in Mexican drug cartel \nviolence are being distorted--often with the intent to restrict the \nconstitutional rights of American citizens--it is crucial that we have \nleaders who are ready to defend those rights. I am concerned that Chief \nKerlikowske will not be such a defender.\n  In short, Chief Kerlikowske's lack of experience with international \ninterdiction and his record of lax enforcement of domestic laws \nrespecting drugs--particularly marijuana--and other crimes leaves me \nconcerned that he is the wrong person to lead ONDCP at this crucial \ntime. Therefore, I will oppose his nomination.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, in March, Gil Kerlikowske was tapped by the \nPresident to be the Director of the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy. Chief Kerlikowske is certainly qualified for this position. He \nis a 36-year veteran of law enforcement. He has been the chief of \npolice of four police departments, and most recently chief of the \nSeattle Police Department. If confirmed, Chief Kerlikowske would be \ncharged with the mission to develop and implement the Nation's drug \ncontrol strategy. My hope is that he would be confirmed today.\n  The formal announcement of Seattle Chief Gil Kerlikowske as the new \nDirector of the Office of National Drug Control Policy was heralded by \nnone other than Vice President Biden. In 1982, Vice President Biden saw \nthe need for a Cabinet-level position to coordinate the efforts of \nvarious agencies. He is credited with coining the term ``Drug Czar.'' \nThen Senator Biden was always a champion for elevating this position to \nCabinet-level status. During our time on the Senate Judiciary Committee \nwe often collaborated on keeping the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy relevant in the country's efforts to curb illicit drug use and \nincrease education. Unfortunately, Chief Kerlikowske will be assuming a \nposition that was downgraded by the administration. The Obama \nadministration has elected to downgrade the Director of the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy from a Cabinet-level position to a \npresidential appointment in the Executive Office. This is a major \ndeparture from the precedent which was set in 1993 under President \nClinton.\n  As the Mexican drug cartel violence has been placed front and center \nby the media and this body, Cabinet-level executives deploy their \npersonnel and weigh in on the illicit drug trade and violence that has \nconsumed the southwest border. Mexico is the leading supplier of \nmethamphetamine. Recent analysis suggests that meth manufacturers are \nadding chocolate flavoring so that their product will be more appealing \nto a younger customer base. The Office of National Drug Control Policy \nhas an annual operating budget of over $14 billion. Current estimates \nindicate that the cartel's profits exceed what we spend on deterrence \nby more than a 2 to 1 ratio.\n  By downgrading this position, President Obama is not sending a \nvociferous message about the future of the national drug control \nstrategy. A key element of the Office of National Drug Control Policy \nis its control over the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area \ndesignation. Stabilization of the southwest border with Mexico needs \nall the resources of the U.S. Government to include the Federal and \nlocal task forces operated and funded by the HIDTA initiatives. The \nprincipal purpose of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, ONDCP, \nis to establish policies, priorities, and objectives for the Nation's \ndrug control program. The goals of the program are to reduce illicit \ndrug use, manufacturing, trafficking, and drug-related crimes of \nviolence. The ONDCP also develops initiatives and campaigns that \neducate youths on the ill effects of drug abuse and drug-related health \nconsequences. To achieve these goals, the Drug Czar is charged with \nproducing the National Drug Control Strategy. This delegation of \nauthority was established through previous Executive orders and \nlegislative authority as crafted by Congress.\n  In some respects, I believe the President and I are on the same page \nwhen it comes to addressing our Nation's illicit drug problem. You \ncannot solely arrest your way out of this issue. I have always believed \nthat everybody makes mistakes and is entitled to forgiveness. I believe \nin putting some emphasis on rehabilitation in conjunction with \nappropriate punishment. The Director of the National Office of Drug \nControl Policy is supposed to have the ear of the President on how the \napproaches of rehabilitation and the criminal justice system will meet \nto curtail this crime. I commend his choice of Gil Kerlikowske to head \nthe ONDCP. However, I question the President's decision to downgrade \nthis important position at a time when our Nation needs key leadership \nto form our strategy to combat our Nation's addiction to illicit drugs.\n  It is my sincere hope that this ill-advised decision by President \nObama to downgrade the position of the Director of the National Office \nof Drug Control Policy, which Mr. Kerlikowske will hold, will not come \nback to haunt Americans for years to come with increased illicit drug \nuse by our children, increased illicit drug manufacturing, increased \ntrafficking, and increased drug-related crimes of violence. That would \nbe a truly tragic mistake for all Americans. The ramifications of a \nvibrant illicit drug market in the U.S. will take lives, ruin families, \ndestroy potential and leave us a much weaker nation.\n  I support Mr. Kerlikowske in his new post and I wish him the best. I \noffer him my support as he undertakes this large assignment. Also, I \nencourage our President to return the Director's office back to a \nCabinet level position where it belongs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the next Director of the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy, ONDCP, has a tough job ahead of him.\n  The new drug czar will have to work hard to stem the rise in \nprescription and over-the-counter medicine abuse and the drug cartel \nviolence crossing our southern borders, as well as the issues we have \nbeen combating for many years: traditional drug abuse.\n  The U.S. has a major drug problem. While we are leveraging law \nenforcement resources for interdiction and drug crime reduction, we \nalso face an active movement to legalize dangerous drugs. I have long \nbeen an opponent of the legalizing cause, as I hear all the time how \ndangerous drugs are to our youth and families.\n  The new ONDCP Director must emphasize and invigorate the law \nenforcement community's efforts to stop illegal drug use. He must be a \nstrong leader for all agencies and organizations that are stakeholders \nin the fight against illegal drugs. He must bring a respect to the \noffice of ONDCP that has been lacking for some time. It is vital that \nthe new Director is able to coordinate domestic and international drug \nstrategy, including ensuring that the Merida Initiative is a success. \nThe next\n\n[[Page S5269]]\n\nDirector must also be able to bring together and work with coalitions \nat the local level to combat meth, coordinate policy on the laws \ndirected to eradicate meth and marijuana production, and be engaged in \nefforts to stop opium production in Afghanistan and Colombia. His drug \nstrategy must produce results at the national and international level \nto address drug manufacturing, interdiction, prevention, and abuse.\n  I have some concerns about Chief Kerlikowske's nomination, given his \nrecord.\n  For instance, in 2003, Seattle voters passed Initiative 75, which \nmade marijuana possession the lowest priority for the Seattle Police \nDepartment. During the debate, Chief Kerlikowske opposed the measure \nonly because he disagreed with voters determining what laws a police \nforce should enforce. In answers to my written questions, he merely \nnoted marijuana was already low on the force's list. Chief \nKerlikowske's lax record on marijuana enforcement concerns me because \nmarijuana is still often the precursor to more dangerous drugs, and it \nonly endangers those who use it. The next ONDCP Director must be a \nstrong opponent of marijuana and all illegal drugs, as well as act as \nan aggressive enforcer of the laws regulating these harmful narcotics.\n  Additionally, Chief Kerlikowske apparently has no experience on \ninternational supply interdiction. We need someone who understands \ninternational drug problems and can help formulate a successful long-\nterm strategy to address them. Chief Kerlikowske's lack of this \nexperience, along with his lax record on marijuana crimes, raise \nquestions for me on his ability to act as an effective Director of \nONDCP. However, several organizations, such as the Major Cities Chief \nAssociation, the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse \nDirectors, and the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, have \nexpressed support for this nominee. While I will not hold up his \nnomination, I put Chief Kerlikowske on notice that I expect him to \nprovide strong leadership in producing and coordinating drug control \nstrategy and to aggressively work to enforce our drug laws.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring the quorum be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, at last, the Senate considers \nPresident Obama's nomination of Chief R. Gil Kerlikowske to be Director \nof National Drug Control Policy. This highly qualified nominee has \ndrawn widespread support, and I had hoped the Senate would confirm him \nbefore our last recess. I look forward to his being confirmed today \nwith strong bipartisan support.\n  Chief Kerlikowske has almost 40 years of experience in law \nenforcement, including in his current role as chief of police for the \nSeattle Police Department. In his long career in public service, Chief \nKerlikowske has demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of narcotics \nissues. He currently serves as the elected president of the Major \nCities Chiefs Association, and he began his career as an Outstanding \nMilitary Police Officer Honor Graduate in the U.S. Military Police in \n1970. He served as the police commissioner of Buffalo, NY, and as the \npolice chief in two Florida cities, Fort Pierce and Port St. Lucie. He \nworked in the Justice Department during the Clinton administration, \nwhere he served as the Deputy Director of the Office of Community \nOriented Police Services.\n  I thank the Senators from Washington State, Senator Murray and \nSenator Cantwell, for their strong endorsement of this outstanding \nnominee at our April 1 hearing and for their continued efforts in \nsupport of his confirmation.\n  Chief Kerlikowske's nomination has received numerous letters of \nsupport, including strong endorsements from Republican and Democratic \npublic officials, State and local law enforcement officials, the \nNational Center for Victims of Crime, the United States Conference of \nMayors, the Community Anti-Drug Coalition of America, the Washington \nAssociation of Sheriffs and Police, and the National Council on Crime \nand Delinquency. General Barry R. McCaffrey, who led the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy during the Clinton administration, writes \nthat Chief Kerlikowske ``is known and highly respected internationally \nfor his knowledge of crime and drugs.''\n  Mary Lou Leary, the executive director of the National Center for \nVictims of Crime, describes Chief Kerlikowske as a ``strong manager,'' \nwho is ``committed to crime prevention'' and who ``understands the \nconnection between illegal drugs and crime.'' Arthur T. Dean, the \nchairman and CEO of the Community Anti-Drug Coalition of America, wrote \nthat Chief Kerlikowske understands that drug policy ``must be \ncomprehensive and coordinated'' and ``recognizes that the perspectives \nof those closest to the ground--state and local enforcement, \nprevention, treatment, and recovery professionals--play a critical role \nin this strategy.''\n  As a former prosecutor, I have always advocated vigorous enforcement \nand punishment of those who commit serious crimes. Along with others \nwho serve in law enforcement, I also know that punishment alone will \nnot solve the problems of drugs and violence in our rural communities. \nI am pleased that Mr. Kerlikowske supports combating drug use and crime \nwith all the tools at our disposal, including enforcement, prevention, \nand treatment.\n  I congratulate Chief Kerlikowske and his family on his confirmation \ntoday, and I look forward to working with him in the years ahead.\n  Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is scheduled to vote at 2 p.m. on \nthe nomination of Mr. Kerlikowske.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Without objection, all time is yielded back.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof R. Gil Kerlikowske to be Director of National Drug Control Policy? \nThe yeas and nay have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, many of my colleagues and citizens across \nthe country recognize this Saturday as National Train Day, a \ncelebration of 140 years of coast-to-coast rail travel in the Unite \nStates.\n  I rise to commemorate the proud history of America's railways, but \nalso to mark this as a time for more than celebration.\n  We must see this occasion as an opportunity to look ahead, to \nreinvest in our nation's infrastructure and begin a fresh chapter of \nhigh-speed rail service.\n  In May of 1869, the Central Pacific and Union Pacific Railroads were \njoined in the remote Utah desert, connecting the east and west coasts \nof the United States and completing the very first transcontinental \nrailroad in our Nation's history.\n  For almost a century and a half since, trains have transformed the \nway goods are transported and intercity passengers reach their \ndestinations.\n  From the moment of their birth, America's railroads have represented \nour efforts to meet the challenges and opportunities of living in a \nNation that spans a continent.\n  The rails that connected Atlantic to Pacific became the backbone upon \nwhich we built American commerce and ingenuity. In many ways they \ndefined the fabric of our culture, laying the foundation that allowed \nour civilization to push the American frontier ever westward.\n  Every year, Amtrak transports 28 million Americans between 500 \ncommunities in 46 States.\n  Intercity passenger rail is 18 percent more energy efficient than air \ntravel and 25 percent more efficient than automobiles, making the \nmodern locomotive one of the most refined and environmentally friendly \ntechnologies in American history.\n  I have seen this firsthand. My early life was shaped in part by the \ngreat American railway. I was raised in Centralia, IL, a small town \nthat was very much centered around the railroad.\n  We lived along a major line originating in Chicago, a national \ntransportation hub that ships goods, passengers and economic \nopportunity to every community it touches as the trains set out across \nthe American heartland.\n  Like many in our town, my father, grandfather and four great uncles \nworked many years for the Illinois Central Railroad.\n  I am proud to be a part of the legacy that he and many others helped \nto create in Illinois and across the country, a legacy that continues \nto shape us even today.\n  But now the aging infrastructure that gave definition to this country \nis badly in need of repair. The time has come once again to invest in \nrail travel.\n  Throughout my career, I have supported high-speed rail technology, \nwhich will curb pollution and ease crowding on our roads and in the \nskies.\n  Now, under President Obama's leadership, we have the chance to make \nthis dream a reality.\n  By making a substantial investment in clean, safe high-speed rail, we \ncan renew the deep connections that bind our cities and states to one \nanother and to our shared national identity.\n  We can create jobs, revitalize our economy, protect our environment, \nand continue the proud tradition of our national railways.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with me in reaffirming this commitment to \nmodern rail service. I am glad that so many recognize the importance of \nrailroads in shaping the past we share. But this year, on National \nTrain Day, we should celebrate our past by looking to the future.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President, the Senate Finance Committee, on which I \nserve, is about to take up the toughest issue in the debate about \nhealth care reform; that is, the question of how to pay for it.\n  To be credible, that means showing that you are not going to sit \naround and wait for years and years to start cutting costs but, in \nfact, you are going to start generating savings, in the $2.5 trillion \nour country spends on health care, quickly. And you must do it in a \nbipartisan fashion that is acceptable to our people.\n  So, today, I offer the four pillars of immediate health care cost \ncontainment. Each one of these pillars is an idea that is supported by \ninfluential Democratic Senators and influential Republican Senators in \nthe Senate.\n  The first pillar of immediate health care cost containment requires \nthat\n\n[[Page S5271]]\n\nthere be tax relief for the middle class but no more tax subsidies for \ndesigner smiles. It sounds incredible, but today hard-working middle-\nclass folks who are uninsured or underinsured--every day--watch their \ntaxes go to subsidize designer smiles for the most affluent that would \nbe worthy of Hollywood.\n  The first pillar of health care cost containment starts saving \nbillions of dollars immediately by taking away unneeded tax breaks and \nbeefing up health care tax relief for middle-class workers and their \nfamilies.\n  The second pillar of immediate health care cost containment means \ntaking an axe to health care administrative costs. Americans are \ndrowning in health care rules and administrative hassles. Now you can \njunk the health care bureaucracy by doing everything just once: signing \nup for the health care you want; paying for it through the withholding \nsystem you use with every paycheck; keeping what you have, if you leave \nyour job, or your job leaves you; and easily finding out about the \ncosts and quality of health care services that are near you, and doing \nit on line.\n  The third principle of immediate health care cost containment is \neverybody is in, and everyone has to be personally responsible. You \ncannot lower health care costs in this country without good, quality, \naffordable coverage for all. If you do not cover everyone, there is too \nmuch cost shifting and not enough prevention.\n  Personal responsibility is just as important. Americans cannot fix \nhealth care unless everyone secures basic coverage, with extra help for \nfolks who would have difficulty affording that. More than 11 million \npeople with incomes of well over $60,000 do not buy basic health \ninsurance, and that is part of the reason hospital emergency rooms are \nso busy in America. Cutting health care costs means getting everybody \nin the system, and it means everyone would be personally responsible.\n  Finally, the fourth principle of immediate health care cost \ncontainment is a revolution in health insurance. Today, health \ninsurance is about cherrypicking. The private insurance companies scour \nyour health history, and they want you if you are healthy and wealthy. \nSick people, on the other hand, are sent to Government programs more \nfragile than they are.\n  Holding down costs soon means changing this, prohibiting the \ninsurance companies from discriminating against those with illnesses \nand requiring a system that features real competition--real competition \nwhere the insurance industry does not compete to see who is the best at \nleaving out those who have health problems but competition that is \nbased on benefit and quality and price. That is not Government-run \nhealth care. That is old-fashioned competition--the kind of bedrock \nprinciples of competition our country understands.\n  When insurance companies compete on the basis of price, benefit, and \nquality, that is about as pure a kind of competition as you could have \nin our country, and it would revolutionize the health insurance \nbusiness in our country.\n  Each one of these four pillars of immediate health care cost \ncontainment is supported by influential Democrats and Republicans in \nthe Senate. If these four principles were adopted, the Senate could go \nto the country and show our people that on the health issue they care \nabout the most--which is containing costs--the Senate has a plan for \ncost containment that will kick in quickly, in the next few years--not \nsomething for which you have to wait 10, 15, 20 years from now. And \ncertainly there are a lot of changes in the health care system that \nought to be made now because they will save money in 10 or 15 years.\n  But the four pillars of immediate health care cost containment I \noutlined this afternoon--tax relief for the middle class and no more \ntax breaks for designer smiles; taking an axe to health care \nadministrative costs; everybody in the system, and everyone personally \nresponsible; and a revolution in the health insurance business--those \nare ideas that are now sponsored by Democrats and Republicans in the \nSenate and will soon save health care costs. They will reduce health \ncare costs, and do it quickly, so that the Senate can be credible with \nthe country on this issue of health care reform.\n  There are other important principles to this question of getting \nhealth care on track. Chairman Baucus, in my view, has done yeoman work \nin terms of his sessions to look at the various issues--delivery and \ncoverage.\n  I have made the case, with considerable passion, on the coverage \nquestion that I think Americans want on the coverage issue--coverage \nthat is at least as good as Members of Congress have--and the \nCongressional Budget Office has said it is possible to pay for that, \nagain, with the kinds of principles of cost containment I have \noutlined. Other colleagues, I am sure, will have other views with \nrespect to what the basic benefit package ought to be about.\n  I also think it is going to be very important to send a \nstraightforward message to those who have coverage that there are \nconsiderable benefits for them in reform as well. We have talked on \nthis floor before--Democrats and Republicans--about making sure \neverybody can keep the coverage they have. That is something Senators \nhear about at every meeting they have when they discuss health care, \nand I think there are going to be 100 Senators voting in favor of the \nprinciple that all our people ought to be able to keep the coverage \nthey have.\n  But there are two other words I think those people with coverage are \nlooking for. I say to the Presiding Officer, you and I have had some \ndiscussion on this issue before. Those folks with coverage want to hear \nabout how they are going to be wealthier and healthier with the health \ncare reform legislation that would be passed in the Congress. On this \nissue, the fundamental question is going to be about increasing the \nchoices that individuals have for their coverage.\n  I have not spoken about this on the floor of the Senate in the past, \nbut I was flabbergasted to learn that those who are lucky enough to \nhave employer-based coverage in this country--of that group, 85 percent \nof them get no choice at all. They get one package, and that is it. So \nyou have 85 percent of the people in this country who are lucky enough \nto have health care coverage who do not get what their elected \nofficials from Colorado and Oregon and everywhere get.\n  We get a full menu of health care choices. Of course, that is a big \nfactor in holding down health care costs for all because then you have \nsome competition. And if one company does not do well in 2009, \neverybody is off in 2010 and choosing somebody else.\n  So it is going to be very important to show those with coverage--\npeople who want to be healthier and wealthier after health care reform \nis passed--that one of the ways to get some additional money in your \npocket is to have more choices. Because when you have only one choice, \nof course, there are not the kind of competitive juices at work in your \nhealth care system that even Members of Congress have.\n  So what I have been interested in is saying that if you want to stay \nwith your employer's package--absolutely--Democrats and Republicans in \nthe Senate are committed to doing that. But if you, for example, want \nto choose one of the private alternatives that would be established in \nhealth reform legislation, and would be certified by your State as \nprotecting consumers, you ought to be able to make that choice. And if \nin making that choice you save money relative to what it might cost for \nyour employer's package, you get to get those savings and--without \noffense to Colorado--you can use the money to go fishing in Oregon \nbecause we have created a marketplace.\n  So I wanted to come today and lay out the four immediate principles \nof health care cost containment. I think there will be other central \nquestions, such as the issue of coverage and the question of how to \nmake sure the Senate keeps faith with the 160 million people--it is \nabout 160 million people, on any given day, who have employer-based \ncoverage and wish to keep what they have--who would like to be \nhealthier and wealthier, and, finally, if they want to leave their job \nor their job leaves them, their coverage ought to be portable and they \ncan take it with them.\n  Finally, let me note that I think Chairman Baucus and Senator \nGrassley, the leaders on the Finance Committee, are doing an \nexceptionally good and an exceptionally fair job in terms of tackling \nthis issue. The fact\n\n[[Page S5272]]\n\nis, health care reform, particularly financing it, is not a subject for \nthe fainthearted. There is a reason this issue has been tough to tackle \nsince the days of Harry Truman of 60 years ago. But under the \nleadership of Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley and the Finance \nCommittee--and I think I can speak for Senators on both sides of the \naisle that we are very appreciative of what Chairman Kennedy and \nSenator Enzi are doing in the HELP Committee. The four of them are our \ncommittee leaders, our chairs and our ranking minority members. I \nbelieve that this time, after 60 years of working on this issue, it can \nget done.\n  The fact is, for health reformers, the history of trying to fix \nhealth care is almost the story of unrequited love. If you look back on \nthis issue, almost every 15 years reformers say: This is the time. I \nfinally found the one. I am going to be able to have my dreams \nrealized.\n  Of course, it has been exactly 15 years since the last effort in \n1994, during the Clinton years. Harry and Louise pretty much soured \nthat romance in 1993 and 1994. But I do think, largely because of the \ngood work being done by Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley and \nChairman Kennedy and Senator Enzi, this year is different. A lot of \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle have moved toward an approach \nthat I believe will allow us to come together.\n  There is a recognition that Democrats have been right on the \nproposition that if you fix this, you have to cover everybody. If you \ndon't get all Americans high-quality, affordable coverage, you have \nthat cost-shifting I spoke about and inadequate attention to \nprevention. I think there is a recognition that colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle in the Republican Party are making valid points as \nwell. There ought to be private choices. It is important not to freeze \ninnovation. We ought to stay clear of price controls. So there is an \nopportunity now, with the Senate being led by two very fine chairs and \nranking minority members, to get this done.\n  I will close with an observation from a number of economists. Our \ncountry clearly is concerned about the cost of these bailouts and \nfinancial obligations in the banking and housing sector. Most of those \nfolks believe that the astounding sums being spent on financial \nbailouts--they are going to look like a rounding error if health care \nis not fixed. So the stakes are very high. Fixing the economy means \nfixing health care.\n  With the principles I have outlined here today, the four immediate \nprinciples of health care and cost containment, I think the Senate can \nget off on the most important and most difficult issue of health care--\ncontaining costs--and do it in a bipartisan way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/07/senate-section/article/S5272-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5272-S5273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CRAIG FUGATE NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, a couple of weeks ago, Senator \nMartinez and I had the privilege of introducing Craig Fugate, President \nObama's nominee for the head of FEMA, before the Senate Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee. The committee promptly \nreported him right out. It is because he is so uniquely qualified.\n  Craig has served as the director of emergency management in our State \nsince 2001, and he has overseen the response to 11 Presidentially \ndeclared disasters in our State. He is one of the most respected \nleaders in emergency management in the country, and he is the one--if \nyou want a pro's pro--with the experience and the expertise FEMA needs \nat this time. Why? Look at how he came up: a former firefighter, a \nparamedic, a fire rescue lieutenant, an emergency manager. All of that \nwas at the local government level, Alachua County, which is \nGainesville, FL.\n  He spent 15 years working in local emergency management before he \nwent up to the Emergency Operations Center at the State level. Since he \nhas become the director of emergency management, he has handled the \nresponses to the landfall of five major hurricanes in Florida, and that \nwas within a 2-year time period.\n  I will never forget when Hurricane Charley came barreling up the \nsouthwest Florida coast headed straight for Tampa Bay. Suddenly, at the \nlast minute, it took a right-hand turn and it went right up Charlotte \nBay. Ground zero was Punta Gorda, FL.\n  By the way, people had evacuated Tampa and then come down to the \nhotels, especially the Holiday Inn Punta Gorda, and here they are right \nin the middle of the storm.\n  That storm was so intense that it blew the roof off of the Charlotte \nCounty Emergency Operation Center. They had to evacuate the CCEOC in \nthe middle of the storm. I got there later that day, after the storm \nhit that morning, and I will never forget seeing Craig in the mobile \nemergency operation center that the State of Florida brought in as he \nwas taking over and directing operations in the midst of that chaos. \nOur Florida emergency management response to disasters--with a sense of \nurgency and efficiency--has emerged as a role model for disaster \npreparation and disaster response. That, in large part, has been as a \nresult of the leadership of Craig Fugate.\n  It is also very interesting, when you respond to these kinds of \nnational disasters, that you have cooperation between the civilian \nemergency response and the National Guard. Of course, the Florida \nNational Guard is the best in the business because they know how to \ntake care of business when it comes to emergency response to \nhurricanes.\n  Under Craig's leadership, Florida has become the first State to \nreceive full accreditation for its emergency management program. Craig \nnot only has creativity but a sense of humor. He judges things after a \nhurricane by the ``Waffle House'' test. He says if the Waffle House is \nopen after the hurricane, that means there is power and water in there. \nIf the Waffle House is closed, things are pretty bad, and a lot of \nthings have been shut down. If the Waffle House is open and they have a \nlimited menu, then it generally means the power has been out for quite \na while because everything in their freezer has melted and has spoiled.\n  I think Craig's exemplary service speaks for itself.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a number of documents be \nprinted in the Record, including a letter from Governor Crist, and a \nletter from a host of organizations, all the way from the Public Works \nAssociation, the American Red Cross--I will not list them all, but it \ngoes through the National Wildlife Federation and the Reinsurance \nAssociation of America. Another one is by the Council of State \nGovernments. Everybody is singing Craig Fugate's praises.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   April 17, 2009.\n     Hon. Bill Nelson,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mel Martinez,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Nelson and Martinez: I would like to extend \n     my most sincere appreciation to you for introducing Florida \n     Division of Emergency Management Director Craig Fugate at his \n     United States Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday, April \n     22. Craig's nomination to be the Director of the Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency instills a great sense of pride \n     in all Floridians. Although his confirmation would mean that \n     we are losing a great asset to our state, Craig's renowned \n     expertise in disaster preparedness, response, recovery, and \n     mitigation activities will, without a doubt, benefit our \n     entire nation.\n       As you well know, Craig has consistently proven to be among \n     the most respected leaders in emergency management through \n     his outstanding work and vast experience. As the Director of \n     the Florida Division of Emergency Management, Craig has dealt \n     with every type of natural disaster ranging from wildfires to \n     hurricanes, and he has managed them all effectively through \n     his total commitment to ensuring the safety of Florida's \n     citizens.\n       For Craig, success is not about personal glory. Instead, it \n     is about building a great team that takes action to prepare \n     for, and respond to, disasters and their impacts. I know we \n     share the belief that Craig would utilize this same \n     leadership philosophy as FEMA director.\n       In advance, thank you for helping to shepherd the \n     nomination of Craig Fugate through the United States Senate. \n     It is exciting to see the hard work and expertise of\n\n[[Page S5273]]\n\n     a great Floridian like Craig recognized at the national \n     level. I am confident he will continue to make all of Florida \n     proud of his leadership.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything \n     else I can do to help expedite the process of confirming \n     Florida's Craig Fugate to this important post. He is the \n     right person at the right time.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Charlie Crist,\n     Florida Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      May 5, 2009.\n     Hon.

After all, this is now \n1 week into the month of May. Remember, hurricane season officially \nstarts June 1.\n  We need to have Craig Fugate in place so that FEMA is ready to go at \nthis particular time, when there is another challenge facing the gulf \ncoast and the Atlantic coast, and potentially the Pacific coast. I hope \nthe Senate is going to act quickly on his confirmation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, yesterday President Obama announced he \nwould nominate Inez Tenenbaum as the new Chair of the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission, and Robert Adler as the new CPSC Commissioner. The \nPresident also announced he would restore this Commission from a three- \nto a five-commissioner body and provide $107 million for the agency in \nits fiscal year 2010 budget, a 71-percent increase in that budget over \nPresident Bush's request for fiscal year 2007.\n  I share President Obama's commitment to consumer safety and his goal \nof restoring the CPSC to prominence as our Nation's premier consumer \nwatchdog agency. CPSC oversees the safety of over 15,000 consumer \nproducts, but for far too long it was hindered by a lack of funding, a \nlack of staff, outdated authorities and failed leadership. We all \nremember what happened after that. Faulty cribs that trapped and killed \ninfants; toys coated in lead paint that endangered toddlers and \nchildren; magnetic toys that, when swallowed, caused serious injuries \nand even a child's death.\n  Most Americans were shocked when they read the stories. They assumed \nthat if they put it on a shelf in a store in America, somebody took a \nlook at it. That is not always the case. Sadly, this agency, which had \na special responsibility for dangerous products, had fallen into a \nstate of disrepair, not just in terms of adequate staffing and \nresources but, unfortunately, in the previous administration, not \nadequate commitment. There was a belief this had to continue to be a \nsmall and virtually unheard of agency at a time when exports into the \nUnited States were flooding the market. If there were ever a time when \nwe needed a consumer watchdog, it was over the last 10 years, as more \nand more of these imports from foreign countries came onto our shores.\n  We learned the hard way. We learned with pet food from China that had \nbeen spiked with melamine for economic reasons and ended up killing a \nlot of dogs and cats that people dearly loved. We learned it with the \ntoys with lead paint and the toys that were dangerous. We learned this \nagency was not up to the task.\n  I can remember meeting with some of the people who worked there. Some \nof them were good, hard-working people. But when I met with the man \nwhose name was Bob, who was the toy tester, I found that his laboratory \nfor testing toys exported to the United States looked about as bad as \nmy workbench in my basement at home. Unfortunately, he didn't have any \nkind of technical equipment. What Bob had done was draw a couple marks \non the wall, one was at about 4 feet, another at 6 feet, and Bob would \ntake the toy and drop it from 4 feet to see if it fell apart into \nlittle pieces that the kids might swallow. If it made that test, Bob \ntook it up to 6 feet and dropped it again. That was the Federal toy \ntesting program for the United States of America.\n  We learned the hard way, when a lot of dangerous toys were sold and a \nlot of them went untested. That had to change. With the leadership of \none of my colleagues from Arkansas, Senator Mark Pryor, we embarked on \na reauthorization of this agency and gave it new authorities and new \npowers. Sadly, some of the holdovers--one Commissioner from a previous \nadministration--complained, said she didn't understand why we needed to \ndo this, that we were going too far in giving more power to this \nagency. It tells you a lot about the mindset of the agency in the old \ndays.\n\n[[Page S5274]]\n\n  Then we matched that with appropriations funds from an appropriations \nsubcommittee that I chair to make sure they had enough money to hire \ntesters and buy equipment and to make certain they could take a look at \nproducts before they arrived in the warehouses of America and on the \nstore shelves to make certain they were safe before they came in.\n  It went along very slowly, when it should have gone quickly because \nthe right leadership was not at the agency. When President Obama was \nsworn in, one of my first calls was to urge him to fill the slots at \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission with true consumer advocates. \nOur passage of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act--which \nPresident Bush had signed into law--by an overwhelming vote of 89 to 3 \nin the Senate was an indication this was a bipartisan issue, as it \nshould have been. That law virtually eliminated lead from toys and \nchildren's products, made sure the products met national standards, \nauthorized a doubling of the Consumer Product Safety Commission budget, \nand strengthened the Commission's ability to protect Americans.\n  Yesterday, President Obama's announcement of these two vacancies \nbeing filled builds on that effort to make sure the Commission has the \nright leadership in place to implement a law in a comprehensive, yet \ncommonsense, manner.\n  Inez Tenenbaum is someone I know. She is a long-time advocate for \nchildren and families. She was the former superintendent of education \nin South Carolina. She oversaw an agency larger than the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission in both budget and staff, and under her \ntenure student achievement in that State improved the fastest in the \nNation.\n  Robert Adler, consumer advocate and expert on the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission, was a professor at the University of North Carolina, \nwhere he worked extensively on consumer protection and product \nliability. He has also served as an attorney and advisor to previous \nCPSC Commissioners. I strongly support President Obama's nominees. I am \nglad he is going to bring about a new day at this agency. It is long \noverdue. Millions of Americans, millions of families and kids are \ncounting on this agency to make sure that when products make the \nshelves in America, they are safe for American consumers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/07/senate-section/article/S5274-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5274-S5275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               AMERICA'S GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT CAPACITY ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Earlier this year, President Obama announced a new policy \nfor Afghanistan and Pakistan beginning to really focus important \nresources and attention on those countries--resources that were, \ntragically, diverted during the war in Iraq.\n  I was honored today to be invited for a lunch with President Zardari \nof Pakistan and President Karzai of Afghanistan. They are now working \ntogether--and that was not always the case--to stop the spread of the \nTaliban and al-Qaida. They are starting to do things which I think \nshould have been done a long time ago. For example, I was surprised to \nlearn when I visited Afghanistan a little over a year ago that we had \nfewer than 10 agricultural experts in that country. We know that \ncountry, which was once a prolific exporter of agricultural products, \nhas now descended to a point where the major export is poppy and \nheroin, which, of course, fuels the underground economy and fuels the \nTaliban in their efforts to bring terrorism to Afghanistan and \nPakistan. Well, to learn that we have fewer than 10 agricultural \nexperts working on the ground in Afghanistan to try to change this was \ndisappointing. This administration, the new Obama administration, has \nmade a commitment to raise that number to over 50 in a hurry, as they \nshould, so that we will be able to counsel those in agriculture in \nAfghanistan about lucrative, profitable crops that will not be feeding \nterrorism. That is one of the things that needs to be done, not just \nthe military side but the economic side as well.\n  We understand--and Secretary Clinton has said such--that if we are \ngoing to be successful in Afghanistan and Pakistan, we have to bring \nthis effort down to ground level, not just to suppress the violence but \nto make certain we build a civil economy and a civil government that \ncan sustain democratic and free growth in those two countries. I was \nglad to be part of that effort today. I believe there is a lot more to \ndo. I join with Senators Kit Bond of Missouri, Patty Murray of \nWashington, and Chris Dodd of Connecticut, as well as Sheldon \nWhitehouse of Rhode Island, in introducing a bill that is called the \nIncreasing America's Global Development Capacity Act, to improve our \nNation's capacity to undertake global development activities.\n  The bill would triple the number of USAID Foreign Service officers by \n2012. If we implement this legislation, in 3 years USAID will have \n3,000 talented, committed Americans serving in the world's most \ndifficult locations, helping to improve the lives of others, and \nshowing the world what America is all about. I would much rather beef \nup the USAID than run the risk of sending more American soldiers to \nface the dangers of war in those foreign countries. I think we can help \nwin over the hearts and minds of people around the world if we have the \nright American ambassador in a civilian capacity using diplomacy and \ndevelopment as major tools.\n  The President's strategy wisely emphasizes training the Afghan army \nand building up the police; a renewed effort to deal with the Taliban's \nsafe havens in Pakistan; and a long overdue civilian surge in State \nDepartment and U.S. Agency for International Development personnel, \nwith particular emphases on diplomacy, agriculture, good governance, \nand job creation.\n  It is unfortunate that more than 7 years after the war in Afghanistan \nbegan we are only now providing sufficient civilian resources and \nexperts to help win the peace in Afghanistan.\n  The Bush administration neglected to focus on post-war needs in both \nIraq and Afghanistan. Once our brave military men and women \naccomplished their early military goals, few if any plans existed for \nsignificant investments in strengthening critical economic, governance, \nand rule of law institutions.\n  The results have been sadly obvious. Our military has had to stay \nlonger than anticipated while we play catch up on these basic building \nblocks that are needed for any true long-term stability.\n  This failure to invest in and deploy our civilian experts has placed \nan unfair burden on our military and their families.\n  Our military leaders have recognized the critical nature of the \ncivilian development and diplomatic component of American engagement \nabroad.\n  Secretary of Defense Gates has said it clearly:\n\n       What is clear to me is that there is a need for a dramatic \n     increase in spending on the civilian instruments of national \n     security--diplomacy, strategic communications, foreign \n     assistance, civic action, and economic reconstruction and \n     development.\n\n  He continued;\n\n       One of the most important lessons of the wars in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan is that military success is not sufficient to \n     win: economic development, institution-building and the rule \n     of law, promoting internal reconciliation, good governance, \n     providing basic services to the people, training and \n     equipping indigenous military and police forces, strategic \n     communications, and more--these, along with security, are \n     essential ingredients for long-term success.\n\n  Secretary Clinton has similarly said:\n\n       In order for us to pursue an ambitious foreign policy to \n     both solve and manage problems, to address our interests and \n     advance our values, we have to reform both State and USAID. \n     And to do so, we have to create a Department and an agency \n     that are funded the right way, where the people doing this \n     work have the tools and authorities that they need. This is \n     particularly important in dangerous regions like Iraq and \n     Afghanistan.\n\n  Our Nation's ability to help others improve their lives is a critical \ncomponent of American foreign policy. Development initiatives help stem \nHIV/AIDS and other global pandemics; provide food, clean water, and \nsanitation to the world's poor; strengthen democratic processes and \ninstitutions; and foster economic growth.\n  These efforts demonstrate our leadership and concern, foster goodwill \nand an appreciation of American values, and provide alternatives to the \ndespair that can lead others to turn against us.\n  That is why a recent story in the New York Times about Afghanistan is \nso tragic. The article's title ``G.I.'s\n\n[[Page S5275]]\n\nFilling Civilian Gap to Rebuild Afghanistan'' says it all.\n  We now have a President who has formed a sound policy for \nAfghanistan, but we simply do not have the civilian international \ndevelopment experts necessary to fill the civilian needs in \nAfghanistan.\n  This is tragic.\n  Think about after the attacks of September 11 how many Americans \nwanted to serve their country, whether in the military, in Americorps \nprograms, or in the Foreign Service.\n  We should have taken advantage of that groundswell of American \nidealism and determination to bring some of our brightest minds into \nthe State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development \nwhere they could use their talents and desire for public service to \nmake a difference in the lives of others around the world and to help \nbring stability to faraway places.\n  The need is stark. Take USAID alone. In the 1960s when President \nKennedy launched the agency, it had more than 5,000 Foreign Service \nofficers. Today, with obvious needs around the world from Afghanistan \nto Iraq to Congo, it has just over 1,000.\n  Its budget in real dollars has shrunk by almost one quarter.\n  That is right. At a time when people on both sides of the aisle, as \nwell as in the military and civilian leadership of our government, \nagree on the great need for such civilian engagement, our lead \ninternational development agency has seen its key staff cut by 80 \npercent and its funding by more than 25 percent.\n  We have this all backwards.\n  This increase in development professionals would be a first step \ntowards rebalancing the three pillars of our foreign policy and \nnational security--development, defense, and diplomacy, and would go a \nlong way in helping face some of our country's biggest global \nchallenges.\n  I urge support for this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise this afternoon to discuss the \nbenefits of nuclear power to our Nation.\n  Last week, I was fortunate enough to visit the Savannah River Site, \nalong with three of our colleagues, Senator Isakson and our two South \nCarolina colleagues, Senator Graham and Senator DeMint, to watch the \nDepartment of Energy employees at the Savannah River Site carry out \ntheir mission.\n  This site has been safely operating since the 1950s refining \nmaterials for nuclear weapons. In more than fifty years, there has not \nbeen a single nuclear incident at the Savannah River Site, proving that \nit is possible to safely operate and maintain our nuclear facilities. \nBut in the past decade, the place that has helped bolster America's \nstanding in the atomic age and has been a watchword for America's \nnuclear might has also begun to harness spent forces for peaceful \npurposes--to bring light and heat into American homes.\n  The Savannah River Site has helped lead the way in disposing of \nnuclear material. For more than 6 years, the facility has blended \nweapons-grade, highly enriched uranium to make low-enriched uranium \nthat is being converted into commercial reactor fuel. It recently \nexpanded its mission to include converting excess weapons-grade \nplutonium from decommissioned nuclear weapons and will become a \nconsolidation point for all weapons-grade plutonium in the United \nStates. This will result in more fuel for commercial power reactors.\n  Materials that once tipped our arsenal of nuclear warheads are now \nbeing used to provide the light by which Georgians eat dinner, do their \nhomework, and the power with which they heat their homes in winter and \ncool them in our hot summers. In fact, one-fifth of Georgia's total \ngenerating capacity comes from nuclear power--second only to coal.\n  The two nuclear plants in Georgia provide some of the lowest cost \nelectricity in our State. The power they generate is safe, reliable, \nand, most significant in the midst of this national debate on climate \nchange--emissions free and environmentally responsible.\n  Despite those clear advantages, in America at large, nuclear power \nproduces some 20 percent of the Nation's energy. Compare that to \nFrance, where nuclear power sources provide nearly 80 percent of that \ncountry's power.\n  Intriguingly, in terms of national security, the Savannah River Site \nis playing a key role in America's nuclear nonproliferation efforts. \nThe nuclear power generated from reducing our nuclear weapons stockpile \nat the Savannah River Site is coming full circle: In its conversion \nfrom weapons to commercial nuclear fuel, it is helping reduce America's \ndependance on foreign energy sources, often from countries that do not \nlike us and do not have our best interests at heart.\n  Additionally, the work conducted at the Savannah River Site helps \nmaintain America's technical and scientific nuclear base, preserving \nthe expertise to expand commercial nuclear energy as well as the \nexpertise to modernize our existing nuclear weapons arsenal.\n  I was impressed by the talent and expertise of Savannah River Site \nemployees I met who are some of the leading nuclear experts in the \nworld. However, they are an endangered breed and will continue to be \nunless America commits to expanded nuclear energy and research and \ndevelopment.\n  We know America's energy consumption will increase. We know the \nincreased demand will drive the need for more base-load capacity. \nDemographers predict that 40 percent of the total U.S. population will \nlive in the Southeast by 2030. Georgia alone is slated to add 4 million \nnew residents during that time frame. If we are to meet the growing \nenergy needs of Georgia and of our Nation in keeping with America's \nnational security interests, the ingenuity of employees at the Savannah \nRiver Site and other such facilities is key to such efforts. I applaud \ntheir great work. I look forward to many more years of expansion of the \ntechnology that is being developed to dispose of our nuclear waste as \nwell as recycle our nuclear waste and to reuse that waste.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/07/senate-section/article/S5275-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n Mr. MENENDEZ.

VAUGHN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, this week, LTG Clyde Vaughn, Director of \nthe Army National Guard, retires after almost 35 years of excellent \nservice to the Army National Guard and the U.S. Army. He has been an \nabsolutely superb Army Guard Director.\n  Under General Vaughn's watch, the Guard has undertaken one of the \nmost successful recruiting programs in history. The Army Guard has \nbecome more capable, ready, and better equipped than at any point over \nthe past several decades. Under his watch, the Army Guard has helped \nmake the country stronger. General Vaughn leaves big shoes to fill.\n  The Army National Guard is a critically important part of the Army \nand the entire Armed Forces. Citizen-soldiers from the Army National \nGuard have comprised a high percentage of the forces on the ground in \nIraq and Afghanistan. The members of the Army Guard also are our \nmilitary first responders for emergencies at home, ready to quickly \nsupport our elected leaders and other civilian authorities in such \nemergencies as flooding and hurricanes. General Vaughn has brought an \nacute understanding of the Army National Guard, built from his \nexperiences in the Missouri National Guard and from successful joint \nassignments in Washington and further afield.\n  During his time as Army Guard Director, the National Guard has racked \nup some extraordinary accomplishments. Soldiers--the proud citizen-\nsoldiers from all the States and Territories--and families have \nremained\n\n[[Page S5276]]\n\nforemost in General Vaughn's mind. In recent years, the Army Guard has \nreversed a downward trend in filling its ranks and boosted enlistments \ntremendously. We have a more educated and a healthier force with more \nfull-time personnel. In his last months on the job, General Vaughn has \nlaid out a sensible plan to build readiness within the Army Guard, \nending the harmful practice of counting untrained and transient \nsoldiers against the end-strength of various units.\n  Working closely with Congress, General Vaughn has also ensured that \nthe Guard has more modern equipment. The Army Guard has much better \ngear today than it did 4 years ago.\n  Lieutenant General Vaughn is a leader who forthrightly lays out his \nviews, whether to Congress or his counterparts in the active Army. It \nis this deep honesty and intelligence that has made him an inspiration \nto his subordinates and a close adviser to his superiors. Lieutenant \nGeneral Clyde Vaughn knows and loves the Army National Guard, having \nlived and breathed with this force of citizen-soldiers for more than \nthree decades. The country owes General Vaughn, as well as his wife \nCarol and kids Chad and Kristi, our thanks and hearty congratulations \non a job, very well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/07/senate-section/article/S5276-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NOMINATION OF DEMETRIOS JAMES MARANTIS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, today I would like to recognize one of \nthe finest members of my staff to ever work for me, the State of \nMontana, and the U.S. Senate. Demetrios James Marantis has served in \nthe Senate since 2005, and on Wednesday, the Senate approved his \nnomination to be Deputy U.S. Trade Representative.\n  When Demetrios first joined my staff more than 4 years ago, he came \nwith a chorus of support and an impressive set of skills and \nexperience. This week, he leaves the Senate for his next challenge with \nan even larger group of supporters and another impressive list of \naccomplishments.\n  Demetrios was at the center of the largest expansion and reform of \ntrade adjustment assistance since its creation four decades ago. He was \ncritical to our granting permanent normal trade relations to Vietnam, \nand instrumental in keeping U.S.-China economic ties on track in \nchallenging times. Demetrios helped me and the Senate extend trade \npreference programs to the world's poorest nations, and worked to lay \nthe groundwork for the important pending trade agreements that I hope \nthat the Senate will consider in the coming months.\n  He did all of this with an unwavering commitment to this country, and \nan unassailable reputation for fairness and openness to supporters and \nopponents alike. And as many of my colleagues and their staff will \nalways remember, Demetrios never failed to bring a little bit of fun \nand a good sense of humor to even the hardest job.\n  But what I will remember most about Demetrios is his commitment to \nthe people that our economic policies affect. In Montana, Demetrios \nmade a point to know the ranchers in Molt, the seed potato farmers in \nManhattan, and the wheat farmers in Three Forks. Demetrios's \nintelligence and experience helped guide me and the Senate through the \nletter of our trade laws. But his good character and heart reminded us \nwhat those trade laws are really about America's workers, farmers, \nranchers, and families.\n  I congratulate Demetrios on his nomination, thank him for his good \nwork, and wish him the best of luck as Deputy U.S. Trade \nRepresentative.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I wish to speak a few words about \nDemetrios Marantis, who was confirmed last night by the Senate to be a \nDeputy U.S. Trade Representative.\n  Demetrios is well known to all of us on the Finance Committee. For 4 \nyears, he has very ably served Chairman Baucus--most recently as the \nDemocratic chief international trade counsel. So he has played a \ncentral role in all of the committee's efforts on trade policy during \nthis time.\n  Not only is Demetrios a very sharp trade lawyer and policy adviser, \nhe is also a skilled negotiator. That will serve him well in his new \nposition. I am grateful for the genuine spirit of bipartisanship that \nDemetrios brought to the Finance Committee, and I am sorry to see him \ndepart. His energy and good nature will certainly be missed.\n  At the same time, I am comforted by the fact that our Nation will \ncontinue to benefit from Demetrios' commitment to public service. He \nassumes a very important portfolio at the Office of the United States \nTrade Representative, as a trade Ambassador to Asia and Africa, and \nalso with responsibility for the trade and development portfolio, as \nwell as for labor and the environment.\n  I therefore look forward to engaging Demetrios in efforts to open up \nnew market opportunities for U.S. exporters in the Asian region. I also \nlook forward to working with him on a reform of our unilateral trade \npreference programs. We must address these key trade priorities in the \n111th Congress, so I expect that we'll continue to see Demetrios on a \nregular basis for some time to come.\n  In closing, I commend Demetrios for his outstanding service to the \nFinance Committee, and I wish Ambassador Marantis every success in his \nnew position.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/07/senate-section/article/S5276-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5276-S5278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share \nwith me how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they \nresponded by the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I am sending you this email in regards to our gas prices. I \n     feel that the taxes that Idaho has on the gas should be \n     dropped in our state.\n       So many people are already unemployed. People are suffering \n     enough trying to keep the jobs that they have. Many people \n     travel from Caldwell and Nampa to jobs in Boise. They are \n     only making $9, maybe $10, an hour. That is just two gallons \n     of gas. Because of this, we will only be adding to our \n     unemployment line. This only takes away the money coming into \n     our state from the taxes from their paychecks.\n       My daughter is trying to find work herself. Do you have any \n     idea the hardship of this? She cannot find a job because she \n     cannot put the $8 for two gallons of gas into her car to find \n     a job. If you removed the gas tax, she would have at least a \n     fighting chance!\n       My son lives in Boise and works in Nampa. He had to leave \n     his car on the freeway because he ran out of gas and had just \n     put in the last of his money he had in his pocket.\n       What about our elderly and all the others on fixed income? \n     We have to get a hold of this situation now. Thank you for \n     your time and consideration in this important matter.\n     Gerald and Tonie, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you, Senator, for asking for input. Yes, we need to \n     protect our planet from excess wrongful pollution; yes we \n     need to have alternatives to the current fossil fuel dilemma. \n     Yes, drilling here and drilling now needs to happen, although \n     it will not give relief for many years to come and at what \n     loss to business and individual Americans, prior to our \n     becoming more energy independent?\n       It is time to steal a page from the Democrats play book of \n     2000 and dump oil from our strategic reserves, referenced \n     http://schumer.senate.gov/SchumerWebsite/pressroom/\npress_releases/2004/PR02640.Gas051904.html, in the market \n     place to lower prices at the pump.\n       This will have many-fold positive effect. It can boost the \n     economy by helping business to maintain pricing at lower \n     levels. It will cause a price lowering on the world market \n     needed by many other nations, i.e., French truckers causing \n     gridlock by blocking roadways. We replenish our reserves at a \n     lower cost oil than today, and it ought have an adverse \n     effect on those speculators that are driving the price of oil \n     through the ceiling. How many of the speculators buying \n     futures contracts for oil are foreign investors wanting to \n     drive up the price of their oil? These positive reactions can \n     only have positive impact.\n       For the future, alternative fuel sources other than our \n     food, wheat, rice, corn ought\n\n[[Page S5277]]\n\n     to be developed, i.e., hydrogen which is in use presently in \n     the East under controlled situations, work towards federal \n     funding for a research facility to developed an economical \n     solution/use for the shale that surrounds Idaho in Wyoming, \n     Utah and Colorado.

Why would you want to give sob stories to \n     Congress?] The problem is the way you are approaching the \n     matter. [The current] approach is to focus on an issue that \n     has been allowed to spiral out of control, so it is now \n     labeled as a significant emotional event that affects a large \n     contingency of or state. You want input from constituents on \n     a possible solution to this crisis.\n       You are way too late, Mr. Crapo. You should have approached \n     this problem at the root cause, when it first started years \n     ago. Nothing was ever done to formulate a plan.\n       Just what are your thoughts? Is this a lame issue \n     strategically planned based on the emotions of the people, \n     centered on a principal of difusionary tactics to point the \n     crisis issue from your office to the bleeding heart \n     consumers? Just what are we going to do?\n       In order to solve a problem, you need to lose the ``ostrich \n     mentality''; that is, bury your head in the sand until the \n     danger passes by. As long as you do not see anything going on \n     around you, then you assume all will be well once it passes; \n     however, while your head is in the sand, your [backend] is \n     hanging out in the air [in danger.]\n       This problem should have been breached months ago when \n     gasoline prices were at $2.50 a gallon, and needed to focus \n     on how to hold them at this price.\n       What you have condoned is the allowance of gasoline to \n     skyrocket out of control, and somehow scheme a plan that \n     involves Idahoans to offer a solution.\n       React when the crisis surfaces because that it the way \n     everyone does it. Any official, manager, analyst, physics \n     engineer knows that you start by dissecting and analyzing the \n     root problem that drove the event. Two great books to read on \n     this management technique are Crucial Conversations and \n     Crucial Conversation. Try them; they are great.\n       As for the bleeding heart letters, I do not buy them one \n     bit. After all, what do we have at our disposal to influence \n     members of Congress?\n       Much could have been done by the American people if we, the \n     consumers, could be in on the ground floor of these fire-side \n     chats and actively work on the problem.\n       We need to be a preventative society, not a panic-reactive, \n     flavor of the month club.\n     George, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I saw in the news this morning that you are asking for \n     comments about the current gas prices. I believe, like many \n     others, that we need to end our dependency on foreign oil. If \n     the government would end the moratoriums against off shore \n     drilling, allow the states who are begging to drill to do so. \n     Allow new refineries be built, I know the prices would begin \n     to go down, just from the threat of competition alone. If our \n     government would get out of the way, let the good old \n     American ingenuity and capitalism take control, things would \n     turn around in no time at all.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to voice my opinion.\n     Kim, Moose.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am very concern that my country's Congress has paralyzed \n     our ability to become energy-independent. To get to the \n     point, I want to be free of terrorist oil. I want our own \n     country to provide for our energy needs. Open up the \n     coastlines to drilling; allow drilling in Alaska, Montana and \n     other states. Allow the mining and processing of oil shale. \n     Develop a national energy strategy with all parties involved. \n     This does not take ten years. Remember World War II; the \n     homefront converted to the war effort--one example, victory \n     ships, I want that attitude in my Congress, my nation. Please \n     express my concerns.

Forty years ago, my wife and I bought a small \n     cabin near a lake in the mountains just south of Salmon. My \n     family and I have enjoyed many pleasant hours every summer up \n     there. At the time we bought it, our big concern was how much \n     time will it take to travel up there from Malad. Now the time \n     element is the least of our concerns. Now the question is how \n     much is it going to cost us to make the trip. So far, this \n     year, the answer has been: Too much! We have not been able to \n     work out a way to get there to even open it up for the \n     season. We are seriously considering the possibility of \n     selling it because transportation costs make it prohibitive \n     to make the trip often enough to make it worthwhile keeping \n     it! Having to sell it would be a blow to our entire family--\n     as well as what would be an economic loss!\n       I really do not think Americans should be treated this way \n     just because some political activists want to punish this \n     country for being too successful. Please do not let them do \n     it. The remedy is so obvious and attainable! Truly this is an \n     economic crisis, not only for this nation, but for the world!\n     Wesley, Malad City.\n                                  ____\n\n       Being a resident of Idaho, I feel compelled to write to you \n     regarding my perspective on energy cost and its effect on the \n     economy. It may be felt, being single and a nurse in the \n     State of Idaho, by many that my situation is secure and \n     comfortable. I must stress, it is not. Gas/fuel prices \n     (including electricity) is a huge concern to me and affects \n     me in ways most may not recognize. I find, as others, filling \n     at the tank is overwhelming at times, but what I find \n     interesting is how it has affected so much more than just \n     getting gas for a vehicle. It does make it more difficult to \n     obtain the fuel for the vehicle that brings one to work, but \n     the effect goes so much beyond that.\n       I find my grocery bill has increased from 10-30% on items I \n     used to feel comfortable in purchasing previously. I find I \n     am no longer looking at brands like I have before, and I find \n     I am going without some items I would have thought to be \n     necessary before.\n       We are a spoiled nation, there is no doubt; however, \n     whenever I stop buying things and chipping away from those \n     items I have enjoyed I think of those individuals who work \n     for those companies that my meager dollar use to support no \n     longer can, and in turn, causes an effect on their ability to \n     continue their lifestyle endeavors.\n       I find an unusual event here in Idaho with regard to my \n     career. I am an RN. I am told there is a huge shortage of \n     nurses, but I am forced off from being able to work because, \n     ``census is down'' at the major hospital I work at in Boise. \n     My thinking on this, though there is no study I am aware of \n     to support it, is that people have become very afraid of the \n     economic situation. ``Elective surgery'' (even though \n     necessary) is being held off, even declined. Why? People have \n     a hard time with insurance coverage now even as before the \n     crunch. I believe they would rather chance their well being \n     over an additional concern of a medical bill, because they \n     cannot afford to go to work that may possibly have coverage \n     for them, or more than likely, probably do not. So, health \n     becomes a secondary choice to them. This, in turn, affects \n     me. I get laid off and I cannot pay the bills . . .\n       I am more fortunate, in that I do have options. Not \n     necessarily pleasant ones, i.e., leave Idaho, but options all \n     the same. Right now I am looking at supplemental work.\n       Basically what I am saying, the ``gas issue'' is obviously \n     more than just filling the tank. It is food, it is housing, \n     it is employment availability, it is health, and it is \n     choices or lack of. Please, I plead that you approach those \n     who can make a difference. Recognize, America should always \n     be first, in their decision, not outside interests.\n       I am born and bred American. I am proud of what we are and \n     what we can be, but I can see greed has taken over common \n     sense. Please do what you can do to stop the undermining of \n     our strength. Let us be self-sufficient first and with good \n     conscience let us use our ability to drill, invent, and \n     create a new direction that will allow new jobs and strength.\n       Advice I give patients: You cannot help those you care for \n     unless you have taken care of yourself and maintain your own \n     strength. Be conscious to care for yourself so you can help \n     those you love. I say the same to my country: Care for \n     yourself.\n     BonnieDee, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Living in a rural area of southeastern Idaho we have been \n     hit particularly hard. Gas in our community is always higher \n     than surrounding areas. I drive 120 miles roundtrip to work \n     and 30 miles roundtrip to the grocery store. Many of my \n     neighbors are trying to farm but the cost of putting fuel in \n     the tractor is so high that to plow and plant a field it \n     almost is not worth the effort anymore. We realize that, as a \n     nation, we need to be prudent in oil drilling practices but \n     to ignore the Alaskan oil fields and the offshore potential \n     of our coastal regions is sheer folly. If we fail to claim \n     and drill what is rightfully ours, the Chinese and the Cubans \n     will find a way to do it right under our very noses. I ask \n     you, what other country in the world is crazy enough to sit \n     on such a resource and just let it go to waste? Regardless of \n     whom drills for the oil we will still have the same potential \n     environmental issues but we could easily not be the ones in \n     control. I would like to see what would happen to the price \n     of gas if congress woke up to the situation and opened our \n     significant undeveloped oil fields to responsible drilling. \n     Congress cannot continue to make the oil companies the \n     ``scapegoat'' in this situation. Congress and the President, \n     past and current, need to accept responsibility for their \n     major part in the entire mess.\n     Clare, Preston.\n                                  ____\n\n       A couple of week ago you were a guest speaker on our local \n     radio program and asked us voters to write you about what \n     trouble and hard times have fallen upon us regular working \n     stiffs.

Well, you asked, so here is \n     my story.\n       I am a certificated flight instructor and had a very \n     promising flight school in the Magic Valley (the only flight \n     school in the valley) at the Jerome County Airport. Then 9/\n     11. I learned two very good lessons after that: [there is \n     little understanding of the real world among the bureaucrats \n     who operate many agencies, and that too often the price for \n     problems is paid by those who had nothing to do with the \n     problem.]\n       While billions [were dumped] into the airline industry, [my \n     business] went under. Just because I was grounded and held \n     accountable for the actions of 9/11, my bills were not \n     ``grounded'' and I ended up losing my airplanes, my business \n     and every cent I had! Oh, well, no complaints, I was not in a \n     rubble pile in D.C., or New York, New York, or dead at a \n     crash site in Pennsylvania. My heart still hurts for those \n     who lost their lives that day. Like I said, no complaints. I \n     am a proud American that is used to pulling me up by the boot \n     straps and, by the way, I was offered a low interest $5,000 \n     loan by the government; that would not have even covered my \n     fuel bill! It has taken me years to pay off the losses, but I \n     have. And I have been teaching flying lessons in student-\n     owned planes. If they come to me without an airplane I have \n     to turn them away. That means out of the Magic Valley because \n     there had been no other flight schools open. Flying is not a \n     privilege like driving, it is a right put down on paper by \n     the Congress and the Senate!\n       Now to end this story--you ask for $5.50 a gallon aviation \n     fuel! It has put me completely out of the teaching game! \n     Thanks a lot! (Not you.) I have been doing this teaching \n     thing for the last 18 years. I do not know anything else! I \n     am 52 years old, too old to start over and become an expert \n     at anything else, I will not be on this planet long enough! \n     Sure, I could go to Dubai, India, China or some other enemy \n     country and teach their students how to fly and probably make \n     a a lot of money, but that is not what it is about. It is \n     about molding good, safe and better American pilots! Not \n     going to the Middle East and teaching the bucks. No, I will \n     never do that! Never! I live in Idaho and that is where I \n     will be put into the good potato-growing earth of Idaho!\n       I feel [let down by my elected officials.] Please keep up \n     your effort to help us no-counts here in Idaho!

The \n     high gas prices make it impossible for us to leave our area, \n     and it is more expensive for me to drive to work. We just try \n     to buy less groceries; no extras. I am really worried about \n     purchasing propane next winter. The minimum you can now have \n     delivered is $300, and that does not even last a month. I \n     hate to see what it will cost next winter.

It is so \n     refreshing to have an honest, wise thinking, conservative \n     congressman. We have lived in liberal states in the past and \n     it can be very discouraging.\n       About the fuel prices, I just want to share that I am a \n     hospice nurse which requires that I drive all over Canyon and \n     some of Ada counties. We do get paid mileage for our trips to \n     and from our patients, but the $.43 a mile is quickly being \n     eaten up by the rising fuel prices. Also my husband and I are \n     private pilots and love to fly over our beautiful state, but \n     again the cost of fuel is making it necessary to but back on \n     those trips. What is so frustrating to us is knowing that we \n     have plenty of oil in our own country, if our government \n     would just allow production to increase. I also favor \n     developing alternate energy. I especially think that nuclear \n     energy can be developed safely and should be looked at very \n     seriously.\n     Linda and Alan, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       It is very obvious that Russia is on an aggressive quest to \n     control the global oil. The U.S. should have already been on \n     top of this, but where are the leaders of the two Houses? \n     They're on vacation (except for a few fighters) instead of \n     attending to very important and critical issues. It is \n     extremely important to deal with the energy issues as soon as \n     possible. We have oil available in the Bakken Formation, \n     Alaska and other areas, which contain the following \n     estimates: 8 times as much oil as Saudi Arabia, 18 times as \n     much oil as Iraq, 21 times as much oil as Kuwait, 22 times as \n     much oil as Iran, 500 times as much oil as Yemen--all right \n     here in the U.S.\n       The issues at hand are affecting the rapidly increasing \n     day-to-day costs. Inflation is rising, not at .05%, rather \n     more like 30%. For example, groceries are costing almost 50% \n     more than in January. That is if one can afford the gasoline.\n       The COLA increase in the next budget for Social Security \n     and the Military should be a minimum of 15%--just to stay \n     even with rising costs.\n       This is not a time for partisan bickering. This is time for \n     a conscience effort toward the business of American citizens.\n     George.

Madam President, I am pleased to pay tribute to \nSan Francisco Police Chief Heather Fong as she retires from the city \nand county of San Francisco's Police Department after 32 years of \ndedicated service.\n  A lifelong Californian, Chief Fong was born and raised in the city of \nSan Francisco. She grew up in a small flat on Bannam Place, a tiny \nalley in North Beach just outside Chinatown, and attended St. Rose \nAcademy in the western addition. It was there that Fong was first \nexposed to the idea that she could pursue a career in law enforcement, \nwhen a visiting officer was brought into the academy to speak with the \nstudents. Fong quickly joined the San Francisco Police Athletic \nLeague's cadet academy, where she served for 2 years, and attended \nclasses one night a week at the Hall of Justice. Following her \ngraduation from St. Rose Academy, Fong pursued her undergraduate \neducation at the University of San Francisco, and later received a \nmaster's degree in social work from San Francisco State University.\n  Chief Fong formally entered the police service when she was sworn in \nas a San Francisco police officer in 1977. Just one month into the job, \nshe played a crucial role in the investigation of the massacre in \nChinatown's Golden Dragon restaurant; her work resulted in four \nconvictions. Because of her dedication and strong work ethic, Fong was \ngiven a beat along Clement Street with a veteran police officer, where \nshe quickly learned the ropes. Two years later, in 1979, Fong \ntransferred to the Police Academy, where she became the first female \ninstructor, an honor not usually given to young officers.\n  Fong has served the San Francisco Police Department in various \ncapacities over her 32 years of service, working her way through the \nranks of inspector, sergeant, lieutenant, captain, commander, deputy \nchief, assistant chief, acting chief, and finally, chief.\n  San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom appointed Fong acting chief of \nPolice on January 22, 2004 and chief of police on April 14, 2004. Fong \nwas the first woman to become chief of police for San Francisco and the \nNation's first Asian American woman to lead a major city's police \ndepartment. Chief Fong is deserving of a very relaxing retirement--in \nher 5 years as police chief, she never took one vacation.\n  I admire Chief Fong's 32 years of dedicated service to the people of \nSan Francisco. Along with her friends and admirers throughout the San \nFrancisco Bay area, I thank her for her tireless efforts and wish her \nthe best as she embarks on the next phase of her life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/07/senate-section/article/S5278-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5278-S5279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR.

Madam President, today I recognize Dr. Andrew \nMoore of Lexington, KY, for being the recipient of the Fayette County \nHero of the Year presented by the Bluegrass Area Chapter of the \nAmerican Red Cross.\n  The Hero of the Year award was presented to Dr. Moore on April 23, \n2009. The Heroes campaign fosters community awareness and generates \nfunds to support the mission and services of the American Red Cross.\n  Dr. Moore is the founder and president of the nonprofit organization \nSurgery on Sunday, which provides outpatient surgical services to \nincome-eligible individuals and families who are without health \ninsurance and are not eligible for Federal or State assistance. \nPatients are referred to the program by community organizations and \nreceive medical procedures that range from general operations to dental \nwork and reconstructive surgeries.\n  In its first year of operation, Surgery on Sunday provided services \nto more than 150 individuals without health insurance or the means to \npay. By the end of its second year, the organization had performed more \nthan 2,000 procedures. It is estimated that $1.5 million worth of \nmedical services has been donated by more than 600 volunteer surgeons, \nphysicians, nurses, and other health professionals.\n  I would like to thank Dr. Moore and all of the volunteers for Surgery \non Sunday for their contributions to the Commonwealth of Kentucky.

Madam President, I wish to honor the men and women \nwho have dedicated their lives to caring for others through the nursing \nprofession. As you may know, National Nurses' Week is celebrated from \nMay 6 through 12. Nurses play a crucial role in our health care system. \nThe need for attention to detail, medical expertise, time management, \ncritical thinking, and compassion shape a vocation that is more than a \ncareer. Professional nurses make enduring investments in their \npatients' lives.\n  Nursing is the largest health care occupation, with over 2.5 million \nnurses nationwide. In my State of Oklahoma, there are over 25,000 \nregistered nurses alone. Nurses are found in a wide variety of \nsettings, including hospitals, doctors' offices, schools, nursing \nhomes, community clinics, and even the battlefield. Nurses do more than \ntreat wounds and assist doctors. They help us all, regardless of age or \nstanding, from the tiniest premature baby to the senior who has a life \nfull of memories. They comfort those in pain, ease children's fears, \neducate students, attend deliveries, and offer assurance to worried \nparents. Nurses are trained to take care of the whole patient, sick or \nhealthy.\n  It is no coincidence that the last day of National Nurses' Week, May \n12, is also the birthday of Florence Nightingale, the founder of the \nmodern nursing profession. Her work set an example of commitment to \npatients that can be seen and felt even today. The skill, dedication, \nand strength of our nurses are too often overlooked. Quality of life \nhas increased for many Oklahomans, myself included, as a result of a \nnurse's actions and care. Nursing is among the noblest professions.\n  Madam President, I ask that you join me today in honoring nurses both \nin Oklahoma and all across the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/07/senate-section/article/S5279-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NEBRASKA ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS\n\n Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, today I wish to commemorate the \n75th anniversary of the founding of the Omaha District of the Army \nCorps of Engineers in Omaha, NE.\n  From its original mission in the 1930s working on flood control \nprojects on the Missouri River, including the building of the Fort Peck \nDam, to its contemporary work in support of our Nation's military \nmission in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Omaha District has served the \ncitizens of the State of Nebraska and the United States of America with \npride and distinction.\n  I especially note the contribution that the Corps has made every day \nsince its inception managing and protecting Nebraska's precious water \nresources. Without the dedicated efforts of all of the men and women of \nthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Omaha District, citizens in the State \nof Nebraska would: (1) be vulnerable to extensive flooding, (2) lack \nabundant recreational opportunities and preservation of critical \nwildlife habitat, and (3) face much higher electric energy bills. It is \nestimated that as a result of the work of the Omaha District of the \nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers, more than $25 billion of property damage \ndue to flooding has been averted during its distinguished history.\n  I also note with extreme pride the important contribution that the \nOmaha District has made over the years to the success of our Armed \nForces. The Omaha District was responsible for the construction of what \nlater became known as Offutt Air Force Base. Offutt Air Force Base was \nthe home of the Glenn L. Martin Co. Bomber Plant, which manufactured \nthe B-29 ``Superfortress'' and the B-26 ``Marauder'' airplanes. Other \nmore recent noteworthy projects have included work on the North \nAmerican Air Defense Command headquarters at Cheyenne Mountain, \nconstruction of various missile controls and launch facilities \nthroughout the Midwest, building of hangar facilities for B-2 \n``Stealth'' bombers, and other important projects for military purposes \nin Nebraska and for foreign deployments.\n  Again, I thank the thousands of Omaha District employees who have \ndedicated their careers to serving the military and civilian needs of \nthe State of Nebraska and the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/07/senate-section/article/S5279-3", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MILITARY FAMILIES APPRECIATION DAY\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, tomorrow, Oregon will be \ncelebrating its first Military Families Appreciation Day.\n  All over my State, people will gather to recognize the sacrifice and \nservice of military families and veterans throughout history.\n  It is a day set aside to bring people together, to learn from and \nsupport each other and to celebrate the families who serve on the home \nfront while their wives, husbands, sons, daughters, and parents serve \non the front lines.\n  America's military is the strongest in the world, and they draw their \nstrength from families back home. Yet far too frequently, the \nsacrifices and dedication of military families have gone unacknowledged \nand unappreciated.\n  That is why Oregon will be proudly recognizing military families on \nthis inaugural Military Families Appreciation Day.\n  In our Nation's recent history, millions of servicemembers have been \nplaced in harm's way for our country, standing watch as freedom's \nguardian. But families, too, have stood watch at home, facing their own \nchallenges, all too often alone.\n  Military families sacrifice so much--they are patriots cloaked in a \nquiet strength and they make all the difference to the success of each \nmission. They have faced the special challenges of long and repeated \ndeployments, separations from loved ones, and frequent relocations with \ngreat courage and resolve. In doing so, their selfless dedication has \ndirectly contributed to the mission readiness of our soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, marines, Coast Guardsmen, and Merchant Marines.\n  So to every military family, I want to offer a nation's thanks.\n  For the times you have stood and watched a ship sail from the harbor, \nan aircraft disappear into the clouds, or a bus convoy pull out of \nsight, not sure when your loved one would return, we thank you.\n  For the anniversaries, birthdays, and holidays you have celebrated \nalone, we thank you.\n  For the helping hand you have extended to other military families \nwhen there was need--truly creating a military family--we thank you.\n  A country is not strong because of its armed services alone, rather \nthe armed services draw strength from the civilians who support them. \nWith military families setting a superior example of devotion, courage, \nand commitment, America will always be a nation of strength.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/07/senate-section/article/S5279-4", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5279-S5280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   BUDGET OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2010--PM 16\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred jointly, pursuant to the order of January \n30, 1975 as modified by the order of April 11, 1986; to the Committees \non Appropriations; and the Budget:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I have the honor to transmit to you the Budget of the United States \nGovernment for Fiscal Year 2010\n  In my February 26th budget overview, A New Era of Responsibility: \nRenewing America's Promise, I provided a broad outline of how our \nNation came to this moment of economic, financial, and fiscal crisis; \nand how my Administration plans to move this economy from recession to \nrecovery and lay a new foundation for long-term economic growth and \nprosperity. This Budget fills out this picture by providing full \nprogrammatic details and proposing appropriations language and other \nrequired information for the Congress to put these plans fully into \neffect.\n  Specifically, this Budget details the pillars of the stable and broad \neconomic growth we seek: making long overdue investments and reforms in \neducation so that every child can compete in the global economy, \nundertaking health care reform so that we can control costs while \nboosting coverage and quality, and investing in renewable sources of \nenergy so that we can reduce our dependence on foreign\n\n[[Page S5280]]\n\noil and become the world leader in the new clean energy economy.\n  Fiscal discipline is another critical pillar in this economic \nfoundation. My Administration came into office facing a budget deficit \nof $1.3 trillion for this year alone, and the cost of confronting the \nrecession and financial crisis has been high. While these are \nextraordinary times that have demanded extraordinary responses, it is \nimpossible to put our Nation on a course for long-term growth without \nbeginning to rein in unsustainable deficits and debt. We no longer can \nafford to tolerate investments in programs that are outdated, \nduplicative, ineffective, or wasteful.\n  That is why the Budget I am sending to you includes a separate volume \nof terminations, reductions, and savings that my Administration has \nidentified since we sent the budget overview to you 10 weeks ago. In \nit, we identify programs that do not accomplish the goals set for them, \ndo not do so efficiently, or do a job already done by another \ninitiative. Overall, we have targeted more than 100 programs that \nshould be ended or substantially changed, moves that will save nearly \n$17 billion next year alone.\n  These efforts are just the next phase of a larger and longer effort \nneeded to change how Washington does business and put our fiscal house \nin order. To that end, the Budget includes billions of dollars in \nsavings from steps ranging from ending subsidies for big oil and gas \ncompanies, to eliminating entitlements to banks and lenders making \nstudent loans. It provides an historic down payment on health care \nreform, the key to our long-term fiscal future, and was constructed \nwithout commonly used budget gimmicks that, for instance, hide the true \ncosts of war and natural disasters. Even with these costs on the books, \nthe Budget will cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term, \nand we will bring non-defense discretionary spending to its lowest \nlevel as a share of GDP since 1962.\n  Finally, in order to keep America strong and secure, the Budget \nincludes critical investments in rebuilding our military, securing our \nhomeland, and expanding our diplomatic efforts because we need to use \nall elements of our power to provide for our national security. We are \nnot only proposing significant funding for our national security, but \nalso being careful with those investments by, for instance, reforming \ndefense contracting so that we are using our defense dollars to their \nmaximum effect.\n  I have little doubt that there will be various interests--vocal and \npowerful--who will oppose different aspects of this Budget. Change is \nnever easy. However, I believe that after an era of profound \nirresponsibility, Americans are ready to embrace the shared \nresponsibilities we have to each other and to generations to come.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nincome tax relief for families, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise to highlight the greatest \nresource of Arkansas. It is our people. It is the working families and \nthe small businesses in their valiant fight against the current \neconomic crisis.\n  It is more important than ever before to give working families and \nbusinesses the tools they need to succeed in this world, to be \ncompetitive in the global marketplace and, more importantly, to be able \nto be successful on their own land. Hard work and entrepreneurship have \nfueled the Arkansas small business economy for decades, and we must \nensure it remains that way in the future.\n  That is why I have designed a package of tax cuts and Tax Code \nsimplification measures that I call the Arkansas Plan, to help move our \nState and hard-working families forward. Together, these tax measures \nwill allow working families and small businesses to get ahead and \nemerge from this economic crisis stronger and more competitive than \never before. These measures will encourage innovation and \nentrepreneurship, create new jobs, and lessen our dependence on foreign \noil; as well as reduce the burden on working families and small \nbusinesses by simplifying our ever-complicated Tax Code.\n  This week, I am focused on measures that will allow working families \nand small businesses to emerge from the economic crisis stronger and \nmore competitive. I have reintroduced the Small Business Health Options \nProgram, which would make health insurance more affordable, \npredictable, and accessible for small businesses and self-employed \nindividuals. Our SHOP bill offers tax incentives to encourage States to \nreform the poorly functioning small group insurance market and \nencourages the development of State purchasing pools backstopped by a \nvoluntary nationwide pool.\n  The majority of uninsured Americans are self-employed individuals and \nemployees of small businesses. Small businesses are the No. 1 source \nfor jobs in our great State of Arkansas. Yet only 29 percent of \nbusinesses with fewer than 50 employees offer health insurance coverage \nbecause it is simply too expensive. Of the total uninsured population \nof Arkansas--more than 56 percent--approximately 295,000 Arkansans are \nemployed by a firm with 100 or fewer employees.\n  Our SHOP bill is a pragmatic model for larger health reform \nlegislation that allows us to begin to address the needs of the \nmillions of working uninsured Americans whose top priority is access to \nquality and affordable health care for their families. What we are \nlooking for is to be able to give small businesses, their employees, \nand self-employed individuals the access to the same kind of quality \nand affordable health insurance we enjoy as Members of Congress.\n  I think it is very doable. I am looking forward to continuing my work \nwith Senator Snowe and others on a plan we have worked on for years \nnow. Whether it is done independently or in the context of a larger \nhealth care reform package, it is time to do something for small \nbusinesses, their employees, and the self employed because they are the \nlargest component of the uninsured that we could really do something \nsubstantively for.\n  Another piece of my Arkansas plan is legislation to help Arkansas \ntaxpayers who have seen their investments disappear as a result of the \ndeteriorating economic conditions. My proposal would allow taxpayers to \ndeduct up to $10,000--up from the $3,000 cap they have now--as the \namount an individual can deduct annually for capital losses suffered.\n  More than 100,000 Arkansans count on such investments. Arkansas \nfamilies have seen the value of investments plummet during the current \neconomic crisis. The resulting losses from the dramatic downturn in the \nmarket have been felt by all investors, but probably the hardest hit \nare those taxpayers who are at or near retirement age, who are counting \non such funds for their retirement security. This gives them a little \nbit of ease.\n  I have also introduced the Savings for Working Families Act, which \nwould encourage low- and middle-income families to establish savings \naccounts for the purchase of a first home, a college education, or to \nstart a business. These individual development accounts have a proven \ntrack record of success in Arkansas.\n  In addition, today I introduce the Family Tax Relief Act to help the \nfamilies of more than 140,000 Arkansas children afford the cost of \nchildcare. If you look around this Nation at the hard-working \nAmericans--particularly in Arkansas--who are in need of childcare, \ngood-quality childcare, to be able to pay for it, this is a substantial \ndifference in these economic times that helps them achieve that goal.\n  Also, today I introduce a bill to update rules for S corporations so \nthat businesses can access capital and have the opportunity to expand \nand create the much needed jobs Arkansans need.\n  Together, I believe these bills will equip the working families and \nsmall businesses in our great State of Arkansas with the resources \nneeded to navigate the current crisis.\n  Next week, my Arkansas Plan will focus on encouraging American \ninnovation and entrepreneurship to create new jobs here at home and \nlessen our dependence on foreign oil. I will introduce a series of \nenergy, research and development, and workforce training\n\n[[Page S5284]]\n\ntax initiatives to accomplish this objective.\n  The following week, I will look forward to introducing reform \nmeasures to simplify the Tax Code and reduce the burden of Arkansas' \nworking families and businesses by working to build a tax structure \nthat is fair and equitable for all Americans.\n  I encourage my colleagues to look at these commonsense measures to \nsee how they will benefit their own constituents in States across this \ngreat land.\n  Throughout my career in the Senate, I have made Arkansas' working \nfamilies and small businesses my top priorities. From my seat on the \nSenate Finance Committee, I will continue to work to bring our families \nthe relief they need and business owners the tools they require to \ninvest and grow and become successful and continue to be competitive.\n  We have a great country, and each of us feels very particular about \nour State. I come from a seventh-generation Arkansas farm family. My \nhome is precious to me. I reiterate what I started with, and that is \nthat our greatest assets and resources in Arkansas are our people. They \nare hard working, innovative, and stalwart in coming together to help \none another and help this country. Whether they are small business \nindividuals or whether they serve in the armed services or whether they \nare teachers or whether they care for parents and the elderly, they are \nwonderful people, and they deserve our utmost attention, as do those in \nother States.\n  I am willing to bet my colleagues that the Arkansas Plan, which I put \ntogether to benefit Arkansas small businesses and working families, \nwill also benefit the working families in each of their States. I \nchallenge you all to take a look at this and help me to move these \ninitiatives forward on behalf of our working families and small \nbusinesses across this country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Ms. Collins, and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 999. A bill to increase the number of well-trained mental health \nservice professionals (including those based in schools) providing \nclinical mental health care to children and adolescents, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today with \nMs. Collins and Ms. Stabenow entitled Child Health Care Crisis Relief \nAct of 2009.\n  This important legislation will address the national shortage of \nchildren's mental health professionals, including school-based \nprofessionals, by encouraging more individuals to enter these critical \nfields. The landmark 1999 Surgeon General's report on mental health \nbrought a hidden mental health crisis to the attention of the U.S. \npublic. According to that report, 13.7 million children in our \ncountry--about one in five--suffer from a diagnosable emotional or \nbehavioral disorder. Such disorders as Anxiety Disorders, Attention-\nDeficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, and Depression are among the most \ncommon in this age group. Yet more than \\2/3\\ of these children do not \nreceive any treatment. Long waiting lists for children seeking \nservices, including those in crisis, are not uncommon. The primary \nreason is that severe shortages exist in qualified mental health \nprofessionals, including child and adolescent psychiatrists, \npsychologists, social workers, and counselors. The President's New \nFreedom Commission on Mental Health also found that ``the supply of \nwell-trained mental health professionals is inadequate in most areas of \nthe country . . . particular shortages exist for mental health \nproviders who serve children, adolescents, and older Americans.'' The \nsituation is no better in our public schools, where children's mental \nhealth needs are often first identified. According to the National \nCenter for Education Statistics within the Department of Education, \nthere are approximately 479 students for each school counselor in U.S. \nschools, nearly twice the recommended ratio of 250 students for each \ncounselor.\n  The situation in my home State of New Mexico is a case in point. \nEstimates suggest that 56,000 children and adolescents in New Mexico \nhave an emotional or behavioral disorder. Of these, roughly 20,000 have \nserious disturbances that impair their ability to fulfill the demands \nof everyday life. In 2009, there were a total of 55 child and \nadolescent psychiatrists in the entire State of New Mexico. The impact \nof this shortage on the affected children and their communities is \ndisconcerting. Research shows that children with untreated emotional \nand behavioral disorders are at higher risk for school failure and \ndropping out of school, violence, drug abuse, suicide, and criminal \nactivity. For New Mexico youth, the suicide rate is twice the national \naverage, the fourth highest in the nation, and the third leading cause \nof death. By one estimate, roughly 1 in 7 youth in New Mexico detention \ncenters are in need of mental health treatment that is just not \navailable.\n  New Mexico is not alone in its struggle to address the needs of these \nchildren. Nationwide, over 1,600 urban, suburban, and rural communities \nhave been designated Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas by the \nFederal Government due to their severe lack of psychiatrists, \npsychologists, social workers, and other professionals to serve \nchildren and adults. Rural areas are especially hard hit. For example, \nin New Mexico there is one psychiatrist per 20,000 residents in rural \nareas, whereas in urban areas there is one per 3,000 residents. In \nrural and frontier counties, it is not unusual for the parents of a \nchild in need of services to travel 60 to 90 miles to reach the nearest \npsychiatrist, psychologist, or other mental health provider.\n  Finally, graduate programs providing the vital pipeline for the child \nmental health workforce have not sufficiently increased their funding, \nclass sizes, and training programs to meet the ever growing need for \nthese specialists. In the U.S., only 300 new child and adolescent \npsychiatrists are trained each year, despite projections by the Bureau \nof Health Professions that the shortage of child and adolescent \npsychiatrist will grow to 4,000 by the year 2020. Federal grant funding \nfor graduate psychology education has also been significantly reduced \nin the past 2 years, which could reduce the numbers of child and \nadolescent psychologists entering the profession.\n  Clearly something needs to be done to address this serious shortage \nin mental health professionals to meet the growing needs of our \nNation's youth. It is for this reason that I rise today to offer the \nChild Health Care Crisis Relief Act of 2009. This bill creates \nincentives to help recruit and retain mental health professionals \nproviding direct clinical care, and to help create, expand, and improve \nprograms to train child mental health professionals. It provides loan \nrepayments and scholarships for child mental health and school-based \nservice professionals as well as internships and field placements in \nchild mental health services and training for paraprofessionals who \nwork in children's mental health clinical settings. The bill also \nprovides grants to graduate schools to help develop and expand child \nand adolescent mental health programs. It restores the Medicare \nGraduate Medical Education Program funding for child and adolescent \npsychiatrists and extends the board eligibility period for residents \nand fellows from 4 years to 6 years. Across all mental health \nprofessions, priority for loan repayments, scholarships, and grants is \ngiven to individuals and programs serving children and adolescents in \nhigh-need areas.\n  Finally, the Child Health Care Crisis Relief Act of 2009 requires the \nSecretary to prepare a report on the distribution and need for child \nmental health and school-based professionals, including disparities in \nthe availability of services, on a State-by-State basis. This report \nwill help Congress more clearly ascertain the mental health workforce \nneeds that are facing our Nation.\n  This important legislation has been endorsed by the following \norganizations: Alliance for Children and Families, American Academy of \nChild and Adolescent Psychiatry, American Academy of Pediatrics, \nAmerican Association for Geriatric Psychiatry, American Association for \nMarriage and Family Therapy, American Counseling Association, American \nGroup Psychotherapy Association, American Mental Health Counselors \nAssociation, American Orthopsychiatric Association,\n\n[[Page S5285]]\n\nAmerican Psychiatric Association, American Psychiatric Nurses \nAssociation, American Psychological Association, Anxiety Disorders \nAssociation of America, Association for the Advancement of Psychology, \nAssociation for Ambulatory Behavioral Healthcare, Association for \nBehavioral Health and Wellness, Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, \nChildren and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Attention Disorder, Child & \nAdolescent Bipolar Foundation, Child Welfare League of America, \nChildren and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, \nChildren's Healthcare Is a Legal Duty, Depression and Bipolar Support \nAlliance, Eating Disorders Coalition for Research Policy & Action, \nMental Health America, National Alliance to Advance Adolescent Health, \nNational Alliance on Mental Illness, National Association for \nChildren's Behavioral Health, National Association of Pediatric Nurse \nPractitioners, National Association of Psychiatric Health Systems, \nNational Association of School Psychologists, National Association of \nSocial Workers, National Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare, \nNational Federation of Families for Children's Mental Health, National \nMental Health Awareness Campaign, Suicide Prevention Action Network \nUSA, Therapeutic Communities of America, U.S. Psychiatric \nRehabilitation Association, Witness Justice.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 999\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Health Care Crisis \n     Relief Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Center for Mental Health Services estimates that 20 \n     percent or 13,700,000 of the Nation's children and \n     adolescents have a diagnosable mental disorder, and about \\2/\n     3\\ of these children and adolescents do not receive mental \n     health care.\n       (2) According to ``Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon \n     General'' in 1999, there are approximately 6,000,000 to \n     9,000,000 children and adolescents in the United States \n     (accounting for 9 to 13 percent of all children and \n     adolescents in the United States) who meet the definition for \n     having a serious emotional disturbance.\n       (3) According to the Center for Mental Health Services, \n     approximately 5 to 9 percent of United States children and \n     adolescents meet the definition for extreme functional \n     impairment.\n       (4) According to the Surgeon General's Report, there are \n     particularly acute shortages in the numbers of mental health \n     service professionals serving children and adolescents with \n     serious emotional disorders.\n       (5) According to the National Center for Education \n     Statistics in the Department of Education, there are \n     approximately 479 students for each school counselor in \n     United States schools, which ratio is almost double the \n     recommended ratio of 250 students for each school counselor.\n       (6) According to the Bureau of Health Professions in 2000, \n     the demand for the services of child and adolescent \n     psychiatry is projected to increase by 100 percent by 2020.\n       (7) The development and application of knowledge about the \n     impact of disasters on children, adolescents, and their \n     families has been impeded by critical shortages of qualified \n     researchers and practitioners specializing in this work.\n       (8) According to the Bureau of the Census, the population \n     of children and adolescents in the United States under the \n     age of 18 is projected to grow by more than 40 percent in the \n     next 50 years from 70,000,000 to more than 100,000,000 by \n     2050.\n       (9) There are approximately 7,000 child and adolescent \n     psychiatrists in the United States. Only 300 child and \n     adolescent psychiatrists complete training each year.\n       (10) According to the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, racial and ethnic minority representation is \n     lacking in the mental health workforce. Although 12 percent \n     of the United States population is African-American, only 2 \n     percent of psychologists, 2 percent of psychiatrists, and 4 \n     percent of social workers are African-American providers. \n     Moreover, there are only 29 Hispanic mental health \n     professionals for every 100,000 Hispanics in the United \n     States, compared with 173 non-Hispanic white providers per \n     100,000.\n       (11) According to a 2006 study in the Journal of the \n     American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the \n     national shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists \n     affects poor children and adolescents living in rural areas \n     the hardest.\n       (12) According to the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, the ``U.S. mental health system is not well \n     equipped to meet the needs of racial and ethnic minority \n     populations.''. This is quite evident in access to care \n     issues involving racial and ethnic minority children. Studies \n     have shown that there are striking racial and ethnic \n     differences in the utilization of mental health services \n     among children and youth. Overall, mental health services \n     meet the needs of 31 percent of non-minority children, but \n     only 13 percent of minority children.\n       (13) According to the National Center for Mental Health and \n     Juvenile Justice, 70 percent of youth involved in State and \n     local juvenile justice systems throughout the country suffer \n     from mental disorders, with at least 20 percent experiencing \n     symptoms so severe that their ability to function is \n     significantly impaired.\n       (14) The Institute of Medicine, in Improving the Quality of \n     Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Disorders, Quality \n     Chasm Series (2006) recommended that clinicians and patients \n     communicate effectively and share information to ensure \n     quality care, which is enhanced with education programs that \n     allow families and consumers to share information with mental \n     health providers about the lived experience of mental \n     illness.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to increase immunization rates; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the Immunization \nImprovement Act of 2009. The recent outbreak of H1N1 influenza makes \nthis legislation timelier than ever before. While a vaccine has not yet \nbeen developed to protect us against this flu strain, one is currently \nin the works. This outbreak is a reminder of the important role that \nimmunizations provide in protecting us against harmful or even deadly \nviruses, like the measles, polio, and seasonal human influenza.\n  Vaccinations have been proven to be clinically effective in improving \nhealth, and providing population-based immunity. Routine childhood \nimmunizations, for example, prevent over 14 million individual cases of \ndisease and over 33,500 deaths over the lifetime of children born in \nany given year.\n  However, significant and persistent gaps in public and private health \ninsurance coverage of immunizations remain. Approximately 11 percent of \nyoung children and 21 percent of adolescents are underinsured for \nimmunizations. Nearly 2/3 of adults are underinsured for \nimmunizations--17 percent are uninsured. Each year, vaccine-preventable \ndiseases cause the deaths of more than 42,000 people and hundreds of \nthousands of cases of illness.\n  Congress will soon embark upon meaningful health care reform. This \ndebate will provide the opportunity for us to eliminate the obstacles--\nlack of insurance and high cost-sharing--to accessing routine \nimmunizations. We must shift to a system that will make routine \npreventive care, like immunizations, affordable.\n  In fact, it is in the best interest of Government and society to \nensure coverage of routine vaccinations, as these preventive \nvaccinations currently result in an annual cost savings of $10 billion \nin direct medical costs and over $40 billion in indirect societal \ncosts.\n\n[[Page S5288]]\n\nExpanding immunization coverage will enhance these savings over the \nlong term.\n  The Immunization Improvement Act would remove barriers to \nimmunization. First, it would enable states to access routine \nvaccinations for adults at a discount negotiated by the Federal \nGovernment. Currently, 36 States and New York City are able to buy \nvaccines using the Federal discount, but these contracts are about to \nexpire. The Immunization Improvement Act would ensure that states can \ncontinue to purchase adult vaccines under CDC contracts. It would also \nprovide for Medicaid coverage of adult immunizations that are \nrecommended for routine use and prohibit any cost-sharing for them.\n  There are a host of routinely recommended vaccinations for the \nMedicare population, as well. Unfortunately, Medicare Part B only \ncovers influenza, pneumonia, and hepatitis B vaccines. Medicare \nbeneficiaries are eligible for additional vaccines that are covered by \nPart D, but few of these vaccines are covered by prescription drug \nplans. Moreover, physicians have difficulties billing plans for the \nincurred costs. As such, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, \nMedPAC, has recommended that all immunizations recommended for routine \nuse among the Medicare population be covered under Part B. The \nImmunization Improvement Act would codify that recommendation.\n  Inadequate reimbursement for administering immunizations also \nprevents children, adolescents, and adults from receiving necessary \nvaccinations. According to the National Vaccine Advisory Committee, the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, and CDC should review \nand update the maximum allowable fees for administering routine \nvaccinations, and publish and update the actual fees for vaccination \nadministration paid by each State--in an effort to encourage \nconsistency across state lines. This legislation would also reimburse \nproviders for administering vaccines to children who are eligible for \nvaccination through the Vaccines for Children program, but not \nMedicaid. This would enable both uninsured and underinsured children to \nbecome vaccinated in an effort to get all children vaccinated.\n  Finally, as we look to reform our health care system, we must also \nhold private health insurers accountable for covering vaccinations \nrecommended for routine use--without any cost-sharing. The Immunization \nImprovement Act would require this coverage upon the enactment of \nhealth reform.\n  Given the current circumstances, it is evident that vaccinations can \nand truly do eradicate the spread of preventable diseases. However, we \nmust do more to ensure comprehensive coverage of immunizations. It is \nmy hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1003\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Immunizations recommended for routine use have been \n     proven to be clinically effective in improving health and \n     preventing the spread of disease. Routine childhood \n     immunizations prevent over 14,000,000 cases of disease and \n     over 33,500 deaths over the lifetime of children born in any \n     given year. In addition to protecting individuals from \n     disease, immunization provides population-based (herd) \n     immunity.\n       (2) An economic evaluation of the impact of seven vaccines \n     routinely given as part of the childhood immunization \n     schedule found that the vaccines are cost-effective. Over the \n     lifetime of children born in any given year, these \n     immunizations result in an annual cost savings of \n     $10,000,000,000 in direct medical costs and over \n     $40,000,000,000 in indirect societal costs.\n       (3) There are significant and persistent gaps in public and \n     private health insurance coverage of immunizations. About 11 \n     percent of young children and 21 percent of adolescents are \n     underinsured for immunizations. Among adults, 59 percent are \n     underinsured and 17 percent are completely uninsured for \n     immunizations. According to the Institute of Medicine, even \n     those with insurance increasingly have to pay higher \n     deductibles and copayments for immunizations.\n       (4) Each year, vaccine-preventable diseases cause the \n     deaths of more than 42,000 people and hundreds of thousands \n     cases of illness.\n       (5) In 2003, the Institute of Medicine's Committee on the \n     Evaluation of Vaccine Purchase Financing made the following \n     conclusions:\n       (A) Current public and private financing strategies for \n     immunization have had substantial success, especially in \n     improving immunization rates for young children. However, \n     significant disparities remain in assuring access to \n     recommended vaccines across geographic and demographic \n     populations.\n       (B) Many young children, adolescents, and high-risk adults \n     have no or limited insurance for recommended vaccines. Gaps \n     and fragmentation in insurance benefits create barriers for \n     both vulnerable populations and clinicians that can \n     contribute to lower immunization rates.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to require a supermajority shareholder vote to \napprove excessive compensation of any employee of a publicly-traded \ncompany; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Americans have every right to be outraged \nover the recent bonuses given to employees of the group within AIG that \nled to that company's collapse. American taxpayers have provided $185 \nbillion--and counting--to save a firm that has been deemed ``too \ninterconnected to fail.''\n  It is unacceptable that millions of those taxpayer dollars have been \nhanded over to some of the executives who caused this disaster in the \nfirst place. If there is a constitutional way to reclaim those bonuses, \nI support it.\n  But it is important to remember that executive compensation practices \nhave been out of control for many years. While the wages and benefits \nof middle class workers have stagnated, CEO compensation has exploded.\n  According to the Economic Policy Institute's ``State of Working \nAmerica,'' in 1965 U.S. CEOs at major companies made 24 times the pay \nof an average worker. By 2005, CEOs earned 262 times the pay of an \naverage worker.\n  The comparison between CEOs and minimum wage workers is even starker. \nIn 1965 U.S. CEOs at major companies made 51 times the pay of workers \nearning the minimum wage. By 2005, CEOs earned 821 times the pay of \nworkers earning the minimum wage.\n  These comparisons are important not because they could be used to \nincite calls for class warfare, but because the American people deserve \nan honest accounting of the activities of the corporations that touch \ntheir lives in so many ways. Every American deserves an honest wage for \nhonest work. And every American, from the top of the corporate ladder \nto the bottom, deserves to know whether they are being compensated \nfairly--whether they are sharing in the rewards of the company's work \nor whether their labors are mainly fueling ever more extravagant pay \nfor the top executives.\n  We have lost the balance we once had in America. Executive pay has \nsoared, while pay for many s has not even kept pace with their \nproductivity increases. It's not surprising that there is widespread \nfury when CEOs get it wrong. After all, they have a hand in setting \ntheir own salaries. But recently, the anger of the average American \nworker has boiled over because so many CEOs have gotten it so wrong. \nThat outcome is not healthy for our economy, and it's not healthy for \nour society.\n  If companies want to pay their executives handsomely for excellent \nperformance, they should be able to do that. They should be able to \ncompete for top talent. But the shareholders should be looking over \ntheir shoulders as they adopt excessive pay structures, and the \ntaxpayers shouldn't be subsidizing the resulting income disparities.\n  To restore some balance, the shareholders of a corporation should \nhave to approve lucrative compensation packages. And, the companies \nshouldn't receive a tax deduction for handing out excessive pay.\n\n[[Page S5291]]\n\n  That is why today I am introducing two bills--the Excessive Pay \nShareholder Approval Act S. 1006, and the Excessive Pay Capped \nDeduction Act, S. 1007.\n  The Excessive Pay Shareholder Approval Act would require a \nsupermajority--60 percent--vote of the shareholders to approve a \ncompensation structure in which any employee receives more than 100 \ntimes more than the average employee of that company. Corporations \ncould pay executives whatever they think is appropriate, but \nshareholders would have to OK packages that are 100 times as large as \nthe average worker earns. This bill would require greater transparency \nin compensation and would encourage companies to think about how they \npay their lower-paid workers, not just how they reward the people at \nthe top.\n  Similarly, the Excessive Pay Capped Deduction Act would limit the \nnormal tax deduction for compensation for executives to 100 times the \ncompensation of the average worker at that company. Again, corporations \ncould pay executives whatever they decide is appropriate, but they \ncould not claim limitless tax benefits for doing so. This bill also \nwould encourage companies to look at their entire compensation \nstructure, and it would protect taxpayers.\n  Here is an example. If the average worker at a company earned, \nincluding wages, paid leave, supplemental pay, and retirement, the same \namount as the average worker nationwide in December of 2008, that \nworker would have earned around $50,000. At that company, a \nsupermajority of shareholders would be required to approve pay packages \nlarger than $5 million and that company could not deduct compensation \nin excess of $5 million.\n  How many companies would this affect? According to the research firm \nThe Corporate Library, in 2007 the median compensation for CEOs of S \n500 companies was $8.8 million. Therefore, if these companies are only \npaying average wages across the rest of the company, many of them would \nbe affected by this legislation. Many would not.\n  From our founding, this country has benefitted from a sense of unity \nand balance that has brought Americans together in good times and in \nbad. If the rewards handed out by our leading corporations flow \nexcessively to the very wealthy while leaving middle-class families \nbehind, we risk losing that sense of common purpose. The uproar over \nAIG bonuses showed very clearly the corrosive effects of compensation \npackages that appear to be disconnected from the reality that the \naverage family faces day in and day out.\n  The two bills I am introducing today would help to restore some of \nthe balance we have lost, by ensuring greater accountability for the \ndisparities in compensation for corporate leaders and the average \nworkers they employ, and by protecting taxpayers when a company's \ncompensation packages reach extreme levels.\n  I urge my colleagues to support both bills.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1006\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to limit \nrequirements of separation pay, special separation benefits, and \nvoluntary separation incentive from members of the Armed Forces \nsubsequently receiving retired or retainer pay; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Military \nRetirement Pay Fairness Act of 2009. I want to thank my colleague, \nSenator Gregg, for cosponsoring this important legislation.\n  The Military Retirement Pay Fairness Act addresses a critical issue \nthat impacts our nation's veterans. Certain service members who receive \nspecial separation pay must have that benefit recouped if they later \nre-enlist and become eligible for a pension. Under current law, the \nDepartment of Defense, DOD, is bound by a statutory formula for \nrecouping that benefit and cannot change the amount it recoups each \nmonth, even if it results in severe financial hardship for our nation's \nveterans. In fact, many veterans are currently in dire financial \nstraits because of this unnecessarily harsh formula. This legislation \nwill fix the formula and provide these veterans with much needed \nfinancial relief.\n  I would like to talk about one particular veteran who brought this \nissue to my attention. Sgt. Wayne Merritt of Dover, New Hampshire \nserved in the Air Force for nearly 14 years until the end of the Cold \nWar, when the Defense Department began to draw down its forces. At \nDOD's encouragement, Mr. Merritt took a one-time Special Separation \nBenefit, and then started working in the private sector.\n  But in 1996, Sgt. Merritt decided to serve his country once again, \njoining the New Hampshire Air National Guard. When Sgt. Merritt retired \nin 2006, he became eligible for a pension that provided him and his \nfamily with enough to help pay the bills, especially his monthly \nmortgage payments.\n  However, just a couple of months ago, Sgt. Merritt had his life \nturned upside down when he got a letter in the mail from the Defense \nDepartment. The letter said that, within a few weeks, DOD would begin \nrecouping his separation benefit by withholding more than half of his \npension each month until the full amount is paid back.\n  Sgt. Merritt was shocked. He planned his family budget around a \npension payment he had been receiving each month for nearly 2 years, \nonly to get a letter saying that, in a few weeks, it would be reduced \nby more than half. Sgt. Merritt suddenly found himself in a position \nwhere he couldn't make ends meet and make his mortgage payments. In \nfact, he was so concerned that he contacted a real estate agent to talk \nabout selling his home.\n  Sgt. Merritt contacted DOD, asking if there was anything that could \nbe done to work out a manageable monthly payment plan. Sgt. Merritt did \nnot ask for the amount to be forgiven, but simply asked DOD to be \nflexible and work out a payment plan that he could afford. DOD told him \nthat there was nothing it could do to help, citing a statute that tied \nits hands.\n  On behalf of Sgt. Merritt, I contacted DOD and spoke to \nUndersecretary Robert Hale. He told me that DOD doesn't have a choice--\nit must recoup over half of his income because the formula in the \nstatute dictates the rate. The result is that Sgt. Merritt, and over \n1,000 veterans in similar situations across the country, face financial \nhardship as a result of an unfair rule. As each month goes by, DOD has \nto garnish over half of Sgt. Merritt's pension payments.\n  I do not believe that Congress intends to treat our Nation's veterans \nthis way. That is why I am introducing legislation today that would \nprovide a simple and straightforward solution. Instead of an \nunnecessarily harsh formula, our bill will provide DOD with the \nflexibility it needs to develop manageable monthly payment plans that \ndo not impose undue financial hardship on service members. In addition, \nDOD would be required to consult with the service member to create a \nmonthly payment plan, taking into account a veteran's financial \nsituation when determining how much should be recouped each month. To \nmake sure these payment plans are manageable, DOD would only be able to \nrecoup, at the most, 25 percent of the veteran's monthly pension check \nuntil the benefit is repaid.\n  This legislation would also address other problems with pension \nrecoupment.\n  It would provide service members with adequate notice of the \nrecoupment so that they have time to prepare for the loss of income. \nSgt. Merritt received his letter just weeks before DOD garnished over \nhalf of his pension pay. This legislation ensures that service members \nhave at least 90 days notice before recoupment begins.\n  Finally, the legislation would also give the Secretary of Defense the \nflexibility to ensure that no veteran will be left destitute from this \nrecoupment. We need to recognize that financial circumstances change \nover time. If recouping the benefit would cause a severe financial \nhardship, the Secretary of Defense should be able to waive that amount.\n  This legislation is critical. Each month, over 1,000 veterans face \ncircumstances similar to Sgt. Merritt's. Undersecretary Robert Hale \ntold me that while he sympathizes with these veterans, he has no legal \nrecourse to change the amount it recoups every month. This legislation \nprovides DOD with the flexibility it needs to ensure that we do not \npunish veterans who have made the courageous decision to serve their \ncountry again.\n  I'm glad that this effort has the support of DOD, as well as veterans \norganizations like the Veterans of Foreign Wars, VFW, and the Military \nOfficers Association of America, MOAA.\n  I want to thank Senator Gregg for his support of this important, \ncommon sense legislation. I also want to thank my fellow New Hampshire \ndelegation member, Carol Shea-Porter, for introducing companion \nlegislation in the House. I urge my colleagues to join me in addressing \nthese important issues.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1008\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a National Foreign Language Coordinator \nCouncil; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to reintroduce the National \nForeign Language Coordination Act with my colleagues Senators Cochran, \nDodd, and Durbin. Through sustained leadership and a coordinated plan \nof action, our bill aims to increase the number of individuals with \nforeign language skills and cultural understanding.\n  Globalization has made the world smaller and Americans must be better \nequipped, with language skills and cultural knowledge, not only to \nsurvive in it, but to prosper. Whether it is: competing on the world \nmarket to provide goods and services, cross cultural exchanges between \neducators and business people of different countries, or allied \nmilitary or diplomatic operations to make the world more secure and \npeaceful, all of these efforts require communication to succeed.\n  It took the tragic events of 9-11 to bring attention to our shortage \nof foreign language speakers. Many of you know about the emergency call \nfor linguists following the attacks. Unfortunately, this was not \nsurprising. The fact that only 9.3 percent of all Americans speak both \ntheir native languages and another language fluently, compared with 56 \npercent of people in the European Union, is cause for alarm.\n  Our national security continues to be at risk without enough foreign \nlanguage proficient individuals. Counterterrorism intelligence will go \nuntranslated, or be so late as to lose its usefulness, if we do not \nhave more foreign language experts. Foreign language skills are also \nvitally important to preserve the economic competitiveness of the U.S. \nGlobalization forces some Americans to compete for jobs in a \nmarketplace no longer limited by borders. According to the Committee \nfor Economic Development, the lack of foreign language skills and \ninternational knowledge results in embarrassing and costly cultural \nblunders for companies. In fact, the Committee reports that American \ncompanies lose an estimated $2 billion a year due to inadequate \ncultural understanding.\n  Many of the Federal Government's efforts to address language needs in \nthe U.S. over the past 40 years have come in reaction to international \nevents. We do not have a proactive policy.\n  In 1958, the National Defense Education Act was passed in response to \nthe Soviet Union's first space launch. We were determined to win the \nspace race and make certain that the U.S. never came up short again in \nmath, science, technology, or foreign languages. That act was a great \nsuccess, but in the late 70s its foreign language programs merged into \nlarger education reform measures and lost their prominence. The results \nare clear. In 1979, the President's Commission on Foreign Language and \nInternational Studies said that ``Americans' incompetence in foreign \nlanguages is nothing short of scandalous, and it is becoming worse.''\n  After 9-11, Congress and the administration once again took action to \naddress language shortfalls, but I fear that these efforts will prove \nto be only a band-aid and not a complete cure to the Nation's recurring \nforeign language needs. Despite the administration's efforts to \nimplement new programs and policies to address our language shortfalls, \nI fear that without sustained leadership and a coordinated effort among \nall Federal agencies, state and local governments, the private sector, \nand academia, we will remain where we are today: scrambling to find \nlinguists after another major international event. We must be prepared \nto avoid another 9-11 type shortage.\n  Together we must commit to build and maintain language expertise and \nrelationships with people from all across the world--whether or not the \nlanguages they speak are considered critical at the time--and to ensure \nthat we have the infrastructure in place to prevent catastrophic \nevents--or at least be prepared to respond to them. To this end, there \nneeds to be one person in the Executive Branch who will lead the cross-\nagency efforts to better understand America's language needs for the \nnext 5, 15, or 20 years, and to figure out how to address those needs. \nThis leadership must be comprehensive, as no one sector--Government, \nindustry, or academia--has all of the needs for language and cultural \ncompetency, or all of the solutions.\n  The Bush administration's National Security Language Initiative was a \ngood first step at coordinating efforts among the Intelligence \nDirectorate and the Departments of Defense, Education, and State to \naddress our national security language needs. However, we must ensure \nthat this effort will continue, bring in the advice of all Federal \nagencies and stakeholders, and address our economic security needs.\n  The legislation we introduce today would set us on the right course \nby implementing a key recommendation of the 2004 Department of Defense, \nDOD, National Language Conference and echoed by Department of Defense \nsponsored State language roadmap summits which is to establish a \nNational Foreign Language Coordination Council, chaired by a National \nLanguage Advisor. An integrated foreign language strategy and sustained \nleadership within the Federal Government is needed to address the lack \nof foreign language proficient speakers in government, academia and the \nprivate sector. Just as I have advocated the need for deputy \nsecretaries for management at the Departments of Defense and Homeland \nSecurity to direct and sustain management leadership, I envision a \nNational Language Advisor to be responsible for maintaining and leading \na cooperative effort to strengthen our foreign language capabilities. \nWithout such a coordinated strategy in the world in which we live, I \nfear that the country's national and economic security will be at \ngreater risk.\n  Specifically, our bill ensures that the key recommendations of the \nDOD National Language Conference be implemented by having strong \nleadership that will develop policies and programs that build the \nNation's language and cultural understanding capability; engage \nFederal, State, and local agencies and the private sector in solutions; \ndevelop language skills in a wide range of critical languages; \nstrengthen our education system, programs, and tools in foreign \nlanguages and cultures; and, integrate language training into career \nfields and increasing the number of language professionals.\n  To strengthen the role of the U.S. in the world, our country must \nensure that there are sufficient numbers of individuals who are \nproficient in languages other than English. Increasing foreign language \nskills enhances national security and economic prosperity.\n\n[[Page S5294]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1010\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint \ncoins in commemoration of the centennial of the establishment of \nMother's Day; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nMother's Day Centennial Coin Commemorative Coin Act. I am proud to have \nthe senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, as an original \ncosponsor given that this is a special event for our state. We are \njoined by Senators Bayh, Begich, Ben Nelson, Whitehouse and Levin.\n  In 1908, a West Virginian woman by the name of Anna Jarvis petitioned \nher local church to declare May 9th as Mother's Day. Within 6 years, \nthe holiday became nationally recognized. Now, more than 100 years \nafter that first Mother's Day, we have the opportunity to commemorate \nthe centennial of this great holiday and further recognize the millions \nof American mothers whose essential role in life cannot be overstated.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would recognize the centennial \nof Mother's Day by authorizing the Treasury to mint commemorative \nMother's Day coins. Profits generated from the sale of the coins would \nbe donated to Susan G. Komen for the Cure and The National Osteoporosis \nFoundation. Susan G. Komen for the Cure has raised more than $1 billion \nfor breast cancer research since 1982, and the National Osteoporosis \nFoundation is considered our Nation's leading voluntary health \norganization. Thousands of women have benefited from the efforts of \nthese organizations and they are well deserving of our support.\n  These coins will not only raise awareness of the proud history of \nMother's Day, but will help improve the health of thousands of our \nNation's mothers.

Res. 84\n\n       Whereas the Government of Canada permits an annual \n     commercial hunt for seals in the waters off the east coast of \n     Canada;\n       Whereas an international outcry regarding the plight of the \n     seals hunted in Canada resulted in the 1983 ban by the \n     European Union of whitecoat and blueback seal skins and the \n     subsequent collapse of the commercial seal hunt in Canada;\n       Whereas the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. \n     1361 et seq.) bars the import into the United States of any \n     seal products;\n       Whereas, in recent years, the Minister of Fisheries and \n     Oceans of Canada has authorized historically high quotas for \n     harp seals;\n       Whereas more than 1,000,000 seals have been killed during \n     the past 4 years;\n       Whereas harp seal pups can legally be hunted in Canada as \n     soon as they have begun to molt their white coats, at \n     approximately 12 days of age;\n       Whereas 97 percent of the seals killed are pups between \n     just 12 days and 12 weeks of age;\n       Whereas, in 2007, an international panel of experts in \n     veterinary medicine and zoology was invited by the Humane \n     Society of the United States to observe the commercial seal \n     slaughter in Canada;\n       Whereas the report by the panel noted that sealers failed \n     to comply with sealing regulations in Canada and that \n     officials of the Government of Canada failed to enforce such \n     regulations;\n       Whereas the report also concluded that the killing methods \n     permitted during the commercial seal hunt in Canada are \n     inherently inhumane and should be prohibited;\n       Whereas many seals are shot in the course of the hunt and \n     escape beneath the ice where they die slowly and are never \n     recovered;\n       Whereas such seals are not properly counted in official \n     kill statistics, increasing the likelihood that the actual \n     kill level is far higher than the level that is reported;\n       Whereas the few thousand fishermen who participate in the \n     commercial seal hunt in Canada earn, on average, only a tiny \n     fraction of their annual income from killing seals;\n       Whereas members of the fishing and sealing industries in \n     Canada continue to justify the seal hunt on the grounds that \n     the seals in the Northwest Atlantic are preventing the \n     recovery of cod stocks, despite the lack of any credible \n     scientific evidence to support this claim;\n       Whereas the consensus in the international scientific \n     community is that culling seals will not assist in the \n     recovery of fish stocks and that seals are a vital part of \n     the fragile marine ecosystem of the Northwest Atlantic;\n       Whereas polling consistently shows that the overwhelming \n     majority of people in Canada oppose the commercial seal hunt;\n       Whereas the vast majority of seal products are exported \n     from Canada, and the sealing industry relies on international \n     markets for its products;\n       Whereas 10 countries have prohibited trade in seal products \n     in recent years, and the European Union is now considering a \n     prohibition on trade in seal products; and\n       Whereas the persistence of this cruel and needless \n     commercial hunt is inconsistent with the well-earned \n     international reputation of Canada: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) urges the Government of Canada to prohibit the \n     commercial hunting of seals; and\n       (2) strongly supports an unconditional prohibition by the \n     European Union on trade in seal products.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/07/senate-section/article/S5297-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5297-S5298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NATIONAL TRAIN DAY\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 138 submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 138) honoring Concerns of Police \n     Survivors for 25 years of service to family members of law \n     enforcement officers killed in the line of duty.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am honored once again to submit this \nresolution to the Senate commemorating our Nation's law enforcement \nofficers and National Peace Officers Memorial Day. The Senate's \nofficial recognition of National Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police \nWeek is a tradition I am proud to carry out each year, and I look \nforward to the Senate taking up and passing this resolution.\n  In 2008, 133 law enforcement officers died while serving in the line \nof duty. We honor their memory. Though this is a decrease from 2007, it \nis no less tragic a loss to our Federal and state law enforcement \ncommunity and to their families and friends. The fact that we \ncommemorate the loss and bravery of so many in law enforcement each \nyear should remove any doubts in Congress that it is necessary to give \nour peace officers everything they need to stay safe and to do their \njobs as effectively as they can.\n  Currently, more than 900,000 men and women work tirelessly to protect \nour communities, our schools, and our children. They investigate and \napprehend the most violent criminals and do more than we know in \nkeeping our communities safe and secure. Since the first recorded \npolice death in 1792, the names of 18,274 law enforcement officers who \nhave made the ultimate sacrifice have been added to the National Law \nEnforcement Officers Memorial.\n  I also take this opportunity to recognize that the names of 387 \nfallen officers will be added to the National Law Enforcement Officers \nMemorial on May 13 during a candlelight vigil that will be held in \ntheir honor. These are officers from the past and present whose memory \nwill be preserved for all time at the memorial, ensuring that their \nbravery and sacrifice will not be forgotten.\n  National Peace Officers Memorial Day provides the people of the \nUnited States, in their communities, in their State capitals, and in \nthe Nation's Capital, with the opportunity to honor and reflect on the \nextraordinary service and sacrifice given year after year by those \nmembers of our police forces. More than 20,000 peace officers are \nexpected to gather in Washington in the days leading up to May 15, to \njoin with the families of their fallen comrades. It is right that the \nSenate show its respect on this occasion, and I am proud to honor their \nservice and their memory. I urge all Senators to join me in approving \nthis resolution.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid on the table.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 138) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 138\n\n       Whereas May 14, 2009, marks the 25th anniversary of the \n     founding of Concerns of Police Survivors;\n       Whereas, for 25 years, Concerns of Police Survivors has \n     answered one of the highest and most noble calls to service \n     by providing compassionate care and support to family members \n     of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty;\n       Whereas, for 25 years, Concerns of Police Survivors has \n     been a bedrock of strength for those family members in \n     helping them rebuild their shattered lives;\n       Whereas, for 25 years, Concerns of Police Survivors has \n     showed the highest amount of concern and respect for the tens \n     of thousands of family members of law enforcement officers \n     killed in the line of duty;\n       Whereas those family members bear the most immediate and \n     profound burden of the absences of their loved ones;\n       Whereas Concerns of Police Survivors facilitates healing \n     and provides love and renewed life to those family members \n     far from the eye of the media and the general public;\n       Whereas it is essential that the people of the Unites \n     States are made aware of the good works of Concerns of Police \n     Survivors and recognize the contributions of Concerns of \n     Police Survivors to so many families; and\n       Whereas National Police Week, observed in 2009 from May 10 \n     to May 16, is the most appropriate time to honor Concerns of \n     Police Survivors: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors Concerns of Police Survivors for 25 years of \n     service to the family members of law enforcement officers \n     killed in the line of duty across the United States;\n       (2) recognizes and thanks Concerns of Police Survivors for \n     assisting in rebuilding the shattered lives of those family \n     members through the organization's invaluable programs;\n       (3) urges the people of the United States to join with the \n     Senate in thanking Concerns of Police Survivors on behalf of \n     the Nation; and\n       (4) recognizes with great appreciation the sacrifices made \n     by the families of law enforcement officers killed in the \n     line of duty in providing essential support to one another.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/07/senate-section/article/S5298-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the Nation says its last farewell to \nJack Kemp tomorrow afternoon. But Americans will long remember the \ntremendous impact he has had on our lives and on our politics. So today \nI would like to add my voice to the many others who have spoken well of \nthis good man.\n  The arc of Jack's life is well known: middle-class son of a small \nbusinessman and his social worker wife. Jack never wanted to be \nanything but a professional football player, and he worked very hard at \nit. Good enough to get drafted by the Lions but not quite good enough \nto make the team, Jack dug in, passing briefly through a few football \nteams before being sidelined by an injury and ending up with the \nBuffalo Bills, where he became one of the great quarterbacks of all \ntime. Jack showed his skills early on with the Bills. In his very first \ngame, he completed 21 of 35 passes, including 2 touchdowns for 230 \nyards. By the time he retired in 1969, he would rank first in passes, \ncompletions, and passing yardage among all American Football League \nquarterbacks.\n  But Jack's restless mind was stirring even before he left the field. \nTeammates would later recall that on long plane rides, while they would \nbe reading playbooks, Jack would be reading economic theory or the \nlatest ``National Review.'' During the off season, Jack volunteered on \npolitical campaigns, including the gubernatorial campaign of Ronald \nReagan. It was all the training he would need.\n  After retiring from pro football, his path to politics was as sure as \nhis 10-yard pass. And so was his path to success. Armed with a kinetic \npersonality, a sharp mind, and a passion for ideas and for people, Jack \nset about with the zeal of a preacher to spread his convictions about \nthe economic benefits of sharp tax cuts. He was so convincing that tax \ncuts became the centerpiece of his party's platform in 1980, the basis \nof its revival and, most importantly, the cause of the unprecedented \nprosperity of the next two decades.\n  Growing up, Jack was the captain of every team for which he ever \nplayed. That didn't change when he came to Washington. He was calling \nthe plays here now, and people were eager to follow. He was as likable \nas he was persuasive, all the more so because he didn't seek out \npopularity.\n  He was always driven by something else. At his core, Jack was \nmotivated by nothing more than a deep desire to see America live up to \nits founding promise of equality for everyone, regardless of color, \nreligion, or background. The fight for equality was Jack's consuming \npassion.\n  Like everyone who grew up playing sports, he knew firsthand that \nwinning ball games had nothing to do with color. But as a quarterback, \nhe appreciated this more than most. The crowds may have cheered for \nJack, but he knew that every time he threw a pass or ran for a \ntouchdown, an offensive line stood guard, many of them African \nAmerican. These were his teammates, his friends, and he witnessed the \ndiscrimination they encountered many times. But there was one moment \nfrom those days that always lived in Jack's memory. It was in 1960. \nJack was playing for the Chargers at the time. They were in Houston for \nthe AFL Championship, and during the playing of the ``National \nAnthem,'' Jack looked over toward his father at the 50-yard line. The \nfather of his cocaptain, Charlie McNeil, was not there. He later found \nout that Mr. McNeil had been forced to sit in a section of the end zone \nthat was roped off for Blacks. It was one of many terrible indignities \nthat would make Jack a restless promoter of equality throughout his \nlife.\n  A self-described bleeding heart conservative, Jack's childlike love \nfor America and all it promised was evident until the end. In a letter \nto his grandchildren just this past November, Jack said his first \nthought upon learning that an African American had won the Presidency \nwas: ``Is this a great country or not?'' ``Just think,'' he wrote, ``a \nlittle over 40 years ago, Blacks in America had trouble even voting in \nour country, much less thinking about running for the highest office in \nthe land.''\n  Jack was not your average politician, but he was a necessary one, \nconstantly challenging the establishment. He was a political \nentrepreneur, restless to get things done. Colleagues remember how \nCabinet meetings were always livelier with Jack there--whether he was \nrolling his eyes in disagreement or squirming in his chair. No room \never seemed big enough to contain him. Sometimes when congressional \nleadership would meet over in the White House, Jack's former colleague \nand ours, Trent Lott, would have to kick him under the table to keep \nhim from saying something he might regret later on. Convention just \nnever suited him, and the Nation and our party was always a lot better \nbecause of it.\n  We will miss Jack's insistence, his passion, his energy, and we will \nmiss seeing him, the broad smile, the snow-white hair, plowing into a \ncrowd, bounding up on a stage, and hurling an imaginary football off \ninto the distance.\n  Jack was a happy, raspy-voiced evangelist for the ideas that shaped a \ngeneration and revived a political party. He believed, rightly, that \nconservative ideas were universal--that if they applied to one group, \nthey applied to all groups. And he rolled up his sleeves to prove it, \nwhether as a candidate for Vice President, a Cabinet Secretary spending \na night in a Philadelphia housing project, or in these last years as an \nadvocate for many of the causes he believed in, a speaker, a wise party \nelder and, above all, a devoted husband to his beloved Joanne, father, \nand grandfather.\n  It is hard to imagine someone of Jack's energy and enthusiasm \nsuccumbing to anything; he was always so full of life, the vital center \nof every room he entered and every debate. We will miss his passion. We \nare all grateful for his goodness. And as we say our final goodbye to \nJack French Kemp, we are consoled by the thought that after a painful \nillness, he has broken away now like a wide receiver from the pack, \ninto the welcoming embrace of a loving God.\n\n[[Page S5301]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/07/senate-section/article/S5301-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, MAY 11, 2009, AT 2 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
