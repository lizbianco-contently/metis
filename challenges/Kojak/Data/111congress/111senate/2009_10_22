Mr. President, I also remind everyone that we are in the \nprocess of coming up with a bill we will send from the Senate to the \nCongressional Budget Office. It is so important that we move forward on \nthis legislation. Health care is vitally important to this country.\n  Every Thursday when we are in session, Senator Ensign and I have a \nWelcome to Washington Breakfast, and it is very good. We have been \ndoing this for 9 years. Today we had the Principal of the Year, from \nFrank Lamping Elementary School, grades 1 through 5. Principal of the \nYear--that is really significant. We have well more than\n\n[[Page S10656]]\n\n400,000 students in Nevada, and to think they selected that man as the \nPrincipal of the Year is quite an honor. The principal is Michael \nO'Dowd. We had a longtime retired judge with whom I practiced law in \nthe same community for a number of years, Gerry Hardcastle.\n  But the reason I mention this, there was a man there who introduced \nme to his son--a good-looking young man. His father was there to tell \nme about a new treatment they have developed for congenital clubfoot. \nIn years past, the only way to handle that situation was with surgery. \nNow they have a new method. He had his boy there. His boy plays \nbasketball. His boy can do anything he wants. And they have done this \nwith no surgery. They now have new treatment for this. It is not \nsurgical. In other countries, people spend the rest of their lives with \ntheir feet upside down unless there is surgery, and it is so difficult \nto do. So that is why health care is important.\n  This is one minor example of how we are advancing in health care, and \nwe have to make sure health care is affordable to the American people. \nOur health care costs are more than 2\\1/2\\ times that of Japan. Yet the \nhealth care is not as good here as in Japan.\n  I look forward to sending that bill on to the Congressional Budget \nOffice. I had spoken to the Republican leader yesterday. We are going \nto make sure Senators have plenty of opportunity to look at this bill \nonce we get it back. We are concerned about quality, not quantity--\nwell, we are interested in quality, not how fast we can move this. We \nwant to move it as quickly as we can, as expeditiously as we can, but \nwe want to do it as well as we can. So I look forward to working with \nthe Republican leader to have a good debate on this matter and have \nhealth care for all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/22/senate-section/article/S10656-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I appreciate sharing the floor with the \nsenior Senator from Minnesota, Ms. Klobuchar.\n  I come to the floor regularly and share letters from voters and \nconstituents and citizens around my State, around Ohio, people from \nKent and Warren and Mansfield and Zanesville and Chillicothe. We all \nget these letters. I know the Acting President pro tempore gets them \nfrom Arkansas and Senator Klobuchar gets them from Minnesota--letters \nfrom people who generally, 2 years ago, a year ago, if you asked them, \nthey would have said they were satisfied with their insurance, but then \nsomething happened: They had a child born with an illness and the \ninsurance company cut them off because the child had a preexisting \ncondition or someone got very sick, they thought they had good \ninsurance, but the insurance company canceled them because the cost was \nso high for their illness. A lot of these letters also come from people \nwho lost their job. They are 59, 60, 61 years old, and they pray to God \nthey will be able to get through the next 3, 4, 5 years until they are \nMedicare eligible so they will have a strong government health care \nplan--Medicare--to insure them the rest of their lives, so they can get \nthe kind of health care they, as American citizens, should be entitled \nto.\n  So let me share three or four letters, and then I will turn the floor \nover to Senator Klobuchar.\n  Allison from Hamilton County, in southwest Ohio, the Cincinnati area, \nwrites:\n\n       In June, I was taken to the hospital for suspected Ruptured \n     appendix. I was admitted and stayed for 24 hours. Currently, \n     my hospital expenses are at $9000. Each day it seems like \n     another bill comes to my home.\n       Last year, I had a part time job while going to school \n     full-time and earned $7000. I completed my coursework and \n     began looking for full time work last month in this tough \n     economy.\n       I believe that the health care program being discussed will \n     help families like mine.\n\n  Allison is exactly right. Think about this. This woman was in \ncollege. She was working. She is doing everything we ask in this \ncountry. She was in college full time. She was working a part-time job. \nShe was working hard. She lost her insurance. She does not have \ninsurance because of her age. So what is going to happen to her? She is \ngoing to face a workplace that is not very embracing right now, with \nnot a lot of opportunity, and have these kinds of costs already piling \nup--possibly student loans also.\n  What our bill will do is simply say that anybody can stay in their \nparent's health plan up to the age of 26. That will make a difference \nfor people such as Allison.\n  Greg from Shelby County, in western Ohio, the Sidney area of the \nState, writes:\n\n       Please keep up the fight for healthcare reform. We have a \n     23-year-old daughter who just graduated from college and has \n     been consistently denied health insurance because of a pre-\n     existing condition.\n       Her condition only requires maintenance medication but she \n     is evidently considered ``too much of a risk'' to insure.\n       We know that if opponents of health reform had a loved one \n     being denied health insurance they [might] not be so against \n     it.\n       Please, please keep fighting and make sure to adopt \n     legislation to get coverage for all Americans.\n\n  Greg and his daughter are victims again of a system that is \nmalfunctioning. Too many times, in too many cases, people who thought \nthey had decent insurance--their daughter is 23. She cannot stay on her \nparent's plan because of that. Our bill will allow her to. Our bill \nwill give his daughter the opportunity to go into the insurance \nexchange--to pick Aetna or Blue Cross or WellPoint or another insurance \ncompany or pick a public option--a public option--that will keep the \ninsurance companies honest, that will compete with the insurance \ncompanies and help bring costs down.\n  There are two more letters. I have a letter from Stephanie from \nCincinnati. I will tell her story quickly.\n  Stephanie traveled all the way from Ohio, along with six other \nfamilies from around the country, to talk about their health care \nstories. They are speaking for millions of Americans who can't obtain \nhealth insurance or who have coverage but still can't get needed \nmedical services. Stephanie's parents were in an accident that cost her \nmother her life and left her father in intensive care for 5 weeks. \nStephanie had to battle insurance companies constantly to get her \nfather vital treatments for his injuries so he could walk again.\n  Stephanie's message is simple. She said: I and every other American \nare not simply claims to be denied.\n  Think about that. Your mother is killed in a car accident. Your \nfather is in intensive care. What are you doing? You are fighting with \ninsurance companies to cover your father's medical care. What kind of \nsystem does that?\n  Insurance companies don't want to insure you when you are sick. If \nyou are going to be too expensive, they find reasons to deny you care: \npreexisting condition, discrimination based on disability or gender or \nage or geography. They don't want to cover you if you are sick, but if \nyou get insurance, then they work to try to deny your claim.\n  Thirty percent of claims in this country are denied in the first \nround--30 percent. Some of them get undenied. Some of them get accepted \nand paid. But the sick person or the sick person's family has to get on \nthe phone day after day and fight with the insurance\n\n[[Page S10657]]\n\ncompany and cajole and argue and call their State legislator and call \ntheir Congressman and push the insurance company to do the right thing. \nWhat does that do? If you are suffering from breast cancer and you have \nto deal with your illness and all those issues and you have to deal \nwith an insurance company, what kind of health care system is that?\n  The last letter I will read, and then turn the floor over to Senator \nKlobuchar, is from Dan from Butler County, just north of Cincinnati. \nDan writes:\n\n       I am 47 years old. My wife and I are among the working poor \n     in this country. We live in a very modest home with typical \n     household expenses: A car, a school loan, a few thousand \n     dollars of credit, and other bills. But starting in 2010, our \n     health care expenses will nearly equal our monthly mortgage \n     payments.\n       I have been diabetic since age 4. Twenty years ago I got a \n     kidney transplant. But today, I can't pay for the increased \n     health premiums my insurance company charges me. I can't pay \n     the doctor bills and keep my house and my car at the same \n     time. It will eventually come down to not seeing a doctor or \n     not taking my medication in order to keep my house.\n       Had I known before that getting a kidney transplant in 1988 \n     would be a preexisting condition today, I would have declined \n     it and not put the financial burden on my parents, myself, \n     and my wife.\n\n  So here is a gentleman in Middletown, Hamilton, in that area of Ohio. \nDan works every day, working poor, making $10, $12 an hour, barely \nmaking it, working hard every day. He has to make a choice: house \npayment, medication, insurance payment. He can't do all three. Maybe he \ncan't even do two of those. When somebody is working that hard and \nplaying by the rules and doing what we ask of them in this country, \nwhich is to work hard, raise your kids, go to school, contribute to \nyour community, Dan doesn't have that opportunity because of what has \nhappened to health care costs.\n  Our bill will help people such as Dan. If he doesn't have insurance \nor he can't afford that insurance, he can go into an insurance \nexchange, choose a menu of plans: CIGNA or Aetna or WellPoint or he can \nchoose the public option, which will mean no more preexisting \ncondition, no more denial of care, no more limits if you get sick and \nit gets expensive. It will keep the insurance companies honest, allow \nthem to compete, and bring the prices down. That is why the public \noption will make this health care bill even better than it would be \notherwise. It is the least we can do. It is what we have to do for our \nNation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I think the Republican leader is here \nand he will go before me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/22/senate-section/article/S10657-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to call \nattention to someone who rarely calls attention to himself. Today, our \nfriend, Senator Inouye, reaches a very lofty milestone, and we honor \nhim for his achievement. It is an opportunity to call attention not \nonly to his dedication to the people of Hawaii but also to a remarkable \nAmerican story.\n  Senator Inouye was only 17 when he heard the sirens over Honolulu and \nsaw the gray planes flying overhead, but he was old enough to know \nnothing would be the same. At the time, he dreamed of being a surgeon. \nA few years later, a medic would be taking care of him after his heroic \nactions in the Italian mountains, for which he would later receive our \nNation's most prestigious award for military valor.\n  Dan Inouye's dream of being a surgeon was not realized. There were \nother things in store. Instead, he became a member of one of the most \ndecorated U.S. military units in American history and one of our \nNation's longest serving and finest Senators.\n  We are periodically reminded of Senator Inouye's deep commitment to \nservice, such as earlier this month when he traveled to Afghanistan and \nPakistan to check in on our troops and ensure their well-being. It was \nan arduous journey for anyone, let alone a Senator who has served so \nlong.\n  Senator, thank you for your service and for your example and \ncongratulations on your achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/22/senate-section/article/S10657-3", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10657-S10658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             MEDICARE CUTS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, at the moment, the final details of the \nDemocratic health care plan are largely unknown to the American people. \nThat is because those details are being worked out in private by a \nhandful of senior Democrats and White House officials, but we do know \nthe basics.\n  The Democratic bill will be about 1,500 pages long, it will cost $1 \ntrillion, it will raise insurance premiums and taxes, and it will slash \nMedicare for seniors by about $\\1/2\\ trillion over the next 10 years. \nThis much we know.\n  We also know where some of these cuts will be made. More than $120 \nbillion in Medicare cuts for hospitals that care for seniors; more than \n$130 billion in cuts to Medicare Advantage, a program for seniors; more \nthan $40 billion in cuts to home health agencies; and nearly $8 billion \nin cuts to hospice care. These are major cuts with serious \nconsequences.\n  Just yesterday I heard about some of these consequences when I met \nwith a group that represents hospices across Kentucky, including \nPhillip Marshall, from my hometown of Louisville, who explained the \nsituation. He told me these vital facilities depend on Medicare for \nmost of their costs and that they make up most of the rest through \ncharitable giving and through the generosity of many dedicated \nvolunteers. He also told me he has been following the debate in \nCongress, and he is concerned the proposed cuts he is hearing about \nwould have a serious effect on hospice care. He is not alone.\n  Last month, I received a letter from Brandy Cantor with the Kentucky \nAssociation of Hospice and Palliative Care. She told me about the \ntremendous emotional and spiritual support hospice care workers provide \neach year to thousands of Kentuckians at the end of their lives, and \nshe also told me that the cuts to these programs would have a \ndevastating effect on the good work these facilities do.\n\n  I got another letter last month from a Kentucky nurse named Victoria \nScarborough. She started out by telling me she supports health care \nreform, as we all do, and she wrote, with evident pride, about the \nexcellent care the caring people who work in her facility are able to \nprovide. To prove it, she related some of the comments she has received \nfrom patients. One hospice patient wrote that she didn't know what she \nwould have done without hospice. Another said she had been treated \n``with the utmost care, love, and concern.''\n  This is the kind of care everyone deserves and which we all hope our \nloved ones would receive during a serious illness. But according to Ms. \nScarborough, the hospice cuts currently being proposed would have a \nserious adverse effect on care.\n  I know the bill writers support the compassionate work that is \nprovided by hospice care across the country. By mentioning these \nletters, I don't mean to imply otherwise. But I do believe we need to \nbe aware of how these cuts will affect real people, and these are just \nthe cuts to hospice care, which represent only a fraction of the cuts \nthat are being proposed.\n  Some of my colleagues will speak today about the dangers of these \nMedicare cuts. They will also talk, as I have many times, about the \nwrongheadedness of using Medicare as a piggy bank to fund a further \nexpansion of government health care. We need to strengthen Medicare and \npreserve it for today's seniors and future generations, not slash it to \ncreate more programs that are bound to have the same fiscal problems \nMedicare, Medicaid, and Social Security already have.\n  I understand the problem of the bill writers. It is not easy to raise \n$1 trillion, particularly at a time when Americans are clamoring for a \nreduction of our record deficits and ballooning debt, but slashing \nMedicare is not the way to go.\n  Republicans have suggested another way, and that is commonsense, \nstep-\n\n[[Page S10658]]\n\nby-step reforms that address the problems at hand without raising \npremiums, raising taxes or cutting Medicare. Unfortunately, those \nproposals have been rejected.\n  As a result, the threat of these massive cuts to Medicare remains. \nThis is not the kind of health care reform America's seniors bargained \nfor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today the Senate Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee is holding a hearing to discuss the need \nto reform our Nation's outdated, underfunded, and overwhelmed food \nsafety system. The focus, of course, in Washington right now is on \nhealth care. I truly believe we need to get a health care reform bill \npassed, and I will speak at another time about Medicare costs which the \nRepublican leader addressed. It is my view that if we don't do anything \nto reform Medicare, we all know it is going in the red by 2017. We all \nknow that if we continue the path we are following--if we don't bring \nhigher quality standards into Medicare at lower costs--that is not good \nfor anyone. It is certainly not good for our seniors. So based on my \nhealth care experience in my State and knowing what our State needs, we \nwant to have that high-quality, low-cost focus, and that is what we are \nworking to do on this bill.\n  Today, I am here on another health matter; that is, the health of our \nfood safety system. The hearing today and recent actions by the \nadministration are good steps forward to ensure the safety of our food \nsupply, but more must be done. The time to act is now. Why is the time \nto act now? Well, look at what has been going on.\n  In the past few months, the recalls of peanut products, spinach, and \ncookie dough have shaken our confidence and trust in the food we eat. \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control, foodborne disease causes \nabout 76 million illnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths \nin the United States each year.\n  Last fall, hundreds of people across the country fell ill from \nsalmonella. In this case, the source was finally traced to a peanut \nprocessing plant in Georgia. In the meantime, nine people died from \nsalmonella poisoning, including three people in my home State, the \nState of Minnesota.\n  The first responsibility of government is to protect its citizens. As \nMembers of Congress, we must act quickly to pass tough new laws to \nstrengthen our food system to ensure the health and safety of the \nAmerican people. Americans spend more than $1 trillion on food every \nyear, and when families go to the grocery store or out to eat or \nwherever they are going to get a bite to eat, they shouldn't have to \nworry about getting sick from the food they eat.\n  I have joined with a bipartisan group of Senators to introduce the \nFood Safety Modernization Act of 2009, which would overhaul the Federal \nGovernment's food safety program. Other cosponsors include Dick Durbin, \nJudd Gregg, Richard Burr, Chris Dodd, Lamar Alexander, and Saxby \nChambliss. I wish to particularly thank Senator Durbin for his long-\ntime leadership on this issue.\n  Whenever contaminated food is allowed to reach consumers, public \ntrust in the integrity of our food supply and the effectiveness of our \ngovernment is undermined. Think about it. The three people who died in \nMinnesota, one was an elderly woman at a nursing home. She was in \nperfectly good shape. She had a little piece of toast with peanut \nbutter. That was it, a little piece of toast with peanut butter. In \ntalking to her son, I learned so much about her and what a courageous \nwoman she was. She ate one piece of toast with peanut butter.\n  This bill will give the Food and Drug Administration the tools and \nauthority for better inspections and a more responsive recall system. \nThe bill will also improve our capacity to prevent foodborne outbreaks \nby helping food companies develop a national strategy to protect our \nfood supply and allow the FDA greater access to facility records in a \nfood safety emergency.\n  Currently, the FDA does not have the resources to conduct annual \ninspections at the more than 150,000 food processing plants and \nwarehouses in the country. Our bill requires annual inspections at \nfacilities that pose the greatest risk to the American public and will \ngo a long way toward ensuring the protection of our Nation's food \nsupply. Think of it. Something such as a peanut butter facility, they \ndon't think they are ever going to be inspected, no one is going to be \nlooking, so they don't have that incentive every year to improve their \nfood processing capability. They don't have that incentive. They don't \nworry that anyone is watching over their shoulder because they are not.\n  This bill also takes steps to improve our capacity to detect and \nrespond to foodborne illness outbreaks, but I believe there is still \nmore that can and should be done. That is why, along with Senator \nChambliss, I have introduced the Food Safety Rapid Response Act.\n  This legislation focuses on the Centers for Disease Control, as well \nas State and local capability for responding to foodborne illnesses. \nThe recent outbreaks demonstrate that there needs to be better \ncoordination when responding to a food safety crisis. This legislation \nseeks to make these much needed improvements.\n  In the case of both the jalapeno pepper outbreak last year and the \npeanut butter outbreak earlier this year, people had been getting sick \nfor months before an advisory was issued. The breakthrough in \nidentifying the sources of contamination didn't come from the Centers \nfor Disease Control. Neither did the jalapeno pepper case, identified \nfirst as tomatoes, or the peanut butter case. It didn't come from the \nCDC or from the FDA, and it didn't come from the National Institutes of \nHealth.\n\n  The breakthrough in both outbreaks came from the work of the \nMinnesota Department of Health and the Minnesota Department of \nAgriculture, as well as collaborative efforts with the University of \nMinnesota School of Public Health. This initiative has earned a \nremarkable national reputation.\n  The Food Safety Response Act uses the exceptional work done in \nMinnesota as a national model for food safety. Why does someone have to \nget sick or die in Minnesota before a national outbreak is solved? They \nhave a team of graduate students who work together under the \nsupervision of the university and the department of health. They, \ntogether, figure out what is wrong. They make the calls together. They \nare like food detectives. Some people have called them ``team \ndiarrhea.'' They figure out what is wrong, what goes on in other \nStates. Sometimes a report in an individual county sits on a busy \nnurse's desk and they don't follow up on it for weeks and we are never \nable to piece together that information that figures out and solves the \nsource of the outbreak.\n  This bill would direct the CDC to enhance their foodborne \nsurveillance systems to improve the collection, analysis, reporting, \nand usefulness of data on foodborne systems, including better sharing \nof information among Federal, State, and local agencies, as well as \nwith the food industry and the public.\n  Second, it would direct the CDC to work with State-level agencies to \nimprove foodborne illness surveillance.\n  Finally, this legislation would establish food safety centers of \nexcellence. The goal is to set up regional food safety centers at \nselect public health departments and higher education institutions. \nThese collaborations would provide increased resources, training, and \ncoordination for State and local officials. In particular, they would \nseek to distribute food safety ``best practices'' so other States can \nfigure out how they can do this better so every food outbreak doesn't \nneed to have someone get sick or die in Minnesota before it gets \nsolved.\n  Think about it. The two recent food outbreaks only got solved in one \nState. We have to use that model nationally.\n  Dr. Osterholm, at the University of Minnesota, is a national food \nsafety expert and is credited with the creation of the Minnesota \nprogram. He said the\n\n[[Page S10659]]\n\ncreation of regional programs modeled on Minnesota ``would go a long \nway to providing precisely the real-time support for outbreak \ninvestigations at the State and local levels that is sorely needed.''\n  At today's hearing, the Food Marketing Institute stated that the Food \nSafety Response Act would ``better coordinate foodborne illness \nsurveillance systems and better support State laboratories in outbreak \ninvestigations with needed expertise.''\n  In Minnesota, we also have the benefit of working with strong leaders \nin the food industry, including SuperValu, Hormel, General Mills, and \nSchwann's. Their leadership has helped set national standards for food \nsafety and response to foodborne outbreaks. Public and private \ncollaboration is essential to improving our food safety response \nsystem.\n  The annual costs of medical care, lost productivity, and premature \ndeath due to foodborne illness is estimated to be $44 billion. There is \na lot at stake--both in terms of life and money. I believe we can do \nbetter.\n  As a former prosecutor, I have always believed the first \nresponsibility of a government is to protect its citizens. When people \nget sick or die from contaminated food, the government must take \naggressive and immediate action.\n  Congress must improve the FDA and bring it into the 21st century. I \nbelieve, together, the Food Safety Rapid Response Act and Food Safety \nModernization Act, which I have introduced with Senator Chambliss, will \nstrengthen food safety in our country and ultimately save both lives \nand money. We owe it to the American people to act quickly and pass \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/22/senate-section/article/S10659-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10659-S10660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEDICARE PHYSICIAN FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am here today to speak on legislation \non which we had a cloture vote last night, the Medicare Physician \nFairness Act.\n  I am here to express my disappointment and frustration that we did \nnot vote through a parliamentary procedure so we could debate the issue \nof what is facing physicians who provide treatment to Medicare \npatients.\n  Under the current situation, American doctors will face a 21.5-\npercent payment reduction in what they get from Medicare when they \ntreat Medicare patients. I think this is outrageous. Right now, we have \npeople who took TARP money and they are acting like twerps.\n  What they did is take the money. They don't lend the money, but they \nsure give themselves money with lavish compensation and bonuses. At the \nsame time, every single day, 24/7, there are doctors on the front line \nsaving lives, improving lives, and having people count on them. I am \nvery sorry they chose over a budget debate to vote to take it out on \ndoctors. We have to treat our doctors fairly for what they do and the \nsacrifices they make to do the job they do.\n  This is a 21.5-percent payment reduction. Imagine that. Imagine if we \nhad to take a 21-percent pay cut. Do you think we would have not voted \nfor cloture? I don't think so. We are forcing doctors to maybe close \ntheir doors to seniors, denying people access to the doctors they need \nand the doctors they should have. We cannot let this happen.\n  Every day, we ask the doctors treating our Medicare population to be \nunstinting in what they do. Then, when it turns around, the government \nis stingy. I think that is a double standard. We ask the people who \nprovide the hands-on services to be unstinting. Yet when it comes to \npaying them for what they do, we are pretty stingy. This is \nunacceptable.\n  As I said, we ask so much of our doctors. They need to be skilled, \nsmart, empathetic, and they need to be available 24/7. We ask them to \nhave the scientific understanding of a Nobel Prize winner and the \npatience and compassion of Mother Teresa. Our doctors assume tremendous \nresponsibility for life, the risk and accountability for making the \nright diagnosis, the right treatment, which is tailored for each unique \npatient. They follow us all the way through when something happens to \nus or comes up in our lives.\n  Our doctors look out for the aging population in our country. When \npeople get older, they have multiple problems, and sometimes the very \ntreatments contradict each other, requiring tremendous scientific skill \nand collaboration. When they treat older people, they need to take time \nto tell their story, their narrative. They don't go in just with a list \nof complaints.\n\n  I have heard my Medicare constituents say time and time again: I \ndon't know what I would do without my doctor. Our doctors are always \nthere for us, but are we there for them? Look at what they face.\n  First of all, in many instances, they are the first responders. They \nare there dealing with disease, trauma, and even death. For all the \nwork they do while they are trying to work with patients, they have to \nface a health care bureaucracy--public and private. What is the one \nthing the public and the private programs have in common? They have a \nbureaucracy.\n  Doctors tell me when they came into medicine, it was to make a \ndifference in patients' lives. But what do they run into? Hassle \nfactors, complicated administrative forms, preapprovals, and skimpy and \nspartan reimbursements, whether it is from private insurance or \nMedicare.\n  In this country, we need to start focusing on value care, not volume \ncare. Patients are grateful to their doctors, but Medicare \nreimbursement is important. All this work and this training is not \nrewarded for what doctors have to do. They have to work with a whole \nteam of nurses, social workers, pharmacists, and integrative health \nprofessionals. One of the things we should do is make sure they are \npaid fairly. For health professionals--that entire team I talked \nabout--their career is their calling.\n  Mr. President, I am going to share a personal anecdote on why I feel \nso strongly about this--not only because I chair the Subcommittee on \nAging, and not only because I have tried to be a champion for the older \npopulation throughout my public career. In July, I took a fall coming \nout of church after Mass. I broke my ankle in three places on that \nSunday afternoon. I was in absolute shock. As I tried to figure out \nwhat I would do, some of the people from church came to my rescue, and \nI was able to contact my primary care doctor. I had an ambulance there \npretty quickly and was taken to a downtown urban hospital--Mercy \nHospital. It truly, in every way, exemplifies the quality of mercy that \ncomes like a gentle drop.\n  On my way there, and what happened to me as I went into the ER--that \nemergency room was like what we see on TV, only this was no miniseries; \nthis was real life. The doctors at the hospital talked to me, and I \nspent time working with them as they treated me, got me through what I \nneeded to do. I was met by the ER doctor. I had x-rays; there was a \nradiologist there. There was my primary care doctor on the phone. There \nwas a gifted and talented orthopedic surgeon, who left his family at a \ncookout because the call of duty came, and he raced to be there. Was it \nfor Senator Barb? No. The people in the ER were doing the same thing \nfor everybody.\n  As I waited a few days for the swelling to go down, I had surgery \nwhich involved the anesthesiologist. I could go on and on.\n  When I look at all of the doctors who cared for me that day and in \nsubsequent weeks--the ER doctor, the radiologist, the anesthesiologist, \nthe orthopedic surgeon, my primary care doctor, and the cardiologist--\nthey were wonderful people at my side. They were people who graduated \nfrom college, who then had gone to medical school, at considerable \nstress and cost. They had gone through sophisticated residency \nprograms, and some even fellowships. They also participate in ongoing \ncontinuing medical education requirements. But they do it not because \nit is required but because they want to be tops in their field.\n  For all of that work and the responsibility they assume, we have to \nbe able to reimburse them. Mr. President, I have seen the health care \nsystem from the wheelchair up. I have seen people who provide the \nhealth care, and I have been in rooms getting physical therapy with \nothers who also need care. One of the things they are absolutely clear\n\n[[Page S10660]]\n\nabout is we need to look out for the people who take care of us as they \nlook out for us.\n  Today I am asking that we recognize the doctors for all that we ask \nof them--the knowledge they need, the risk they undertake, the high \ncost of their education, spending 12 years in training, being on call \n24/7, often being rushed from their families when they want to spend \ntime with them. I ask that we recognize those doctors by compensating \nthem justly and fairly and not treating them like a commodity. We also \nneed to do that for the nurses, social workers, physical and \noccupational therapists, integrative health people, and many others.\n  If we don't pass this Medicare Physician Fairness Act, we have real \nproblems. Failing to pass this bill is not an option. I think we need \nto do the right thing by the doctors, and I think we need to do the \nright thing by the people who need the doctors.\n  Let's do the right thing and pass the Medicare Physician Fairness \nAct.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, first impressions are important. \nDepending on one's age, we remember different things. When I was a \nyoung teenager, the first college football game was broadcast on a \ntelevision network. It was Tennessee versus Alabama with Lindsey \nNelson, who had gone to Tennessee, and Mel Allen, who had gone to the \nUniversity of Alabama, as the announcers. There have been a lot of good \nfootball games since that time, but everyone remembers the first \nbroadcast.\n  I can remember the first one-hour evening news program. I think it \nwas ``Huntley-Brinkley'' on NBC. There have been a lot of distinguished \nnewscasters before and since, but that was the first one-hour news \nprogram with two anchors.\n  I can remember watching basketball games and getting a glimpse of a \ncoach and forming an impression of the whole university from a short \nglimpse. An experience we've all had is meeting someone for the first \ntime and getting a first impression that is usually a fairly accurate \nimpression of that person. It usually lasts a long time, and it is hard \nto get over a first impression.\n  Yesterday was the first vote on health care reform. I think the \nAmerican people got a very strong first impression from that vote. What \nthe majority leader, the Democratic leader, sought to do was add $\\1/4\\ \ntrillion to the national debt on the first health care vote. The Senate \nsaid: No, we are not going to do that, even for a worthy cause, which \nin this case was fixing the doctors reimbursement procedure; which the \nSenator from Maryland just discussed and which we all agree needs to be \nattended to. But the Senate--all 40 Republicans, and 13 Democrats--said \nno, we are not going to start by adding $\\1/4\\ trillion to the national \ndebt on the first vote of health care reform. Especially not at a time \nwhen we just finished a year which added $1.4 trillion to the national \ndebt, three times as much as the year before, and as much as we added \nto the entire national debt in the first 200 years of the Republic.\n  People are very worried about the growth of the debt, and that was \nreflected yesterday in the first vote on health care reform. I think \nthat reminds us of the importance of reading the bill and knowing what \nit costs. That also is a bipartisan approach here. All the Republicans \nhave said we want to be able to read the bill and know what it costs \nbefore we start voting. And even though Senator Bunning's amendment, \nwhich would have allowed this, was voted down in the Finance Committee \nby Democrats, eight Democratic Senators wrote the Democratic leader and \nsaid: We agree; put the bill on the Internet, the complete text, for 72 \nhours and let's have a formal calculation of exactly what it costs \nbefore our first vote.\n  We had a first vote yesterday, even before we have a complete bill. \nBecause we had a chance to read this one provision and time to think \nabout it, we came to the right conclusion and voted it down.\n  In the next several months of discussion there will be many other \nissues such as this about how we reform health care. My view--and I \nthink the view of most Republicans and I believe most Americans--is to \nreduce costs. We have to reduce the cost of health care to our \ngovernment, otherwise it is going to go broke.\n  The President hosted a summit on entitlement spending early in the \nyear which I was invited to it. I appreciated receiving the invitation \nand I attended the summit. Everybody there said if we do not control \nhealth care spending, we are going to go broke as a government. Then \nmillions of Americans are saying: I cannot afford my own health care; \n250 million of us have a health care premium we pay or someone helps us \npay or some combination, and it is too expensive for individuals and \nfor small businesses. So our goal is to reduce the cost of health care \nto government and reduce the cost of health care to Americans. Yet our \nfirst vote yesterday was to increase the debt, and we said no.\n  Let's read this bill as it comes to us. Right now it is being written \nbehind closed doors in the majority leader's office. With such a \ncontroversial issue I am not sure that is the best way to go about \nwriting this bill. Usually it helps to have bipartisan support in the \nCongress, even if you have big majorities, so that you can get broad \nbipartisan support in the country any time you have a complex issue.\n  When I was a young Senate aide in 1968, we had a very controversial \nissue before the Senate called the civil rights bill. Lyndon Johnson \nwas President of the United States, and Everett Dirksen was the \nRepublican leader sitting over where Mitch McConnell sits today. The \nDemocratic majorities were bigger than they are today. President \nJohnson did not have the Democratic leader write the civil rights bill \nin a closed room in the Democratic leader's office. What did he do \ninstead? He was very wise. He had it written in the Republican leader's \noffice.\n  So in Senator Everett Dirksen's office for several weeks in 1968, I \nrecall, the bill was written in the full light of day, with Senators, \nstaff members, and hangers-on going in and out. In the end, the bill--\nmore difficult than this health care bill--passed. Senator Dirksen, the \nRepublican leader, got some of the credit. He deserved it. President \nJohnson got what he wanted. And the country supported it because it \nsaw, looking at Washington, DC, a broad level of support and they felt \nbetter about that.\n  I don't think people are going to feel as good about a bill that \nrestructures one-sixth of our economy, that affects every single \nAmerican's health, and the health care bill is being written behind \nclosed doors, in the Democratic leader's office. We will see. But at \nleast whatever emerges, we want to read the bill. We want the American \npeople to be able to read the bill. And we want to know exactly what it \ncosts before we go ahead.\n  For example, what is it going to do to Medicare? The Republican \nleader has talked about that issue. If the concept paper is any \nindication we know what it is going to do to Medicare. It is going to \ncut Medicare by $\\1/2\\ trillion to pay for a new entitlement program.\n  Some of my friends on the other side say: You are scaring seniors \nwhen you say that. It may be scaring seniors, but it is the truth. This \nbill, when implemented, is going to cost $1.8 trillion and $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion is going to come from Medicare cuts. We are going to be \ncutting grandma's Medicare to spend on somebody other than grandma--a \nnew entitlement program.\n  We are doing that at a time when the Medicare Program, the program \nthat serves more than 40 million older Americans, is going broke. We \nneed to be careful in the Senate not to overstate issues. So let's not \ntake my word for it. The Medicare trustees say that the Medicare \nProgram, upon which more than 40 million seniors rely, is going to run \nout of money between 2015 and 2017. That is not too far away. The\n\n[[Page S10661]]\n\nMedicare trustees--it is their job to watch out for these things--said:\n\n       We need timely and effective action to address Medicare \n     financial challenges.\n\n  I think what they are saying to us is if you are going to cut \ngrandma's Medicare, you ought to at least spend it on grandma instead \nof spending it on somebody else. That is basically what we are doing. \nWe are cutting Medicare $500 billion, and instead of spending it to \nstrengthen the Medicare Program, the proposal is to spend it to create \na new entitlement program.\n  What are the cuts? Nearly $140 billion in Medicare Advantage; $150 \nbillion in cuts for hospitals that care for seniors; $40 billion for \nhome health agencies; and $8 billion from hospices.\n  The President said that people who are currently signed up for \nMedicare Advantage are going to have Medicare at the same level of \nbenefits. That is why we need to read the bill and know what it costs \nbecause something has been lost in translation between what the \nPresident said and what appears to actually be in the bill. The \nDirector of the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office, said in testimony that fully half of the \nbenefits currently provided to seniors under Medicare Advantage would \ndisappear in the Baucus proposal. The same Baucus proposal which is \nbeing amended and written and merged with other bills behind closed \ndoors in the Democratic leader's office. The head of the Congressional \nBudget Office said the changes would reduce extra benefits such as \ndental, vision, hearing coverage, that would be available to \nbeneficiaries. Humana advised its customers who are Medicare Advantage \nbeneficiaries that their benefits would be cut, causing the Obama \nadministration to put a gag order on this large health care \norganization.\n\n  I made a little speech on the floor yesterday talking about the \ndangers of developing an enemies list, of boycotting television \nnetworks, of calling out Senators with whom you disagree, taking the \nnames of bondholders who do not go along with the General Motors or \nChrysler bailout, threatening an insurance company for switching from \nsupporting your proposal to opposing your proposal or a large health \ncare company that tells its customers the truth--your Medicare \nAdvantage is going to be cut.\n  Another reason to read the bill is the provision that will make \nadditional cuts to Medicare above and beyond the $500 billion that is \nspecified. At least that is the assumption of the Congressional Budget \nOffice when it looked over the bill and said that it was in balance, \nwhich it has turned out not to be.\n  The Congressional Budget Office assumed that a Medicare commission \nwould make even more Medicare cuts. Those do not seem to be realistic \nassumptions. We have had a provision in law since 2003 that would \nprovide an automatic mechanism for making Medicare cuts. Nobody has \never wanted to use it.\n  We saw what happened yesterday, recognizing that it was unrealistic \nto expect that doctors would take a 21-percent cut in their pay in a \nyear. The Democratic leader tried to borrow $\\1/4\\ trillion to try to \ntake care of that problem.\n  If we read the bill and now what it costs we find out that either \ndoctors are going to pay for a big part of this new Medicare Program or \nseniors are going to pay for a big part of it or our grandchildren are \ngoing to pay for a big part of it by increasing the debt. The \nWashington Post said this was a shell game.\n  I think the lesson here is first impressions count. We got a good \nfirst impression yesterday of the direction of this health care bill. \nThe proposal was: Let's borrow $\\1/4\\ trillion, and the Senate, in a \nbipartisan way, said: We are not going to do that, no. That was the \ncorrect vote.\n  Now we see another reason to read the bill is because we want to make \nsure we know what it does to Medicare. What we have seen so far is that \nit will cut grandma's Medicare by $\\1/2\\ trillion, not to spend on \ngrandma but to spend on some somebody else, even though the Medicare \nProgram, its trustees say, will go broke in the year 2015 to the year \n2017. That is one more good reason not just to read the bill but to \nstart over in this health care reform.\n  We have been saying on the Republican side for months that we should \nnot be trying to do this comprehensive, full-of-surprises, trillion-\ndollar health care reform, that restructures one-sixth of our economy, \nin the middle of the greatest recession we have had since the 1930s. We \nshould focus instead on reducing the costs of health care to the \ngovernment and to Americans who pay for premiums, and go step by step \nto re-earn the trust of the American people to reduce costs. We \nsuggested how to do that. We would start by allowing small businesses \nto come together, pool their resources, and offer insurance to their \nemployees. It has been estimated that would produce at least coverage \nfor 1 million more Americans and probably many million more Americans.\n  Second, we have suggested saving money by reducing the number of junk \nlawsuits against doctors which drive up the cost of health care.\n  Third, we have suggested allowing insurance to be sold across State \nlines. That creates more competition that should reduce costs.\n  We have suggested creating health insurance exchanges--many of our \nDemocratic friends agree with that--to make it easier to shop for \nhealth care. We have suggested enrolling individuals in existing \nprograms. There are up to 11 million people who are already eligible \nfor programs that we now have, and that is one way to add people \nwithout increasing cost in a huge way, or creating a great new program. \nWe have suggested incentivizing health care technology, changing tax \nincentives, and expanding health savings accounts. These are steps we \ncan take to reduce costs.\n  It appears many of the American people agree with that Republican \nstrategy. A new Gallup poll out yesterday said that 58 percent of \nAmericans would generally prefer to see Congress deal with health care \nreform on a gradual basis--over several years--rather than to try to \npass a comprehensive health care reform bill this year.\n  So first impressions count.\n  The health care debate was defined yesterday by the attempt to borrow \n$\\1/4\\ trillion to add to the debt. I am glad it failed. The health \ncare debate, as the President himself said, is actually a proxy for a \nlarger debate about the role of our Federal Government in American \nlife. Increasingly, Americans are skeptical of this comprehensive \ntrillion-dollar-plus, full-of-surprises proposal that is being written \nin the back room approach. Instead they hope we will focus clearly on \nreducing the cost of health care premiums, reducing the cost to our \ngovernment, and then going step by step in the right direction to make \nhealth care affordable for all Americans.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kirk). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank again my colleague from \nTennessee for the great work he has been doing on the issue of health \ncare and the many other leadership issues. There are a lot of things \ngoing on. There are a lot of moving parts in the health care reform \ndebate situation.\n  I would like for us, however, to maybe pause and look back for a \nsecond as to what we heard and what has actually been going on. First, \nwe heard the President say that if you like the insurance you have, you \ncan keep it, period. Increasing mandates on employers, who today have \ndifficulty affording health care coverage, and cutting Medicare by $500 \nbillion will ensure that millions of Americans will not be able to keep \nthe coverage they have today. CBO and common sense tell us this. \nAccording to CBO, 3 million fewer Americans will be covered under \nemployer health plans; and further, millions of seniors may lose the \nMedicare plan they have and that they want to keep. That is called \nMedicare Advantage.\n  We also heard the President say that he won't support legislation \nthat increases the deficit one dime. We now know that is not true. We \nsaw yesterday an attempt at incredible gimmickry to do away with $247 \nbillion worth of debt that would have been associated with health care. \nObviously, it is a way to get around the $\\1/4\\ trillion increase in \nthe cost of health care that would have accrued if we had kept doing \nwhat we are doing. We all know that the true implementation cost of\n\n[[Page S10662]]\n\nthe proposal in the Senate Finance Committee is $1.8 trillion, once you \nlook at the real numbers.\n  One of the more entertaining aspects of the protestations of cost \nsavings is the approach that all of these bills take to medical \nmalpractice reform. There is none. There is none. Before the joint \nsession of Congress several weeks ago the President even referenced a \ngrand initiative, that he was going to support medical malpractice \nreform. Consequently, we found out the announcement was that the \nadministration was going to--get this; I am not making it up--the \nPresident was going to accept grant applications for demonstration \nprograms. I say to the President and to my colleagues, there are \nalready demonstration programs: One is called Texas and the other is \ncalled California. They have enacted medical malpractice reform and it \nhas saved incredible amounts of money. CBO now estimates that real \nmedical malpractice reforms can save the health care system $54 billion \nover the next 10 years. Real medical malpractice reform can save as \nmuch as $200 billion.\n  My favorite example so far--and then we politicians wonder sometimes \nwhy the American people are a little cynical about the things we \npromise and the things we commit to during political campaigns; that we \nare going to do A, B and C and you can count on it, et cetera. My \nfavorite so far is when the President was running for office. Three \nmonths before he was elected, President Obama vowed not only to reform \nhealth care but also to pass the legislation in an unprecedented way. \nHe said:\n\n       I'm going to have all the negotiations around a big table.\n\n  He said that at an appearance in Chester, VA, repeating an assertion \nhe had made many times. In referring to the debate on health care, he \nsaid the discussions would be--\n\n       . . . televised on C-SPAN, so that people can see who is \n     making arguments on behalf of their constituents and who are \n     making arguments on behalf of the drug companies or the \n     insurance companies.\n\n  Well, maybe the administration and the majority leader don't know \nwhere the C-SPAN cameras are. I can get them outside of Senator Reid's \noffice at a moment's notice. In fact, they are televising this. I want \nto repeat what the President of the United States promised the American \npeople specifically on health care reform. He said the discussions \nwould be--\n\n       . . . televised on C-SPAN, so that people can see who is \n     making the arguments on behalf of their constituents and who \n     are making arguments on behalf of the drug companies or the \n     insurance companies.\n\n  It might be a little late for the drug companies. They have already \ncut a sweetheart deal with the drug companies. They have agreed to \noppose importation of drugs from Canada and oppose competition amongst \ndrug companies for Medicare patient recipients in return for some $80 \nbillion in supposed savings over 10 years, and $100-some million worth \nof advertising by the drug companies in favor of health care reform. I \nam not making it up.\n  President Obama also said he didn't want to be--\n\n       . . . negotiating behind closed doors but bringing all \n     parties together and broadcasting those negotiations on C-\n     SPAN so the American people can see what the choices are. \n     Because, part of what we have to do is enlist the American \n     people in this process.\n\n  The last I saw, they were trying to enlist the AMA by doing a $247 \nbillion unpaid for deal so that they could buy their support. They \nbought the drug companies. They couldn't buy the health insurance \ncompanies, so now they are going to retaliate against them by removing \ntheir antitrust exemptions.\n  One thing I have to say for this administration, they know how to \nplay hardball. They know how to play hardball. But they also don't seem \nto care about the commitments that the President made during his \ncampaign for the Presidency.\n  I see my colleague is here--Senator Barrasso--and he wants to speak \nalso, but I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, the \nAmerican people are tired of this behind-closed-doors dealmaking, deal \ncutting, which none of us on this side of the aisle have had anything \nto do with and very few on the other side of the aisle. They are doing \na multi-trillion-dollar deal which will affect the future and the lives \nof 300 million Americans eventually. It is not right. This process is \nnot right.\n  The process they should be going through is exactly the one that the \nPresident promised the American people when he was running for \nPresident of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/22/senate-section/article/S10662-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CLEAN AIR PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a bill I have \nintroduced called the Clean Air Protection Act.\n  Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson has stated \nthat she believes the Clean Air Act was not specifically designed to \naddress greenhouse gases. She also says using the Clean Air Act to \nregulate climate change raises serious concerns.\n  I agree with her completely. So then what was the EPA's response to \nthe problem? Well, they developed a tailored interpretation of the \nClean Air Act where they ignore certain provisions of the law. This \ntailored interpretation is actually called the tailoring rule. The \ntailoring rule is EPA's attempt to limit the scope of the Clean Air \nAct--limit it to only those businesses that emit 25,000 tons of \ngreenhouse gases. That is 100 times more than the amount of emissions \nthat are currently allowed by law.\n  Saying that the EPA will only limit emissions from large businesses \nis not allowed under the current law--the Clean Air Act. So if you are \ngoing to use the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions for \nAmerican businesses, you have to use the standard that Congress has set \nout in the act. The EPA's approach is not legal, and I can tell you it \nwill be challenged in court.\n  I alerted EPA Administrator Jackson and the EPA Assistant \nAdministrator Regina McCarthy that special interest groups are scheming \nto sue the EPA. Suits will be filed if the EPA does not follow the \nClean Air Act limits--sue them to capture hospitals, farms, nursing \nhomes, commercial buildings, and any other small emitters of greenhouse \ngases.\n  I put a hold on Regina McCarthy at the time she was the nominee to be \nthe Assistant Administrator of the EPA Office of Air and Radiation. I \ndid this because of my concern about lawsuits if the EPA attempted to \nuse the Clean Air Act to regulate climate change. I wanted to know what \nthe EPA's solution to the problem would be. When asked about potential \nlawsuits, Regina McCarthy said that she will--\n\n       . . . request that I be informed if any such notice is \n     filed with regard to a small source, and I will follow up \n     with potential litigants.\n\n  That is the EPA's solution, to sit down over a cup of coffee and ask \nlawyers for special interest groups not to sue. Groups know the law. \nThey know what it says. The EPA Administrator is opening the door to \nenvironmentalists and other activists to file suit--to sue to run small \nbusinesses into the ground. Up to 1.2 million hospitals, farms, nursing \nhomes, commercial buildings, and other small emitters could be \nbankrupt. The net result of all of this will be jobs lost. According to \nthe Heritage Foundation, job losses are estimated to reach 800,000.\n  The solution to this problem is not to have government officials go \naround asking litigants not to sue; the solution is to pass legislation \nthat takes this regulatory ticking timebomb off the table for good. \nThat is why I have introduced legislation to fix the problem. The bill, \nS. 1622--the Clean Air Protection Act--takes the Clean Air Act out of \nthe business of regulating climate change. My legislation allows car \nand truck regulations under the Clean Air Act to move forward, while \nstopping the regulation of stationary sources, such as small \nbusinesses, hospitals, farms, and nursing homes.\n  Given the introduction of the tailoring rule by the EPA, Congress \nshould pass S. 1622, the Clean Air Protection Act, without delay, pass \nit before the regulatory ticking timebomb goes off.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/22/senate-section/article/S10662-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10662-S10663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXTENSION OF UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the Reid-\nBaucus-\n\n[[Page S10663]]\n\nShaheen amendment to H.R. 3548, which is the unemployment benefits \nextension bill.\n  I very much regret that the majority leader has had to file a cloture \nmotion on a motion to proceed to even consider that issue. To my mind, \nthis should not be a partisan issue. There ought to be agreement in \nthis body that we should proceed to extend unemployment benefits given \nthe circumstances we face.\n  The job market in my home State of New Mexico is dismal, and there is \nvery little indication of improvement expected in the near future. New \nMexico's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is modest compared to \nsome States. It was only 7.5 percent in August of 2009, but that is up \nfrom 7 percent in July and up from 4.3 percent a year ago. The trend is \ndefinitely disturbing. The decline in the number of jobs is the worst \nthe State has seen in more than 45 years--with the speed with which we \nhave been losing jobs.\n\n  The pain of unemployment is being felt across the country. More than \n5 million Americans have been unemployed for 6 months or more, and 2 \nmillion of these workers face the end of their unemployment benefits \nbefore the end of this year. There are up to 4,000 New Mexicans who \nwill exhaust their unemployment benefits by December 2009. The total \nnumber of unemployed and underemployed--including those who are working \ntwo or three part-time jobs to try to make ends meet and those who have \ngiven up looking for work--approaches 17 percent of our workforce. \nThese are not just numbers, obviously. These are real people who face \neach day with the dread of not knowing how they are going to pay for \nthe groceries they need that week or their mortgage payment or their \nrent payment.\n  The stimulus funding Congress passed earlier this year has helped to \nslow job losses, and it has created some new jobs, especially in \neducation and in government services more generally. New Mexico's \nstimulus funding, alone, is expected to create about 22,000 jobs this \nyear. This has had a significantly positive impact on the State's \nunemployment picture, but it is still not enough to fully address the \nneeds created by the economic situation in which we find ourselves. \nNationwide, for every job opening, there are six applicants. I was \nstruck by the article on the front page of the New York Times this \nmorning entitled ``$13 an Hour? 500 Sign Up, 1 Wins a Job.'' This was \ndatelined Burns Harbor, IN. It says:\n\n       As soon as the job opening was posted, on the afternoon of \n     Friday, July 10, the deluge began.\n       C.R. England, a nationwide trucking company, needed an \n     administrative assistant for its bustling driver training \n     school here [in Indiana]. Responsibilities included data \n     entry, assembling paperwork and making copies.\n\n  It goes on to quote the head of corporate recruiting. It says:\n\n       When Stacey Ross, C.R. England's head of corporate \n     recruiting, arrived at her desk at the company's Salt Lake \n     City headquarters the next Monday, she found about 300 \n     applications in the company''s e-mail inbox. And the fax \n     machine had spit out an inch-and-a-half thick stack of \n     resumes before running out of paper.\n\n  The article goes on to point out the estimate is there were 500 \napplications filed for this 1 job, a $13-an-hour job, but they took \ndown the posting of the availability of the job.\n  We have a very serious problem that needs addressing. The extension \nof unemployment benefits will not ease the worry of the unemployed. It \nwill not eliminate the dread they have about the need to pay bills each \nmonth. But it will make things a little bit easier for some of those \nindividuals. Extension will make it easier, not just for the direct \nrecipients but for the larger economy as well. Economists tell us that \nfor every $1 in unemployment benefits the government provides, $2.15 is \ngenerated throughout the economy. These economic benefits are felt most \nimmediately, as benefit recipients use the funds almost immediately to \nmeet their daily needs.\n  The legislation the majority leader has filed, the petition to \nproceed to it, takes a responsible approach to providing these \nadditional funds. The extension is paid for with an 18-month extension \nof the Federal unemployment tax, which has traditionally been used, \nboth by Republicans and by Democratic administrations, for this very \npurpose. The extension is a responsible, well-thought-out response to \nthe dire circumstances many Americans find themselves in today.\n  As I said at the beginning, this should not be a partisan issue. \nUnemployment is affecting everyone, regardless of their political party \nor their ideology. I urge the Senate to set aside partisan politics and \nto agree to the majority leader's request that we proceed to this bill \nso we can quickly provide assistance to the thousands of Americans who \ndepend upon these benefits as they continue to search for jobs.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Under the previous order, there will be 1 hour \nfor debate, equally divided and controlled between the Senator from \nMichigan, Mr. Levin, and the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain.\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the conference report on H.R. 2647, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, would fully \nfund the fiscal year 2010 budget request of $680 billion for national \nsecurity activities in the Department of Defense and the Department of \nEnergy. This bill is the product of months of hard work by our \ncommittee, culminating in more than 6 weeks of negotiations with our \nHouse counterparts. I thank all of the members of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee for the commitment they have shown to the best \ninterests of our men and women of our Armed Forces. I want to \nparticularly thank Senator McCain, our ranking minority member, for his \ngreat work throughout the conference. It has been a real pleasure to \nwork side-by-side with Senator McCain as we worked through issues with \nour counterparts from the House of Representatives.\n  I also want to thank the chairman of the House Armed Services \nCommittee, Ike Skelton, and his ranking minority member, Buck McKeon, \nfor the cooperative spirit with which they worked with us throughout \nthe conference.\n  This conference report contains many important provisions that will \nimprove the quality of life of our men and women in uniform, provide \nneeded support and assistance to our troops on the battlefield in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, make the investments we need to meet the challenges of \nthe 21st century, and require needed reforms in the management of the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  First and foremost, the bill before us continues the increases in \ncompensation and quality of life that our service men and women and \ntheir families deserve as they face the hardships imposed by continuing \nmilitary operations around the world. For example, the bill contains \nprovisions that would authorize a 3.4 percent across-the-board pay \nraise for all uniformed military personnel--a half a percent more than \nthe budget request and the annual rate of inflation; increase the \nArmy's active-duty end strength by nearly 30,000, and authorize an \nadditional\n\n[[Page S10664]]\n\n30,000 increase during fiscal years 2011 and 2012, if the Secretary of \nDefense deems it necessary to increase dwell time and reduce the stress \ncreated by repeated deployments; authorize payment of over 25 types of \nbonuses and special pays aimed at encouraging enlistment, reenlistment, \nand continued service by active-duty and reserve military personnel; \nextend the limitation on charges for inpatient care in a civilian \nhospital under TRICARE Standard; enhance the ability of military voters \nto vote by absentee ballot; increase the authorization for the \nHomeowners Assistance Program by almost $300 million to provide relief \nto homeowners in the armed forces who are required to relocate because \nof base closures or change of station orders; and increase the maximum \namount of supplemental subsistence allowance from $500 to $1,100 per \nmonth to ensure that service members and their families do not have to \nbe dependent on food stamps.\n  The conference report also includes a number of provisions to support \nthe civilian workforce of the Department of Defense. For example, the \nbill contains provisions that would: provide for the application of \nunused sick leave toward length of service for purposes of computing a \nretirement annuity under the Federal Employee Retirement System; phase \nin locality comparability pay in place of cost of living allowances for \nFederal civilian employees working in Hawaii, Alaska, and other \nnonforeign U.S. territories, so that they are treated the same as \nfederal employees in other States; terminate the National Security \nPersonnel System--NSPS--and replace it with a provision that provides a \nseries of personnel flexibilities applicable to the entire civilian \nworkforce of the Department of Defense and an opportunity for the \nSecretary to propose additional flexibilities; freeze the Defense \nCivilian Intelligence Personnel System--DCIPS--until an independent \nreview can be completed; and authorize the Secretary of Defense to \nestablish a new Defense Civilian Leadership Program to help recruit, \ntrain, and retain highly qualified civilian employees to help lead the \nDepartment of Defense over the next 20 years.\n  The conference report also includes important funding and authorities \nneeded to provide our troops the equipment and support that they will \ncontinue to need as long as they remain on the battlefield in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. For example, the bill contains provisions that would \nprovide $6.7 billion for the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected--MRAP--\nVehicle Fund, including an increase of $1.2 billion above the \nPresident's budget request for MRAP All-Terrain Vehicles--M-ATV--which \nare deploying to Afghanistan; add $100 million for unfunded \nrequirements identified by the Commander of Special Operations Command, \nincluding MC-130 airships to provide improved fire support for our \nground forces in Afghanistan and Iraq; provide full funding for the \nJoint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization--JIEDDO--to \ncontinue the development and deployment of technologies to defeat these \nattacks; provide nearly $7.5 billion to train and equip the Afghan \nNational Army and the Afghan National Police, so that they can begin to \ncarry more of the burden of defending their country against the \nTaliban; and authorize up to $1.3 billion for the Commanders' Emergency \nResponse Program--CERP--in Iraq and Afghanistan for humanitarian relief \nand reconstruction projects that directly benefit local communities, \nincluding up to $50.0 million to support the Afghanistan National \nSolidarity Program to promote Afghan-led community development.\n\n  The bill would implement almost all of the budget recommendations \nmade by the Secretary of Defense to terminate troubled programs and \napply the savings to higher priority activities of the Department. For \nexample, the bill would end production of the F-22 fighter after 187 \naircraft; terminate the Air Force Combat Search and Rescue X--CSAR-X--\nhelicopter program; terminate the VH-71 Presidential helicopter; end \nproduction of the C-17 airlifter program; cancel the manned ground \nvehicle portion of the Army's Future Combat Systems program, with \nassurances those funds will be available for the newly designed vehicle \nportion--ground vehicle portion; terminate the Multiple Kill Vehicle \nprogram; cancel the Kinetic Energy Interceptor and we cancel the second \nAirborne Laser prototype aircraft.\n  Finally, the bill contains a number of provisions that will help \nimprove the management of the Department of Defense and other Federal \nagencies. For example, the bill contains provisions that would enhance \nthe ability of the DOD inspector general to conduct audits and \ninvestigations by authorizing the IG to subpoena witnesses to provide \ntestimony; improve DOD financial management by requiring the Department \nto engage in business process reengineering before acquiring new \ninformation technology systems and submit regular reports on its \nprogress toward auditable financial statements; require the Department \nto develop a comprehensive plan to address longstanding problems in its \ninventory management systems, which lead it to acquire and store \nhundreds of millions of dollars worth of unneeded items; place a \nmoratorium on public-private competitions under OMB Circular A-76 until \nthe Department complies with existing statutory planning and budget \nrequirements relevant to such competitions; and streamline and \nrestructure DOD management positions by eliminating 22 of the 28 \ncurrent Deputy Under Secretary of Defense positions and requiring the \nDepartment to develop a new organizational plan within 6 months.\n  The conference report incorporates two pieces of legislation from in \nthe Senate-passed bill: the Military Commissions Act of 2009 and the \nMatthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.\n  The Military Commissions Act of 2009 would replace, and dramatically \nimprove, the procedures enacted in the Military Commissions Act of \n2006. In its 2006 decision in the Hamdan case, the Supreme Court held \nthat Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions applies to the \nGuantanamo detainees and requires that the trial of those detainees be \nconducted in a manner consistent with the procedures applicable in \ntrials by courts-martial.\n  The Supreme Court concluded that this requirement ``is not an \ninflexible one; it does not preclude all departures from the procedures \ndictated for use by courts martial. But any departure must be tailored \nto the exigency that necessitates it.''\n  The Military Commissions Act of 2006 created a cloud over the use of \nmilitary commissions because it failed to live up to that standard. The \nconference report would address this problem by, one, precluding the \nuse of coerced testimony; two, limiting the use of hearsay testimony; \nthree, establishing new procedures for handling classified information \nsimilar to procedures applicable in civilian courts; four, providing \ndefendants with fairer access to witnesses and documentary evidence; \nand five, requiring the defendant to be provided with appropriate \nrepresentation and adequate resources.\n  The Military Commissions Act of 2009 is intended to meet the standard \nimposed by the Supreme Court's ruling in Hamdan and should help ensure \nthat convictions obtained through military commissions will hold up on \nappeal and will be perceived as fair by the American public and by the \nrest of the world.\n  I thank Senators McCain and Graham as well as the lawyers at the \nWhite House, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Justice, \nwho worked with us and for the great effort they put into this \nprovision.\n  The conference report incorporates the Hate Crimes Prevention Act. \nSimilar provisions have been previously adopted by both the Senate and \nthe House of Representatives. This legislation is intended to help \ndeter people from being targeted for violent attacks because of race, \nreligion, disability, gender, or sexual orientation, among other \naspects. The Senate adopted the hate crimes legislation when we adopted \nthe Defense Authorization Act, and it was kept in conference. The House \nof Representatives has now adopted the conference report, and so it is \nnow hopefully going to be before us after a cloture vote.\n  The hate crimes legislation includes, for the first time, a provision \nthat makes it a Federal crime to attack a member of the U.S. Armed \nForces on account of his or her military service--a hate crime that is \nof particular interest to the armed services.\n\n[[Page S10665]]\n\n  According to the FBI, the trend is up for hate crimes based on sexual \norientation. There has been a 6-percent increase in such crimes in the \nmost recent year for which statistics are available, which is the year \n2006. This is a category of hate crimes that would be covered for the \nfirst time by this bill.\n  The language has been written to ensure it does not intrude on first \namendment rights, that State and local law enforcement retain the \nprimary jurisdiction over investigations and prosecutions.\n  We all know Senator Kennedy was long the Senate's leading advocate \nfor hate crimes legislation. As he said when the Senate debated and \npassed this legislation in 2007:\n\n       America has taken many steps throughout our history on a \n     long road to becoming a more inclusive Nation, and our \n     diversity is one of our greatest strengths. Our tolerance for \n     each other's differences is part of the lamp that can help \n     bring light to a world which is enveloped in bigotry and \n     intolerance.\n\n  The enactment of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act through this, which \nis the last National Defense Authorization Act in which Senator Kennedy \nparticipated in his 26 years of service on the Armed Services \nCommittee, would be a fitting tribute to one of the truly great \nSenators in the history of this body.\n  Finally, I thank Senator Leahy for the leadership role he has played \non this issue in his capacity as chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  As of today, we have almost 130,000 U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen, \nand marines on the ground. Over the course of the next fiscal year, we \nwill undertake the difficult task of drawing down these numbers--these \nare numbers in Iraq--while maintaining security and stability on the \nground. At the same time, we have dramatically increased our forces in \nAfghanistan, with more than 60,000 engaged in increasingly active \ncombat and combat-support operations, with more on the way.\n  This conference report includes numerous provisions that need to go \ninto effect immediately to ensure that they benefit our troops \nimmediately. These provisions cannot be implemented before this \nconference report is enacted but will go into effect, without the need \nfor appropriations, immediately upon enactment.\n  They include the following in the area of compensation and benefits. \nThe conference report includes provisions that would prevent the \nimplementation of large increases in the copayments military retirees \nmust pay for in-patient care at civilian hospitals under the TRICARE \nProgram; provisions which would authorize new special compensation for \ncaregivers of catastrophically injured servicemembers; and a provision \nwhich will increase the maximum amount of supplemental subsistence \nallowance to ensure servicemembers do not have to rely on food stamps \nto meet their nutritional needs. Those important provisions and others \nwhich I am going to now talk about will not go into effect until this \nconference report is enacted.\n  With regard to our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, the conference \nreport includes provisions that will immediately go into effect without \nthe need for appropriations.\n  For instance, there is a provision which would authorize the \nSecretary of Defense to transfer defense equipment that would otherwise \nbe withdrawn from Iraq and transfer it to the security forces of Iraq \nand Afghanistan, their national forces. The use of that equipment by \nthose national forces in Iraq and Afghanistan will assist in the \ntransfer of security responsibilities to the Iraqi forces and the \ngrowth of the Afghan Army and police forces more quickly.\n  Another provision which will go into effect immediately upon \nenactment would allow the Secretary of Defense to use funds from the \nCERP in Afghanistan to pay for reintegration programs to separate local \nTaliban fighters from their leaders. This is a new program modeled on \nthe Sons of Iraq Program which was so successful in getting large \nnumbers of young Iraqis who had been attacking us to switch sides and \nsupport the government. These are two programs which I think people \nstrongly support regardless of their position on the question of \nstrategy and the troop levels. Those provisions will make it possible, \nimmediately upon enactment, to use funds to support the reintegration \nof those young Afghans into their civilian life, just the way we did \nwith the Sons of Iraq.\n  This provision will permit the shipping of equipment that is so \nimportant to strengthen the Afghan Army and police from Iraq instead of \nbringing it home. These are critically urgent provisions, particularly \nin Afghanistan.\n  Another provision, as soon as a conference report is enacted, would \npermit the Secretary of Defense to use up to $500 million in operations \nand maintenance funds to meet urgent military construction needs of the \ncommander of the Central Command in Iraq and Afghanistan that were not \npreviously forecast. But these new authorities are not there until the \nconference report is enacted.\n  As I mentioned earlier, this bill includes the Military Commissions \nAct of 2009, which is needed to make trial of detainees by military \ncommissions a viable alternative to trial in Federal court. Until it is \nenacted, any conviction obtained before a military commission will be \nat serious risk of being overturned on appeal. For that reason, the \nadministration has suspended all military commission trials until this \nlanguage goes into effect.\n  We have enacted a defense authorization bill every year for almost 50 \nyears now. We have done so because Members of Congress have understood, \non a bipartisan basis, the importance of supporting our troops and \nmaking the policy decisions that are necessary to support them. This \nyear is no different.\n  With almost 200,000 men and women of the Armed Forces currently \nserving in Iraq and Afghanistan and many more supporting them and \nengaging in other demanding activities on our behalf and their behalf \naround the world, we cannot afford not to enact this legislation.\n  For all these reasons, I would urge our colleagues to vote for \ncloture on the conference report and then to adopt the conference \nreport itself.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Today, the Senate begins consideration of the conference report to \naccompany this year's national defense authorization bill providing our \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and their families with the support \nthey need and deserve. This is a responsibility I do not take lightly, \nespecially during a time of war. It is a responsibility my good friend \nand colleague Senator Levin understands very well. I thank and commend \nSenator Levin for his skill in shepherding this bill through the \nconference process in a bipartisan fashion. I thank Senator Levin for \nhis leadership. I thank him for his commitment to the men and women who \nare serving in the military and the long relationship we have enjoyed \nworking together as colleagues in that effort.\n  The conference report largely supports the defense priorities laid \nout by Secretary Gates and authorizes over $550 billion in base program \nfunding for the Department of Defense and the national security \nprograms of the Department of Energy.\n  Additionally, the legislation authorizes over $129 billion in \noverseas contingency operations funding for ongoing activities in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, Pakistan, and other regional operations and support of the \nwar on terrorism.\n  The conference report demonstrates our bipartisan support for the men \nand women of the Armed Forces and their families and provides them with \nthe pay, benefits, equipment, and training they need and deserve.\n  The report increases benefits for our wounded warriors and provides \nan across-the-board pay raise for our military.\n  The report terminates production of the F-22 aircraft, contains no \nfunding for additional C-17 cargo aircraft, provides full funding for \nprocurement of 30 Joint Strike Fighters, and fully authorizes funding \nto train and equip the Afghan National Army and police forces.\n  I am disappointed that we are unable to eliminate funding for the \ncontinued development of the alternative engine for the Joint Strike \nFighter. As Secretary Gates said, ``This program is unnecessary and \ncould disrupt the overall\n\n[[Page S10666]]\n\nJSF Program by diverting resources away from efforts needed for the \ncontinuation of that program.''\n  During the more than 20 years Senator Levin and I have worked \ntogether, we have had our share of respectful disagreements, and this \nyear is no exception. I strongly disagree with the majority's decision \nto include hate crimes legislation in the national defense \nauthorization bill. I have consistently opposed attaching hate crimes \nlegislation to the national defense authorization bill in years past. \nThis year, I again objected to the inclusion of this nongermane, \nnonrelevant language as an amendment to the defense authorization bill \nwhen the bill was being considered on the floor of the Senate. Today, I \nremain strongly opposed to its inclusion in the conference report. The \ndefense authorization bill is not the appropriate vehicle for \nconsideration of hate crimes legislation. It is not germane to the work \nof the Armed Services Committee. The stand-alone legislation, S. 909, \nhas not even been considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee, where \nit could have been debated, modified, improved, and brought to the \nfloor of the Senate. What we are doing here is an abuse of the Senate \nprocess.\n  I also object to the language itself because it would create a new \nFederal crime for willfully causing bodily injury to any person due to \nthe actual or perceived race, national origin, religion, or gender \nidentity, sexual orientation, or disability of any person.\n  I do not believe an expansion of the Federal criminal code is \nnecessary to cover a certain class of citizens from ``perceived \ninjustices.''\n  Let me tell you one of the biggest problems I have here. We have now \nseen a virtual disappearance of authorization bills for various \nfunctions of government from Senate consideration. We have done that \nbecause extraneous and nongermane issues have been raised on those \nauthorization bills. I don't remember the last time we had \nauthorization bills for foreign operations out of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. I don't know when we have had authorization for other \nbranches of government. The reason is because they always get bogged \ndown in extraneous amendments on both sides. I am not placing the blame \non the other side. I am placing the blame on both sides. This then bogs \ndown the legislation which then, because of the exigencies of time, \nmeans we are not able to address the proper authorizing process for \nmany functions of government. That, then, throws it all into the \nappropriations process. Of course, that is now an enormous shift of \npower and authority and responsibility from the authorizing committees, \nin whom the responsibility should lie, to the appropriating committees \nwhich are simply only supposed to appropriate money for previously \nauthorized functions of government. I worry a great deal about that.\n  The only bill that has been consistently passed for many years \nthrough the Senate and into law is the Defense authorization bill. The \nDefense authorization bill is vital. We are now starting a very \ndangerous precedent by adding a very large and controversial provision, \nwhich is nongermane and nonrelated to defense, to a Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  As my friend Senator Levin will point out, there have been other \ntimes where provisions have been added to this bill which were \nnongermane. Nothing of this magnitude, nothing of the controversy that \nis associated with the hate crimes legislation which was tacked on to \nthis bill without any consideration in the committee itself. There was \nno committee consideration. When the bill came to the floor, bang, the \nfirst amendment out of the box was the hate crimes legislation which, \nof course, tied up the legislation for some days.\n  I understand the realities around here. I know what majority votes \nare. I know what majority membership in this body means. It was jammed \nthrough. I want to tell my colleagues, if we allow hate crimes to be \nadded to this Defense authorization bill, what is next? What pet \nproject or legislation on the part of the majority leader or the \nmajority will be included in the next authorization bill?\n  If this legislation is signed into law, it will force police and \nprosecutors to treat identical crimes differently depending on a police \nofficer or prosecutor's determination of the political, gender, \nphilosophical, or even religious beliefs of the offender. Our legal \nsystem is based on identifying, capturing, and punishing criminals, not \non using the power of government to divine biases. Crimes motivated by \nhate deserve vigorous prosecution, and I strongly support punishing \nthose who commit such heinous acts under existing laws. Moreover, I am \ncommitted to a full and transparent debate on the issue. But I strongly \noppose using the men and women of the military as the vehicle to pass \nthis controversial and partisan legislation.\n  The Detroit News editorialized:\n\n       Certainly, threats of violence or violence against \n     individuals for any reason should be prosecuted to the full \n     extent of the law. Not, however, because the victims are \n     members of a particular race or sex, adherents of a \n     particular religion or are gay. These crimes should be \n     punished because the victims are uniquely valuable \n     individuals who deserve the protection of the law solely on \n     that basis. The idea of special prosecutions for ``hate \n     crimes'' is inherently divisive.\n\n  I am pleased the conference report does retain some legislative \nlanguage offered by Senator Brownback during Senate debate on the bill. \nThe Brownback language clarifies that nothing in the hate crimes \nlegislation language shall be construed as an infringement on \nAmericans' first amendment rights. Additionally, his amendment ensures \nthat nothing in the hate crimes language should be construed to \noverturn ``the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993'' that ensures \nour laws do not substantially burden Americans' free exercise of their \nreligion.\n  The majority had the votes in July to add hate crimes to the Senate \nbill, and I am sure the majority will again have the votes today to \ninvoke cloture on the conference report containing hate crimes \nlanguage. It is indeed, unfortunate, that we are using the brave men \nand women in uniform as leverage to pass hate crimes legislation.\n  This legislation should have gone through the Judiciary Committee. \nThat is the oversight committee. That is the committee of jurisdiction. \nI know my colleagues who are here on the floor will be justifying this \nlegislation on the grounds of how badly it is needed. I say to the \nmajority, who controls the legislative schedule here, they could have \nhad this bill through the Judiciary Committee and on the floor of the \nSenate and passed in the Senate in the proper fashion and not put hate \ncrimes on a bill that cares for the men and women serving in the \nmilitary today. I worry a great deal about the precedent we will be \nsetting by including an incredibly controversial piece of legislation \nin the Defense authorization bill which provides for our first and \nforemost obligation, and that is to secure the safety and welfare of \nour fellow citizens.\n  Finally, I believe it is important to note that the Defense \nauthorization bill has been the only authorization bill that the U.S. \nCongress has consistently passed every year. Other authorization bills \nhave often fallen under the weight of provisions inserted into must-\npass bills that are not relevant to the legislation and highly \ncontroversial. The lives of our men and men serving abroad literally \ndepend on our ability to consistently and reliably pass this \nauthorization bill every year. I am not willing to take a gamble with \nour troops. For these reasons I cannot in good conscience vote to \nsupport the motion to invoke cloture on this bill, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Prior to the final vote on passage of the conference report, I plan \nto speak in more detail about the overall bill and the commitment we \nhave made in this conference report to do everything possible to ensure \nour soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines receive the support they \ndeserve and need, as well as a message we need to send those brave men \nand women and their families whom we support and stand behind.\n  I will vote against cloture. I will vote for final passage of the \nlegislation in deference to our need to care for the men and women who \nare serving. I also would point out that if cloture is not invoked, we \ncould immediately pass a resolution reconvening the conference and get \nthis bill done today. But that is not going to happen, unfortunately.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n[[Page S10667]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I did not sign the conference report on \nthis legislation. I did not do it for a number of the same reasons \narticulated by the Senator from Arizona.\n  There are some good provisions in this bill. It does increase the \nsize of our military, the Army, Marines, Air Force, and the Navy. \nSpecifically, it authorizes 30,000 new additional Army troops through \nfiscal years 2011 and 2012 but provides no funding, which means the \nArmy is going to have to take it out of its hide somewhere else. This \nconcerns me.\n  It does provide a pay raise. That is good. It improves TRICARE \neligibility. It adds eight congressionally appointed members to the \nindependent panel that will consider the Quadrennial Defense Review. \nThat was a program of Senator Thune's. It does do that. That is good.\n  It provides $350 million to train and equip. Train and equip has been \none of my favorite programs for a long period. It is one that we are \ngetting the most out of right now. I am pleased that is in there. It \nalso adds some funding for the new AFRICOM, African Command. It used to \nbe divided into three different commands--the European command, the \nPacific command and Central Command--but now it is in one. However, \neven though AFRICOM is good, and General Ward is doing a great job, it \nwas not adequately funded in terms of resources. Now it is much better. \nWe have extra funding in there.\n  Having said that, I would have to say that on modernization and the \nthings I have been trying to do since I have been serving in this body \nand on the Armed Services Committee, military modernization has been \nkicked down the road. It seems all we ever do around here is take care \nof what is on fire at any given time.\n  President Obama said, in his February 2009 speech to a joint session, \nthat he would push for removal of Cold War era equipment we do not \nneed. I agree with that statement. That is not what this legislation \ndoes though. We are still using the Bradley fighting vehicle and the M1 \nAbrams tank, both developed in the 1970s and 1980s. The Army's Paladin \nhowitzer was developed in the 1950s back when I was in the Army. We do \nhave the Paladin Integrated Management, P.I.M., program to upgrade it \nbut, nonetheless, there is no current modernization plan to replace \nthat cannon. It terminates the C-17 program. Fortunately, we were able \nto get some things in Defense appropriations to correct that and add \nfunding for additional C-17s. It terminates the F-22 program. I can \nremember when that program was first introduced. We were going to have \nsome 900 aircraft. As it turned out, that was dropped down to 750 and \nhas now been reduced to purchasing only the 187 aircraft already \nproduced. Let's keep in mind that the F-22 is the only fifth-generation \nfighter we have, and other countries--China and Russia--are cranking \ntheirs out now.\n  I think the worst part of this, though, was what they did to our \nmissile defense system. The chart is complicated but it shows that \nduring the boost phase, we have two capabilities--the airborne laser \nand the kinetic energy interceptor. Those were, for all practical \npurposes, terminated with this bill. That is the easiest and earliest \nphase to knock down an incoming missile, if you can get it during the \nboost phase. It cut down the number of missile interceptors in Alaska \nand California from 40 to 33. But to me the worst part is--and we have \ntalked about this on the floor over and over--it eliminated our ground-\nbased interceptor capability that was ongoing in Poland and the Czech \nRepublic. I was there when this European plan was first being \ndiscussed.. I talked to the Polish Parliament as well as the Czech \nParliament to encourage them to let us have that capability. I remember \na member of the Parliament asked me: Are you sure that if we do this \nand take a controversial position in allowing an interceptor capability \nto take place, that America won't back down? I said: I am absolutely \ncertain we won't. Obviously, we did back down. I am very much concerned \nabout that. I wish there were time to go into it. There is not.\n  I will say this: We are pretty well protected with our capability, \neven though they decreased the number of interceptor missiles in Alaska \nand California in this legislation. But the interceptor missiles based \nin Alaska and California are intended to protect against missile \nthreats from the west of the United States from Asia. Something coming \nfrom the East is a different situation. We needed this added capability \nand protection. I know the administration says that we already have the \ncapability of knocking down a short and medium-range hostile missiles \nwith our PATRIOT missiles, our THAAD system and our SM-3. The problem \nwith that is, those systems do not adequately address the long-range \nmissile threats from nations like Iran. Our intelligence says Iran is \ngoing to have a long-range missile capability by around 2015. If we had \nstayed with our program to have this capability in Poland and the Czech \nRepublic in advance of that, we would have the capability of knocking \ndown an ICBM coming toward the United States.\n  As it is now, we will not have until around 2020. If our intelligence \nestimate is right, that means we have a 5-year period, between 2015 and \n2020, where we are pretty much naked on the east coast and Europe \nagainst long-range missile threats.\n  Let me ask, because I know there is another Senator who wants part of \nthis time, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 11\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I am very much concerned about some of the other things \nthat have been approached in this legislation. One is the lack of \ntesting capability for our existing stockpile of nuclear capability.\n  I am concerned about the additional money, some $560 million, to \ncontinue development and procurement of the alternate engine for the F-\n25 Joint Strike Fighter. We debated this over and over again. The end \nresult would be, if this continues in the way it is right now, it would \neventually knock us down by about 50 F-35 aircraft. This is something \nthat should not take place.\n  While this authorization bill does prohibit the Gitmo detainees \ncoming into the United States, it does allow for detainees to be \ntransferred into the United States 45 days after the President has \nsubmitted a plan to Congress. It does not say that Congress has to \napprove the plan, just that they must submit the plan to Congress. \nAnytime I look at what has happened and the capability we have there at \nGitmo--and to think we would shut it down for no reason I have ever \nbeen able to determine--that is concerning.\n  The last thing I would mention is, if we look at our responsibility \nof defending America, we are down now to a very small percentage of GDP \ncompared to where we have been in the past. During the gulf war, our \ndefense spending was 4.6 percent. It was 6 percent during the buildup \nof the Reagan years. If this trend continues on the road we are on now, \nit would be at 3 percent of GDP by 2019.\n  I would only remind you, Mr. President, we went through this same \nthing back at the beginning of the Clinton administration. As this \nchart shows, this line right here is a baseline. The Clinton budget is \nthe red line down there. So we are talking about a degradation of some \n$412 billion in that period of time.\n  On the heels of that--I remember so well the jubilant cries that: The \ncold war is over. We don't need a strong defense anymore. I see that \nsame sentiment coming on the horizon. I am very much concerned about \nthat.\n  For that reason, I will be opposing the vote we will be facing in a \nshort period of time. There still is time to send this back to \nconference and get some of those things taken care of. I would \nencourage our colleagues to give us the opportunity to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, very briefly, I yield myself just 1 minute. \nThere is no conference to send this back to. The conference, by rules, \nhas been disbanded.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am frustrated and disappointed that I \nwould be in a position to vote against\n\n[[Page S10668]]\n\ncloture on this legislation. I have been a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee now for 12 years. I have voted in favor of passing the \nNational Defense Authorization Act each of those 12 years. I am \nparticularly concerned that I would feel compelled to oppose the \npassage of this conference report this year.\n  I will vote against cloture because I am deeply troubled that we are \nmoving away from the longstanding tradition of passing bipartisan \nlegislation that sets aside partisan politics in favor of providing \nfunding for our men and women in uniform. I am sad to say that in this \ncase the desires of a few have overridden that tradition. The result of \nthat decision is before us in the conference report.\n  The inclusion of the controversial language of the hate crimes \nlegislation, which is unrelated to our national defense, is deeply \ntroubling. I think we will be setting a dangerous precedent by \nincluding such extraneous legislation on a most important authorization \nbill the body passes every year.\n  I count myself as an ally of our men and women in uniform. I work for \nthem, feel compelled to support them in every way possible. I certainly \ndo not mean to disrespect them and all the good things that are in this \nbill. But let me just say, one reason we have had such good support for \nthe Defense authorization bill and are able to pass it every year, when \nbills like the foreign relations authorization bill almost never pass \nbecause that bill and so many other authorization bills get larded up \nwith all kinds of pork and special interest, extraneous legislation, \nand they become so controversial they do not pass--our unwritten but \nfirm principle has been: Let's keep the Defense bill a clean bill that \nfocuses on our men and women in uniform. And just because you or some \nSenator in the body has a piece of legislation they strongly favor, \nthat does not mean it should be added to the Defense bill, because \nothers may feel just as strongly in opposition. So it creates a real \nproblem for us.\n  I will just say that the train on which this Defense bill annually \nmoves forward is a powerful engine. It has always been known that if \nyou are able to get your legislation on the Defense bill, then few \nSenators are going to vote against it even if they do not agree with \nthat particular piece of legislation. They want to vote for the Defense \nbill.\n  In a bipartisan way, we have recognized--and not perfectly--if we \nwant to make sure this bipartisan strength and support for our men and \nwomen in uniform and our national defense is maintained, we do not need \nto load up that train with extraneous, controversial pieces of \nlegislation. That is a great disappointment to me.\n  I hope by raising this objection clearly--and I appreciate Senator \nMcCain doing so--we will begin to send a message that: Let's not do \nthis again because it can endanger the success we have had over the \nyears.\n  This legislation was included despite the opposition of both the \nchairman and the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee \nand certainly the ranking member of the Senate committee, Senator \nMcCain. It is my understanding that the leadership--I guess the Speaker \nand the majority leader are the ones who insisted this legislation, \nthis hate crimes bill, be added to it. Specifically, Chairman Ike \nSkelton, the Democratic chairman in the House, on October 8, said:\n\n       Finally, regarding the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, I have \n     said several times that I would have preferred it to have \n     been enacted as a stand-alone bill.\n\n  Well, I think that is certainly what we all felt. But somehow that \ndid not happen. It has been added to the legislation.\n  On July 20 of this year, I gave a lengthy statement I am sure few \nlistened to and even fewer read discussing hate crimes legislation and \nthe constitutionality of it, the need for it or lack of need for it. I \npointed out a number of things that I think were very important to \nconsidering the legislation. One of them I will just note is a report \nby the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.\n  I oppose the legislation. I do not think there was any showing--as a \nmatter of fact, there was no showing--of a failure of State and local \nprosecutors to prosecute these cases. I asked the Attorney General \nhimself, Mr. Eric Holder, to list the cases he named, and he listed \nfive. We checked all those cases in the last 5 years, and they were all \nprosecuted, and most resulted in conviction and jail time. So it is not \nas if these cases were not being prosecuted.\n  This has a political dimension to it, frankly, more than a legal \ndimension. Six of the eight members of the U.S. Commission on Civil \nRights signed a strong letter to the President and to the Judiciary \nCommittee opposing this legislation. They went on to say in their \nletter that:\n\n       While the title [of this legislation] suggests that it will \n     apply only to ``hate crimes,'' the actual criminal \n     prohibitions contained in it do not require that the \n     defendant be inspired by hatred or ill will in order to \n     convict. It is sufficient if he acts ``because of'' someone's \n     actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, \n     gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability.\n\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       Rapists are seldom indifferent to the gender of their \n     victims. They are virtually always chosen ``because of'' \n     their gender.\n       A robber might well steal only from women or the disabled \n     because, in general, they are less able to defend themselves. \n     Literally, they are chosen ``because of'' their gender or \n     disability.\n\n  The letter goes on to say that this piece of legislation would make \nevery rape in America be declared a crime under this bill because it is \nan act against someone because of their gender.\n  So on the merits, I am concerned about the legislation. I am \nconcerned about its constitutionality. There is a lack of interstate \nnexus. Unlike the 1968 Civil Rights Act--which was needed and did fill \na gap because there was clear proof that serious crimes committed \nagainst African Americans and other minorities were not being \nprosecuted. They had proof of that and could show that. So the Federal \nlegislature, through narrowly crafted legislation to protect the \nmovement and free exercise of civil rights by minorities in this \ncountry, passed a civil rights bill that I think has been upheld as \nconstitutional. But this bill is much broader, much less narrowly \ntailored, and much less defensible.\n  So I will just say, Mr. President, I am proud we have a good pay \nraise in the legislation. I am proud there are some good things in it. \nI am disappointed, as Senator Inhofe said, about the missile defense \nissue and the lack of funding to update our nuclear stockpiles, which \nis becoming a critical issue. Overall, I am supportive of the \nlegislation, want to be supportive of it, but I want to be crystal \nclear that we should not head down this road where we allow the \naddition, through a defense bill, of controversial legislation such as \nthis.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. How much on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am going to be very brief and will not \nuse the 10 minutes, unless there is somebody else who wishes to speak \nin support of the motion to invoke cloture.\n  I yield myself, Mr. President, 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Just very briefly, let me say that the Senate has adopted \nhate crimes legislation on a defense authorization bill, I believe, \nthree times. This is not the first time we would do this. It is not the \nsecond time we would do this. So it is not unique. It is not unusual. \nIt is not unprecedented.\n  It is important that we provide the same kind of protection for the \nadditional groups who are being protected under this legislation, \nincluding groups who would be attacked physically based on sexual \norientation.\n  It would protect men and women in uniform for the first time from \nthese kinds of hate crimes. That is something in which the Armed \nServices Committee has a special interest. The language has been \nwritten to ensure that it does not intrude on first amendment rights, \nthat State and local law enforcement retain primary jurisdiction over \ninvestigations and prosecutions. It would punish violent acts\n\n[[Page S10669]]\n\nonly, not beliefs. No Federal prosecution could take place under the \nprovision unless the Justice Department certifies that the State in \nwhich the hate crime occurred either does not have the jurisdiction, \nhas asked the Federal Government to assume jurisdiction, or has failed \nto vindicate the Federal interest against hate crime motivated violence \nor that a Federal prosecution is necessary to secure substantial \njustice. Senator Kennedy was the champion of this provision. Over and \nover again, he attempted successfully in the Senate to get this kind of \nlanguage adopted. He pointed out, and I think with eloquence that is \nunmatched, that the values men and women in uniform fight for are these \nkinds of values: the value of diversity, the value of \nnondiscrimination. To say this has no place on this bill, it seems to \nme, is wrong for that reason as well as a number of other reasons.\n\n  We have had strong support for this provision from the Department of \nJustice and from law enforcement groups across the country that want \nthis kind of support. The Senate, again, has authorized this \nlegislation on the Defense authorization bill and has supported it \ntwice before. This is at least the third time now that it is part of \nthis bill. There are good reasons for it being part of Defense \nauthorization, one of which is the values that are reflected here that \nwhen the men and women put on the uniform of our country, they fight to \nprotect.\n  This would be a real tribute to Senator Kennedy for this language to \nbe included. I remember going over with him to urge the House to adopt \nthis language a couple years ago. The House did not do it then, \nalthough we in the Senate did do it. But now the House has adopted it. \nThe Senate voted on this language just a few weeks ago with, I believe, \n63 votes to incorporate this language into the Defense authorization \nbill. So we have already voted to do this. There is nothing unique or \nunprecedented about doing it again.\n  I hope we will invoke cloture. The stakes are huge. When I spoke \nbefore, I was quoting some of the things this bill will provide which \nare essential.\n  Now, some of the things in this bill required an appropriation. The \nAppropriations Committee hasn't acted on--excuse me--we haven't adopted \nan appropriations bill yet. Those things are not going to be held up if \nwe don't pass this bill today, but there are a few things that will be \nheld up. Our veterans are going to have to pay more for prescriptions \nand copays if we don't act on this bill, and acting on this bill will \nprevent that increase in copays without an appropriation.\n  We all talk about the importance of getting to Afghanistan equipment \nthat is in Iraq. This bill has language which will permit that to \nhappen. There is great disagreement as to what the right policy is in \nAfghanistan, but there seems to be no disagreement that we ought to \nstrengthen the Afghan Army. One of the key ways to strengthen the \nAfghan Army is to get them equipment that is currently in Iraq which, \nif we don't pass this bill, is going to have to be shipped back here \nnot only at great expense but also denying to the Afghan Army that we \nare trying to build up the kind of equipment that will make it possible \nfor them to assert greater control for the security of their own \ncountry. That equipment cannot be transferred until this bill passes \nbecause that is nonexcess equipment. The moment this bill passes and is \nsigned by the President, that equipment can be shipped to Afghanistan. \nThat will protect our troops.\n  To try to pass another bill--have the House pass another bill, have \nanother conference created if we can get one, have the conference, go \nthrough the process of conferees--is going to deny and delay an \nessential item going to Afghanistan to help protect our troops and our \ninterests.\n  We talk a lot about: Why can't we do in Afghanistan what they did in \nIraq? Why can't we have the Sons of Iraq be the Sons of Afghanistan? \nWhy can't we put a policy in place which will attract those young \nAfghans who are on the payroll of the Taliban not because they believe \nin the extreme religious fanatic position the Taliban takes, but \nbecause it is a check or, more importantly, more accurately, cash they \ncan put in their pockets?\n  With the Sons of Iraq we were able to wean away from the attackers, \nthe people who hated us, 100,000 young Iraqis because we had a program \nwhich would help to fund that. This bill contains the authorization for \nour commanders to use CERP funding for that purpose. That is going to \nsupport our troops. Those funds can't be used until the President puts \nhis name on this bill. Delaying that jeopardizes our troops, \njeopardizes our interests, and it is one of the many essential \nprovisions in this bill, and until they become law cannot be put into \neffect. But the moment it does become law, if and when it does, it can \nbe placed into effect.\n  So the stakes on this first vote are great. If we delay adopting this \nbill by not adopting cloture, we are going to be taking a step \nbackwards in terms of the support of our troops and our interests in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. The delay is unacceptable. I hope our colleagues \nwill vote for cloture.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                     Honoring Senator Daniel Inouye\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, our colleague, Senator Dan Inouye, has \nearned, on the field of battle, the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, and \nthe Congressional Medal of Honor. The man we work with on a daily basis \nis an American hero. He has earned the admiration, respect, and trust \nof the people of Hawaii and the entire Nation.\n  Today he has reached another milestone. He becomes the third longest \nserving Senator in American history.\n  (Applause.)\n  Every day since January 3, 1963--46 years, 9 months, and 20 days--\nHawaii has been proud to call Dan Inouye their Senator. There has \ncertainly never been a Senator such as Dan Inouye. He holds many \ndistinctions no one else can claim or will claim: He has represented \nthe people of Hawaii since Hawaii became a State. He was Hawaii's first \nCongressman and is its longest serving Senator. He was the first \nJapanese American to serve in the House and the first Japanese American \nto serve in the Senate and first chairman of the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence.\n  Just as he today becomes the third longest serving Senator, he also \nranks third all-time in the number of votes cast in the Senate, behind \nonly Senators Byrd and Thurmond. That means the senior senator from \nHawaii has cast more votes than any Senator west of the Mississippi.\n  Today's vote by Senator Inouye, which was the last vote cast--one of \nAmerica's most accomplished veterans, and that is an understatement--\nwas on the Department of Defense authorization bill. It was his \n15,507th vote.\n  The good people of the great State of Hawaii thank Senator Inouye for \nhis continued service. The American people thank him for his courage \nand his leadership. I thank him--from the day I entered this body, \nthere is no one who has been more cordial, more of a gentleman than the \nman we know who has a Congressional Medal of Honor, Dan Inouye.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my good friend from Hawaii, I \naddressed this issue we are discussing now in my opening remarks this \nmorning. I congratulate him for achieving this milestone. He has been \nan inspiration not only to Members of the Senate but to many Americans \nthroughout his life, beginning, obviously, with his extraordinary \nservice for our country during World War II.\n  As I indicated to my good friend, I addressed this earlier today. I \nwish to join with others in congratulating him on this important \nmilestone he has achieved today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I also add my voice, support, and praise \nfor our colleague, Senator Inouye of Hawaii, who now becomes the third \nlongest serving Member of this great body. Dan Inouye has spent his \nlife fighting for freedom, democracy, and equality in uniform, as a \nMember of Congress and the Senate.\n  Senator Daniel Inouye may be the only American who saw with his own \neyes the smoke from Pearl Harbor and the black smoke that rose from the \nPentagon on 9/11. On both of those terrible days, when the Nation he \nloved was under attack, Dan Inouye stood ready to protect and serve \nthis great country. I am honored to call him a colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate and bring my aloha \nto my good friend, brother, and colleague, Senator Inouye, on reaching \nthis impressive milestone today, becoming the third longest serving \nSenator in U.S. history. His dedication to public service and to this \ngreat country is an inspiration to me and to many others.\n  Senator Inouye has been in Congress ever since Hawaii became a State \nin 1959. He has been here for 46 years, 9 months, and 20 days. He was \nin the House and then joined the Senate 3 years later.\n  This historic milestone would be impressive on its own, but it is \ntruly amazing when one considers Senator Inouye's background: a Medal \nof Honor recipient who lost his arm fighting for America in World War \nII. He fought for our country while fellow Japanese Americans were \nbeing interred in our country.\n  He then became the first Japanese American in Congress. He has fought \nfor our country in battle and in the Congress as well.\n  Senator Inouye will continue working for Hawaii and the United States \nfor many more years to come. It has been a pleasure serving with him in \nthese years representing Hawaii.\n  I, again, extend my aloha, my congratulations to Senator Dan Inouye, \nand ask for God's blessing upon him and God bless America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, one thing Senator Inouye has \nestablished is that you do not have to be a Democrat to love Danny \nInouye. He is not only revered here for his knowledge and for his \nleadership but for his affection and to all things we care about, and \npeople on the other side of the aisle confirm that in their respect for \nDanny Inouye.\n  Danny, as we affectionately know him, and I and Senator Akaka are the \nthree remaining veterans of World War II in this place. We treasure \nevery moment we have together. I particularly am in debt to Danny \nInouye for his unique capacity to listen, to think quickly on his feet \nand come up with the right answers.\n  Danny, we congratulate you. We look forward to your ascension to even \nhigher standing with longevity in this body and, quite frankly, I hope \nto be here with you. Congratulations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this day I am reminded how grateful I am \nto the people of Hawaii for honoring me all these years. I just hope my \nwork here has returned this great favor they have given me.\n  I can think of many good things that have happened, but the thing I \nwill always cherish is the friendship of my colleagues--friendship that \nextends on both sides of the aisle. I think that is the way we should \nlook upon the Congress and the Senate. Therefore, I am pleased that as \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, I can tell one and all that \nout of the 12 bills, 10 were reported out unanimously, 2 with 1 \nopposition. That is bipartisanship, and we intend to keep it that way.\n  Once again, I thank my colleagues for their many courtesies and today \nthey have honored me greatly. Aloha.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, may I inquire, what is the business \nbefore the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The conference report to accompany H.R. 2467.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President I rise, regrettably, to oppose the \nconference report for the fiscal year 2010 National Defense \nAuthorization Act. For the record, this will be the first Defense \nauthorization bill I have voted against in my 15 years in Congress.\n  There are many provisions in this bill with which I agree and \nstrongly agree that represent major steps forward in support of our men \nand women in uniform and the national security responsibilities of the \nUnited States. For example, the bill includes a significant pay raise \nfor our troops, re-authorizes numerous bonuses and special pays, \nauthorizes billions of dollars of much needed military construction, \nboth in the United States as well as overseas, and authorizes $6.7 \nbillion for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles or MRAPs.\n  Also, the bill includes the Military and Overseas Voting Empowerment \nAct, which I worked on in conjunction with Senators Schumer, Ben \nNelson, Cornyn and Bennett and which was cosponsored by over half this \nbody. The MOVE Act is one of the most substantive and comprehensive \nmilitary and overseas voting reforms we have seen in years. It will fix \na significant problem we have had in this country, that of the men and \nwomen of our military; who are putting their lives in\n\n[[Page S10671]]\n\nharm's way being denied the ability to, No. 1, have the opportunity to \nvote, and No. 2, to have their vote counted.\n  However, the bill includes at least three provisions which I strongly \noppose, and for those reasons I cannot support this final bill.\n  First, the bill includes hate crimes legislation, which I firmly \nbelieve is unnecessary, irresponsible, and certainly not germane to \nthis bill. There is little evidence that indicates that violent crimes, \nmotivated by hate, go unpunished in the United States. Every single \nState has criminal laws that prohibit the antisocial behavior addressed \nby hate crimes legislation, including laws against murder, rape, arson, \nassault, and battery.\n  I oppose the creation of Federal hate crimes legislation for several \nreasons. First, I do not believe the Federal Government should \ninterfere with the criminal laws already on the books in our States.\n  Second, this hate crimes legislation would establish a protected \nclass of crime victims who would receive special protection under the \nlaw.\n  Finally, we already have laws to prosecute individuals who commit \nviolent crimes. Those people guilty of violent crimes against anyone \nshould and will be prosecuted under existing law and should be punished \nto the hilt when found guilty. For all these reasons, I strongly oppose \nthe hate crimes legislation in this bill.\n\n  Secondly, the bill contains no funding for the procurement of \nadditional F-22s. On May 19, 2009, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, \nGeneral Schwartz, affirmed under oath that 243 is the right number of \nF-22s to have in our inventory. Nevertheless, inclusion of additional \nF-22 funding received a veto threat from the administration and funding \nwas stripped out of the Senate bill after an unbelievable lobbying \neffort coming out of the Pentagon and the White House.\n  I readily acknowledge there is a difference of opinion on this issue \nand that others do not necessarily share my views on this subject. \nHowever, what I will not acknowledge is that support for additional F-\n22s is simply an example of doing business as usual and the influence \nof special interests. Congress is entitled to disagree with the \nexecutive branch on significant procurement and policy decisions, and \nthere are countless examples of where we have done so and history has \nproven Congress to be right. Time will tell, but the F-22 may very well \nbe an example of where the supporters of the program were, without \nquestion, correct.\n  I hope we are never put in a position as a country where we once \nagain must fight to maintain air dominance, but there is not a single \nweapon in our inventory that ensures that we will maintain air \ndominance other than the F-22. The F-35 is a great weapon system, but \nwe now know it is going to be delayed by 2 years.\n  It was kind of interesting that the announcement on the 2-year delay \non the F-35 came out about 3 or 4 days after the final vote on the \nDefense authorization bill on this floor. But the F-35 is an air-to-\nground weapon system that will not guarantee us the air superiority the \nF-22 will. If we are going to rely on 187 F-22s from an air dominance \nstandpoint in every potential sector of the world, against every \npotential adversary, it is simply not enough. General Schwartz was \nright when he said 243 is a more correct number. I believe stopping \nproduction at 187 puts our Nation at high risk in the near to midterm, \nand there is no reason our Nation should accept that amount of risk \ngiven our global responsibilities.\n  Third, section 1041 of the bill provides for the transfer of \nGuantanamo detainees to the United States. While the bill specifies \nconditions for transfer as well as requiring a plan for each detainee \nwho is transferred; the bill nevertheless allows for the transfer of \nthose detainees. The conditions for the transfer of those detainees are \nsimilar to those that are present in the fiscal year 2010 Department of \nHomeland Security appropriations bill which I voted against earlier \nthis week.\n  I made a much more detailed statement at that time about my reasons \nwhy I was voting against that bill relative to this issue of the \ntransfer of Guantanamo detainees to the United States, but that bill \nauthorized the transfer of detainees to the United States for the \npurpose of prosecuting the detainees or for detaining them during legal \nproceedings. This bill allows the transfer of detainees not just for \nthat purpose but for any purpose. This will allow those detainees to \nhave access to U.S. criminal courts, which I strongly oppose, because \nthese are individuals who were arrested on the battlefield, not by the \nFBI or local police or any other law enforcement agency inside the \nUnited States. These are battlefield combatants. This also goes against \nthe will of the American people and opens up the possibility that these \ndetainees may one day be released in the United States. Therefore, I \ncannot support this provision in the underlying bill.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support our troops, and I support the \nmissions we have asked them to carry out. Shortly, I will be going back \nto Afghanistan for my third trip. I also have been to Iraq on eight \ndifferent occasions, and I get very emotional and excited about the \nopportunity to look our men and women in the eye, with their boots on \nthe ground, and tell them how much we Americans appreciate the great \njob they are doing. I am going to continue to support them in every way \npossible. But the fact is, here we have provisions in a Defense \nauthorization bill that go against the will of the American people and \nthat, frankly, don't have much of anything to do with our troops in \ntheater as well as our troops here.\n  So, Mr. President, regrettably, I am going to be opposing this bill \non the grounds of the issues I have outlined.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am a student of history and a firm believer in \napplying the lessons of history to present planning and to future \nplanning. There is no profit--none--in making the same mistakes over \nand over. There is no future--none--in building on a foundation of \nshifting sand. Our military planners and our Afghanistan policy \nanalysts, as well as Members of this Senate, would do well to spend \nsome time considering the history, the geography, and the cultures of \nAfghanistan.\n  Throughout the long centuries, Afghanistan's geopolitical value has \nbeen its location along the great Silk Road that carried both trade \ngoods and armies between Europe and Asia through the forbidding Hindu \nKush mountains. Afghanistan has limited natural resources. Afghanistan \nhas a climate and a geography that produces very little for export. So \nthe fiercely--and I say fiercely--independent tribes that populate this \nharsh and barren land have long earned a living instead from the goods \nand the armies that travel across it.\n  Tribesmen have used the dry rocky plains and the steep, bare, cavern-\nriddled mountains to great advantage--to extort both armies and traders \nfor security and shelter or as a base from which to raid.\n  In weary succession, rulers and nations have witnessed their dreams \nof conquest and their dreams of empire in Afghanistan dashed. From \nAlexander the Great in 326 BC, to Genghis Kahn in the 13th century, to \nthe British in the 19th century, to the Russians in the 20th century, \nno invading army has ever conquered Afghanistan, earning it the \nsobriquet ``Graveyard of Empires,'' the graveyard of empires or, to say \nit another way, graveyard of foreigners.\n  In one horrific example, in 1842, the British lost more than 16,000 \ntroops and civilians in a single 110-mile retreat from Kabul to \nJalalabad. History tells us--and we had better listen to history--that \nAfghanistan does not take kindly to foreign intervention. Yet--now, get \nthis--here we are discussing a proposed counterinsurgency strategy that \nwould vastly increase the U.S. presence in Afghanistan in the vain hope \nof spawning the establishment of a Western-style, modern democracy and \neconomy in a land that in many areas and in many ways is still frozen \nin the time of Alexander the Great.\n  As a junior United States Senator I traveled to Afghanistan in the \n1960s--way back there in the 1960s. Yes, I went to Afghanistan in the \n1960s and, let me say to you, it was an eye-opening experience. Men, \nhuman beings, were treated like beasts of burden, actually pulling \ncarts like oxen. Yes, I saw it. Living conditions were primitive. \nCorruption was widespread. While life in Afghanistan's cities has \nchanged somewhat in the intervening decades, many\n\n[[Page S10672]]\n\nof the scenes that I see in the news still look very familiar to me. \nThe fundamental changes that are wished for by some NATO and U.S. \nplanners, particularly in the least developed rural areas where the \ntribal theocratic Taliban rule is most entrenched, would certainly be a \nlong shot--and I mean that, a long shot--and likely will be a long shot \nand quite unwelcome.\n  What is really at stake for the United States in Afghanistan? We all \nknow that Afghanistan is not a threat to us militarily. The Taliban is \nnot a threat to us militarily. Al-Qaida, however, is a demonstrated \nthreat to us, with ambitions and a philosophy that must--must--keep us \nvigilant. But the link between al-Qaida and Afghanistan is a tenuous \nlink, one based only on the temporary expediency of location, an \nexpediency that has already been replaced as the al-Qaida leadership \nhas moved and may move again. Building a western style Democratic state \nin an Afghanistan that is equipped with a large military and police \nforce and a functioning economy based on something other than opium \npoppies may or may not deny al-Qaida a safe haven there again. It will, \nhowever, guarantee that the United States--that is us--must invest \nlarge numbers--not just a few, large numbers--of troops and many \nbillions of dollars in Afghanistan for many--not just a few, many--\nyears to come, energy and funds that might otherwise go toward \nfueling--in other words building and strengthening--our own economic \nrecovery, better educating our children or expanding access to health \ncare for more of our own people, and yet there are many here in this \nbody, many here in the Senate who believe that we should proceed with \nsuch a folly in Afghanistan.\n  I am not one of them. But there are many, I say, here in the Senate, \nwho believe that we should proceed with such a folly in Afghanistan. \nDuring a time of record deficits, some actually continue to suggest \nthat the United States should sink hundreds of billions of borrowed \ndollars into Afghanistan, effectively turning our backs on our own \nsubstantial domestic needs, all the while deferring the costs and \ndeferring the problems for future generations to address. Our national \nsecurity interests lie in defeating--no, I go further, in destroying \nal-Qaida. Until we take that and only that mission seriously, we risk \nadding the United States to the long, long list of nations whose best \nlaid plans have died on the cold, barren, rocky slopes of that far off \ncountry, Afghanistan.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, it was a great privilege to be here on the \nfloor to hear the remarks of the senior Senator from West Virginia. I \ncongratulate him on his remarks and thank him for giving us the \nprivilege of hearing his views on Afghanistan.\n  One of the most import duties we have as Members of this Chamber is \nto ensure that our troops have the tools and equipment they need to \nsucceed. It is an obligation we all take very seriously. I thank the \nchairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nSenators Levin and McCain, for producing such a balanced and bipartisan \nbill that invests in our Nation's defense and provides, as President \nObama has said, ``for the few who have borne the overwhelming burden of \nour security.'' Making sure our troops have the very best America can \noffer is absolutely essential to our defense and keeps our military \nsecond to none.\n  I rise today to discuss a provision in this conference report that \nreflects a different source of pride, a source of pride that projects \nanother characteristic of America and defines us as a model of freedom \nand equality under the law. These values form a foundation of America's \nstrength that is our most enduring asset, both in times of war and \npeace. I rise today in strong support of the Matthew Shepard Hate \nCrimes Prevention Act. With the bipartisan passage of the Defense \nauthorization conference report, we will have taken another substantial \nstep forward for our values as Americans.\n  It has been 10 years since the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention \nAct was first introduced in the Senate. During this period we have seen \na marked increase in hate crimes. In my home State of Colorado there \nwere 156 hate crime incidents reported to the FBI in 2007; 75 of those \nwere on account of the victims' race and 32 on account of his or her \nsexual orientation.\n  One of these victims was 18-year-old Angie Zapata, of Greeley, who \nwas beaten to death in her home in July of 2008. Press accounts \nindicated Angie's attacker said he went after her because he hates \ntransgender and gay people. A jury found that the attacker was \nmotivated by prejudice based on sexual orientation. The jury's verdict \nmarked Colorado's first ever conviction for a hate crime against a \ntransgendered person. The crime was heinous and the attacker will \nrightly serve his time because of the laws in my State. Our experience \nin Colorado, which already has strong hate crimes laws on the books, \nserves as an example of how to protect the civil rights of all \nAmericans, regardless of where they live.\n  Our laws must reflect our values. Communities are threatened anytime \nthere is a violent crime motivated by racial animus or by bigotry \nagainst one's gender or sexual orientation. Hate crimes are serious \nchallenges for our law enforcement personnel. They can lead to \nadditional crimes, and they can raise the level of animosity among \ncommunities. These unique challenges have rightly caused Congress to \nbecome involved. As we learned in the civil rights era, sometimes \ncommunities need assistance and resources from the Federal Government \nwhen they have to confront the most emotional and dangerous kinds of \ncrimes. The Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act is designed to \nhelp local law enforcement manage these situations and deter hate \ncrimes from ever happening in the first place.\n  This important law strengthens the current Federal hate crimes \nstatute by protecting would-be targets of violence based on gender, \nsexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. It closes a \nsignificant loophole under current law that prevents hate crime \nprosecution when a victim is not engaged in a federally protected \nactivity. All victims should be protected, and these crimes should be \ndeterred regardless of where or when an attacker may be planning to \ncommit a violent crime.\n  This legislation also authorizes the Department of Justice to provide \ngrants to State, local, and tribal authorities to investigate or \nprosecute hate crimes more effectively. Grants are also made available \nfor programs that combat hate crimes committed by juveniles, including \ntraining by local law enforcement to effectively identify, prosecute, \nand prevent those hate crimes.\n  I thank all of those who worked so hard over the past 10 years to \nupdate our hate crimes laws, particularly the late Senator Ted Kennedy, \nwho long championed this cause. In a speech he gave back in 2007 on \nthis very subject, Senator Kennedy asked how long those living in fear \nof attack or reprisal would have to wait until Congress did the right \nthing. How long, he asked, would it take for Washington to show that \nviolence on account of gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity \nis absolutely inconsistent with our values and as such will not be \ntolerated in the United States of America.\n  Today, is Senator Kennedy's answer. Today we send a bill to the \nPresident that ensures America's enduring principles apply to all \nAmericans. Today we approve a bill that, as Senator Kennedy predicted, \n``sends a message about freedom and equality that will resonate around \nthe world.'' It is a proud amendment. I urge my colleagues to set the \nright example and pass this important legislation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, if the Senate votes to pass the \nnational defense authorization bill, Congress will at long last pass \ninto law the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention \nAct of 2009. It is an important and historic step to reaffirm our \nvalues as Americans and show that violence against members of any group \nbecause of who they are will not be tolerated in this country. I am \nproud that this Congress and this administration have made this \ncritical measure a top priority.\n\n[[Page S10673]]\n\n  This is a step that has taken far too long. I have been working hard, \nas have many others, for more than a decade since the horrific murders \nof Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr., galvanized the Nation. When \nAttorney General Holder testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee \nin June, it was the second time he had testified in support of this \nimportant bill. A full decade earlier he had testified as Deputy \nAttorney General in support of the passage of hate crimes. Since that \ntime, he noted that ``there have been over 77,000 hate crime incidents \nreported to the FBI, not counting crimes committed in 2008 and 2009. \nThat is nearly one hate crime every hour of every day over a decade.''\n  I offered the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act as an \namendment to the Defense authorization bill, and I was joined by my \nfellow New Englander, Senator Collins, in the effort. She has taken a \nleadership role on several important civil rights measures and now can \nadd this to her long list of bipartisan accomplishments.\n  With the passage of this measure, for the first time our Federal law \nwill protect a segment of Americans who have been under attack for too \nlong. The LGBT community deserves its civil rights just as the rest of \nAmericans do.\n  I commend Senator Levin for working so hard to ensure that this \nprovision would go forward as part of the conference report. I \ncongratulate the Senate majority leader, Senator Reid, for his \nessential role in this matter. Yesterday I noted the steadfast \nleadership Senator Ted Kennedy provided on this issue, as on so many \nothers, for more than a decade. We think of him as we see his good work \ngo forward.\n  Earlier this month was the 11th anniversary of the brutal murder of \nMatthew Shepard, a college student who was beaten and killed solely \nbecause of his sexual orientation. Matthew's parents have worked \ncourageously and tirelessly for this legislation, which aims to ensure \nthat this kind of despicable act will never be tolerated in this \ncountry. The bill was named for Matthew, as well as for James Byrd, \nJr., a Black man who was killed in 1998 because of his race in another \nawful crime that galvanized the Nation against hateful violence. We \nappreciate and honor the important contributions of James Byrd's \nfamily, as they have worked hard for this legislation.\n  As I have said many times, the years since these two horrific crimes \nhave made clear that hate crimes remain a serious and growing problem. \nThe recent shooting at the Holocaust Memorial Museum showed that these \nvicious crimes continue to haunt our country. This bipartisan \nlegislation will help law enforcement respond more effectively to this \nproblem.\n  I understand that a Senator on the other side indicated that we were \nconsidering a fully inclusive hate crimes measure today based solely on \n``perceived bias.'' I would note for the record that this measure would \npunish violent acts that result in bodily injury that were motivated by \nhate. Each of these elements needs to be proven to a jury beyond a \nreasonable doubt. So it is just plain wrong to claim that perceived \nbiases will be elevated to a crime.\n  I understand that some have alleged that this has not gone through \nthe Judiciary Committee. In fact, we did consider this legislation at a \nhearing in June. The Attorney General of the United States testified in \nsupport of the legislation, and we had a thorough debate about the \nmerits of the legislation in committee. I would also note that adding \nthe hate crimes measure to the Defense authorization bill has occurred \nin the past, as recently as last Congress. Its inclusion this year \ncould not have come as a surprise to anyone here.\n  This same hate crimes bill also passed the Senate in 2004, 2000, and \n1999. The amendment passed this year in July on a bipartisan vote. \nThere has been plenty of consideration and process.\n  President Obama has worked closely with us to facilitate the quick \npassage of this vital hate crimes legislation. In his first few months \nin office, he has already acted to ensure that Federal benefits are \nawarded more equitably, regardless of sexual orientation, and now to \nensure that this hate crimes legislation becomes law. Unlike in \nprevious years, we have a President who understands that crimes \nmotivated by bias are particularly pernicious crimes that affect more \nthan just their victims and those victims' families. I expect the \nPresident to sign this legislation without delay.\n  Hate crimes instill fear in those who have no connection to the \nvictim other than a shared characteristic such as race or sexual \norientation. For nearly 150 years, we have responded as a nation to \ndeter and to punish violent denials of civil rights by enacting Federal \nlaws to protect the civil rights of all of our citizens. The Matthew \nShepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 \ncontinues that great and honorable tradition. Passage of this \nlegislation, at last, will show once again that America values \ntolerance and acts to protect all of its people.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico.) The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today with regard to the importance \nof international development efforts in Afghanistan, as well as the \nrole of women in that same country. Much of the public debate around \nAfghanistan is focused on troop levels, especially in Washington. This \nis a critical decision on troops, but a focus only on troops ignores so \nmany of the crucial elements that will contribute to our strategy in \nAfghanistan; namely, what should be done to help promote democratic \ninstitutions. That is one question we have to spend more time on. How \ncan we accelerate the training of the Afghan security forces? What \nimpact does Pakistan have on this conflict? I have spoken about these \nissues in depth. I want to directly address the formidable development \nchallenges before the Afghan people and what this means for the \nsecurity environment.\n  Let me be clear. We are not conducting development in Afghanistan for \ndevelopment's sake. Promoting development has a direct national \nsecurity impact and, if done right, can result in a safer environment \nfor coalition troops, as well as Afghan security forces, and it can \nultimately contribute to stability in the region.\n  Before discussing these issues, I want to applaud the extraordinary \nefforts of Senator Kerry, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, to seek a resolution to the Afghan election crisis. As we \nall saw from news reports, his tireless work over the past few days to \nsupport the democratic process in Afghanistan renewed the chance for \nmuch needed legitimacy in the electoral process. I hope the second \nround of the elections will be free from violence and the terrible \nfraud that was seen in August.\n  I also want to recognize the work of the Electoral Complaints \nCommission, which meticulously rooted out corruption in the election \nprocess. Those guardians of Afghan democracy should be commended for \ntheir work, and I trust they will perform equally well on November 7 \nand the days following.\n  The development changes facing Afghanistan are formidable. Destroyed \nby 30 years of war, Afghanistan is the third poorest country in the \nworld. Large swaths of the country don't have access to roads, \nelectricity, water, or prospects for jobs.\n  As I discussed on the floor last week, there are some positive \naspects of the development process already in Afghanistan. There are \nnow 6 million children in school, one-third of whom are girls. Basic \nhealth care now reaches more of the country than ever before. The \npublic health care system has made strides in this regard to have \norganizations such as the Pennsylvania-based Cure International, which \nis working to train doctors. The economy has grown at 10 percent a year \nin aggregate terms, and mobile telephones are starting to connect more \nand more people across the country. When this process began in 2002, we \nstarted at zero. We should not be content with the pace of reform in \nAfghanistan, but we should acknowledge that some progress has been \nmade.\n  While the debate in Washington revolves around the prospect of a \ntroop\n\n[[Page S10674]]\n\nsurge, not much has been said about the civilian surge to assist in \ndevelopment and diplomatic efforts. I support this important \ninitiative, but we must encourage the administration to match this \ninternational surge with an Afghan surge. We must increase our efforts \nto build the skills and capacity of Afghans to develop Afghanistan. We \nmust constantly work to instill the idea that Afghanistan's prospects \nlie not with the efforts of the international community--though we \nshould do our part, and we have and we will--but with the talent and \nthe will of the Afghan people. It is not only the best way to conduct \ndevelopment, it is in fact the only way it has ever been truly \nsuccessful.\n  The strong roots of an Afghan-led development process have been years \nin the making. The Government's National Solidarity Program has worked \nto develop the ability of Afghan communities to identify, plan, \nimplement, and monitor their own development projects. This model of \ncommunity-based development is essential to building civic ownership \nfor the country's future. The World Bank reports that more than 20,000 \ncommunities now have local government consultative institutions or \ncommunity development councils. Afghanistan's Ministry of Rural \nRehabilitation and Development oversees this effort, which is financed \nby a consortium of international donors. It employs more than 4,000 \nAfghan nationals and has developed the skills of 600,000 Community \nDevelopment Council members across the country in planning and \nsupervising projects and managing finances transparently. More than 80 \npercent of the labor has been provided by communities themselves, \ngenerating wages for the poor and cutting in half the cost of their \nprojects.\n  While substantial progress has been made, the National Solidarity \nPlan faces three main challenges: First, the security environment is \nthe biggest hurdle to rapid development. Second, the international \ncommunity can play a helpful role in supporting the government's \nefforts to ensure that these structural gains are sustainable. The \ndemocratic process has begun to take hold in these communities but will \nrequire years to grow strong roots. Finally, the Community Development \nCouncils will need regular assistance in building capacity. As local \ncommunities start to work together on multivillage projects, they will \nneed technical help to implement the projects.\n  Afghanistan's development infrastructure is important and represents \nan important effort to mesh traditional community-based decisionmaking \nstructures with the official governing structure. In order for these \nbodies to work properly, there must be an important focus on the \nprovision of basic services, irrigation, access to transportation and \nthe construction of roads, basic health care and education, and access \nto drinking water and electricity.\n  Much of the development work on Afghanistan must take place in an \nenvironment of extreme insecurity. USAID works in countries all over \nthe world, but its impressive staff doesn't usually contend with the \nsmall arms fire, roadside bombs, and the militant attacks that they \nconfront in Afghanistan. In the most crucial regions of Afghanistan, \nalong the Pashtun belt in the east and south, USAID must operate \nalongside the U.S. military, the State Department, and the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture in provincial reconstruction teams. The \nmilitary forces provide protection for the aid workers and diplomats as \nthey seek to implement their projects. This configuration is clearly \nnot ideal but has allowed for some development progress and has also \nplayed a critical role in the overall counterinsurgency effort.\n  While there has been significant funding provided for development \nefforts, not enough of the funding is actually reaching the Afghan \npeople. Lately, international organizations have been criticized for \nhigh consultant fees and overhead costs associated with doing business \nin Afghanistan. Some nongovernmental organizations, so-called NGOs, and \ncontractors are performing excellent work in extraordinary \ncircumstances in Afghanistan. While much of the cost associated with \ntheir efforts is understandable given the high pricetag associated with \nsecurity and paying quality staff to live in Afghanistan, I do believe \nthat more of an effort should be made and must be made to work directly \nwith the Afghan organizations where possible to implement development \nprograms. This will likely mean an increase in USAID staff to oversee \nimplementation of the programs and assure accountability. This would \nalso serve in rebuilding USAID's capability to implement programs \ninstead of relying upon contractors. Developing the capacity of USAID \nis long overdue. I want to acknowledge Ambassador Holbrooke's work in \nthis regard and support his efforts to deliver more of our assistance \ndirectly to the Afghan people.\n  International development experts have highlighted the critical role \nplayed by women in the security, stability, and development of \nAfghanistan. We cannot expect progress on any of these fronts if half \nof the population is ignored. As I have said before, we have seen \nprogress on women's and girls' political participation, education, and \nhealth since the fall of the Taliban. However, women are still largely \nexcluded from public life and economic participation, and they remain \ntargets of endemic violence.\n\n  We must support the Afghan Government's efforts to empower women and \nensure their right to work in both public service and at community \nlevels. Promoting the economic participation of women will pay long-\nterm dividends in terms of education, health, GDP, and even the \nsecurity and stability of their country.\n  International development experts in the region have noted that women \nare more likely than men to invest their extra savings and earnings in \ntheir families, specifically toward much needed education and health \ncare, assisting women, whether through small grants, access to credit, \nor skills training as a potential to improve the lives of the entire \nhousehold, including those susceptible to be drawn in by the Taliban.\n  Military strategists have focused on this important nexus of \nadvancing development for women and security. In a society where young \nmen are loathe to make decisions against their mother's wishes, \nconvincing mothers that their children have future prospects beyond \njoining a militant group is a key part of our strategy. By working with \nwomen on a host of development issues, international and Afghan groups \ncan have a clear and convincing impact on the security environment \nwhere our soldiers are operating today.\n  In closing, the security challenges in Afghanistan grow more acute by \nthe day. We are rightly focused on the question of troop deployment and \nhow to stem the tide of militancy across the country. But as we debate \nthe merits of our presence in Afghanistan and our efforts to bring \nstability, we must fully account for the developmental shortcomings in \nthe country. This, as well as the establishment of durable democratic \ninstitutions, will most likely be the ultimate determining factor in \nresolving this conflict.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express how pleased I am \nwith the inclusion of the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act of \n2009 within the Department of Defense authorization bill. This day is a \nlong time coming, and I am proud we have successfully stood up against \nhate crimes in this country. Such acts will not be tolerated in our \nsociety. The American public supported this goal. According to a Gallup \npoll from 2007, 68 percent of Americans support extending hate crimes \nprotection to groups based on sexual orientation and gender identity, \nincluding 60 percent of Republicans and 62 percent of individuals who \nfrequently attend church.\n  Hate crimes continue to occur in our country every day. According to \nrecent FBI data, there were over 7,600 reported hate crimes in the \nUnited States in 2007. That is nearly one every hour of every day. Over \n150 of those instances occurred in my home State of Maryland.\n\n[[Page S10675]]\n\n  The passage of the legislation demonstrates that the Congress is \nfighting for people such as Stephen Johns, who was killed at the U.S. \nHolocaust Museum; Lawrence King, a 15-year-old student murdered in his \nhigh school because he was gay; James Byrd, who was beaten and dragged \nby a truck for 2 miles because he was Black; and for the 28-year-old \nCalifornia woman who was gang-raped by four men because she was a \nlesbian. Today, we stand and say: No more. No longer shall we tolerate \nthese types of actions.\n  During the recent confirmation hearing of Justice Sonia Sotomayor, I \nspoke about the importance of standing against hate. I expressed the \nimportance of a Justice and a Court that will continue to move forward \nin protecting civil rights and not turning back the clock. I hope the \nCourt will stand with us against such actions and continue to protect \nimportant civil rights laws.\n  According to the recent Leadership Conference on Civil Rights \neducation fund report entitled ``Confronting the New Faces of Hate,'' \nhate crimes against Latinos has been increasing steadily since 2003. \nThis marked increase also closely correlates with the increasing heated \ndebate over comprehensive immigration reform. There was also a 5-year \nhigh in victimization rates in 2007 toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, and \ntransgendered individuals. That number has increased by almost 6 \npercent. The number of White supremacy groups has increased by 54 \npercent, and African Americans continue to experience the largest \nnumber of hate crimes, with an annual number essentially unchanged over \nthe past 10 years. While religion-based offenses decreased, the number \nof reported anti-Jewish crimes increased slightly between 2006 and \n2007. The Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act is a necessary and \nappropriate response to this ongoing threat to our communities.\n  Currently, 45 States and the District of Columbia have enacted hate \ncrime laws and have taken a stand against hate in their own States. \nThirty-one of those States have already included sexual orientation in \ntheir definition of what constitutes a hate crime. Twenty-seven States \nand the District of Columbia prohibit violent crimes based on a \nvictim's gender. States have a patchwork of hate crimes statutes that \nleaves gaps which need to be filled in order to have an effective \nresponse and prosecution of these crimes.\n  The Federal Government has a clear responsibility to respond to hate \ncrimes. Current Federal hate crime laws are based only on race, color, \nnational origin, and religion. We need to include gender, disability, \ngender identity, and sexual orientation.\n  Current law also requires the victim to be participating in a \nfederally protected activity, such as attending school or voting. Those \nwho commit hate crimes are not bound to certain jurisdictions, and \nneither should the people who prosecute them, which is why this \nlegislation removes the requirement that a victim be participating in a \nfederally protected activity. The Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes \nPrevention Act will make sure all Americans are equally protected \nagainst hate crimes.\n  The legislation will provide necessary resources to our State and \nlocal governments to fight hate crimes. Specifically, it will provide \ngrants for State, local, and tribal law enforcement entities for \nprosecuting, programming, and education related to hate crimes \nprosecution and prevention. The bill will assist States and provide \nthem with additional resources, not diminish their role in managing \ncriminal activities within their own States. The bill supplements State \nand local law enforcement efforts.\n  Additionally and most importantly, the legislation was carefully \ndrafted to maintain protections for Americans' first amendment rights. \nNothing in this legislation diminishes an American's freedom of \nreligion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, or freedom to \nassemble. The Supreme Court has already ruled that such laws do not \nobstruct free speech. Let me be clear: The Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes \nPrevention Act targets acts, not speech.\n  Hate crimes affect not just the victims; they victimize the entire \ncommunity and make residents fearful. We cannot allow our communities \nto be terrorized by hatred and violence. Today, we hold true to our \npromise for a better tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for the \nnext 7 or 8 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, in the election of 1912, Theodore \nRoosevelt and the Progressive Party laid out an ambitious platform. \nT.R., as he was referred to, was seeking a third term as President of \nthe United States. During his campaign, he called for a minimum wage. \nHe demanded child labor laws and believed occupational safety should be \na priority across America. Today we would take such measures for \ngranted, but at the time, nearly a century ago, they were considered \nvery progressive.\n  However, there is at least one major part of Roosevelt's platform \nthat was never enacted. He called for ``the protection of home life \nagainst hazards of sickness, irregular employment and old age, through \nthe adoption of a system of social insurance adapted to American use.'' \nNinety-seven years ago, Teddy Roosevelt was talking about health care \nreform--but not just any kind of reform, he was talking about a public \noption. He knew even then that the American people needed to have \nquality affordable coverage that can only be provided by a ``system of \nsocial insurance'' much like the public option we are talking about in \nthe current legislation.\n  That was the origin of the debate that rages on even today. Since \nthat time, nearly every President and Congress has had to wrestle with \na broken health care system; a system in which costs continue to rise \neven as relative health outcomes keep going down; a system that allows \ninsurance companies to hold American families in a vice grip, squeezing \nthem for exorbitant profits; a system that affords no choice, no \ncompetition, and no accountability for the American people. I believe \nthat is fundamentally wrong. I believe fixing our broken system is \nnothing less than a moral imperative. I would imagine Teddy Roosevelt \nshared this belief, and since the day he raised this issue in 1912, no \nfewer than 10 U.S. Presidents of both political parties have also \nsupported meaningful reform.\n\n  President Herbert Hoover referred to the health care crisis as ``one \nof the most vital problems facing our people today'' and called for \nadequate care for every single American at a reasonable cost.\n  His successor in the White House, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, said \nthat ``the health of the people is a public concern'' and ``it is clear \nthat there is need for a coordinated national program of action.''\n  When Harry Truman became President, he also took up this cause but \nquickly discovered that the special interests were a major threat to \nreform. He said:\n\n       I usually find that those who are loudest in protesting \n     against medical help by the Federal Government are those who \n     do not need help.\n\n  I will repeat that, quoting President Truman. He said:\n\n       I usually find that those who are loudest in protesting \n     against medical help by the Federal Government are those who \n     do not need help.\n\n  By the end of his Presidency, his effort had fallen short as well. He \nwas defeated by the same kinds of influential groups that are trying to \ndistract us even today. After Truman left office, he told friends that \none of his deepest disappointments was his ``failure to defeat \norganized opposition to a national compulsory health insurance \nprogram.'' But even then, in the face of those who had an interest in \nmaintaining the status quo, reform with a public option was not dead.\n  The next President to raise the standard was John F. Kennedy, who\n\n[[Page S10676]]\n\nsaid that the strength of a nation ``can be no greater than the health \nand vitality of its population.'' He believed swift action was \nnecessary. But his time was cut tragically short before he could take \naction. In the decades to follow, it would be his youngest brother, Ted \nKennedy, the lion of this Senate, who would wage the fight that has \nbrought us to this junction in history today.\n  But in the uncertain days after John Kennedy's tragic loss, the cause \nof health reform next fell on Lyndon Johnson, who embraced it as \nstrongly as any President ever has. He said:\n\n       For a long time in our country, we have considered public \n     support for education [to be a] basic investment, but today \n     we are declaring that the health of our people is just \n     equally worthy of that support, [and] equally important to \n     our Nation's future.\n\n  But the end of Johnson's Presidency was wrapped up in the escalating \nVietnam war, and Richard Nixon was swept into office.\n  President Nixon faced a health crisis not unlike the one we face \ntoday. Mr. President, 25 million Americans were without insurance. The \nnumber has almost doubled since then. Costs were escalating, and the \nPresident knew something had to be done about it. He said:\n\n       Comprehensive health insurance is an idea whose time has \n     come in America. Let us act now to assure all Americans \n     financial access to high quality medical care.\n\n  Some of my colleagues across the aisle find it hard to believe that a \nRepublican President made that statement almost 40 years ago. I urge \nthem to consult the record for themselves. Back then, members of both \nparties agreed at the highest levels that it was time for comprehensive \nreform.\n  So surely we can find agreement today, in the face of a problem that \nhas gotten far worse.\n  In 1977, when President Carter took office, he said the American \nhealth care system ``has left us unhealthy and unwell at the same \ntime.'' His reform package included a public option. But, sadly, those \nefforts were blocked by the political opponents in Congress.\n  Finally, in the early 1990s, President Clinton thought he had victory \nwithin reach. He called for universal, comprehensive health care and \nsaid reform must be ``our most urgent priority.'' But, once again, the \nopposition succeeded in delaying and distracting our efforts, and \nreform fell by the wayside one last time.\n  When President George W. Bush took office, he recognized that \nAmerica's health care system was broken and in need of reform. He even \nsaid that ``government has got to take an active role in reform.'' But \nhe stopped short of calling for a public plan, and he left our broken \nsystem much as he found it.\n  This is where we find ourselves today. Despite the leadership of 10 \nPresidents from both political parties, we are faced with the same \nbroken system that has troubled our elected leaders for almost a \ncentury. Now this momentous question has fallen to us: How will we meet \nthis test that so many have failed?\n  These 10 Presidents were Republicans, Democrats, conservatives, and \nliberals. If these men had ever met one another, they probably would \nhave found little they could agree upon. These 10 people held our \nNation's highest office at very different times in the last century. \nThey faced different challenges, confronted different obstacles, and \nled our Nation through decades of peace and war, ease and unrest, \nprosperity and depression.\n  But although their lives and administrations might have been very \ndifferent, there was at least one thing they could all agree on. There \nwas one thing all these Presidents agreed on. Every one of them \nsupported comprehensive health care reform. Every one of them knew our \nsystem was broken, and almost every one of them knew some form of \npublic option was the right answer. That kind of broad and long-\nstanding bipartisan consensus is not only remarkable, it is almost \nunheard of in American history.\n  Let us take up this cause as our own. Let us make good on the promise \nfirst articulated by Teddy Roosevelt almost 100 years ago and supported \nby so many people since then. When President Barack Obama came to \noffice less than a year ago, he vowed to succeed where so many of his \npredecessors had failed. He became the 11th President in the last 100 \nyears to take up the challenge of health care. Thanks to his \nleadership, I have faith there will not need to be a 12th President to \nwork on this issue. This time, we will not fail. We will not fall short \non this issue.\n  At long last, it is time to heed this call. The weight of history and \nof consensus cannot be denied and it can no longer be ignored. We must \npass meaningful health care reform that includes a public option. Our \nNation has been debating this issue for nearly 100 years. Now is not \nthe time to back down. We have talked for a century. So let us now act \nwith conviction.\n  Friends, colleagues, fellow Americans, once again, our time has come. \nWe must cast aside the tired constraints of partisanship and work \ntogether on behalf of the hardworking Americans we swore to represent. \nEleven Presidents have stood up for health care reform, and now, \ncolleagues, it is our turn. Let us succeed where our predecessors have \nfailed, and let us write this history. Let us serve the sacred trust \nthe American people have placed in us, not merely as political leaders \nbut as lawmakers.\n  Colleagues, let us be statesmen. After 11 Presidents and nearly 100 \nyears, it is time to vote for health care reform that includes a public \noption. It is time to stand up for the American people.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Debt and Deficits\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to speak about one of the most \nsignificant issues we have confronting us as a nation, our rising \ndeficits and debt. At the end of the last fiscal year, which just \nconcluded at the beginning of October, end of September, we determined \nwe had a $1.4 trillion deficit--$1.4 trillion.\n  It is projected that we will have trillion-dollar deficits for the \nnext 10 years under the President's budgets as President Obama has \nbrought them forward. Yesterday we had a vote not to do cloture on a \nbill the administration supported, and which was brought forward here, \nwhich would have put another $300 billion onto the Federal debt to pay \nfor what is known as the doctors fix.\n  The doctors fix is something which should occur. We have done it \naround here before. We have done it every year for about 8 years; that \nis, reimbursing doctors at a fair rate rather than having their rates \ncut. But we have always paid for it.\n  But yesterday there was an attempt by the leadership on the other \nside of the aisle to pass a bill which would have not paid for the \ndoctors fix and which would have put $300 billion of new debt onto our \nchildren's backs; so that every time somebody walked into a doctor's \noffice and was reimbursed under Medicare, that bill, whether it was for \na flu shot or whether it was for serious disease issues, would have \nbeen taken and passed directly to our children rather than paid for \ntoday, as it should have been. So it was a totally irresponsible act to \ntry to increase the debt by $300 billion in order to take care of the \ndoctors fix. But that was what was attempted. Fortunately that failed. \nAt least as of yesterday it failed.\n  There was bipartisan appreciation in the Senate. All of the \nRepublicans voted against doing that, and 12 Democrats and 1 \nIndependent voted against doing it, and that was good. That was a good \nsign to the American people that maybe we are finally taking the \ndeficit and the debt seriously.\n  The reason I wanted to speak today on this matter is because we are \ngetting some significant warning signs, some flashing yellow lights \nthat are moving from yellow, maybe, to red from the world community \nthat we better do something about our debt and our deficit or the world \ncommunity is going to react to it.\n  About 4 months ago now the Chinese, who are the primary owners of our \ndebt--in other words, when we spend $1.4 trillion more than we have in \na year like we did last year or we spend $1 trillion more than we have \nevery year for the next 10 years as is being\n\n[[Page S10677]]\n\nproposed by the President, we have to get that money from somewhere. We \nhave to borrow it from somebody. Someone has to be willing to lend us \nthat money, that $1 trillion, that $1.4 trillion.\n  Well, the countries that have that type of money and are willing to \nlend it to us are countries such as China and Russia and Saudi Arabia. \nThey have surpluses in their economies. They are not running deficits \nin their governments, so they have surpluses. They have, historically, \nat least over the last few years, been willing to buy our treasuries, \nour notes to finance the government operation in the United States.\n  About 4 months ago the leadership of the Chinese Government said: \nWell, we are getting a little concerned. We are still going to buy \nAmerican treasuries. We are still going to help you finance your \ndeficit. But you have to do something about this because we are \nconcerned about the value of what we are buying. We are concerned that \nthose IOUs we are buying from you may not be worth what we are paying \nfor them on face value if you continue to run your deficit that you \nhave.\n  That was a fairly large warning sign from a country which obviously \nhas not historically been close to us but which is one of our largest \ntrading partners, and which is, whether we like it or not, buying up \nall of this debt when we run these massive deficits, or a lot of this \ndebt.\n  Another warning sign came at us when the dollar, which has \nhistorically been the reserve currency of the world--in other words, \ncountries hold dollars in order to maintain their own structure of \nreserves for their countries. The dollar started to be discussed as \nmaybe not the best reserve currency, and there have been a number of \nrumors and some representations by some Finance Ministers around the \nworld that people might not want to use the dollar any longer as their \nreserve currency. They may want to use some other currency--maybe the \neuro or some basket of currencies, maybe the euro, the yen, or maybe \njust use commodities or maybe use IMF drawing rights, a whole series of \ndifferent ideas.\n  What does that reflect? That reflects that people are not too \nconfident in our future ability to maintain and defend the value of the \ndollar. Why are they not confident about that? Well, they are not \nconfident about it because they are looking at the deficits we are \nrunning. They are looking at the debt we are piling up, and they are \nsaying: Hold it. How are you going to pay all of that off? If you put \n$13, $14, $15, $16 trillion worth of debt on your Nation, if you take \nyour public debt from 38 percent of GDP up to 80 percent of GDP or \nmore, how are you going to pay that off, United States?\n  That is a legitimate question because there are only a few ways it \ncan be paid off. One of them, unfortunately, is by using inflation, and \nthat devalues the dollar and it devalues all of that debt people have \nbought. That is why we are hearing more and more that people, first, \nare worried about using the dollar as their reserve currency because \nthey do not want to see its value drop; and, secondly, they are worried \nabout buying our debt.\n  So we are getting some serious caution lights from the international \ncommunity about the fact that we are running these massive deficits and \nthis massive debt. Just yesterday, I think one of the most serious \ncaution lights came out because there are groups in this world, small \ngroups of people--Moody's and Standard & Poor's--who basically look at \nthe currencies and the debt of various nations and they do that also \nfor companies and they rate the debt. The rest of the world's financial \nactivities look at those ratings because they are considered to be of \nvery high caliber and very high standard. They allow people in other \nplaces to be able to assess the value of the debt they might want to \nbuy.\n  So if you want to buy debt from XYZ country, you look at Moody's or \nStandard, that has taken a hard look at that country's debt, evaluated \nit, and they will tell you whether it is rated AAA, AA, A. That \ndetermines how much it is going to cost a country to lend to you. That \nwill determine the amount of interest rate on that debt because if it \nis not AAA, which is the best rated debt, then people are going to be \nless likely to invest in it. If they do invest in it, they are going to \nwant a higher return because they are going to be at bigger risk \nbecause they know that debt might not be paid back. If it is paid back, \nit might be paid back in devalued dollars or devalued currency of that \ncountry.\n  So, historically, American debt, the Treasury note, has been the gold \nstandard for the world. In fact, it is technically the gold standard. \nMost people use it as the reserve fund. When the world went off the \ngold standard, the dollar basically became the way people maintained \nand conserved their assets. They would invest in Treasury notes and \nknow that the treasuries were always safe. It was always determined \nthat Treasury notes were safe because the United States always was \ngoing to pay back its debt.\n  So the United States has always had a AAA rating. That is hugely \nimportant to us as a nation. It is hard to appreciate as just an \nordinary American going to work every day and trying to make ends meet \nthat the AAA rating of the United States is important to them, but it \nis. It affects everything in this country that has to do with credit.\n  If the United States were to lose its AAA rating, all credit would go \nup, and the costs in this country. It would be much harder to buy a \nhouse because the interest rates would be higher. It would be harder to \nbuy a car because the interest rates would be higher. It would be \nharder to send a child to college because the interest rates would be \nhigher. Everything is tied to the fact that treasuries have AAA \nratings. It has always been presumed that they would.\n\n  In the post-World War II period, it has always been presumed that the \nUnited States, the strongest economy in the world, the most vibrant \neconomy in the world, would always have the gold standard for the debt \nit issues, that it would always be a AAA-rated event. Well, as a result \nof our profligate nature as a country and as a Congress, as a result of \nhaving run up these massive deficits, we are getting a very large \nyellow flashing light from the rating agencies.\n  They are saying this--this was an October 22 news report from \nReuters:\n\n       The United States, which posted a record deficit in the \n     last fiscal year, may lose its AAA rating if it does not \n     reduce the gap to a manageable level in the next 3-4 years.\n\n  That is according to Moody's Investors Service.\n\n       The AAA rating of the United States is not guaranteed.\n\n  Steve Hess, Moody's lead analyst for the United States, said in an \ninterview on Reuters Television:\n\n       So if you do not get the deficit down in the next 3-4 years \n     to a sustainable level, then the rating will be in jeopardy.\n\n  Those are words that should make us in the Congress pause because \nthey are directed right at us. The most sophisticated and important \nevaluator of America's deficit situation and debt, Moody's ratings \nservice, is saying if we as a Congress do not do something within the \nnext 3 to 4 years to bring our debt under control, and our deficits \ndown, we may jeopardize the AAA rating of the United States.\n  I can think of nothing that would be more irresponsible for a \nCongress to do to the American people than to jeopardize and put at \nrisk the AAA rating of this country. Maybe only after disarming \nourselves in the face of a potential terrorist threat or the use of a \nweapon of mass destruction, I can think of nothing which would have a \nlarger impact on our populous than for the Congress to put in place \nfiscal policies which would jeopardize our ability to sell bonds, \nAmerican debt around the world at a reasonable price, and put at risk \nthe value of the dollar and the status of the dollar as the reserve \ncurrency of the world, as a result of putting at risk the AAA rating of \nour bonds.\n  That is exactly what we are doing. This gentleman, Mr. Hess, said we \nhave to, within the next 3 or 4 years, put in place a manageable plan, \na realistic plan, that will address the deficit and debt of the United \nStates.\n  Are we doing that now? We are doing just the opposite. Just yesterday \nthis Congress tried to pass $300 billion of new debt for ordinary \nexpenses, for daily expenses of paying doctors. We were going to give \nan IOU to our children and our grandchildren 5, 10 years from now. \nTotal irresponsibility.\n\n[[Page S10678]]\n\n  Last week it was the White House suggesting we do the exact same \nthing in Social Security for $13 billion. A couple of months ago we did \nthe same thing on cash for clunkers for $5 billion. A budget was passed \nby this Congress, which does it for the whole Nation--it creates $1 \ntrillion of unfunded liability and deficits for the next 10 years every \nyear.\n  Now we have this health care bill coming at us, which is going to \nincrease the size of the government by $1 to $2 trillion, which is \nrepresented that it is paid for, but that is only because they phase in \nthe expenses 4 years after they phase in the income and thus are able \nto match 10 years of income versus 6 years of expenses. So they claim \nit is paid for.\n  When the bill is fully phased in, it will not be paid for. It is \ngoing to be a huge cost to the Federal Government, and even if it were \npaid for, it would be taking massive resources in the area of Medicare \nby $400 billion and it is going to raise fees by $500 billion. Instead \nof using those resources to reduce the debt, it will use them to create \na brand new major entitlement at a time when we have on the books \nentitlements which we can't afford today.\n  Medicare has a $34 trillion unfunded liability. Yet we will add a new \nmajor entitlement on top of Medicare and Medicaid, and we will pay for \npart of it by cutting Medicare. Still, instead of cutting Medicare for \nthe purposes of paying for that, we should be using Medicare savings \nfor the purposes of making Medicare solvent. We should not be growing \nthe government. We are going to do a $1 to $2 trillion increase in the \nsize of government. I will absolutely guarantee that that will not be \nfully paid for and that a large percentage of that will go to our debt.\n  On top of having deficits which are already projected to be a \ntrillion dollars a year for the next 10 years, we are seeing a Congress \nwhich is being incredibly spendthrift in its approach to all sorts of \nareas: $300 billion to pay doctors, new debt; and who knows how much \nout of this health care bill. I am willing to bet the family farm that \nit will be well over a trillion dollars of new debt when it is fully \nphased in; new programs in the area of Social Security, which is \nalready bankrupt, unpaid for, added to the debt; new programs for this \nfavorite group, cash for clunkers or whatever the issue is of the day. \nWe are totally out of control on the spending side of the ledger.\n  It is not a revenue issue. It is a spending issue. Revenues have \nhistorically been about 19 percent of GDP. Spending has been about 20 \npercent of GDP. But under the budget which we have been given, \nindependent of the health care bill, spending goes from 20 percent of \nGDP up to 23 percent. And when we throw in this health care bill, we \nare heading toward 24, 25 percent of GDP. Revenues, if they maintain \ntheir historic levels once the recession is over, go back to 19 percent \nof GDP, but we still have a 6 to 7-percent gap because spending has \ngone up so much.\n  I appreciate the fact that this administration comes with a \nphilosophy--and they won the election--that we create prosperity by \ngrowing the government. The President said that. People around him said \nthat. Members on the other side of the aisle say that. We create \nprosperity by growing the government. But we don't create prosperity if \nwe let the government grow so fast that it can't be paid for. \nGovernment cannot be allowed to grow any faster than it can be paid \nfor. In my opinion, prosperity doesn't come from the government to \nbegin with. Prosperity comes from entrepreneurs who are willing to \ncreate risks and create jobs. Independent of that philosophical debate, \nthe simple fact is, if we allow government to grow a lot faster than we \nhave the capacity to pay for it, we create debt. It is that debt and \nthese independent people looking at that debt who are giving us these \nmassive caution lights and saying: Slow down, get your house in order.\n  People who are buying our debt around the world are saying it. People \nwho use the dollar as reserve currency around the world are saying it. \nAnd now Moody's, the clear, independent arbiter of what the value of \ndebt is and what its likelihood of repayment is, is saying it in the \nmost stark way. The AAA rating of the United States is not guaranteed, \nSteve Hess of Moody's, said. So if they don't get the deficit down in \nthe next 3 to 4 years to a sustainable level, the rating will be in \njeopardy.\n  We need to heed those words. We need to get some discipline around \nhere, and we need to stop having proposals which dramatically increase \nthe size of the government and continue to put us on a path where we \npass debt on to our children which will cause them to have a much lower \nstandard of living than we had and which will cause them to be unable \nto send their children to college, to buy their first home and afford a \ncar, because they will be confronting a nation where the debt is \nabsorbing so much of the productivity of the economy or where inflation \nhas basically priced them out of the markets.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from South \nCarolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the hate crimes \nprovision inserted in the Defense authorization conference report, \nfirst, of course, because hate crime legislation has nothing to do with \nthe Defense Department or with national security. Hate crimes actually \nhave nothing to do with crimes or with hate. It is very cynical that \nthis bill that funds our soldiers, who are fighting for our \nConstitution and our country, actually undermines the very principles \nthey are fighting for.\n  There are many practical problems with hate crimes legislation. The \nbroad language will unnecessarily overextend Federal law enforcement \npersonnel. It will undermine the effectiveness and confidence of local \nlaw enforcement. It will create conditions for arbitrary and \npoliticized prosecutions of certain cases.\n  I wish to focus on the basic, fundamental problems with any Federal \nhate crimes legislation. The rule of law requires opposition to this \nprinciple or this idea that we treat crimes differently. Let me first \nstate the obvious. Hate crimes are wrong. That is why they are already \nillegal. That is why they are already prosecuted. That is why the \nrights of victims are defended by law enforcement authorities at every \nlevel of government.\n  Strictly as a matter of justice, the hate crimes provision in this \nreport is offensive. It suggests that violence committed against \ncertain kinds of victims is worse, more in need of Federal intervention \nand swift justice. I am sure most parents of a minority, a homosexual \nor female victim would appreciate the extra concern, but the other side \nof the coin is the implication that these crimes committed against a \nnonspecial person should have less punishment. Where does that leave \nthe vast majority of victims' families who, because of the whims of \npolitical correctness, are not entitled under this legislation to \nspecial status and attention? How can a victim's perceived status or \nthe perpetrator's perceived opinions possibly determine the severity of \na crime?\n  The 14th amendment explicitly guarantees all citizens equal \nprotection under the law. But these hate crime provisions create a \nspecial class of victims whose protection of the law will be, in \nOrwell's phrase, more equal than others. If some are more equal than \nothers, some must be less equal. It is, then, inevitable that this hate \ncrimes provision will create the very problem it purports to solve.\n  This provision will also move our Nation a dangerous step closer to \nanother Orwellian concept: thought crimes. It would criminalize certain \nideas, and those ideas' involvement in a crime will make the crime more \ndeserving of prosecution. The problem, of course, is that politicians \nare claiming the power to decide which thoughts are criminal and which \nare not. Canadians right now live under this kind of regime where so-\ncalled human rights commissions, operating outside the normal legal \nprocess, prosecute citizens for espousing opinions the commissioners \ndisagree with. Today in the United States only actions are crimes. If \nwe pass this conference report, opinions will become crimes. What is to \nstop us from following the lead of the European countries and American \ncollege campuses where certain speech is criminalized? Can priests, \npastors, and rabbis be sure their preaching will not be prosecuted, if \nit says certain things are right and wrong? Again, in Canada, for \ninstance, Pastor Stephen Boissoin\n\n[[Page S10679]]\n\nwas so prosecuted by Alberta's Human Rights Commission for publishing \nletters critical of homosexuality. Or will this provision serve as a \nwarning to people not to speak out too loudly about their religious \nviews, lest Federal agents come knocking at their door? What about the \nunintended consequences such as pedophiles and sex offenders claiming \nprotected status under this provision as being disabled? There is no \nsuch thing as a criminal thought, only criminal acts. Once we endorse \nthe concept of thought crime, where will we draw the line? More \nimportantly, who will draw that line?\n  Under existing law, if my own children were attacked in a violent \ncrime, justice would demand that their attackers be pursued no more or \nless than the attackers of any other children. We all say we want a \ncolor-blind society, but we cannot have a color-blind society if we \ncontinue to write color-conscious laws. Our culture cannot expect to \ntreat people equally if the law--if our ruling class--treats citizens \nnot according to the content of their character but according to their \nrace, sex, ethnic identity, or gender identity.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider the implications of what we are \ndoing, the raw cynicism of attaching this type of controversial \nlegislation to a bill that funds the defense of the country. What type \nof legislative extortion will they consider next? I have the choice \nhere to vote for hate crimes legislation that I believe would undermine \nthe very justice system of the country or to vote against the defense \nof my country. I don't think we could be more cynical.\n  I urge colleagues to oppose this conference report unless and until \nthe principle of equal justice is upheld and the report's hate crimes \nprovisions are removed.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I would like to make a few comments \nabout the Defense authorization conference report, which we will vote \non, presumably, later this afternoon.\n  First, I wish to express my appreciation to the conferees for \nfighting for legislation we passed out of the Senate but which was not \nincluded in the House version of this bill. This legislation is \ncontained in sections 575 through 589 of the conference report, and it \nis called the Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act--or the MOVE \nAct--and it addresses a national disgrace.\n  Our military servicemembers, we know, put their lives on the line for \nus every day to protect our rights and freedoms. Yet too many of them \nwho are deployed overseas face many stumbling blocks and hurdles as \nthey attempt to cast their votes and participate in our national \nelections.\n  In 2008, more than a quarter of the ballots requested by uniformed \nand overseas voters went either uncollected or uncounted--a quarter of \nthe ballots--according to a recent survey of seven States with high \nmilitary populations.\n  Another recent study by the Heritage Foundation documented the \nproblems during the last election cycle. They looked at 20 States with \nlarge military populations and concluded that as many as three-quarters \nof our troops and their family members were ``disenfranchised by their \ninability to request an absentee ballot'' and that as many as one-third \nof the ballots that were requested never reached the appropriate \nelection officials to be counted on a timely basis.\n  Voting has remained a challenge for our troops and their families for \nmany reasons. One is our election laws are varied from State to State \nand they are very complex. We also know that multiple levels of \ngovernment bureaucracy are involved--from the local level, to the State \nlevel, to the Federal level. We know election challenges and other \nunforeseen events can delay the finalization of ballots. We know, with \nthe high tempo of military operations, frequent deployments for our \ntroops and their families make it hard for them to exercise their most \nfundamental civil right, which is the right to vote.\n  What this legislation does--the MOVE Act--is address several of the \nbiggest roadblocks our troops and their families face when attempting \nto vote.\n  First, the MOVE Act reduces the reliance on ``snail mail'' for \ncorrespondence between election officials and our troops.\n  Under current election laws, many troops must, first, mail a request \nfor an absentee ballot. Then they have to wait for the election \nofficials to mail them the blank ballot. Then they must mail the \ncompleted ballot in time to be counted.\n  This legislation requires election officials to create electronic \nblank ballots and to post them online to cut down on some of these \nsteps. Election officials must allow the use of faxes and e-mails to \nexpedite correspondence with our troops. Together, these reforms will \nreduce dependence on snail mail--until the servicemember is ready to \nreturn the completed ballot to be counted.\n  Second, the MOVE Act will expedite the return of the completed ballot \nto elections officials. Under current law, each servicemember is \nresponsible for making sure his or her ballot is postmarked and \nreturned on time. Our legislation--this bipartisan legislation--\nrequires the Department of Defense to take possession of completed \nballots and ensure they get to election officials on a timely basis by \nusing express mail, if necessary. This legislation will also require \nelection officials to give our troops at least--at least--45 days in \nwhich to return their ballots.\n  The MOVE Act contains many other commonsense reforms that were \nsuggested by other Senators and which will help end the effective \ndisenfranchisement of our troops and their family members. However, one \nkey provision of the bill we passed out of the Senate was modified in \nconference, and I believe all Senators should understand why and how \nthat happened.\n  The provision I am referring to was in the bill I introduced called \nthe Military Voters' Equal Access to Registration Act. It too became \npart of the MOVE Act and was amended to the Defense authorization bill \nas it passed out of the Senate. This legislation was designed to \nprovide basic voting assistance services to every servicemember and \nfamily member upon transfer to a new military installation, as well as \nat other significant transition points in their military careers.\n  As part of in-processing at each base, every servicemember was to be \noffered an opportunity to fill out a simple form that would, first, \nregister the servicemember or that family member to vote; it would, \nsecondly, update existing registrations; and it would request absentee \nballots for the next Federal election cycle. The Department of Defense \nwould have then been responsible for forwarding the completed forms to \nthe appropriate election officials.\n  This kind of voting assistance may sound familiar because it is \nnearly identical to the motor voter provisions contained in the \nNational Voter Registration Act. The logic is that military \ninstallations can and should offer the same kind of voting assistance \nthat their local department of motor vehicles would offer to them if \nthey lived at home stateside.\n  This legislation makes practical sense because many of our troops and \ntheir families are transferred quickly and without much notice, and it \nis difficult for them to keep changing the address that local officials \nhave on file.\n  During the conference process, when we were working with our \ncounterparts in the House of Representatives, this legislation was \nwatered down, unfortunately, and was made optional for the Department \nof Defense to offer voting assistance to our troops and their families.\n  I have to say, I was disappointed at this action because when our \ntroops are given orders to deploy elsewhere, obviously, those orders \nare not optional and neither should the requirement of the Department \nof Defense when it comes to helping make sure our deployed troops' \nvotes actually count. So it should not be optional for the Department \nof Defense to offer these services to the troops and their families \nwhen they arrive, as ordered, at their new post.\n  I am particularly concerned this legislation was weakened at the \nspecific\n\n[[Page S10680]]\n\nrequest of the Department of Defense. Furthermore, the Department's \nobjection was based on a misreading of the National Voter Registration \nAct. In fact, at our request, the Department of Defense's objections \nwere reviewed by subject matter experts at the Department of Justice. \nThese experts at the Department of Justice agreed with us on the clear \nmeaning of the law and that the Department of Defense had made an error \nin interpreting the Senate bill. Unfortunately, by then the damage was \ndone and House conferees deferred to the Department of Defense \ninterpretation of this legislation and made it optional at their \nrequest.\n  I do not think the Senate should be content to kick a field goal when \nwe could have scored a touchdown for the men and women of our U.S. \nmilitary--and we will.\n  First, I expect the Department of Defense to implement this optional \nprogram at every applicable military installation. I will request \nregular updates from the Department on its implementation, as well as \nany explanation for delays. We will not let up until we make sure this \nis complied with.\n  Secondly, I expect the Department of Defense to correct the official \nrecord and to make clear to the Members of the House and the Senate who \nwere conferees that its objection to this legislation was based on an \nerroneous interpretation of the law.\n  Third, I intend to offer amendments to other legislative vehicles to \ncorrect this watering down of this important provision--the language \npassed out of this Chamber unanimously--and I will continue to make \nsure it becomes ultimately the law of the land.\n  The provisions of the MOVE Act that did make it through conference, I \ndo believe, represent a clear win for our troops and their families. \nMany of my colleagues were instrumental in making this happen, and I \nthank all of them. Again, this was a bipartisan effort.\n  However, my colleagues in the conference also included language in \nthe Defense authorization bill which clearly does not belong in this \nbill and which I do not support. I refer, of course, to language \naddressing so-called hate crimes in the conference report.\n  I, in a previous life, was a judge for 13 years and attorney general \nof my State after that. I believe very firmly in the concept of equal \njustice under the law, and I believe crime should not be treated \ndifferently based on the victim of that crime. I have had the privilege \nof working with many victims of crime and their families, and I share \ntheir determination that those who commit crimes should be delivered \nswift justice and be held accountable.\n  But a fair justice system, committed to equal justice under the law, \ndoes not distinguish between crimes based on race, gender or whatever \nthe category that is included in a particular list. A fair justice \nsystem, committed to equal justice under the law, does not criminalize \nthoughts or perceptions. It criminalizes behavior. In this country, a \nfair justice system, committed to equal justice under the law, is based \non federalism, one which respects that State and local law enforcement \nand prosecutors are doing their jobs fairly and responsibly.\n  Expanding hate crimes legislation should not be part of this \nconference report. Not withstanding this flaw in the bill, I will vote \nfor the conference report but with this reservation. The hate crimes \nprovision does not belong in the bill and I believe violates our \nnational commitment to equal justice under the law.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Brown are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. BROWN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n          Colquitt Regional Medical Center's 70th Anniversary\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise today to commemorate the 70th \nanniversary of Colquitt Regional Medical Center in my hometown of \nMoultrie, GA. For seven decades, residents of southwest Georgia have \nbeen fortunate not only to have a state-of-the-art facility but also to \nbe served by a hospital that has boasted visionary leadership.\n  Back in 1935, the Public Works Administration approved $50,000 for a \nnew hospital in Moultrie, but only if the community could match those \nfunds. That is when Moultrie businessman W.C. Vereen stepped up and \npledged $50,000 and, in turn, made his offer contingent on the \ncommunity matching his funds. Thereafter, a grassroots campaign to \nbuild a hospital was born, at a total of $140,500--a very significant \namount of money in those days.\n  On October 17, 1939, the Vereen Memorial Hospital was dedicated, and \nthe first operation was performed a week later.\n  From those humble beginnings, the now-rechristened Colquitt Regional \nMedical Center has grown into a comprehensive health care facility, \nboasting medical services that include dialysis, physician offices, \noncology, and a home health care component, among others.\n  It speaks volumes about the community, the camaraderie, and the \nsuccess of Colquitt Regional Medical Center to know that in 70 years, \nthis hospital has had only four CEOs, and the first one only served for \n2 years.\n  Its first two CEOs--Pierina Egan and Nora Manning, both of whom \nobviously were female--in addition to dealing with the day-to-day \nchallenges of managing a hospital, also had to contend with growing the \nfacility and coping with a doctor shortage brought on by World War II.\n  Ms. Manning was succeeded by Millard Wear, who served as CEO for 14 \nyears and oversaw the creation of a brandnew 126-bed facility.\n  In 1982, Mr. Wear was succeeded by the very able Jim Lowry, who \ncontinues to head the hospital to this day. Under Mr. Lowry's tutelage, \nColquitt Regional Medical Center has become a force to be reckoned with \nin physician and specialist recruitment. It has also undergone four \nexpansion projects and added off-campus facilities, making it a truly \nregional endeavor.\n  In 1992, Colquitt Regional Medical Center was named the Georgia \nHospital Association Rural Hospital of the Year. In 2007, it received \nthe hospital association's Community Leadership Award. It has \nconsistently performed at the top of Georgia's hospitals in patient \nsatisfaction.\n  On a personal note, my son Bo was born at Colquitt Regional. I have \nhad the unfortunate situation of needing five surgeries at Colquitt \nRegional but was very fortunate to be treated by the very finest \ndoctors our country has to offer and a very skilled and excellent group \nof nurses. All of the employees and operators at Cochran Regional--from \nthe professionals, the administration, as well as the day-to-day \npersonnel, including our pink ladies, who are our volunteers--do an \noutstanding job of making this hospital a truly fine medical facility \nserving a very broad area in the rural southwest part of my State.\n  The folks at Colquitt Regional Medical Center do a tremendous job in \nserving the community. In fact, they also constitute a large part of \nour community in southwest Georgia, and we are thankful to have them in \nour midst. I congratulate Colquitt Regional Medical Center on 70 \nwonderful years of service.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I oppose this legislation because it \ndoes\n\n[[Page S10681]]\n\nnothing to bring our open-ended and disproportionate military \ncommitment in Afghanistan to an end and/or to ensure that our troops \nare safely and expeditiously redeployed from Iraq. I am concerned that \nour current military strategy in Iraq and Afghanistan may undermine our \nability to combat al-Qaida while imposing a tremendous burden on our \nbrave servicemembers and on American taxpayers.\n  This bill includes several important provisions, including provisions \nI authored that will help improve care for wounded warriors and the \nhate crimes legislation that was first introduced over 8 years ago. But \nI cannot support a bill that does not do enough to protect our country \nfrom our top national security threat, al-Qaida.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise today to address the Military \nand Overseas Voter Empowerment Act of 2009--the MOVE Act. Since its \ninception, the MOVE Act has garnered strong bipartisan support, and \ntoday we celebrate its passage as part of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n  I want to recognize the importance of this Act and also to \nacknowledge my partners in this effort especially my friends and \ncolleagues, Senator Saxby Chambliss, Senator Ben Nelson, Senator Bob \nBennett, and Senator John Cornyn. I would also like to thank Senators \nLevin and McCain and their staffs, as well as the House and Senate \nconferees for their time, support, and work to ensure that the \nprovisions of the MOVE Act were included in the conference report.\n  Every now and then an opportunity emerges to work on an important \nissue with a team of colleagues towards a single goal. This bill \nprovided one such opportunity, and I am extremely pleased to have \nworked with such a committed team. This legislation is a bipartisan \nsolution to a serious, yet all too familiar problem--the problem of \nmilitary and other overseas voters not being able to cast their vote \nand have that vote counted.\n  Every couple of years there is a great push to improve the process of \nmilitary and overseas voting. However, as soon as the election is over, \nCongress too often neglects to push for improved rights for military \nvoters. That neglect is over. The needs of military and overseas voters \nhave been heard, and met, with this legislation.\n  While the need for Congress to act is now, this is not a new problem \nand we are not the first to identify the problem and attempt to deal \nwith it. The first revolution in military voting rights occurred not \nwhen our soldiers were overseas. It occurred during the Civil War. At \nthat time, the right to vote was provided by the Constitution, and \nsoldiers from both the Union and the Confederacy depended on State law \nto determine whether they could vote ``in the field'' during wartime.\n  According to historians, there were two methods of voting then. In \nthe first system, a closed ballot box was taken to the field of battle, \nthe ballots were cast there, and the box returned to the jurisdiction. \nStates at the time questioned whether the act of voting outside their \njurisdictions could be authorized by State law.\n  Other objections to voting ``in the field'' were heard when a State \nconstitution prescribed the place, time and manner of elections; and if \nmilitary voting was conducted prior to Election Day, whether early \nvoting would violate State constitutions.\n  The second type of voting was known as ``proxy voting.'' A soldier's \ncompleted ballot was mailed to someone, such as a family member, in the \nsoldier's regular place of voting. This completed proxy vote would then \nbe delivered on Election Day. My home State of New York used the proxy \nvote procedure during the Civil War. While proxy voting avoided the \nconstitutional problems of voting ``in the field,'' it was subject to \nother problems: the lack of a secret ballot; the transmission of the \nproxy ballot to the place of voting, and concerns about fraud.\n  Given the pressure to ensure that soldiers' rights were not \ndiminished by their service, States in both the North and South passed \nlaws to allow for voting for Federal office. President Lincoln, in \naddition to presiding over the War Department's filing of the first \nmilitary voting regulations on October 1, 1864, intervened with his \ngenerals directly to ensure that those soldiers who could vote be given \nthat right.\n  In an 1864 letter to GEN William Rosecrans, President Lincoln wrote \nthese stern words: ``I have a report that you incline to deny the \nsoldiers the right of attending the election in Missouri. . . . \nWherever the law allows soldiers to vote their officers must also allow \nit.''\n  Eighty years later, with the country locked in the crisis of the \nSecond World War, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt sent a very \npointed Message to the United States Congress on the same issue. It \nbegins: ``The American people are very much concerned over the fact \nthat the vast majority of the eleven million members of the armed \nforces of the United States are going to be deprived of their right to \nvote in the important national election this fall, unless the Congress \npromptly enacts adequate legislation. . . . The men and women who are \nin the armed forces are rightfully indignant about it. They have left \ntheir homes and jobs and schools to meet and defeat the enemies who \nwould destroy all our democratic institutions, including our right to \nvote. [They] cannot understand why the fact that they are fighting \nshould disqualify them from voting.''\n  President Roosevelt foreshadows the issues we are still fighting to \nfix when he further advised Congress:\n\n       By the 1944 elections, there will be than five million \n     Americans outside the limits of the United States in our \n     armed forces and merchant marine. They and the millions more \n     who will be stationed within the US waiting the day to join \n     their comrades on the battle-fronts, will all be subject to \n     frequent, rapid, and unpredictable transfer to other points \n     outside and inside the United States.\n\n  He concluded by arguing that ``. . . What is needed is a complete \nchange of machinery for absentee balloting, which will give [the armed \nforces] all over the world an opportunity to cast their ballots without \ntime-consuming correspondence. . . .''\n  I am subjecting us all to a bit of a history lesson here because I \nbelieve this is a very fundamental--and yet unresolved--issue facing \nour military and our system of elections. We meet again, 65 years after \nPresident Roosevelt's Message to Congress, and 145 years after \nPresident Lincoln's directive to let soldiers vote, to again address \nfundamental improvements to military and overseas voting.\n  Building on the tools already in law, this legislation creates a \nsystem of improved access with multiple fail-safes built into the \nprocess. We use new technology to create more options for registration \nand ballot delivery, and at long last provide enough time for the \nmilitary service men and women to vote. The lost letter, the late \ndelivery, the ballot not notarized, and the last-minute troop transfer \nshould no longer impede these voters from having their votes counted.\n  What we did in the Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act will \nhave a direct and dramatic impact on the rights of military voters.\n  In May 2009, I chaired a hearing in the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration on the problems that military and overseas voters face. \nWhat we heard was nothing short of shocking.\n  We learned that during the 2008 general election, our military and \noverseas voters still faced a complicated and convoluted system that \nmade it impossible for many of them to have their votes counted.\n  The committee convened a study of last year's election, which \nrevealed that more than one in four ballots requested by military and \nother overseas voters were never received by local election officials \nand, thus, never counted. Let me repeat: one in four ballots requested \nwere never counted. We owe our men and women in uniform more. Does it \nmake sense that they are fighting for the very freedoms that we enjoy, \nyet are unable to choose their Commander in Chief? No, it does not.\n  If we can deploy tanks, high-tech equipment, and food to the front \nlines, we can figure out a way to deliver ballots to our troops so that \nthey can be returned and counted.\n  The MOVE Act does precisely that, correcting many of the flaws that \nriddle the absentee balloting process for overseas voters.\n  By modernizing the voting process, increasing accessibility to voter \nregistration and balloting materials, and requiring election officials \nto send out\n\n[[Page S10682]]\n\nballots to military and overseas voters in time for them to be returned \nand counted, this legislation--at long last--brings overseas voting \ninto the 21st century.\n  Consider a letter one soldier sent to the Overseas Vote Foundation \nafter the 2008 election, in which that solider said: ``I hate that \nbecause of my military service overseas, I was precluded from voting.'' \nThat solider continued, ``Of all people, deployed servicemembers should \nhave a guaranteed ability to vote.''\n  I say here on the floor of the Senate that I absolutely agree.\n  The MOVE Act will ensure that military and other overseas voters know \nhow to register to vote and how to request an absentee ballot. They \nwill receive their ballot in a timely manner, and have that ballot \ncounted on election day.\n  How did we accomplish that goal? Through a number of simple, \nstraightforward fixes to the overseas voting process:\n  First, this legislation gives the right to military and overseas \nvoters to request--and requires States to send--registration materials, \nabsentee ballot requests, and blank absentee ballots electronically. In \nthe computer age, it is long past time we used technology to speed up \nthe voting process. For many troops, this quick transmission of ballots \nwill give them for the first time a sufficient number of days to vote.\n  Second, this legislation ensures that overseas voters have at least \n45 days to complete their absentee ballots and return them to election \nofficials. For those voters who have no access to electronic delivery \nof ballots, this should provide the time for a ballot to travel to Iraq \nor Afghanistan, and back to the local election official. This need was \nexposed by a 2009 Pew Charitable Trusts study aptly named ``No Time to \nVote.''\n  This legislation also requires that military absentee ballots be sent \nthrough expedited mail procedures, further reducing the transmission \ntime for voted ballots to make it back to local election officials.\n  In the Rules Committee hearing, we listened to the concerns of Air \nForce LTC Joseph DeCaro. One major concern he described was that there \nwas no way to ensure that the ballots had been properly received by the \nelection office. This legislation will allow military and overseas \nvoters to determine whether their ballot has been received by the local \nelection official. That way, if their ballots are not received, the \nvoters can take steps to ensure a replacement vote is cast.\n  If a ballot is lost, or cannot be re-sent in time, we require the \nDepartment of Defense to create an online tool that allows military and \noverseas voters to identify all the races they are qualified to vote \nfor, and submit a replacement ballot immediately. This ensures that \ntroops can complete a full Federal ballot in time for the election.\n  The legislation prevents election officials from rejecting overseas \nabsentee ballots for reasons not related to voter eligibility, like \npaper weight or notarization requirements. I ask you, how can a marine \nin Fallujah find a notary?\n  The legislation has the Department of Defense work with election \nofficials to define and improve election data related to military and \noverseas voters. More accurate election data will reduce future \nproblems and speed fixes to the voting process.\n  Finally, this legislation expands resources for overseas voters \nthrough the Federal Voting Assistance Program.\n  As a result of this new legislation, the Department of Defense will \nuse online tools to train and inform its staff on crucial voting \ninformation. And all military servicemembers will receive uniform \nnotices and information via e-mail prior to registration or election \ndeadlines.\n  Finally, this legislation directs that every military installation \nhave a place where soldiers can register to vote, update their \nregistration information, and request an absentee ballot. Military \nvoters, as they are transferred or reassigned to different bases, will \nbe provided the opportunity to change their election information.\n  We also know that that there are improvements still to make. A pilot \nproject included in the legislation will promote research into new \ntechnology to help assist future voters with absentee balloting. The \ntools and mandates set forth in this legislation are minimum \nrequirements. And if technology can improve secure ballot transmission, \nwe want that work done.\n  Again, it is simply unacceptable that those who fight to defend our \nfreedom often face the greatest obstacles in exercising their right to \nvote.\n  While good work has been done in the past to improve military voting, \nI firmly believe that the MOVE Act has incorporated the best and \nstrongest ideas on how to ensure a modern military receives every \nopportunity to cast their ballot. Working with States and local \nelection officials, we must encourage prompt implementation of the MOVE \nAct so that the benefits of the act will impact voters in the 2010 \nelections.\n  In our Rules Committee hearing this May, I made the public commitment \nthat we would not have another Federal election without these tools in \nplace for our military voters, and I am very pleased that this act was \nagreed to by the House and Senate. I again thank our colleagues in this \ntruly bipartisan effort, and I look forward to President Obama's \nsignature on this important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise today to speak on the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 2647, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010.\n  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the chairman \nof its Subcommittee on Airland, I had the honor and pleasure again this \nyear of working with Chairman Levin and Senator McCain on this bill. I \ncongratulate them for working with their House counterparts, Chairman \nSkelton and Representative McKeon, to deliver a bill that will help \nkeep our Nation safe and provide our troops with the support they \ndeserve.\n  I also wish to thank Senator Thune, who is my ranking member on the \nAirland Subcommittee, and Chairman Abercrombie and Representative \nBartlett of the House's Air and Land Forces Subcommittee, for the close \ncooperation we achieved this year on the areas that fall under our \nshared jurisdiction.\n  There are several accomplishments in this bill of which I am \nespecially proud.\n  This bill will increase the authorized size, known as end strength, \nof our active duty Army from 532,400 to 562,400 for fiscal year 2010, \nand further authorized the Secretary of Defense to increase the Army by \nan additional 30,000 soldiers in fiscal years 2011 and 2012. This \ngrowth in the Army is essential--our soldiers are under incredible \nstrain from multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, oftentimes with \nlittle more than a year at home to rest and train for every year that \nthey spend in theater.\n  I applaud the President's decision this July to add 22,000 soldiers \nto the Army, and call upon him to use the authority provided in this \nbill to do more. We must ensure that our Army is large enough for all \nthe missions we ask of it, and also give our soldiers the time they \nneed at home to rest, train, and be with their friends and families.\n  With regard to missile defense, this bill includes an amendment that \nSenator Sessions and I, along with a bipartisan group of cosponsors, \nintroduced to ensure that the administration's new architecture for \nmissile defenses in Europe will be as capable as the previous plan that \nwas set aside. I believe that this section of the final bill, paired \nwith section 8121 of the Senate version of the Defense Appropriations \nAct, which protects funding for the continued development of the two-\nstage ground based interceptor, will help to keep our Nation safe \nagainst Iran's aggressive missile programs.\n  This bill also makes critical investments in our Nation's sea power. \nIt authorizes $4.2 billion for Virginia-class submarines, which will be \nprocured at the rate of two per year from 2011, and $495 million for \nthe research and development of a replacement to our aging Ohio-class \nstrategic deterrence submarines. I am very proud of the skilled workers \nof my home State of Connecticut who build these essential submarines.\n  Turning to the Army's modernization programs, the final version of \nthis bill supports the decision by the Secretary of Defense and the \nArmy's leadership to restructure the FCS program. This\n\n[[Page S10683]]\n\nbill will provide full funding for the ``Spin Out'' portions of that \nprogram and the continued development of the network. I look forward to \nworking with Senator Thune in the coming year to evaluate the Army's \nrevamped strategy for developing and procuring ground combat vehicles \nfor our soldiers.\n  There is one element of this bill with which I must express my deep \ndisappointment--the inclusion of $560 million in funds for the \ncontinued development and procurement of an alternate engine for the F-\n35 Joint Strike Fighter.\n  When the President introduced his plans for reducing spending in the \nbudget this May, he specifically pointed out the alternate engine as \nthe singular example of programs that ``do nothing to keep us safe--but \nrather prevent us from spending money on what does keep us safe.'' He \ncontinued to say ``the pentagon does not want--and does not plan to \nuse--the alternative version'' to the engine that it already has for \nthe Joint Strike Fighter.\n  Since the President's initial comments on this unnecessary and \nwasteful program, the Secretary of Defense and the uniformed military \nleadership have explained exactly why they do not want this \nunnecessary, alternate engine. It is because they know the danger this \nearmark poses to the Joint Strike Fighter, which is planned to be the \ncornerstone of American air power for decades to come.\n  If Congress forced the Defense Department to continue paying for an \nalternate engine, it would cost an additional $4 to $6 billion over \njust the next 5 years--billions of dollars that the Department has not \nplanned for, and that would either have to come from the Joint Strike \nFighter or other critical programs to keep our country safe.\n  If Congress forced the Defense Department to procure the alternate \nengine that it does not want, it would prevent the Joint Strike Fighter \nprogram from achieving economies of scale for years to come, as it \nsplit its procurement to maintain two manufacturing lines. The costs of \nthe program would rise, along with the risk that it will never deliver \nthe aircraft that our Nation requires.\n  When he testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee in June, \nAir Force LTG Mark Shackelford explained that these added costs would \nmean that the Air Force would be able to afford some 53 fewer of the \nJoint Strike Fighter aircraft that it needs to support our airmen.\n  In response to the President's strong arguments and the concerns of \nour military leadership, the Senate put this question to a vote in on \nJuly 23, deciding by a vote of 59-38 to end the unnecessary, alternate \nengine. Although the House never took similar action on this topic, the \nSenate receded to its position in conference.\n  I call upon President Obama to send a clear message to our colleagues \non the Appropriations committee--that he will veto an appropriations \nbill that includes funds for this unnecessary program. Fifty-nine \nMembers of this body stood by the President when he first called upon \nus to end this program, and I am sure that we will stand by him again.\n  Despite this strong reservation, I call upon my colleagues to vote \nfor the adoption this conference report and again thank my colleagues \non the Armed Services Committee for their hard work on behalf of our \nservice men and women.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I rise to speak about the fiscal year 2010 \nNational Defense authorization bill. Although I believe this to be a \nflawed piece of legislation, I will support it because it provides \ncritical resources, training, and equipment to our troops serving \noverseas. It adds 30,000 soldiers to our Army, lightening the strain of \nrigorous deployment cycles. And it provides a 3.4-percent pay raise for \nour men and women in uniform--not enough, in my view, but welcomed \nnonetheless. It also authorizes various facility upgrades for our \ntroops, including $9 million to begin construction of an Air Operations \nCommand Center at Bradley International Airport in my State of \nConnecticut. I commend my colleagues from Michigan and Arizona for \ntheir hard work on this bill.\n  I would also like to take a moment to offer my strong support to the \nhate crimes prevention amendment. I am also proud to be an original \ncosponsor of the underlying legislation, the Mathew Sheppard Local Law \nEnforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007, and I only wish that my \ndear friend, the late Senator Kennedy, could be here with us today to \nsee this topic that was so important to him, finally be considered for \nfinal passage. This legislation is truly historic and is long overdue. \nHate crimes sow discord and threaten entire communities. They are a \nparticularly virulent form of violence, and that is why a broad \nconsensus supports reacting to crimes motivated by bias with swift \ninvestigations and strong penalties. However, the special nature of \nhate crimes often makes those investigations particularly difficult, \nespecially for small, local police departments. Passage of the bill \nbefore us will bring more criminals to justice by making it easier for \nthe federal government to assist the investigations of more crimes. I \nam extremely proud to support this provision.\n  Despite my strong support for this important provision and many \nothers in this bill, I also have to note some serious reservations I \nhave with some portions of the bill. First, this bill effectively kills \nour Nation's most advanced tactical aircraft program, the F-22 Raptor, \nwithout any plans for replacing it. Furthermore, it fails to authorize \nfunding for any additional C-17 cargo aircraft, though these planes are \ncritical for transporting troops and equipment. Worse, the bill \nrestricts the Air Force from retiring the aging C-5 cargo fleet, planes \nthat are now some 40 years old. Over the President's objection, this \nbill forces the Pentagon to maintain aging aircraft, imposing an \nunnecessary burden on our taxpayers and an unacceptable risk on our \ntroops.\n  I am also disappointed by the inclusion of $560 million for the \ncontinued development of the F-136 Joint Strike Fighter alternate \nengine. This is wasted money, pure and simple. We are already \ndeveloping an engine that our military supports--one build by the \nskilled workers at Pratt & Whitney. The Pratt engine has now \naccumulated more than 140 hours of flight tests without failure. \nDeveloping a second engine wastes billions of taxpayer dollars, money \nthat could be better spent on things our troops actually need.\n  So this is not a perfect bill. But there will be an opportunity to \naddress these issues in the upcoming Defense appropriations bill, \nduring whose consideration the critical priorities I have outlined \nattained bipartisan support. I am optimistic that we will soon be \nconsidering legislation that invest in strategic airlift platforms like \nthe C-17, as well as other important military needs. And I remain \noptimistic that my colleagues share my commitment to our critical \naerospace priorities. This bill includes $2.5 billion to build 125 \nBlackhawk helicopters for the Army and Navy, aircraft that have proven \ninvaluable in operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. In addition, $92 \nmillion is authorized for a highly advanced wide area surveillance \nradar system, which will be built in Norwalk, CT, and which will prove \ncritical for our forces' future ability to have precise and up-to-date \nintelligence of the battlefield. Similarly, $250 million is authorized \nto build new Pratt & Whitney engines for the Joint STARS radar aircraft \nthat are widely used in Iraq and Afghanistan. The bill also authorizes \n18 F/A-18 fighter aircraft and 30 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, which \nmarks the beginning of a long production run of these sophisticated \njets.\n  This is good news for our military and good news for our economy. \nAccording to the Department of Labor, ``The aerospace industry is a \npowerful force within the U.S. economy and one of the nation's most \ncompetitive industries in the global marketplace. It contributes over \n15 percent to our Gross Domestic Product and supports over 15 million \nhigh-quality American jobs.'' And, as I have stated before, my small \nState of Connecticut, which ranks 29th in the Nation in terms of total \npopulation, is 6th in aerospace employment. The workers at companies \nsuch as Pratt & Whitney, Hamilton Sundstrand, Sikorsky Aircraft, \nGoodrich, Norden Systems, Kaman, Aerogear, and hundreds of others work \nday in and day out to provide our troops with the highest quality \nequipment in the world. The billions of dollars of funding authorized \nin this bill is\n\n[[Page S10684]]\n\nproof of our military's appreciation for their hard work.\n  Just as important as protecting our troops from the skies is \nprotecting them when they are at sea. That is why funding authorized in \nthis bill for the Virginia class submarine program is so important. The \nbill includes $4 billion to procure one submarine next year and to \nprepare to begin building two submarines per year in 2011. This boost \nin production will better equip our Navy to deliver Special Forces such \nas the SEALs without detection, launch precision missiles on a moment's \nnotice, and intercept enemy signals unseen and unaffected by weather. \nThis bill also authorizes $495 million to design the Ohio class \nreplacement submarine, our next generation ballistic missile submarine. \nThis bill confirms that submarines have and will continue to stealthily \nprotect our country for decades to come.\n  There is no higher priority than our national defense. And the brave \nmen and women who serve us overseas must have the resources they need \nto do their jobs. I will support this legislation because it does that. \nBut I look forward to working with my colleagues to strengthen our \napproach to defense policy so that we can address some of the \nshortcomings of this bill as we consider further legislation in the \nweeks ahead.\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, Congress will pass an exceptional bill \ntoday. I know that Senator Kennedy would have been proud of this \nresponsible legislation and the ways in which it benefits our Armed \nForces and our country.\n  The bill specifically honors the sacrifice of our men and women in \nuniform, and it includes provisions to put mechanisms in place to \nstrengthen our current defense operations and our national security. I \ncommend my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee for their \nleadership on these issues, and I am honored to serve on the committee \nin Senator Kennedy's place.\n  I wanted to spend a moment praising our colleagues for agreeing to \ninclude another important provision in the bill, the Matthew Shepard \nHate Crimes Prevention Act. I know Senator Kennedy would have been \nespecially pleased by its inclusion. It is an extremely important bill \nand was especially important to Senator Kennedy.\n  He worked on it for years to close the loopholes that have prevented \neffective prosecution of these flagrant crimes that terrorize entire \ngroups of communities across America.\n  As Senator Kennedy said so well:\n\n       We want to be able to have a value system that is worthy \n     for our brave men and women to defend. They are fighting \n     overseas for our values. One of the values is that we should \n     not, in this country, in this democracy, permit the kind of \n     hatred and bigotry that has stained the history of this \n     nation over a considerable period of time.\n\n  The statistics about hate crimes are shocking and shameful. For far \ntoo long, law enforcement has been forced to investigate these vicious \ncrimes with one hand tied behind its back. The Matthew Shepard Hate \nCrimes Prevention Act gives Federal, State, and local law enforcement \nagencies the real power and authority they need to combat these brutal \nacts of domestic terrorism.\n  The bill makes it clear that the time is now to stand up for all \nvictims of hate crimes across America. It would not have advanced this \nfar without the dedication of Senator Kennedy and other key colleagues, \nespecially Senator Reid, Senator Leahy and Senator Levin. I also praise \nthe incredible and tireless advocacy of Matthew Shepard's mother, Judy. \nShe educated all of us about the immense impact of such crimes, and I \nknow how much Senator Kennedy admired her for all she's done to make \nsure that no other families have to endure the horror she faced in the \nloss of her son.\n  I know that it is unusual to include such a measure in the defense \nbill. But the rule of law will be stronger in America because of the \ninclusion of the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act in this \nyear's National Defense Authorization Act. I look forward to it \nbecoming law as soon as possible.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I am voting no on the conference report to \nthe fiscal year 2010 DOD Authorization Act.\n  This was not an easy decision. This is a very important bill in view \nof the important policies it puts in place for our men and women \nuniform and I commend the leadership of the committee's chairman and \nranking member for their commitment to the well being of our nation's \narmed forces. This conference report also contains several important \nprovisions I authored or coauthored.\n  However, I believe is unconscionable that this bill has been taken \nhostage by the far Left to advance its hate crimes agenda. I cannot \nprovide my vote for a bill that uses our military in this way if we \npermit it this time, where will it end?\n  Because of this, while this is an important conference report, and \nmostly a good one, I cannot vote in favor of it today.\n  The Defense Authorization Act authorizes more than $680 billion for \nnational defense programs; this figure includes authorization for \nfunding for ongoing operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the war on \nterror. It also authorizes funding for such crucial programs as \nDepartment of Defense military assistance to for Afghanistan and \nPakistan. And it includes $7.5 billion to train and equip Afghan \nsecurity forces and $1.3 billion for the Commanders' Emergency Response \nProgram, which provides funds for commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan to \nspur local security and reconstruction projects.\n  The bill appropriately caps F-22 production at 187 aircraft--which \nthe Pentagon requested--and it includes $6.7 billion for armored \nvehicles including the new M-ATVs, $600 million for equipment \nshortfalls in the National Guard, and more funding for defense health \nand family support programs. It also includes a 3.4 percent across-the-\nboard pay raise for the men and women in the military\n  I am also pleased that the conference report contains several \nprovisions I authored or coauthored, including an amendment requiring a \ncomprehensive review by the Government Accountability Office on the \nsuccesses, failures and unmet objectives of the Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram. This is an important report for future debates on START and \nother matters, a provision I coauthored, section 1254, with Senators \nBayh and Lieberman on imposing sanctions on Iran if it continues its \nillegal nuclear weapons program. I am disappointed that this provision \nwas watered down in conference, as it passed the Senate with its \nunanimous endorsement that the Iranian Central Bank should be \nsanctioned if Iran continues to defy the world on uranium enrichment. \nHowever, I am pleased that it continues to state the strong support of \nthe Congress for the proposition that Iran must comply with the U.N. \nSecurity Council Resolutions directing it to halt uranium enrichment a \nprovision I authored, Section 1251, with several of my colleagues, \nincluding the Republican leader and the ranking member of the Armed \nServices Committee, regarding the START follow-on.\n  I am pleased that the conference report enshrines in law that the \nPresident must deliver to the Congress a report on the plan to \nmodernize the nuclear weapons stockpile and complex, as well as the \ndelivery vehicles.\n  The Perry-Schlesinger Commission was clear that further reductions in \nthe U.S. nuclear weapons force are only prudent if the weapons that \nremain are highly reliable and credible. This is only possible with a \nrobust modernization program, which has to include full and timely \nLifetime Extension Programs for the B61 and W76 warheads consistent \nwith military needs; funding for a modern warhead that includes new \napproaches to life extension involving replacement, or, possibly, \ncomponent reuse; full funding for stockpile surveillance work through \nthe nuclear weapons complex, as well as the science and engineering \ncampaigns at the national laboratories; and full funding for the timely \nreplacement of the Los Alamos plutonium research and development and \nanalytical chemistry facility, the uranium facilities at the Oak Ridge \nY-12 plant, and a modern pit facility.\n  This provision greatly strengthens the DOD authorization bill, and, I \nthink, makes it more likely the Senate will be able to ratify a follow-\non treaty to START, especially if the President heeds the Senate's \nadvice, in this section, that missile defense, space systems, and \nadvanced conventional modernization, which includes nonnuclear\n\n[[Page S10685]]\n\nglobal strike capability are not subjects for this follow-on agreement.\n  I would have been proud to cast my vote for legislation providing \nthese policies for our men and women in uniform; and I am grateful for \nthe leadership of the chairman and ranking member on these issues.\n  I am, however, concerned by several provisions of the bill. First, I \nopposed the inclusion of funding for an alternate engine for the F-35, \nor Joint Strike Fighter. At a time when we are fighting two wars, the \n$560 million authorized in this bill for the development and \nprocurement of an alternate engine could be better spent to support our \ntroops. The Secretary of Defense opposes this program, and the \nadministration so strongly opposes the alternate engine that the \nPresident's advisers have recommended he veto the bill over this \nprovision.\n  Our national debt is spiraling out of control. Critical defense \nprograms, like missile defense, are underfunded. The F-35 alternate \nengine is a prime example of an unnecessary program that should not be \nauthorized in this bill.\n  I am also greatly concerned about the manner in which missile defense \nis addressed in the conference report. I joined Senators Lieberman and \nSessions in offering an amendment to the Senate version of the NDAA \nthat would require the administration to certify that any proposed \nalternative to the planned missile defense sites in Poland and the \nCzech Republic be at least as cost effective and operationally \neffective as the original plan. In particular, I wanted to ensure that \nany alternative proposal was capable of protecting the United States as \nwell as our European allies against long-range Iranian ballistic \nmissiles. This amendment was adopted unanimously on the floor of the \nSenate, while a similar version was also included in the House-passed \nversion of the NDAA.\n  Unfortunately, the conference report only authorizes funding for the \nalternative proposal and eliminates entirely the certification \nrequirement that the alternative be as least as effective as the \nplanned deployments in Poland and the Czech Republic. As such, I \nbelieve the administration is moving forward with a plan for missile \ndefenses in Europe that will leave most of Europe and the United States \nmore vulnerable to the threat of long-range Iranian ballistic missiles \nthan the previous plan.\n  I would also note that this authorization bill endorses an approach \nto missile defense that emphasizes theater missile defense over the \nprotection of the U.S. homeland. Under the previous plan, protection \nfor the United States against future Iranian and North Korean \nintercontinental ballistic missiles was to be guaranteed by 54 ground-\nbased interceptors: 40 deployed in Alaska, 4 in California, and 10 in \nPoland. The Obama administration has curtailed this to deployment to 30 \nground-based interceptors in Alaska. Attempts by the minority to \nrestore funding for the deployment of additional ground-based \ninterceptors were rejected by the majority in both the House and the \nSenate. America will be less secure as a consequence.\n  Finally, the so-called hate crimes bill should not have been attached \nto the defense authorization act. Adding this left-wing priority onto \nthe legislation that authorizes funding for our troops in battle is not \nin our troops' best interest.\n  A hate crimes bill should have been considered by this Chamber as a \nstand-alone bill that would pass or fail on its own merits. By \nattaching it to the unrelated, and must-pass, NDAA, the sponsors of \nthis legislation clearly indicated that they anticipated they would \nencounter trouble in successfully getting a hate crimes bill through \nthe regular legislative process on its own. And with good reason the \nhate crimes legislation is unnecessary Federal Government interference \nin an issue that is adequately handled by the States.\n  Forty-five States and the District of Columbia already have hate \ncrimes laws. To my knowledge, States have a track record of \naggressively prosecuting hate crimes, making a Federal hate crimes \nprevention act an unnecessary imposition on state jurisdiction. After \nall, State, rather than Federal, courts exist to adjudicate local \ncrimes. Matters that can be handled adequately by the States, like hate \ncrimes prosecution, should be left to them.\n  Everyone in this Chamber undoubtedly wants to ensure that all \nAmericans are protected from crime. But flawed legislation that \nunnecessarily takes responsibility away from States and further taxes \nthe Department of Justice's resources does not enhance the protection \nof people from these crimes.\n  The chairman and ranking member worked hard to complete a conference \nreport that I would have been able to support absent the so-called hate \ncrimes bill. However, I cannot support using our men and women in \nuniform as pawns to satisfy the liberal base of the Democratic Party. \nFor that reason, I must oppose the conference report.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, today I will cast my vote against the \nfiscal year 2010 Defense authorization bill. It is a step I take with \nsome reluctance, as there are programs of merit authorized in this \nconference report.\n  I take this position because the majority has seen fit to attach \nunrelated hate crimes legislation. This controversial social policy has \nnothing to do with defense policy or our global war on terror. Instead, \nthe majority has chosen to evade open committee hearings and debate on \ncontroversial social policy by pairing it with this legislation. In my \nview, all violent crime is malicious or hateful, and all victims suffer \nregardless of the motive of the criminal. I am also mindful of the \nconcerns of the many Kentuckians who contacted me with their views that \nhate-crimes laws will lead to an expansion of Federal authority that \ncould chill many forms of speech, including religious expression, that \nare protected by the first amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n  There is much that is good in this year's Defense authorization bill, \nreflecting policies that I strongly support. For example, the bill \nauthorizes a 3.4 percent pay increase for our military personnel; \nincludes a number of bonuses and special pay provisions; contains \nfavorable TRICARE provisions; and continues support for the alternate \nengine for the Joint Strike Fighter. It also includes a measure to make \nit easier for members of the military to vote. Further, it authorizes \nmany worthwhile Kentucky appropriations projects that I have been proud \nto support.\n  Were the conference report not burdened with the unnecessary and ill-\nadvised hate crimes legislation I would have supported it as I have \nconsistently done in prior years. I am hopeful that the majority's \neffort with regard to hate crimes does not presage future legislative \nshortcuts on matters of national importance.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I rise today to state for the record \nthat Congress has spoken on the major issues and concerns that have \nbeen raised about the Military Commissions Act of 2006. As one of the \nprincipal authors, I worked closely with the Chairman and Ranking \nMember to amend the language of the Military Commissions Act to address \nthe concerns of the new administration, the judiciary, and other \nrespected groups who have voiced concerns about military commissions. I \nwould like to thank Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain and their \nrespective staffs for their hard work and many hours they dedicated to \nthis bill. A common understanding for all as we move forward is that \nour country is at war and we are fighting a vicious, dedicated enemy \nwho preys upon civilians and has no respect for the rule of law and \nhuman life. There are three key areas in which Congress has clarified \nthe law, and I would like to briefly address these.\n  First, this legislation raises the bar to provide an even higher \nlevel of protection and process than enemy combatants--or enemy \nbelligerents--have ever had in the history of war, much less since the \nGeneva Conventions were adopted. Common Article 3 of the Geneva \nConventions prohibits the passing of sentences and the carrying out of \nexecutions without judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court \naffording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as \nindispensable by civilized peoples. The detainees who are subject to \nMCA jurisdiction are not qualified for the privileged status of \nPrisoner of War. However, because we have such deep respect for due \nprocess in this country, Congress constituted a court under the MCA of \n2006, in accordance with our Constitution, to\n\n[[Page S10686]]\n\nprovide appropriate due process to those who conducted themselves \noutside the law of armed conflict. In the current legislation, we now \nadd additional due process within this court.\n  Second, in the legal history of these commissions there has always \nbeen robust debate about how to handle sensitive classified \ninformation. The commissions by definition discuss the most sensitive \nelements of our national security and process cases against the most \ndangerous and committed enemies of our country. In the current \nlegislation we have carefully drafted new protections to ensure our \nNation's intelligence is protected, while also allowing the defendants \nto see the information presented against them. These procedures were \nmodeled on the Classified Information Procedures Act and will therefore \nallow the judiciary to look to the developed case law of our Federal \ncourts when issues arise that may not be entirely answered by the plain \ntext of the statute. We intend that this case law be instructive but \nnot necessarily binding on the military commissions. We have also \nincluded language to clarify that the national security privilege may \nbe invoked by the government at any time in order to protect our \nnational security.\n  Thirdly, the MCA of 2009 offers even more protections for the \ndefendants. The new administration came to office voicing a number of \nconcerns about the MCA of 2006. With their party also in control of \nboth houses of Congress, there has been ample discussion and \nopportunity to draft new text addressing those concerns. During \nhearings before our committees, administration officials expressed both \ntheir official and personal concerns with respect to various aspects of \nthe commissions. As an equal branch of government, Congress considered \nall those issues and addressed them in this new legislation. Among \nthose concerns was the question of whether Congress had created an ex \npost facto issue in the MCA of 2006. Congress has modified the language \non this issue in the current legislation, but has not changed its \nposition. As the branch of government empowered to write the laws under \nour Constitution, Congress has codified offenses which have \ntraditionally been tried by military commissions under customary \ninternational law. There is no need to go into a detailed history of \nmilitary commissions and war crimes trials here, but it should be noted \nthat Congress clearly states in this act that those who aid unlawful \ncombatants are subject to the Commission's jurisdiction to the same \nextent as those who directly commit the crimes. Further, we understand \nthat there will always be a debate about when the war with al-Qaida and \nviolent extremists first began. Osama bin Laden formally declared war \nagainst the United States in a fatwa in 1996, but, of course, the first \nWorld Trade Center bombing was in February of 1993. Understanding the \nambiguity of this issue, Congress has deliberately stated that the \nmilitary commissions may exercise jurisdiction over offenses that \noccurred before the date of enactment.\n  In closing, I would like to note that in passing these reforms to the \nMCA of 2006, Congress has once again affirmed the legitimacy of the \ncommissions, their sufficiency of due process, and their rightful place \nin our juris prudence. Our country is at war with an enemy that has \nclearly stated they will continue to disregard the law of war and \ncommit war crimes. The military commissions are the most appropriate \njudicial forum in which to try those individuals.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise today in support of the Matthew \nShepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act. Matthew Shepard was brutally \nmurdered more than 11 years ago, and yet the bill that bears his name \nit still not law. Today, we will finally send this historic bill to \nPresident Obama for his signature.\n  Many of us here in Congress have fought for this day for years--my \ndear friend, the late Ted Kennedy, fought for this day for decades. It \nis a bittersweet day. For as much as this is a victory for all who \nstand for civil rights, it brings to mind those horrible crimes \ncommitted simply because an individual is gay, or black, or Latino, or \nMuslim, or because of any other aspect of their being.\n  These crimes must not be met with silence, but rather, with our \nloudest voices.\n  In an era in which we elected our first African-American president, \nwe must condemn crimes based on racism, homophobia, anti-Semitism, or \nany other small-minded and intolerant angst. We must act, as these are \ncrimes inflicted not merely on individuals, but on entire communities. \nThey are attacks meant to not only break bones, but to break spirits. \nThese crimes know no state boundaries--they are a national problem.\n  And today we will present the President with a national response. But \nlet me be clear: this legislation does not criminalize speech or \nhateful thoughts. It seeks only to punish action--violent action that \nundermines the core values of our Nation.\n  One particularly chilling hate crime occurred in my home state of New \nYork less than two weeks ago. The victim, Jack Prince, was leaving a \ndeli in College Point, Queens late at night when two men started \nyelling anti-gay slurs at him. Suddenly, the perpetrators began beating \nhim, savagely breaking Jack's jaw, his ribs, and causing both of his \nlungs to collapse. This crime, which was caught on video, shook the \nentire gay community.\n  This legislation sends a clear message to Jack's perpetrators and to \nall others: In America, we do not tolerate acts of violence motivated \nby hatred. In America, you are free to be yourself, and you should \nnever be attacked for being so.\n  The time for waiting is over. The time for silence is over.\n  With the Matthew Shepard Act, we are helping local law enforcement \nstamp out crimes like the one committed earlier this month and punish \nits perpetrators. With the Matthew Shepard Act, we are saying, \n``Enough!''\n  And, with the Matthew Shepard Act, we are honoring a brave soul. I \npersonally want to thank Judy Shepard and all who continue to fight \nalongside her to make sure that we not only remember her son's life, \nbut that we continue to strive for a better America.\n  For one last time, let me say: I urge my colleagues to support the \nMatthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 4:40 \np.m. today, all postcloture time be yielded back and the Senate then \nproceed to vote on the adoption of the conference report to accompany \nH.R. 2647, the Department of Defense Authorization Act; that no points \nof order be in order to the conference report; further that the vote on \nthe motion to proceed to H.R. 3548 occur at 2:30 p.m., Tuesday, October \n27.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I ask the \ndistinguished assistant leader if he would agree to allow the vote to \nstart immediately and that we make sure that 5 minutes is counted \ntoward the end.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  All time having been yielded back, the question is on agreeing to the \nconference report.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Utah (Mr. Hatch) and the Senator from Alaska (Ms. Murkowski).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch) \nwould have voted ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 68, nays 29, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 327 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--68\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burris\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Gregg\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Kirk\n\n[[Page S10687]]\n\n\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--29\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Corker\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Kyl\n     LeMieux\n     McConnell\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Byrd\n     Hatch\n     Murkowski\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have just adopted a landmark Defense \nauthorization bill. We are sending to the President the 48th \nconsecutive Defense authorization bill--I move to reconsider the vote \non that bill and lay that motion upon the table.\n  The motion to lay upon the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have an unbroken tradition on our \ncommittee, 48 consecutive national Defense authorization bills. It is \nnever easy to get this bill through the legislative process. But with \nperseverance, a lot of good-faith work has never let us down.\n  We maintain our focus because we are acting on behalf of our true \nheroes, the men and women of our Armed Forces and their families. The \nenactment of this conference report is going to provide the men and \nwomen of our Armed Forces, both Active and Reserve, and their families \nwith the pay and benefits they deserve, the equipment and training they \nneed.\n  The conference report includes $164 billion for military personnel, \nincluding costs of pay, allowances, bonuses, survivor benefits, and \nmilitary health care. It would authorize a 3.4 percent across-the-board \npay raise for our troops, a half a percent above the budget request and \nthe annual increase in the employment cost Index.\n  The conference report would authorize $130 billion in funding for our \nongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. It would provide \nmore than $2.0 billion for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat \nFund, to help take on the threat that has claimed so many American \nlives in Iraq and Afghanistan. It would fully fund the President's \nrequest for $7.5 billion to train and equip the Afghan National Army \nand the Afghan National Police.\n  This legislation sends a vital message to our men and women in \nuniform that we, as a nation, stand behind them and appreciate their \nservice.\n  We are at this point because all our dedicated Members and all our \ndedicated staff members--on both sides of the Capitol--were all willing \nto hit on all cylinders and keep this bill rolling along.\n  Of course, I want to start by thanking my partner and my friend, \nSenator McCain, as well as all committee members, for their active \nroles in getting us to this point. Our counterparts on the House side, \nCongressmen Ike Skelton and Buck McKeon and the House Armed Services \nCommittee staff lead by Erin Conaton and Bob Simmons, also have our \ngratitude. Senator McCain and I are extremely grateful to our own \ncommittee staff members who so willingly put all their legislative \nexpertise into this bill. Not only is there a tremendous amount of \nlegislative craftsmanship involved, but there is a mind-boggling number \nof administrative details that have to be meticulously tracked in this \nmassive bill.\n  I again thank my partner and my friend, Senator McCain, as well as \nall committee members for their active roles in getting us to this very \nhistoric moment when there is much in this bill that is so important to \nour troops, as well as a number of other provisions which are \ncritically important to success in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  Our dedicated, hard-working staff assistants in particular deserve a \nspecial mention for their extraordinary efforts in this regard. As a \nvisible sign of the high regard in which we hold our staff, I ask \nunanimous consent to have all staff members' names printed in the \nRecord. I offer here a list of the staff of the Armed Services \nCommittee for that purpose.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Staff of the Committee on Armed Services\n\n       Adam J.

Mr. President, as the Senate continues to discuss in \nvarious ways the issue of health care, I wanted to comment once again \non the need, when the health care bill is finally brought to the floor, \nopen for debate and amendment, to offer an amendment, which I and \nothers will do, to address the cost of prescription drugs. One of the \nsignificant areas of cost increases for medicine is in prescription \ndrugs.\n  Prescription drugs are unbelievably important. Many people manage \ntheir diseases with prescription drugs that were not available years or \ndecades ago. Those people who are able to access prescription drugs for \ndisease management are able to keep out of the hospital and avoid being \nin an acute-care bed, which is the costliest form of health care.\n  I understand the importance of prescription drugs in the health care \nsystem. I want us to continue to incentivize the development of new \ndrugs, research and development. We do a lot of that through the \nNational Institutes of Health, and so, too, do the pharmaceutical \ncompanies engage in research and development. But even as we do all of \nthat to try to incentivize development of additional drugs and make \nthem available for disease management, it is important to understand \nthat part of the process of trying to put some downward pressure on \nhealth care costs is to put some downward pressure on the price of \nprescription drugs. It is a fact that we pay the highest prices in the \nworld for brand-name prescription drugs. That is just a fact. In my \njudgment, it is not fair.\n  When a bill does come to the floor, I and a number of my colleagues--\nthere are over 30 who have cosponsored legislation on prescription \ndrugs--will offer as an amendment the legislation we have drafted \ntogether. It has significant safety provisions in it. It would\n\n[[Page S10688]]\n\nmake the drug supply eminently safer than now exists, requiring \npedigrees and batch lot numbers on everything that is produced and \ndistributed so that we can track it. It would be a much more effective \nway of addressing the issue of counterfeit drugs.\n  Essentially what we propose is to put downward pressure on \nprescription drug prices by allowing the American people the freedom to \naccess that identical prescription drug wherever it is sold, if it is \nFDA-approved, access it wherever it is sold for a fraction of the price \nthat is charged here in the United States.\n  I have in my desk two pill bottles. They contain the medicine called \nLipitor. I have used them many times and ask unanimous consent that I \nbe allowed to use them on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. These bottles are bottles that contain medicine produced \nin the exact same manufacturing plant. This plant happens to be in \nIreland, and Lipitor happens to be the most prescribed prescription \ndrug for the lowering of cholesterol anywhere in the world. More people \ntake this for the lowering of cholesterol than anything else. I am not \nstanding here advertising for it. I am making the point that this is \nmade in Ireland. It is shipped all over the world.\n  As we can see, these are two bottles that look identical. They \ncontain the same pill in the same bottle made by the same company made \nin the same plant. This bottle was shipped to Canada. This bottle was \nshipped to the United States. This is 90 tablets at 20 milligrams. \nCanadians are required to pay $1.83 per tablet for this drug. \nAmericans--same pill, put in the same bottle, made in the same place, \nin an FDA-approved plant--pay $4.48 a pill. So it is $1.83 if you buy \nit north of here, $4.48 if you are an American citizen buying it in the \nUnited States.\n  Is that fair? It is not, in my judgment. It is not only Lipitor; it \nis brand-name drug after brand-name drug. How does that happen, and how \ncan they make this stick? They do it because under current law the only \nentity that can import a prescription drug is the manufacturer of the \ndrug. Therefore, if this prescription drug is sold in Italy or Spain or \nFrance or Canada--any number of countries--for a fraction of the price, \nthe American people are prohibited from accessing that identical, FDA-\napproved drug that is sold at half or one-third of the cost in the \nUnited States.\n  With our legislation, we aim to give the American people some \nfreedom--the freedom to access that drug. We establish a system by \nwhich they are able to access that FDA-approved drug from a chain of \ncustody that is as safe as the American chain of custody and allow them \nto import that drug into this country by paying a fraction of the \nprice. This is about freedom. Why would we not want to give the \nAmerican people the freedom and the advantage of the system of trading?\n  Some say: You can't do that without limiting the opportunity for \ncounterfeiting. They have been doing it in Europe for 20 years. If you \nare in Spain and want to buy a prescription drug from France, good for \nyou; it is easy to do under something called parallel trading. If you \nare in Italy and want to buy a prescription drug from Germany, it is \nnot a problem; they have something called parallel trading. They have \nbeen doing it for two decades without any safety issue at all. Yet they \nsay we can't do it here in America? We can't manage something the \nEuropeans have managed routinely for two decades? I think we can. Of \ncourse we can.\n  It is not just Lipitor. I mentioned previously that I was at a \nfarmyard for a farm meeting some while ago. People were sitting around \non bales of straw talking, and there was an old codger there. The \nsubject of health care came up.\n  He said: I am near 80 years old. My wife is about 2 years younger, \nnear 80. She just suffered breast cancer. She has been fighting a \nbattle with breast cancer in the last 3 years.\n  This, by the way, was in the southern part of North Dakota.\n  He said: We drove to the Canadian border and then drove across the \nborder every 3 months to buy Tamoxifen for my wife to fight her breast \ncancer. And the reason we did that is because we couldn't afford it \nhere. We paid about 20 cents for what we would pay a dollar for in the \nUnited States for the Tamoxifen my wife needed. We had to drive to the \nCanadian border and across to buy it.\n  The fact is, he was allowed to do that because on an informal basis \nthey allow you to bring across on your own person about 90 days' worth \nof prescription drugs. But for the most part, Americans are not allowed \nto access those lower cost prescription drugs. They are just not \nallowed.\n  Why not give the American people the freedom to access the same drug, \nput in the same bottle, made by the same company? If that company plant \nis inspected by the FDA, and the drug itself is FDA approved, why would \nyou prevent the American people from having access to the very \nmarketplace that everybody boasts about as being the free market?\n  I hear all my colleagues come to the floor all the time and talk \nabout freedom. Yet I have seen some of them vote against the bill that \nwould give the consumer the freedom to access these same drugs in \nplaces in the world where it is sold for a fraction of what the \nAmerican people are charged.\n  There are 30 of us who have come together to write this legislation. \nIt is a Dorgan-Snowe bill. Myself and my colleague, Senator Snowe from \nMaine, have worked on this legislation for a long time, as have other \ncolleagues. The late Senator Kennedy was a cosponsor of this \nlegislation. Senator John McCain is a cosponsor of this legislation. \nLast year, when Barack Obama was a Senator, he was a cosponsor of my \nbill. So this is a very wide coalition. Senator Grassley from Iowa \nasked me about this legislation when we came over for the last vote.\n  This is a very wide coalition of Republicans and Democrats who \nbelieve the American people ought to be given the freedom to access \nthese identical prescription drugs that are sold at a fraction of the \nprice in all the rest of the world at a time when the highest prices \nare charged to the American consumer.\n  If the goal of health care is twofold--one, to try to put some \ndownward pressure on these relentless cost increases for health care; \nand, No. 2, to extend coverage to those who do not have it--how could \nwe possibly bring a health care bill to the floor of the Senate and \navoid the issue of whether we are going to do something about the \nrelentless increasing march of prescription drug prices? How could we \nwalk off the floor having done health care and say, ``Yes, we did not \ndo anything, however, about prescription drug prices. Yes, we \nunderstand it is ratcheting up, up, up, and up, way out of the reach of \nsome folks, but we did nothing about it.''\n  Some will say: Well, except that there was a deal made in which the \nWhite House announced an $80 billion deal with the pharmaceutical \nindustry, and so on, that would have senior citizens buying brand-name \nprescription drugs in a manner that filled half of the doughnut hole--\nthat is all Washington jargon--so, therefore, it becomes something that \nthe pharmaceutical industry has contributed to the well-being of senior \ncitizens.\n  I do not know about all that. I think it was Russell Long who said: \nI'm not for any deal that I was not a part of. Well, I do not know \nabout what this deal is. I called the White House when it was \nrepresented by the pharmaceutical industry that this deal also included \nthe White House's agreement to oppose the legislation I and others are \ntalking about here. I called the White House. Actually, I did not call \nthe physical structure. I called a high official in the White House and \nasked the question: Was there a deal made by which they would oppose \nthis? And the answer was no, no such deal was made.\n  So there is a bipartisan group of us who will be here to offer this \namendment. I fully expect in the consideration of deciding how to put \nsome downward pressure on the costs of health care, our colleagues will \njoin me and Senator Snowe and so many others in adopting this \namendment. At last--at long last--having been fighting this issue for \nmany years, I believe, as we consider the health care bill on the floor \nof the Senate, we will include something that puts some pressure to \nbend down or at least to limit the kind of price increases we see every \nsingle year on these brand-name prescription drugs.\n\n[[Page S10689]]\n\n  Let me say again, I have great respect for the pharmaceutical \nindustry. It is looking after its own interests. Good for them. They \nshould. They produce in some cases some miracle drugs, some of it with \npublic funding through the National Institutes of Health, but, however, \nsome of it, perhaps--not ``perhaps''--some of it with their own \nresearch and development. I do not want to do anything that interrupts \nour opportunity to produce these new medicines that will be helpful to \nthe American people.\n  But I know what will happen. The minute we offer this amendment, we \nwill have people popping up here on the floor of the Senate, and they \nwill say: Aha, what you are going to do is shut down research and \ndevelopment for new drugs. That is what you are doing. You are going to \nshut down R that is going to develop the next miracle drug for \nAlzheimer's or Parkinson's, and so on.\n  I say, no, that is not the case at all. It is just not the case. In \nfact, they pay a much lower price for the brand-name drugs, the same \ndrugs we pay for. They pay much lower prices in Europe and do more \nresearch and development in Europe than we do here in the United \nStates. So go figure.\n  It is also the case that the industry spends more for marketing, \nadvertising, and promotion than they do on research and development. If \nyou doubt me, turn on your television set tomorrow morning when you are \nbrushing your teeth and listen to the advertisements. The \nadvertisements say: Go ask your doctor today. Run down to your doctor \nand ask whether the purple pill is right for you. Or: Didn't you wake \nup this morning thinking you needed some Flomax? Go talk to your \ndoctor; you must need Flomax--whatever Flomax is.\n  My point is, they relentlessly push these medicines at you with \nunbelievable amounts of advertising. So I would say, how about knocking \noff a little of that, maybe pumping some of that money back into \nresearch? The fact is, the way you can get a prescription drug is if a \ndoctor thinks you need it. That maybe is where the decision ought to be \nmade, not while you are brushing your teeth watching a commercial on \ntelevision, whether the purple pill would enhance your lifestyle.\n  So I only say that because I know the pushback when we offer this \namendment will be to say: This will injure somehow the opportunity to \ndo research and development. Nothing could be further from the truth. \nIt will not. I want the pharmaceutical industry to succeed. This \namendment is not punitive at all. I want them to charge prices that \nallow them to make profits. I just do not want them to charge the \nhighest prices in the world to the American consumer--to do it over and \nover. Why? Because they can. Because the American consumer does not \nhave the freedom to access those lower priced prescription drugs in the \nworld economy.\n  Let me mention something, finally, about the larger area of health \ncare. I held a lot of meetings in August, as most of my colleagues did, \nI am sure. I had standing room only at every single meeting, and I had \npeople allege that whatever is done with health care will be a bill \nthat will cover health care for illegal aliens, it will be a bill that \npays for health care costs for abortions, it will be a piece of \nlegislation that does this and that. It is unbelievable the allegations \nout there, which have no basis in truth at all.\n  I am not going to vote for a bill that does the five or six things \nthat most people are alleging the bill would do. But that is not going \nto be in legislation. This legislation we will consider I hope will \nbe--and if it is not, I will offer to amend it; and if I cannot amend \nit and cannot fix it, I will not support it. But I believe legislation \nthat will be supported by a good many--perhaps including myself if it \nis the right kind of legislation--will be legislation that is a serious \nattempt to try to address the issue of increasing costs of health care.\n  We spend much more than anybody else in the world on health care. Yet \nwe do not have the results. We rank, according to CIA data, which keeps \ninformation on all the countries, 50th in life expectancy. So we spend \nmuch more than anybody else in the world and rank 50th in life \nexpectancy. Go figure. There is something wrong with that picture.\n  The other issue is, a lot of people do not have health insurance \nbecause the increased cost of health insurance is running out of \npeople's ability to pay for it.\n  One other important point is most people who do have health insurance \nbelieve: Well, I am set. I am fully insured. In most cases, they are \nnot. In most cases, they are one serious illness away from bankruptcy.\n\n  I met a woman in a community recently who is a quadriplegic. About 10 \nyears ago, she had $600,000 in the bank. She lived in a home and had \nhome equity. She had a job and insurance. Ten years later, it is all \ngone. She is a quadriplegic who has unbelievable needs. She suffered a \nvery serious illness that continues. She has reached the cap on her \ninsurance policy. She is one of those who is a demonstration of being \none serious illness away from bankruptcy, even if you have insurance. \nThis country is a better country than to decide that does not matter.\n  One-half of the bankruptcies in this country are bankruptcies as a \nresult of health care costs. Every single Member of this Chamber goes \naround their State and discovers there is a benefit being held \nsomeplace for somebody who needs a new kidney or somebody who has some \nother medical difficulty, and they are doing some sort of fundraiser \nfor the community to see. Can they raise enough money for this surgery \nso this person can get health care because that is the only way they \ncan get this surgery? So they need donations from neighbors. We can do \nbetter than that. That is the reason there is an interest in trying to \nfind some way to address this health care issue.\n  I want to mention one additional point, and that is last evening \nthere was a vote on what is called commonly here the doctors fix. It \ndeals with physician reimbursements. A reporter asked me, as I left \nlast evening: Wasn't this some significant rejection of the health care \npiece? The answer was no. That vote last evening was not a harbinger of \nanything. The vote last evening was on the issue of fixing physician \nreimbursements, but it was done in a way that was not paid for, and a \ngood many Members of the Senate felt that is not the way to do it.\n  We should--and will, in my judgment--fix this physician reimbursement \nissue. We must. We cannot have a circumstance where physicians are \ntold: Oh, by the way, in 2 or 3 years from now, your reimbursements are \ngoing to drop off a cliff 25 or 35 percent and then we will see you \ndecide not to treat Medicare patients. That will not work. So we have \nto fix this. But we are in the middle of a very deep hole with very \nsignificant budget deficits, the most significant recession since the \nGreat Depression. In my judgment, we cannot just add $240 billion to \nthe Federal budget deficit.\n  So we will, in my judgment, address legislation with the physician \npayment issue and fix that issue because we have to, but we have to do \nit the right way. That is all that vote was. That vote was not a \nharbinger about how health care reform might be dealt with today, \ntomorrow, or yesterday. It was just a vote on that issue with respect \nto the deficit, and a lot of Members of Congress decided, do you know \nwhat, let's come back and do it in a different way.\n  Let me make one final point. The majority leader of the Senate is \nworking, along with many others, to try to combine the best of several \npieces of legislation. It is not an easy job. But the fact is, he will \nbring a piece of legislation to the floor of the Senate. It will be \nwide open for amendment, and we will have a lot of the best ideas that \ncome to the floor in the form of amendments about how to improve the \nbill. And that is exactly the way this process will work. I do not \nthink we ought to get ahead of the process alleging this or that. Let's \ntake a look at what this bill does and says and provides. Let's offer \nimprovements where improvements can be made. We will have votes on all \nof those issues and see if we can do something good for the American \npeople. The American people deserve that.\n  This has been a tough time with a very deep economic hole we have \nbeen going through. Part of the economic distress in this country is to \ntry to decide at the end of the day, the month, or the year: How do I \npay this unbelievable increase in my health insurance\n\n[[Page S10690]]\n\ncost because I know that and my kids and my family and I need to have \nhealth insurance? When you are losing your job and losing your home and \nlosing hope in the middle of a great economic downturn, it is pretty \ntroublesome to discover, do you know what, we probably cannot even \ninsure our family against illness and disease.\n  We are a better country than that. We can do something here. I \nunderstand a lot of people would like to say they want to do something \nbut in reality do not want to do anything. And it is always easier to \ncriticize. It is always easier to take the negative side. But the \nquestion is: Can we come together with something positive that advances \nthe interests of this country? I hope we can. And I believe we can if \nwe are thoughtful and work together. So that will be my hope at the end \nof the day.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/22/senate-section/article/S10690-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    IN RECOGNITION OF THE ARCS FOUNDATION SCHOLARSHIP AWARD WINNERS\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I have spoken many times about the need \nfor a renewed investment in scientific research and development. This \nincludes science, technology, engineering, and mathematics--or, as we \nsay, STEM--education.\n  As a former engineer, I also know how important it is that research \nand innovation is fostered through both public and private investments. \nOver the years, many wonderful private organizations have been formed \nto promote STEM education. One of the very best is the national \nAchievement Rewards for College Scientists--or ARCS--Foundation, which \nis an excellent example of the type of investment I believe our country \nneeds to make.\n  ARCS was created in 1958 by a group of women in Los Angeles following \nthe launch of Sputnik. Like many people at that time, the women saw a \nneed to support American technological and scientific advancement, and \nthey decided to create a scholarship program for students to pursue \ndegrees in science, medicine, and engineering.\n  Today, the all-volunteer, all-women organization has grown to 14 \nchapters with a national membership of over 1,500. Thanks to the \nefforts of the dedicated women of the ARCS Foundation, nationally more \nthan 13,000 scholarships have been awarded since the organization's \ninception.\n  All ARCS recipients are U.S. citizens who have superior academic \nrecords and proven abilities in scientific research and development. \nThey are recommended and selected by the deans and departmental chairs \nat universities that have been approved by the ARCS Foundation.\n  This year, the local Metropolitan Washington Chapter of ARCS awarded \n20 scholarships to Ph.D. candidates and two scholarships to \nundergraduates:\n  Ilana Goldberg, Monique Koppel, and Eric Patterson from Georgetown \nUniversity.\n  Brenton Duffy, Anna Korovina, Yi Jin, Jessica Stolee, and Bennett \nWalker from the George Washington University.\n  Marcin Balicki, Stephanie Wilson Fraley, Eatai Roth, Bridget Wildt, \nand Bryan Benson from Johns Hopkins University.\n  Brendan Casey, Stefanie Sherrill, Nathan Siwak, Seth Thomas, and \nNatalie Salaets from the University of Maryland.\n  Theresa Bankston, Thomas Bliss, Ori Fox, and Rebecca Salomon from the \nUniversity of Virginia.\n  Scholarships were funded through contributions from ARCS members, \nWashington-area corporations and foundations, and various fundraising \nevents. One hundred percent of all funds went directly to the scholars \nwho received $15,000 at the graduate level and $5,000 at the \nundergraduate level. This year, several Washington-area corporate and \nfoundation sponsors provided funding for full scholarships, including \nLockheed Martin, American Council on Technology/Industry Advisory \nCouncil, Booz Allen Hamilton, Bristol-Myers Squibb, General Dynamics, \nMars Foundation, McNichols Foundation, and Raytheon.\n  None of these scholarships would be possible without the dedicated \nwomen of the Washington Metropolitan Chapter of ARCS. Betty Polutchko, \nthe chapter's president, has worked tirelessly for the Foundation since \nshe joined the local Washington chapter in 1992. Her leadership during \nher 2-year tenure has enabled the scholars to thrive.\n  I recently had the honor of meeting this incredible group of scholars \nand learning about the fascinating research they are conducting. These \nstudents are discovering new ways for delivering pharmaceuticals and \nother medical treatments, inventing processes to reduce carbon dioxide \nand other pollutants, engineering aerospace systems, creating \nmicrosurgical robots, and much, much more.\n  They are, without a doubt, the future of our Nation's leadership in \nscience and technology, helping us to solve medical and environmental \ndilemmas and creating new products and systems that will continue to \nimprove our lives and create new jobs.\n  Engineers and scientists have always been the world's problem \nsolvers. They helped us to land on the moon during the space race, the \nperiod when ARCS was founded. The foundation saw the need to foster the \nscientific and engineering potential of our Nation then, and they \ncontinue to do so today.\n  The silver lining in today's financial crisis is the opportunity to \nshift our priorities in many positive ways. As America continues on its \npath toward economic recovery, we must inspire our students to address \nthe extraordinary challenges facing our country and the world. What \nbetter way to encourage and promote this than through programs such as \nARCS. I know that, when given the opportunity, a new generation of \nengineers and scientists will step up to meet these challenges. Indeed, \nthey already are.\n  Congratulations to the 2009-2010 ARCS Metropolitan Washington \nscholarship recipients.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Would the Senator withdraw his request?\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I withdraw my request and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, first, I wish to say to the \nPresiding Officer, I know Senator Sherrod Brown from Ohio and a number \nof us are going to be down here from the 6 to 7 o'clock period, and I \nam starting out here for the first 10 minutes before 6 to talk a little \nbit about health care reform and this whole issue that many of us have \nbeen addressing on the floor. We did this several weeks ago and we did \nit last week. What we are doing is talking about the whole issue of the \npublic option and how important it is to have a public option.\n  The Presiding Officer from Rhode Island, Senator Whitehouse, has been \ndown here with us. He has pointed out, on a number of occasions, how \nimportant it is to have a public option. But I think one of the things \nI would like to do today is talk a little bit about what these \ninsurance companies are doing and where they are coming from.\n  Insurance companies made a point of playing nice over the first \ncouple months of this reform process, but they revealed their true \ncolors earlier this month when they released a series of biased, \nmisleading reports to scare people about the impact of reform. The \ntruth is insurance companies aren't worried about how reform will \nimpact consumers--far from it. What they are worried about is the \nimpact of reform on their profits.\n  The insurance industry has shown where it stands when it comes to \nhealth care reform. In the process, they have given us yet another \nreminder of why we must have a robust public option included in the \nfinal legislation. A public option is one of the only ways still on the \ntable to keep the insurance companies honest. It will allow us to \nrestore competition back into the market and hold companies accountable \nfor their abusive practices. If you need further proof that insurance \ncompanies are putting profits above people, let's look at this chart \nand look at some of the statistics and numbers here.\n\n[[Page S10691]]\n\n  Over 7 years, publicly traded health insurance companies saw a 428-\npercent increase in profits--again, a 428-percent increase in profits. \nThe 10 CEOs of those companies made $118 million in 2007. That is why \n47 million Americans went without coverage. The premiums more than \ndoubled over 9 years, three times faster than wage increases.\n  Going to chart No. 2, insurance companies are afraid of competition \nand want to protect their strangleholds in most State markets. Ninety-\nfour percent of the commercial health insurance market is highly \nconcentrated. In 21 States, 1 carrier dominates more than half the \nmarket. In 39 States, 2 carriers control more than half the market. \nThis is the case in New Mexico, where 2 companies control 65 percent of \nthe market.\n  What does this mean for individuals and families in New Mexico and \nacross America? Nearly one in four Americans under the age of 65--some \n64 million people--will spend more than 10 percent of their family \nincome on health care in 2009. This means families often have to choose \nbetween paying health insurance premiums and putting food on the table. \nOutrageous health insurance premiums are a heavy burden for working \nfamilies who already are dealing with tight budgets. This can often \nlead to significant medical debt, bankruptcy, and home foreclosure.\n  I wish to talk a little bit about some of the New Mexico families who \nhave called me and written me and told incredible stories. I know the \nPresiding Officer, the good Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Whitehouse, \nhas been down here talking about his stories in Rhode Island, and we \nhave the Senator from Ohio here right now whom I spoke about earlier.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a moment.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Let's ask unanimous consent to carry this on \nas a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Please, go ahead.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Presiding Officer, Senator Whitehouse.\n  I saw the Senator show that map, if we could put that map back up. \nThe current chart shows the number of uninsured New Mexicans, and that \nis, of course, significant. But when we look at this map, we can look \nat any number of States where in some States--about a dozen States--two \ninsurance companies have more than 75 percent of the market, some \npretty good-sized States with some pretty decent populations, including \nMinnesota, Missouri. But no matter how many people live there, when you \nhave two companies that have more than 75 percent of the market and you \nlook at the next level of States, which includes yours, New Mexico; \nmine; as well as Rhode Island, where two companies have between 50 and \n75 percent of the market, what does that mean in your mind in terms of \nwhat the public option will do? We were all taught in school, whether \nyou were a business major or a French major, that if there was almost a \nmonopoly, where two or three companies had most of the market, prices \nwent up.\n  What does that mean with the public option and injecting competition \ninto this whole market?\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I thank the Senator from Ohio. I know \ntonight he is leading this effort, this hour we now have on the floor, \nand I thank him for being down here and leading the effort and showing \nincredible leadership on the public option.\n  What I think it means is, when we talk about the lack of competition, \nthis is a concentrated market, that they can basically do whatever they \nwant and drive up the premiums and drive up these incredible profits.\n  I don't know if the Senator was on the floor when we showed this \nchart, but publicly traded insurance companies saw a 428-percent \nincrease in profits over 7 years. So the lack of competition drives \nthose profits. We are not against people making profits; it is just \nthis is profit in terms of health care. So let's compare it.\n  To answer the Senator's question, one of the things that I think is \nimportant to compare is the high-tech industry. They have six, seven, \neight companies all competing against each other, driving the prices \ndown, lowering costs. What the public option does is exactly that: It \ndrives the premiums--it puts competition into the market; it drives the \ncosts down.\n  Mr. BROWN. When we have seen the increase in profits of these \ncompanies, the publicly traded health insurance companies--and I don't \nmind that they have an increase in profits if they aren't doing it by \nusing preexisting conditions to deny care to people whom the Senator \nreads letters from, from Santa Fe and Albuquerque and Truth or \nConsequences and all over the Senator's State. I wouldn't mind if it \nwas not on the backs of people whose insurance companies put caps on \ntheir coverage so that even though they didn't know it when they bought \ntheir insurance--they get very sick, spent a lot of money, and all of a \nsudden they lost their insurance.\n  Then you also see on the bottom there, the top 10 CEOs made $118 \nmillion in 2007. I remember talking the other night about the CEO of \nAetna who, I believe, made $24 million; the CEOs of--do the math there: \n10 CEOs, that is $11.8 million each. Obviously, the Aetna guy drives up \nthe average a little, but they are all making $6, $8, $10, $12 million. \nI assume that what has happened in the last decade--and part of the \nreason for that huge increase is that there are fewer and fewer of \nthese companies dominating the market. I assume--I am asking, I guess--\n10 years ago there was probably more competition in this market than \nthere is now. So we are seeing the number of companies shrink, their \nmarket share increase, and that is an even stronger case for the public \noption.\n  I guess the even stronger case for the public option is, frankly, how \nmuch the insurance companies hate it. There is nothing they are \nopposing more strongly in this bill than the public option. As unhappy \nas insurance companies are with any change--because they love the \nsystem the way it works now. They love having preexisting condition \ndenials, they love their caps, they love to be able to discriminate. \nTheir whole business model, it seems to me, is to keep people who are \nsick from getting insurance and then hire a whole bunch of bureaucrats \nto try to spend time on the phone denying care, denying reimbursements \nor denying claims for people who get sick who are their customers.\n  So what does public option do for all of that?\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Well, Senator Brown makes a very good point. \nI think, first of all, when you have a public option, it is a nonprofit \nthat is dedicated entirely to health care, and you are not going to see \nthese outrageous kinds of CEO salaries. The purpose of a public option \nnonprofit is to put moneys that come in above the goal of providing \nhealth care back into the overall system. So what we are talking about \nis dedicating ourselves on that basis to providing the very best \nquality care.\n  So if you take out the profits and you take out these salaries, you \nare going to have a very competitive--\n  Mr. BROWN. You are taking out another big group of people. You are \ntaking out two groups. You are taking out marketers and the money they \nspend trying to get people to buy their insurance and making sure they \nexclude those who are sick. That takes some skill, it takes some \ncomputer programming, it takes some aggressive salespeople, \ndiscriminating aggressive salespeople. Then you have the bureaucrats--\n--\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. As the Senator pointed out, it happens at \ntwo points in the process, right?\n  Mr. BROWN. Then you have the bureaucrats denying coverage on the \nother end. The public option will not spend a lot of money marketing \nand will not have people denying care, right?\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Absolutely. Those two things occurring drive \nup the costs, so the comparison--let me make this one more point.\n  The comparison on administrative costs--let's look at a government-\nrun program such as Medicare that has 3 percent administrative \ncosts. Then we go over to the insurance industry, and we are talking 30 \npercent. It is those people in the process who are denying the claims \nand all of that activity.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. So it is the CEO salaries, the profits, the marketers, and \nit is the bureaucrats denying your claims\n\n[[Page S10692]]\n\nwhen you thought you had good insurance. They say about 30 percent of \nclaims are initially denied.\n  I have read a lot of these constituent letters. So many of these \nletters come from people who are sick and thought they had good \ninsurance, who then ended up getting very sick or having a new child \nwho had a preexisting condition, and they ended up fighting the \ninsurance company, and they were already suffering from an illness. \nThink about the stress one must already have from having breast cancer \nor from having a sick child, and then they have to spend time on the \nphone fighting with insurance companies or bureaucrats who are saying \nno, no, no.\n  Instead, with the public option, they will not have those bureaucrats \nto fight, correct?\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Correct. Would Senator Whitehouse like to \nspeak?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I am delighted to join the discussion. One other \npoint merits mention about a public option. The current business model \nfor health care in America is not a good one. The insurance companies \ntry to--if you are not healthy--make sure you never get insurance in \nthe first place. If they give you insurance and then you get sick, they \nwill look for loopholes and try to throw you out. Then they will try to \ncontrol the way you get treated by your doctors. So your doctors have \nto spend as much as half of their time on the phone trying to fight and \nget you the treatment they know is right for you, but they have to \nclear it with the insurance company, which has a vested interest in \ntaking as long as it can and causing as much trouble as it possibly can \nbecause some doctors and patients will just give up.\n  On the other side, in terms of the quality of care, with all that \nstuff going on, we have a country in which the quality of care is far \nbelow our competitors by innumerable measures. Part of it has to do \nwith the way the system works.\n  We had an intensive care unit reform that we fought through in Rhode \nIsland that was modeled on the keystone project in Michigan. In \nMichigan, they went into intensive care units and said: We are going to \neliminate hospital-acquired infections, get rid of those. In 15 months, \nthey saved 1,500 lives, $150 million, and 81,000 days that patients \nwould have spent in the hospital with those infections, but they didn't \nhave to because they got out without them. They invested in that.\n  That is the kind of thing a public option can invest in because it \nwill be around, it is not profit motivated, and it wants to do the \nright thing for people.\n  Mr. BROWN. How does that work? In the Michigan hospital, they used a \nchecklist and all this to try to cut down on infections. How does \npublic option interface with the hospital to try to get them to do \nthat?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. It will be willing to take the long view and say: You \nknow what. This is the right thing to do.\n  Mr. BROWN. Invest the money now, and the insurance companies will not \ndo that.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Insurance companies have had a long time to do this, \nbut they have not done it. If you want to believe that by passage of \nthis legislation, all of their motivation and their business model, the \nway they work, is going to spontaneously change, and they will start \ndoing things they have never done before, is one thing to believe. I \nthink prudence and experience and a practical and serious appreciation \nof how urgent our situation is all counsel against believing a sudden \nepiphany happening in the halls of the big insurance companies and, \ninstead, put a new entity on the field, which would be easier to start \nup and bring a new business model in with it. It is not going to have \nall that tradition and history. You know, you get in a rut. The only \nway to change the business model in health care is to have a new \nentrance--a public entrance and a nonprofit entrance and one that has a \ndispersed interest in the health of the American people rather than the \nwealth of the insurance company shareholders.\n  Would the Senator from Oregon like to jump in?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I am happy to jump in. Last weekend, I \nwas over in central Oregon--in Bend--and I was reading local clips. One \nof the articles that came across was about a lawsuit that had been \nfiled. The article said that a year before an individual had passed \naway because they had repeatedly asked for an MRI to address a pain he \nhad in his back. It turned out to be a tumor, and it killed the \nindividual. But they could never get the MRI approved. The doctor \nrequested it, but it wasn't approved. Another doctor requested it--a \nconsulting doctor--and it wasn't approved. Eventually, the tumor was \nbeyond the point of being able to be operated on. The individual passed \naway.\n  That article talked about a second parallel situation that is \nunfolding right now. The individual is still alive but also is seeking \nan MRI and is being turned down by the same company. I thought, that is \nhow an insurance company makes those profits--by turning down requests \nfor coverage. Hopefully, it doesn't come to the point that a diagnostic \nexam is denied to the degree that someone is going to die, but it \nhappens. It happened in this particular case.\n  The motivating factor of the management of the company was to \nmaximize profit, not to maximize healing. The Senator from Rhode Island \nserved as insurance commissioner. I am sure he saw examples of this. If \nI heard him right, he is saying that in a public option the motivation \nis healing, not profit, and therefore has a long-term perspective. \nTherefore, it can invest in prevention, in disease management. A \nprivate company will not assume that its customer, the policyholder, \nwill still be a customer in 10, 15 years. They take a short-term \nperspective. That is to minimize the amount you spend on health care. \nBut the longer term perspective would be much better for the quality of \nlife of our citizens, and certainly investment in prevention and \ndisease management might have tremendous rewards in bending the cost \ncurve.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. That is precisely accurate. If you are a for-profit \ninsurance company and your motivation is to make money, and if you \nassume your customers are going to stay with you--how long does \nsomebody stay with a company before they change jobs or move to a \ndifferent State? Five to ten years? You put down 100 cents on the \ndollar of a prevention strategy or a wellness strategy and help that \nindividual, and if it is an illness, it is going to show up 8, 9, or 10 \nyears later and you haven't saved yourself any money. You have done the \nright thing for the customer but haven't saved yourself any money. So \nyou have a huge built-in bias to underinvest in wellness and \nprevention.\n  Sure enough, we are a country that underinvests dramatically in \nwellness and prevention. It is impossible not to connect the dots and \nsee that the reason we are so underinvested in wellness and prevention \nhas to do with the motivation of the for-profit insurance sector.\n  (Mr. UDALL of New Mexico assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, one of the things that concerns me about \nthis is we hear about the fact that we should not have a public option \nbecause it is the government doing this and that. When I was in \nbusiness school, I learned that the beauty of the private sector is \ncompetition. If you don't have competition, you will not get the \nadvantage in the private sector. I don't care how you structure things. \nI want to read off some States.\n  The problem is, in so many States we have no competition. The only \nway we are going to get competition is through some kind of a public \noption.\n  In Hawaii, 98 percent are with two insurers. In Rhode Island, it is \n95 percent. In Alaska, it is 95 percent. Vermont, it is 90 percent. \nAlabama, it is 88 percent. In Maine, it is 88 percent. In Montana, it \nis 85 percent. In Wyoming, it is 85. You can go down the list to \nFlorida, which is No. 42, and 45 percent of all the health care is with \ntwo firms. The next one is No. 43, California, and it is 44 percent.\n\n  You cannot get the advantage of free enterprise if you do not have \nthe competition. What this is about--the whole reason to have a public \noption and the only way you are going to bend the cost curve and get \nthis turned around is to have competition. In most of the States, you \nare not going to have competition if you don't have the public option. \nSo the public option is turned on its head.\n\n[[Page S10693]]\n\n  When I hear people on the Senate floor and on television talk about \ngovernment, government, the one thing government by itself cannot \nprovide is competition. In some cases, it is the only way we can \nprovide competition.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. It is a little ironic to have the insurance industry \ncomplaining about government entering into the role as a competitor to \nthe insurance industry, which is the best possible way government could \nenter into this equation, when, for years, they have fought for and \nprotected a government role in the health insurance industry, which is \nto protect them, the insurance industry, from the antitrust laws. \nGovernment has been involved in health insurance for a long time in the \nworst possible way--protecting these insurance companies from being \nsubject to antitrust laws, like every other business in America except, \nI guess, Major League Baseball.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. It is hard to believe when you hear it on the floor--and \nhow do they get the ads straight? First, they say government cannot do \nanything right. The next ad says we cannot just have government because \ngovernment is going to take away our business. Either government is \nefficient and organized or it is not.\n  So what you begin to see is that there isn't much continuity to the \narguments against a public option. They bring out the same old \narguments we heard in 1994 about the public option--and then the public \noption was not like what we talked about before. First, it is an \noption. People don't have to do it if they don't want to.\n  It is inconceivable to me--and we have debated this for a long time--\nI am trying to see the first indication of how we have competition in \nthese States where the overwhelming amount of business is just in two \nfirms. Nobody has come to me and said: How are you going to have \ncompetition? I believe in competition.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Particularly when those two firms aren't subject to \nthe antitrust laws, they are able to price-fix and do things like that. \nFor them to complain about competition after having used government to \nwall themselves off from the basic law that protects competition, you \nkind of have to believe the irony department is open late at night at \ninsurance companies.\n  Mr. BROWN. We know what they say about why they are against the \npublic option. We know what conservatives--many of whom have been close \nallies of the insurance industry in their campaigns for years--we know \nwhat they say: government take-over. The government cannot do anything \nright, and the government will run them out of business.\n  We know the real reason the insurance industry is fighting this: they \nhave has a 428-percent increase in their profits. As they get bigger \nand bigger and squeeze smaller insurance companies out, they know the \npublic option will mean no more huge profits.\n  We know the insurance industry will continue to make profits because \nthey are smart and sometimes they are well run. They have been around a \nlong time. They are going to have marketplace advantages. We know CEOs \nof the 10 largest companies made an average of $11 million. That means \na lot of vice presidents are making $3 million, $4 million, $5 million, \nand $6 million. They like that gravy train. Of course, the people \nmaking the decisions at the insurance companies, doing the lobbying, \nhiring the lobbyists, and hiring the PR firms, and making decisions to \nrun television ads, these are all people who want this to continue.\n  There was an article in the Time Magazine that came out today that \nevery Member in Congress in both Houses has an average of 2.3 industry \nlobbies--that may just be the drug companies or insurance companies \ntogether. There are hundreds of lobbyists around here to protect health \ninsurance profits and to make sure the top executives are making $6 \nmillion, $8 million--up to Aetna's CEO, who makes $24 million a year.\n  They have a lot at stake in this. But you know what, we have a lot \nmore at stake. What we have at stake is we have people--we can read \nletters when we come to the floor. A lot of us day after day read \nletters from people who have preexisting conditions and have lost \ninsurance or a 24-year-old who just graduated from college or just came \nback from the military and cannot get insurance because they had \nasthma, as my wife does, when they were 12 years old and cannot get \ninsurance or their mother got really sick and the insurance practice \ncalled, I say to Senator Whitehouse, rescission--that is a fancy word--\nwe are dumping you off the insurance because you cost us too much \nmoney.\n  It goes back to what you were saying. The business model is, we do \nnot want to insure sick people or people who might get sick, and if we \ndo insure them, we want to find ways not to honor their claims, not to \npay their claims. The industry will fight like a dog, in many cases, to \nkeep from paying those claims. It is a dysfunctional model in business. \nIt is bad for our society. It is really only correctable by a public \noption, injecting that competition and keeping those companies honest.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. One of the ironies in all this is that whole scheme \nof the insurance companies is actually increasing the cost of American \nhealth care. I think from 2000 to 2006 the administrative costs of \ninsurance companies went up over 100 percent. So they are loading on \nmore and more people whose purpose is to do just what you said, which \nis to interfere with the doctors, to require more and more prior \napprovals before you can get treatment, to do more and more claims \ndenial--all of that. And then not only does that add costs to the \nhealth care system within the insurance company, but then the doctors \nhave to fight back.\n  In Rhode Island, I go all around to doctors and medical practices and \ncommunity health centers. The standard number that I hear is that 50 \npercent of the personnel of a doctor's office or a community health \ncenter is not dedicated to providing health care but dedicated to \nhaving to fight back against the insurance industry.\n  I visited the Cranston Community Health Center a few months ago, and \nthey said that more than 50 percent of their personnel is devoted not \nto the health care function but to the ``fighting with the insurance \ncompany'' function. Plus they have to spend $300,000 a year that could \ngo to health care for consultants and computer programmers who help \nthem fight with the insurance companies. It is not just half the \npersonnel, it is also a $300,000 consulting expense.\n  You put the two together, and it is a huge cost and a great \nopportunity for a public option to cut through all of that, to knock \noff the administrative expense on their side, costs on the doctors' \nside, and bring costs down.\n  (Mr. KAUFMAN assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BROWN. They use the term ``medical loss ratio.'' They want to \nkeep the medical loss ratio as low as possible. The medical loss ratio \nis often 75 percent. That means that 75 cents on the dollar goes to \nactual health care, doctors, hospitals, physical therapists. The other \n25 percent is insurance company overhead. They call every dollar they \nspend on health care a loss. That is the way they think. That is the \ninsurance company model. So if the medical cost ratio goes up to 85 \npercent--in other words, they spent 85 percent on medical care--they \ndon't like that. They want the medical cost ratio to stay low because \nthe rest is marketing, profits, and insurance company salaries. It is a \ncurious turn of a phrase. I think they are phasing that term out \nbecause I think they know ``medical loss ratio'' does not sound good to \nthem.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Something Senator Whitehouse mentioned \nearlier that should be driven home very strongly is the antitrust part \nof this. I am not sure people out there know what we are talking about \nwhen we say these large insurance companies that are making all these \nprofits are exempt from the antitrust laws. We know. We were attorneys \ngeneral. We had to get into antitrust cases as attorneys general.\n  What it means is that the antitrust laws say: As you get bigger and \nyou get a more concentrated market, the government can weigh in and say \nthe market is too concentrated; there is not enough competition. What \nwe have done with these insurance companies is we have said: Oh, no, \nno, we are not going to use the antitrust laws; we are going to exempt \nyou from the antitrust\n\n[[Page S10694]]\n\nlaws. That is something I think the average citizen does not realize. \nIt applies in most of the rest of the economy to encourage competition, \nbut it isn't here. I know Senator Brown and Senator Merkley also \nunderstand this point. This is a very important point.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. There is an alarm bell. An alarm rings when a market \nis something called heavily concentrated. The Department of Justice has \nstandards for when a market is heavily concentrated. When a market is \nheavily concentrated, that means they look particularly closely for \nanticompetitive conduct. Of course, they don't look at the insurance \nindustry because they are exempted from the antitrust laws. But 94 \npercent of the major metropolitan areas in America--nearly everyplace--\nis heavily concentrated. It is in that uncompetitive danger zone.\n  The public option is not only a useful alternative, but we are \ndealing with a market where competition is in a very poor state. So it \nis not as if you are adding an extra competitive element to an already \ncompetitive market. You are adding an extra competitive market to a \nmarket that is almost virtually certain to be heavily concentrated and \nto show none of the signs of healthy competition that one looks for in \na healthy marketplace.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. So not only do we have little competition because there \nare many markets with only a couple of companies providing services, \nbut because of the antitrust provisions, those companies are allowed to \ntalk to each other, to collaborate on what rates they charge or what \ndeals they make with providers, further reducing competition, even when \nthere are a couple companies in the market.\n  If we take and flip this notion of competition and look at it through \nthe eyes of the individual working American, then what it becomes is \nchoice. Lack of competition in the marketplace equals lack of choice \nfor individual Americans.\n  I read this story in the press last weekend in central Oregon about \nthis fellow who could not get an MRI. He had probably very few choices \nabout what insurance company he could go to. Would it not be great if \nhe would have the ability during an open window each year to be able to \nsay: I am not satisfied with the service I am receiving or I am not \nsatisfied with the premium I am being charged, and I want to change to \na different company or a different provider to see if they do a better \njob. That is the heart of the American capitalist system if there is \ncompetition and, therefore, choice for the individual. These two things \ngo hand in hand.\n  When folks say that what will happen with a public option is that it \nwill reduce choice, I must say, what are they thinking, because we \ndon't have choice now. But if you bring in a community health option or \na public option, then you do have real choice as a citizen. You can \nmarch with your feet. You can sign up for this program or this program \nor this program.\n  We have competition between governmental opportunities and \nnongovernmental in other areas. I don't think I would like to say to \nthe citizens in the State of Oregon: You no longer have a choice of \nmailing a letter with the post office. Everything you do regarding the \nmail has to be through a private company. I don't think I would like to \nsay to the citizens of Oregon: You no longer have the choice of sending \nyour kids to public school. You have to choose between solely private \noptions.\n  It is a positive thing to have competition, and having a strong, \nrobust public option is going to create a real opportunity for our \ncitizens to choose and, in so doing, create this competition, improve \nservice, and lower costs. If we don't lower costs, then we truly have \nnot succeeded in health care reform.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Think how many Americans from Oregon or from Ohio or \nfrom Rhode Island or from Delaware, the Presiding Officer's home State, \nhave been able to achieve their dreams because they were able to go to \na public university in their home State as opposed to private colleges. \nI have nothing against private colleges and universities. I went to \none. I think they are wonderful. But I am very proud of the University \nof Rhode Island, and for many Rhode Islanders and many people who come \nto Rhode Island to go to URI, that is a great opportunity for them. The \nnotion that it should not be there because it is government run and \ngovernment supported and, therefore, makes Brown University \nnoncompetitive is just crazy. The facts belie it.\n\n  If you look even closer--I know the Senator from Oregon has talked \nbefore about the workers' compensation example--half of the States in \nthe country have public options that operate in an insurance market and \nprovide workers' compensation. Indeed, some of the strongest advocates \nagainst a public option in health insurance on the other side of the \naisle have workers' compensation public plans in their home States.\n  Mr. BROWN. If I may ask a question, I remember the Senator from Rhode \nIsland mentioned some very prominent members of our Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee, on which all three of us sit, that they \nwere some of the strongest critics of the public option, but their \nStates, if I recall, have, in some cases, a single-payer plan.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The Republican leader, Senator McConnell, has a \npublic option in his home State of Kentucky that provides workers' \ncompensation insurance in competition with private insurers. It has \nbeen doing it for years. It has a significant market share. I don't \nrecall that he has ever criticized that plan. I think it seems to be \nhelpful.\n  Mr. BROWN. It probably makes them both work better, public option and \nprivate work better.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. In Arizona, our wonderful colleague, Senator McCain, \nwith whom I am very proud to serve, is also very antagonistic toward \nthe notion of a public option. But in Arizona, if I recall correctly, \ntheir public option has been in the workers' compensation market for 80 \nyears.\n  So the notion that when you have a public option it is going to \ncreep, crawl, and take over and force out competition is proven wrong \nby the actual facts and history of some of the States of Senators who \nare here making that very argument.\n  Mr. BROWN. Didn't you mention the other night the State of Wyoming, \nwhich is represented by the ranking Republican on the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee--before I ask about Senator \nEnzi and that committee, one of the things I think is important to \nremember when I hear people say this is a partisan effort, we all \nremember in our committee we did 11 days--there was no hurry on this--\n11 days of markup, longer than almost any of us can remember in terms \nof that much time in committee, debating and vetting. We adopted 161 \nRepublican amendments. I voted for almost all of them. I know Senator \nWhitehouse and Senator Merkley did most of them, too, and there are \nsome fundamental questions on which we have ideological differences. We \nmade a better bill as a result. But Senator Enzi's State has a public \noption or only a public plan? I cannot remember.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. In Wyoming, the workers' compensation system is run \nentirely by the government. It is a single-payer public plan. As far as \nI can tell, all of the business community in Wyoming is perfectly \ncomfortable with that plan.\n  One of the concerns people raise about a public plan is that it will \ngive terrible public service, terrible customer service. It has been \ndescribed as if you take the IRS and a department of motor vehicles and \nput them together, that is the kind of customer service you will get \nfrom a public plan. I doubt very much that the public plan in Wyoming, \nwhich is a single-payer, government public plan, gives that kind of \nterrible public service because if it did, I would expect the Wyoming \nbusiness community to be up in arms about the way they are being \ntreated by their only choice of workers' compensation insurer. Judging \nfrom the track record, it seems they are pretty satisfied with it.\n  I think when you actually go out into the field and look at examples \nof competition, whether it is the Postal Service, higher education, or \nthese public plans that do workers' compensation in half of our States, \nwe find that a lot of the concerns the people have raised, a lot of the \nfears that seem to animate this debate actually, in reality, appear not \nto prove out.\n\n[[Page S10695]]\n\n  Mr. BROWN. I would add from what Senator Whitehouse said that you can \nlook another place and you can see how in very quantitative and very \nspecific, giving example comparisons that Medicare versus private \ninsurance--we know the cost of bureaucracy, the cost of marketing, the \ncost of future profits, and the cost of high executive salaries. \nPrivate insurance means they have a 15-percent absolute minimum, more \nthan 20, 25, sometimes 30 percent administrative costs. Medicare has \nsomewhere around 3 percent overhead, administrative costs. Medicare is \na public plan. The private insurance companies really don't compete \nvery well with Medicare in terms of measuring them for administrative \ncosts.\n  Whether you look at workers' comp plans when there is a public option \nor you look at workers' comp plans in Wyoming where it is single-payer \nor you look at Medicare, you can see that this argument they make that \nthe government can't do anything right is pretty wrongheaded, \nespecially when they are afraid that government does things so \nefficiently, it is going to run them out of business.\n  We know public plans can coexist, side by side, with private plans \nand make the private plans a lot better. I argue the private plans will \nmake the public plans perhaps more flexible too. It will help both.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. That is what competition is all about.\n  Mr. BROWN. That is what competition is all about.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I have to depart, and I yield the floor to the \ndistinguished Senator from Ohio. But before I go, I want to express my \nappreciation to him for convening us and for his energetic and constant \nadvocacy on this subject. I think he has been a wonderful leader of our \ncaucus, and I wish I could stay longer, but I have a plane awaiting me.\n  So I yield to the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank Senator Whitehouse, and I will wrap up too. I \nthink this discussion is much better than a speech, frankly, from any \none of us. I appreciate the contribution of the Presiding Officer, Mr. \nKaufman, the Senator from Delaware, to this discussion, more than \ndebate, as well as Senator Merkley, who was with us, and Senator Udall \nof New Mexico.\n  As I close, let me run through a couple of these posters reflecting \nthe monopoly that has caused so much hardship for so many people in \nState after State after State. In my State, two insurance companies \nhave a huge part of the market. In parts of southwest Ohio--the \nCincinnati and Dayton areas--two insurance companies have about 80 \npercent of the market. In Senator Udall's State, it is very high. In \nsome States it is even higher.\n  When you have that lack of competition in States, you can see what it \nbrings to us after that. It brings huge profits. Having so little \ncompetition, it means these insurance companies get larger and larger \nand push out smaller insurance companies and we end up with two or \nthree companies. Without competing much with each other, what do you \nend up with? You end up with a 428-percent increase in profits over 7 \nyears. You end up with the 10 top industry CEOs making $118 million, \nheaded by Aetna's CEO making $24 million last year. So what happens? \nForty-seven million Americans don't have insurance. Insurance premiums \nmore than doubled in 9 years. If we do nothing--as many on the other \nside suggest, and certainly the insurance companies would like that--we \nwill see insurance premiums double again in the next 7 or 8 years, \nputting such a burden on small businesses and making our big companies \nless and less competitive internationally. We all know what that means \nin terms of jobs for our people, especially in manufacturing.\n  Again, what fuels all this? What fuels all this and all these dollars \nthey are making is the insurance company business model. The insurance \ncompany business model is to deny care--to deny insurance, to start \nwith--by using very sophisticated sales practices to keep people from \neven buying insurance if they are sick, if they have a preexisting \ncondition that might be expensive. That is part of the business plan. \nThe other end of the business plan is to deny care as often as they can \nfor people who have insurance.\n  So we know what we need to do. We know a public option will make a \nhuge difference in keeping the insurance industry honest. A public \noption will make a huge difference in providing competition. And a \npublic option will make a huge difference in keeping prices down. That \nis why we are here tonight. That is why I appreciate the work of \nSenators Kaufman, Udall, Merkley, and Whitehouse, and why I believe \ncome December, when this work is completed on this health insurance \nbill--which, frankly, our government has been working on for 75 years, \nsince Franklin Roosevelt tried it--we are going to finish with a good \nstrong plan, with a robust public option that will make a huge \ndifference in people's lives.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, I thank my colleagues, and I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/22/senate-section/article/S10695-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                          SSG Matthew Kuglics\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor SSG Matthew Joseph \nKuglics, U.S. Air Force, who lost his life in service to our Nation.\n  Matthew's call to serve our Nation came immediately after his \ngraduation in 2000 from Green High School in Green, OH, not far from \nAkron. That was when he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force.\n  In June of 2004, Matthew achieved the distinction of becoming a \nspecial agent with the Air Force Office of Special Investigations.\n  Sergeant Kuglics then volunteered to deploy to Iraq. There, he served \nwith distinction by providing counterintelligence support to nearly \n4,000 coalition forces at Kirkuk Regional Air Base in Iraq. Following \nhis first tour in Iraq, Matthew volunteered for a second deployment in \nthe combat zone.\n  On June 5, 2007, while in a convoy, Matthew was killed by an \nimprovised explosive device. He gave his life for our Nation. He was 25 \nyears old.\n  Throughout two tours in Iraq, Sergeant Kuglics executed the mission \nof identifying and neutralizing criminal, terrorist, and intelligence \nthreats to the Air Force, to the Department of Defense, and to the \nUnited States of America. His service resulted in successful military \noperations and the increased safety of his fellow servicemembers. \nSergeant Kuglics was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star, the Purple \nHeart, the Air Force Commendation Medal, and the Air Force Combat \nAction Ribbon.\n  On Friday, October 23, 2009--tomorrow--at 11 a.m., there will be a \nstreet dedication ceremony at Barnes Memorial Park at Wright Patterson \nAir Force Base in Dayton, OH, to honor the life and service of Matthew \nJoseph Kuglics.\n  Future generations of the Air Force will now forever honor Staff \nSergeant Kuglics. He represents the best of Ohio, the best of the U.S. \nAir Force, the best of the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/22/senate-section/article/S10695-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10695-S10696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         INCREASING LOAN LIMITS\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, since Congress passed and the President \nsigned the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in February, more \nthan 33,000 loans--nearly $13 billion--have gotten into the hands of \nentrepreneurs, helping to give more small businesses the capital they \nneed to stock their shelves and pay their employees while creating or \nsaving 325,000 jobs at a critical time. But as President Obama said \nyesterday, we must do everything in our power to help our nation's \ninnovators and job creators to ensure their success and our nation's \neconomy and future competitiveness.\n  Ensuring that small businesses have greater access to capital is the \nfirst, and perhaps most critical, step. In hearings, roundtables and \nother meetings with small business owners and lenders, I have heard \ntime and time again that the current small business loan limits do not \nadequately meet their needs. To answer their urgent call for help, I am \nhere today to introduce S. 1832, The Small Business Access to Capital \nAct of 2009. Senate\n\n[[Page S10696]]\n\nSmall Business Committee and Entrepreneurship members Senators John \nKerry of Massachusetts, Tom Harkin of Iowa, Ben Cardin of Maryland and \nJeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, along with Senators Barbara Boxer of \nCalifornia and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, have joined me as cosponsors \nof this bill.\n  The Small Business Access to Capital Act of 2009 contains several of \nthe initiatives President Obama highlighted in his speech yesterday, \nincluding raising the limits on SBA loans to as high as $5.5 million. \nCoupled with lower-cost capital available to community lenders, these \nhigher loan limits will further spur small business growth and aid in \nour nation's continued economic recovery.\n  I have made increasing access to capital for small businesses a top \npriority within my Committee since the day I became Chair, leading my \nfirst Committee event on this topic in January. Since that first \nroundtable, Senator Snowe and I helped pass the Recovery Act's small \nbusiness provisions that eliminated SBA loan fees for borrowers to make \ncapital more affordable, increased the loan guarantees on SBA's largest \nloan program to reduce risk for banks and encourage them to lend when \nthe economy was at its worst, and created initiatives to help unfreeze \nthe secondary market for SBA loans so that banks would have more \ncapital to lend small businesses. These provisions, as I mentioned \nearlier, helped some 33,000 businesses receive $13 billion in capital, \nsaving or creating 325,000 jobs.\n  I have also held four additional hearings and roundtables focused on \nincreasing access to capital for entrepreneurs. Most recently, an \noversight hearing on October 6 focused on what in the Recovery Act has \nbeen implemented and what additional steps Congress needs to take. \nIncreasing loan limits was a main focus.\n  In addition to making greater access to capital a top priority since \nand prior to my becoming Chair, I have specifically supported \nincreasing the loan limits for the past two Congresses, voting \nfavorably for this increase in the last two SBA reauthorization bills \nout of the Senate Small Business Committee. My bill goes above and \nbeyond these increases because in this recession small business needs \nare greater than ever before, and the programs have not been updated in \nmany years.\n  The bill I am introducing today increases the maximum 7(a) loan from \n$2 million to $5 million, increases the maximum 504 loan from $1.5 \nmillion to $5.5 million, and the maximum microloan from $35,000 to \n$50,000. These are all provisions that have been championed by my \ncolleague and Ranking Member, Olympia Snowe, in S.1615, the Next Steps \nfor Main Street Act. Additionally, the bill includes a provision to \nallow businesses to use 504 loan guarantees to refinance existing \nbusiness debt and allows microloan intermediaries to have greater \naccess to technical assistance grants. The bill also increases the \namount that a New Market Venture Capital Company can invest in any one \ncompany, helping fast-growing businesses located in areas with chronic \nunderemployment.\n  The Recovery Act included a controversial provision that exempts the \nNational Institutes of Science (NIH) from participating in the Small \nBusiness Innovation Research (SBIR) and the Small Business Technology \nTransfer (STTR) programs. This provision could cost small businesses as \nmuch as $230 million in lost r work, impacting the development of \nneeded military and medical technologies and therapies. In addition, it \ndirectly counters the goals of the Recovery Act to create high-paying \njobs, spur innovation and boost America's competitiveness. This bill \ncontains a provision to correct this unfair exemption by requiring NIH \nto obligate $150 million of the Recovery funds it received to be used \nfor SBIR and STTR projects.\n  Last, the bill amends the America's Recovery Capital (ARC) loan \nprogram, enacted as part of the Recovery Act, so that businesses with \nexisting SBA 7(a) loans can access this financing. The temporary ARC \nprogram offers interest-free loans to viable small businesses, which \ncarry a 100-percent guaranty from the SBA to the lender and require no \nfees paid to SBA. Loan proceeds are provided over a six-month period \nand repayment of the ARC loan principal is deferred for 12 months after \nthe last disbursement of the proceeds. Repayment can extend up to five \nyears.\n  With small businesses making up the largest source of employment in \nthis country, and the national unemployment rate still too high, \nchanges like these are vital to the success of our small businesses and \nthe competitiveness of our nation. I look forward to working with \nPresident Obama and his Administration, Ranking Member Snowe and my \nSenate and House colleagues to quickly pass this critical legislation \nand send to the President for signature.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/22/senate-section/article/S10696-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING CAMDEN AEROJET WORKERS\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I am joined with my colleague, \nSenator Pryor, to recognize the Aerojet-General Corporation's Camden, \nAR, production facility. The Camden facility recently achieved the \nmilestone shipment of its 5,000th MK 104 dual thrust rocket motor to \nRaytheon Missile Systems and the U.S. Navy. Aerojet is a world-\nrecognized aerospace and defense leader principally serving the \nmissile, space propulsion and armaments markets. This most significant \nmilestone will be commemorated with a celebration ceremony held in \nCamden, AR, on Wednesday, October 28, 2009.\n  The MK 104 dual thrust rocket motor provides the main propulsion for \nthe standard missile 2 (SM-2), the U.S. Navy's primary surface-to-air \nair defense weapon. SM-2 is an integral part of the AEGIS weapon system \naboard Ticonderoga-class cruisers and Arleigh Burke-class destroyers. \nThe MK 104 dual thrust rocket motor also is the second stage propulsion \nfor the Navy's newest defensive weapon, the standard missile 6 extended \nrange active missile, SM-6, which will provide extended range anti-air \nwarfare capability over both sea and land. The MK 104 also is utilized \non the standard missile 3, SM-3, for aegis ballistic missile defense, \nBMD, from the sea missions.\n  Aerojet has manufactured the MK 104 dual thrust rocket motor since \n1987 at its Camden facility. The Standard Missile family of products, \nwhich also includes the MK 72 booster and MK 125 warhead, are \nnoteworthy elements of Aerojet's industry-leading tactical propulsion \nportfolio produced in Camden.\n  On the occasion of this milestone, Senator Pryor and I are proud to \njoin together and lend our voices to congratulate and honor the nearly \n600 Aerojet workers in Camden, AR, on a job well-done. You have served \nour State and our Nation admirably for more than 20 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/22/senate-section/article/S10696-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10696-S10697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO CLARA KIRCHER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have been privileged to meet so many \npeople in my 35 years in the Senate. One who will always stand out is \nClara Kircher, who stayed with me in my office for over a quarter of a \ncentury, leaving as deputy chief of staff when she retired.\n  She is a remarkable woman who, on her own, raised her family, giving \nthem the best example of a strong, talented, and loving woman. She did \nthe same in my office, mentoring so many, and showing by example that \nshe could keep a 50- to 60-hour week and still go back to college.\n  Marcelle and I consider her one of our dearest friends, and we were \nprivileged to be with her when she was inducted into the hall of fame \nat Elizabeth Seton High School in Bladensburg, MD. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the statement they made about her at that induction be \nprinted in the Record as an example to everybody in the Senate family.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Elizabeth Seton High School Hall of Fame Induction\n\n       Clara Smiley Kircher was born on May 3, 1945 in Washington, \n     D.C., the daughter of Ann and Golden Smiley. She grew up in \n     Mt. Rainier, MD, and attended Saint James Elementary School. \n     She was accepted into the first freshman class at Elizabeth \n     Seton High School in 1959 and graduated from Seton in June \n     1963. At Seton, she was a member of the Glee Club, Masque and \n     Gavel, basketball team, Future Nurses Club, Student Council, \n     Louise de Marilacs and Honor Society. She attended Saint \n     Joseph's College in Emmitsburg, Maryland, where she \n     majored in business, from 1963-1965. She married Walter \n     Kircher from Riverdale, Maryland, at Saint\n\n[[Page S10697]]\n\n     James Church in April 1965. Her Maid of Honor was Monica \n     Kircher Brady, her best friend at Seton since their \n     sophomore year. Clara and Walter had five children--Anne, \n     Walter, Eric, Anthony and Aaron. Their marriage ended in \n     1978, and Clara had to raise their five children as a \n     single parent.\n       Clara went to work in the office of U.S. Senator Patrick \n     Leahy (D-VT) in October 1981. She served as the assistant to \n     the Chief of Staff and the Press Secretary. After twenty-six \n     years in the Senate, she retired in October 2007 as Deputy \n     Chief of Staff to Senator Leahy. While working for Senator \n     Leahy, she returned to college to complete her degree. In May \n     1996, she graduated summa cum laude from Bowie State \n     University with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Public \n     Administration. As Deputy Chief of Staff to Senator Leahy, \n     Clara helped establish the Leahy Women's Economic Opportunity \n     Conference which is now in its 13th year. The Leahy Women's \n     Conference focuses on the career and business development of \n     Vermont women and is open to all women free of charge. Women \n     learn the skills of running their own business, writing a \n     financial plan, and sharpening their computer and personal \n     skills for a new job or career change. She was the intern \n     coordinator for the Leahy College Internship Program, which \n     offers young women and men the opportunity for a close-up \n     view of their government and the workings of a Senator's \n     office. Clara also served as the Chief Financial Clerk for \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee where she helped with the \n     administration of the Committee and prepared committee \n     budgets for Chairman Leahy.\n       In November 2008, she temporarily returned to the U.S. \n     Senate to help start up the office of the newly-elected \n     Senator Mark Warner (D-VA). In March 2009, she went back to \n     her retirement life and is now enjoying time with her \n     children and eleven grandchildren. Two of her granddaughters \n     have followed their Grandmother's footsteps in attending \n     Seton. Clara Bannigan graduated in May 2009, and is a \n     freshman at Christopher Newport University studying music; \n     and Alice Bannigan is a sophomore this year.\n       Clara and her family live in Bowie, Maryland, since 1971 \n     and are members of St. Pius X Church. Clara is an active \n     member of the Seton Alumna and is proud to be a member of the \n     first graduating class of Elizabeth Seton High School, the \n     Class of 1963.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/22/senate-section/article/S10697-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BETTY TAYMOR\n\n Mr. KIRK.

SPEAKES\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I recognize the \ndistinguished service of LTG Stephen M. Speakes as he prepares to \nretire after 35 years of exceptional service to this Nation as an \nofficer of the U.S. Army. I have had the pleasure to work with General \nSpeakes over the last several years as he served as the Army deputy \nchief of staff, G-8, a position in which he was responsible for \nmatching the service's resources to the needs of our soldiers. His \ncompassionate leadership, unwavering commitment and selfless dedication \nare exemplified in his enumerable contributions throughout his \ndistinguished career.\n  General Speakes was commissioned as an armor officer in 1974. He \nbegan his career with troop-leading assignments in the 3d Armored \nCavalry Regiment at Fort Bliss, TX, and the Third Brigade, Third \nInfantry Division in Aschaffenburg, Germany. He commanded the 2d \nSquadron, 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment at Bad Kissingen, and the 2d \n``Blackjack'' Brigade in the First Cavalry Division, Fort Hood, TX.\n  General Speakes' service also includes assignments on the Joint Staff \nwith the srategic arms reduction talks nuclear negotiations team in the \nJoint Staff's J5 Directorate for Strategic Plans and Policy, as a war \nplanner in the Joint Staff's J7 Directorate for Operational Plans and \nJoint Force Development, and on the Army Staff's Force Development \nDirectorate. A graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, \nGeneral Speakes received a master's degree in government from \nGeorgetown University and was a fellow at Harvard University's John F. \nKennedy School of Government. At Harvard, he coauthored a study of U.N. \npeace enforcement, ``A Blue Helmet Combat Force.''\n  His senior assignments include a tour in Europe beginning in 1997 as \nthe V Corps G3 and chief of staff. He then served as the deputy G3 at \nU.S. Army Forces Command before assignment as the chief of staff of the \nIII Corps in August 2001. From August 2002 thru June 2003, General \nSpeakes served as the assistant division commander of the 4th Infantry \nDivision, Mechanized, and deployed in that capacity for Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. In June 2003, he departed Tikrit, Iraq, and reported to Kuwait \nas the deputy commanding general, Third U.S. Army and Coalition Forces \nLand Component Command. While there, he oversaw the redeployment of \n250,000 soldiers and marines as the United States executed the first \nIraq force rotation. Returning to the United States, General Speakes \nserved as the director, force development on the G-8 staff from August \n2004 to December 2006 before assuming his current responsibilities.\n  His lovely wife, Mrs. Gigi Speakes, has supported General Speakes and \nall the members of his commands in every assignment for the past 30 \nyears. She has been integral to all the contributions that this Army \nteam has been able to make to soldiers, the Army and the Nation. She is \nan outstanding volunteer in all aspects of her service to the Army.\n  The Speakes are the epitome of an Army family. Clearly, General and \nMrs. Speakes' greatest achievement was the raising of two incredible \nsons, Grant and Brennan. Both are Army officers who have served on \nmultiple deployments in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Their \ncontinued success in the military is the fruit of their parents' \nenduring love and dedication to them and other junior soldiers.\n  On behalf of the Senate and the United States of America, I thank \nGeneral Speakes, his wife Gigi, and his entire family for the \ncommitment, sacrifice, and contribution that they have made throughout \nhis honorable military service. I congratulate them on completing an \nexceptional and successful career, and wish them the greatest\n\n[[Page S10698]]\n\nhappiness as they move on to the next phase of their life \ntogether.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/22/senate-section/article/S10698-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNIZING D & G MACHINE PRODUCTS, INCORPORATED\n\n Ms. SNOWE.

A bill to prohibit the Federal Communications Commission \nfrom further regulating the Internet; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN.  Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation that would prohibit the Federal Communications Commission \nfrom enacting rules that would seek to regulate the Internet. Today the \ncommission will meet to determine whether the historically open \narchitecture and free flow of the Internet should be subject to onerous \nFederal regulation. Specifically, the commission will seek to impose \n``net neutrality'' rules that would reign in the network management \npractices of all Internet service providers, including wireless phone \ncompanies.\n  Skeptical consumers should rightly view these new rules as yet \nanother government power grab over a private service provided by a \nprivate company in a competitive marketplace. Earlier this year the \nadministration moved to control much of the auto industry and the \nbanking industry and now the administration is trying to control the \ntechnology industry by regulating its very core: the Internet.\n  This government takeover of the Internet will stifle innovation, in \nturn slowing our economic turnaround and further depressing an already \nanemic job market. Outside of health care, the technology industry is \nthe nation's fastest growing job market. Innovation and job growth in \nthis sector of our economy is the key to America's future prosperity. \nIn 2008, while most industries were slashing jobs in the worst economy \nin nearly 30 years, high tech industries actually added over 77,000 \ngood high-paying jobs. Just this month, Google and Yahoo both released \npositive earnings reports.\n  According to a report released last week by the Recovery \nAccountability and Transparency Board, which oversees the stimulus \nplan, 30,000 jobs have been directly created or saved by contractors \nwho received money from the $787 billion stimulus package for \ninfrastructure and social programs. This pales in comparison to the \nfact that the high tech industry produced more than double the number \nof jobs so far ``created or saved'' by the so-called ``stimulus \nlegislation.'' It did so without the assistance of $787 billion from \nthe wallets of taxpayers. Maybe a better stimulus package for this \neconomy would be an administration decision to keep the Internet free \nof government control and regulation.\n  Unfortunately, the administration seems oblivious to the fact that \ntheir stated opposition to the supposed excesses of capitalism is at \nodds with a new regulatory regime being lobbied for by the most \npowerful businesses. As the Chairman of the Federal Communications \nCommission has recognized, Americans have benefitted enormously from \nthe Internet's ``fundamental architecture of openness.'' The light \ntouch regulatory approach toward the Internet that was advanced by \nprevious administrations has brought Americans social networking, low \ncost long distance calling, texting, telemedicine and over 85,000 \n``apps'' for the iPhone. It also brought us Twitter, You Tube, Hulu, \nKindle, the Blackberry and the Palm. It has allowed the Internet to \nchange our lives forever.\n  The wireless industry exploded over the past twenty years due to \nlimited government regulation. Wireless carriers invested $100 billion \nin infrastructure and development over the past three years which has \nled to faster networks, more competitors in the marketplace and lower \nprices compared to\n\n[[Page S10703]]\n\nany other country. Meanwhile, wired telephones and networks have become \na slow dying breed as they are mired in state and Federal regulations, \nuniversal service contribution requirements and limitations on use.\n  It is for these reasons that today I introduce The Internet Freedom \nAct of 2009 that will keep the Internet free from government control \nand regulation. This will allow for continued innovation that will in \nturn create more high-paying jobs for the millions of Americans who are \nout of work or seeking new employment. Keeping businesses free from \noppressive regulations is the best stimulus for the current economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself and Mr. Webb):\n  S. 1838. A bill to establish a commission to commemorate the \nsesquicentennial of the American Civil War; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate a defining \nmoment in our Nation's history--the American Civil War. From 1861-1865, \nthe U.S. was torn apart, engaged in the most deadly struggle that has \never befallen our great Nation. As we approach the War's 150th \nanniversary, we must remember the contributions of our forefathers, \nthose many Americans who gave their lives to make America what it is \nnow. Today I join my colleague, Senator Webb, in introducing the Civil \nWar Sesquicentennial Commission Act of 2009.\n  We all studied the Civil War in school. We know that the opening \nshots of the Civil War were fired at Fort Sumter, South Carolina in \nApril of 1861 and that Robert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant agreed to \npeace at Appomattox Court House, Virginia on April 9, 1865. We \nrecognize those most horrific battles--Antietam, Gettysburg, \nFredericksburg, and the 10,000 other sites from New Mexico to Vermont \nthat were host to fighting. We celebrate the strength and bravery of \nindividuals such as Frederick Douglas and Harriett Tubman who risked \neverything to combat the deplorable institution of slavery. Every \nFebruary, we observe President Lincoln's birthday, a day to recollect \nhis legacy. The Emancipation Proclamation and Gettysburg address are \ntwo of the most memorable documents in American history, and it is \nthanks to President Lincoln that slavery was eradicated.\n  These are the most memorable aspects of the Civil War, but the \ninfluence and impact reaches so much further. I recently learned that \non this very day, 148 years ago, work was underway on a revolutionary \nnew technology--an innovation that would forever change the face of \nnaval warfare. It was in October of 1861 that the keel of the USS \nMonitor was laid. For those who may not remember, the USS Monitor was \nthe world's first ship to be entirely constructed from iron. It also \nfeatured the first rotating gun turret, allowing it to fire in any \ndirection regardless of which way the ship was facing. Naval history \nrecognizes this as the beginning of the end for wooden warships and the \nneed to strategically position ships because their artillery could only \nbe fired in one direction. I recognize this as an example of American \ningenuity.\n  This is just one additional example to show how the events of the \nAmerican Civil War have reverberated through history. Every aspect of \nAmerican life was affected whether economic, cultural, political, or \notherwise. The most profound consequence of the Civil War was to end \nthe legal edifice that justified the subjugation of people based on \naccidental characteristics such as race.\n  We must remember what our forefathers sacrificed for us. More than 3 \nmillion men fought in the Civil War. They left their homes and their \nloved ones to fight for their beliefs, their families, their Nation. \n620,000 of those soldiers gave their lives.\n  We must remember the untold number of civilians who lost their lives \nor welfare because the battles were taking place all around them. No \nState, city, community, or family was untouched by devastation or loss.\n  We must remember the legacies of the Civil War. The U.S. emerged \ncompletely altered after the 4 years of struggle, and as a testament of \nAmerican resilience, grew stronger than it was before. The cultural and \npolitical ramifications still shape the American landscape today. It \nwas in the era of Reconstruction that Congress adopted the 13th, 14th, \nand 15th amendments to the Constitution, acknowledging black Americans \nas free and equal citizens of the U.S.\n  The Civil War Sesquicentennial Commission Act of 2009 is about \npreserving the memory. It will establish a Commission to ensure \nsuitable National observance. Consisting of 25 members from government, \nbusiness and academia, this commission will develop and carry out \nprograms to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Civil War. It will \nwork together with State and local governments, as well as various \norganizations, to assist with these activities and ensure that \nremembrance occurs at every level.\n  Mr. President, 2011 marks the anniversary of a monumentally tragic \ntime in American history, but also a time of intensive change, growth, \nand hope. We must use this opportunity to reflect upon the Civil War, \nthe sacrifices, legacies, and changes in our Nation. I urge support of \nthe Civil War Sesquicentennial Commission Act of 2009.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 1843. A bill to provide increased penalties for health care fraud; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak about \nthe Strengthening Enforcement for Health Care Fraud Crimes Act of 2009, \nwhich I am introducing today with Senator Graham.\n  At a time when Congress is poised to pass historic health care reform \nlegislation to protect the health of Americans, it is imperative that \nwe do all that we can to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse in America's \nhealth care systems. We must do all that we can to prevent, detect and \nvigorously prosecute health care fraud.\n  Health care fraud costs tax payers billions of dollars each year. \nNational health care spending in the United States exceeded $2.2 \ntrillion and represented 16 percent of the Nation's Gross Domestic \nProduct in 2007. The National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association, \nNHCAA, conservatively estimates that 3 percent of all health care \nspending--or more than $60 billion--is lost to health care fraud \nperpetrated against both public and private health plans. Other \nestimates by government and law enforcement agencies suggest losses \nfrom fraud as high as 10 percent--or $220 billion annually.\n  Fraud committed against both public and private plans by health care \nproviders, medical equipment suppliers, drug companies, and also by \nfraudulent plan operators and brokers, undermines public trust in our \nhealth care system.\n  More importantly, the costs of health care fraud are borne by all \nAmericans. It does not matter if you have health insurance sponsored by \nyour employer, if you purchase privately your own insurance policy, or \npay taxes to fund government health care programs. Health care fraud \nresults in reduced benefits and coverage, and higher premiums and \ncosts. It can mean higher taxes and increased budgetary challenges.\n  Health care fraud often targets the most vulnerable in our society--\nthe elderly, the poor, and the infirm. Criminals involved in health \ncare fraud falsify patients' medical records and steal patients' \npersonal and insurance information to submit fraudulent claims. Health \ncare fraud subjects patients to unnecessary and dangerous medical \nprocedures. According to the FBI:\n\n       One of the most significant trends observed in recent \n     health care fraud cases includes the willingness of medical \n     professionals to risk patient harm in their schemes. FBI \n     investigations in several offices are focusing on subjects \n     who conduct unnecessary surgeries, prescribe dangerous drugs \n     without medical necessity, and engage in abusive or sub-\n     standard care practices.\n\n  FBI Financial Crimes Report to the Public, Fiscal year 2007.\n  Criminologists have long reported that criminals look at three \nfactors in performing their own cost benefit analysis: the risk of \ngetting caught; the probability of being convicted; and the severity of \nthe punishment.\n  The bill I am introducing today addresses the third factor--and sends \nthe message loud and clear to those who would contemplate committing \nhealth\n\n[[Page S10704]]\n\ncare fraud. If caught stealing $100,000 or more you will go to jail--no \nifs, ands or buts. The bill provides a sentence of at least 6 months \nincarceration for committing health care fraud with losses of $100,000 \nor more. You may even get more jail--under the discretionary \nguidelines--but no one will get less than 6 months for schemes of this \nsize.\n  Since the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker in January \n2005 and made the Sentencing Guidelines advisory, sentencing judges \nhave wide discretion to impose sentences on criminal defendants unless \nmandatory minimum sentences are applicable. Except for aggravated \nidentity theft crimes, defendants do not face mandatory imprisonment \nfor white collar crimes. Given the importance and necessity to \nvigorously prosecute and punish serious health care fraud crimes, I \nurge the Senate to pass this bill. Without it, there will be no \ncertainty of punishment nor effective deterrence for serious health \ncare fraud crimes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW (for herself, Mr. Voinovich, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. \n        Brown, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 1857. A bill to establish national centers of excellence for the \ntreatment of depressive and bipolar disorders; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today I introduced legislation to create \na national strategy for treating two diseases that affect millions of \nAmericans: depression and bipolar disorders. This bill, the \nEstablishing a Network of Health-Advancing National Centers of \nExcellence for Depression, or the ENHANCED Act, will establish a \nnetwork of national centers of excellence for the treatment of these \ndisabling conditions. My bill would increase the number of people with \ndepressive disorders who receive appropriate and evidence-based \ntreatment; it would create a national resource to develop and \ndisseminate evidence-based interventions, and provide public and \nprofessional education aimed at eradicating the stigma associated with \ndepressive and bipolar disorders.\n  Depression and bipolar disorders affect one of every five people in \nthe United States and are the leading cause of disability among \nindividuals between the ages of 15 and 44. In fact, more Americans \nsuffer from depression, bipolar illness and other mood disorders than \nfrom coronary heart disease and cancer combined.\n  Depression can affect anyone, at any age, at any time. It affects \nchildren, adolescents, and adults. It affects people of all racial, \nethnic, religious, and socioeconomic levels as well as both sexes. \nYoung adults, women of childbearing age, people with chronic medical \nconditions such as diabetes and heart disease, and adults over the age \nof 55 are at especially high risk of depression.\n  With medication, psychotherapy, or combined treatment, most people \nwith depression and mood disorders can be effectively treated and \nresume productive lives. Yet one-third of those suffering from \ndepression--nearly 5 million Americans--do not receive treatment \nbecause they cannot afford it, do not believe it is needed, are afraid \nof societal judgment, or do not know where to go.\n  My bill is based on work done informally by 16 academic research \ninstitutions across the nation. Led by my own State's University of \nMichigan Depression Center, these comprehensive research and treatment \ncenters have joined together to create a network of depression centers \npositioned to take academic research and translate it into practice, \nstandardize diagnoses, treat early and more effectively, and prevent \nrecurrences of depression and bipolar disorders.\n  Currently, there is no direct federal support or coordination of this \nwork. Clinicians lack universally accepted multi-disciplinary \napproaches and real-time clinical and care management guidelines. \nNearly half of all diagnoses of depression and bipolar are missed. And \ntragically, one of the preventable costs of undiagnosed, untreated and \nundertreated depression is suicide. The World Health Organization \nrecently reported that suicide causes more deaths around the world \nevery year than homicide or war. Across all age groups nationwide, more \nthan 90 percent of those who commit suicide have a diagnosable \npsychiatric illness at the time of death: usually depression, alcohol \nabuse or both. Clearly, we need better diagnostic approaches to \ndepression in primary care, other medical settings, and mental health \nprograms.\n  Finally, depression has a significant economic impact on society. The \nestimated total annual cost of depression in the U.S. is $83.1 billion, \nwith the majority of costs in the form of reduced productivity, \nabsenteeism, and mortality.\n  The ENHANCED Act offers us a viable response to a devastating and \noften debilitating disease: it would create a national network with a \npathway for developing and expanding up to 30 depression centers of \nexcellence with a goal of increasing access to the most appropriate and \nevidence-based depression care; it would develop and disseminate \nevidence-based treatment standards, clinical guidelines, and protocols \nto improve accurate and timely diagnosis of depression and bipolar \ndisorders; it would expand multidisciplinary, translational, and \npatient-oriented research by fostering the collaboration of academic \nand community-based organizations; and, it would establish a \nsustainable national resource for public and professional education and \ntraining.\n  We need to act now to make effective and evidence-based treatment of \ndepressive and bipolar disorders available to the millions of Americans \nsuffering from depression.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me today to support the ENHANCED Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Mental Health America,\n\n                                 Alexandria, VA, October 13, 2009.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: On behalf of Mental Health America \n     (MHA) and our national network of more than 300 affiliates \n     across the United States, I wanted to express our strong \n     support for your legislative proposal to establish national \n     centers of excellence for the treatment of depressive and \n     bipolar disorders.\n       Your proposal to create the national network of centers of \n     excellence for depressive and bipolar disorders would enhance \n     the coordination and integration of physical, mental and \n     social care that are so critical to the identification and \n     treatment of depression and other mental disorders across the \n     lifespan. The work of these centers will be an essential \n     component in the dissemination and implementation of \n     evidence-based practices in clinical settings throughout the \n     country.\n       The goals of this initiative would be to create improved \n     clinical care guidelines, chronic care coordination, multi-\n     disciplinary translational research, and public-private \n     partnerships. Publicly available national databases would be \n     developed and community resources would be leveraged. This \n     initiative would also encourage the use of electronic health \n     records and telehealth technologies to better coordinate, \n     manage, and improve access to care.\n       These centers are especially critical at this time given \n     the strong evidence that economic uncertainty and recession \n     increase the rates of psychiatric symptoms and demand for \n     services. Depression is associated with poorer health \n     outcomes and higher health care costs. Rates of depression \n     and suicide--already at a staggering level of nearly 33,000 \n     persons a year (roughly twice the number of homicides)--tend \n     to climb during times of economic tumult. Our nation must \n     prioritize the integration and coordination of mental health \n     with general health care.\n       As you know, the lack of adequate care coordination for \n     individuals with mental illness makes this population \n     particularly vulnerable. For example, persons with serious \n     mental illness die, on average, 25 years earlier than the \n     general population, mainly due to other co-occurring chronic \n     conditions. This proposal is an important step in an effort \n     to decrease these distressing mortality rates and improve the \n     quality of life for individuals experiencing mental health \n     conditions.\n       MHA applauds your work on this important legislative \n     initiative and looks forward to working with you to achieve \n     its enactment at the earliest possible date.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             David L. Shern, Ph.D,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          American Association for\n\n\n                                         Geriatric Psychiatry,\n\n                                    Bethesda, MD, October 6, 2009.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: On behalf of the American \n     Association for Geriatric Psychiatry (AAGP), I wanted to take \n     this opportunity to express our strong support for your\n\n[[Page S10705]]\n\n     legislative proposal to establish national centers of \n     excellence for the treatment of depressive and bipolar \n     disorders.\n       AAGP is a professional membership organization dedicated to \n     promoting the mental health and well being of older Americans \n     and improving the care of those with late-life mental \n     disorders. AAGP's membership consists of approximately 2,000 \n     geriatric psychiatrists as well as other health professionals \n     who focus on the mental health problems faced by older \n     adults.\n       Of the approximately 32 million Americans who have attained \n     age 65, about five million suffer from depression, yet an \n     astounding number go without treatment. Depression is \n     associated with poorer health outcomes and higher health care \n     costs. Those with depression are more likely to be \n     hospitalized and experience almost twice the number of \n     medical visits than those without depression. Older adults \n     also have the highest rate of suicide in the country, \n     accounting for approximately 20 percent of all suicide \n     deaths; and the suicide rate for those 85 and older is nearly \n     twice the national average.\n       The national network of centers of excellence for \n     depressive disorders that would be created by your proposal \n     would enhance the coordination and integration of physical, \n     mental and social care that is so critical to the \n     identification and treatment of depression and other mental \n     disorders across the lifespan. The work of these centers will \n     be an essential component in the dissemination and \n     implementation of evidence-based practices in clinical \n     settings throughout the country.\n       We applaud your work on this important legislative \n     initiative and look forward to working with you to achieve \n     its enactment at the earliest possible date.\n           Sincerely,\n                                     Charles F.

Debbie Stabenow,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Brown, Kerry, Hutchison, and Stabenow: On \n     behalf of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent \n     Psychiatry (AACAP), I write to support the ENHANCED Act of \n     2009. The establishment of national centers of excellence for \n     the treatment of depression and bipolar disorder is essential \n     as we move forward with real healthcare reform.\n       As child and adolescent psychiatrists, our members are \n     deeply invested in early identification of children with \n     depressive disorders, as well as prevention strategies \n     targeting children at risk. As many as 1 in 33 children and 1 \n     in 8 teenagers in the United States have clinical depression. \n     Suicide is the leading cause of death among those between the \n     ages of 15 and 24.\n       While many adolescents are diagnosed with a depressive \n     disorder, most go undetected and untreated. Lack of detection \n     leads to social and academic decline, may foster treatment \n     resistance in children, and result in many future problems.\n       The AACAP is a medical membership association established \n     by child and adolescent psychiatrists in 1954. Now over 8,000 \n     members strong, the AACAP is the leading national medical \n     association dedicated to treating and improving the quality \n     of life for the estimated 14 million American youth under 18 \n     years of age who are affected by emotional, behavioral, \n     developmental and mental disorders.\n       On behalf of AACAP's members, I commend you for your \n     continued leadership on this issue. We are pleased to support \n     this bill and we look forward to working with you and your \n     staff to ensure its passage. Please contact Kristin Kroeger, \n     Director of Government Affairs, if you have any questions \n     concerning children's mental health issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Robert L. Hendren,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               American Foundation\n\n\n                                       for Suicide Prevention,\n\n                                   New York, NY, October 21, 2009.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: It is with great enthusiasm that we \n     write to support the ENHANCED Act which would establish a \n     national network of Centers of Excellence for the treatment \n     of a full range of depressive disorders that afflict our \n     population.\n       Although depressive disorders are the most common illnesses \n     that lead to disability in our country, there has been little \n     concerted national effort to acknowledge the problem and \n     enhance the treatment. Besides disability, they cause \n     enormous suffering, loss of productivity, difficulty with \n     family, friends and colleagues and can be fatal. As you are \n     aware, suicide is the 11th leading cause of death in this \n     country. Ninety percent of those who die by suicide have a \n     mental disorder and the most common mental disorder is \n     depression. Most people have known someone who has died by \n     suicide. While survivors often recognize that the person was \n     in a great deal of pain and agony, they often do not \n     understand that the person was suffering from a treatable \n     disease. We believe that this legislation can lead to \n     partnerships between organizations like ours and the Centers \n     of Excellence with the goal of reducing suicide. This has \n     been an unrealized national imperative since the National \n     Strategy for Suicide Prevention was issued in 2001.\n       Given that there is evidence that depression is under-\n     recognized and often inadequately treated, we believe that \n     these Centers of Excellence would provide appropriate and \n     evidence-based treatment. In so doing, they would provide \n     families, the public and professionals with knowledge about \n     theses disorders and help to erase the stigma that exists \n     about them.\n       Treating depression requires a great deal of skill in order \n     to provide the best care to each individual. These Centers of \n     Excellence will promote best practices and therefore become \n     national resources for the 35,000,000 people affected with \n     depressive illnesses.\n       Given the recent well-documented increase in suicides in \n     the military and returning veterans, it is clear that the \n     country needs an all-out commitment to the education and \n     treatment of these disorders. Thank you again for your work \n     on this bill and please let us know how we can ensure that it \n     becomes law, so that millions of Americans suffering from \n     depressive disorders can recover and live healthy and \n     productive lives.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robert Gebbia,\n       Executive Director.\n     Paula J. Clayton,\n       Medical Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Kohl, and Ms. \n        Snowe):\n  S. 1859. A bill to reinstate Federal matching of State spending of \nchild support incentive payments; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today, I introduce the Child Support \nProtection Act of 2009; with my colleagues Senators Cornyn, Kohl, and \nSnowe. This bill continues the long-standing, bipartisan support of \nCongress for the Child Support Enforcement program, which began with \nthe passage of the authorizing legislation in 1974.\n  Child support enforcement is a strong partnership between the Federal \nGovernment and State governments to help parents provide long term \nsupport for their children. It includes a network of 60,000 dedicated \nstaff serving 17 million children across this country.\n  In 2008, paternity was established for 1.8 million children ensuring \nthat the legal rights of both the children and their fathers were \nprotected; 1.2 million orders for support were also established, \nresulting in $26.6 billion of child support being collected and \ndistributed to families. This is an important investment in the future \nof our Nation, our children.\n  So, the Child Support Enforcement program's results are impressive \nand it is widely recognized as one of the most effective programs \noperated by the Federal Government. In fact, the program is notable for \ncollecting $4.79 for each dollar of expenditure. It is a true bargain \nthat works well.\n  Child support collections account for 31 percent of the income of \nsingle parent households, but the program does so much more. It works \nwith non-custodial parents who need employment so that they can make \nregular payments. Child support staff also play a critical role in \ntimes of high joblessness, by processing adjustments to support orders \nso that non-custodial parents do not fall hopelessly behind.\n  When Congress passed the Child Support Performance and Incentive Act \nof 1998, CSPIA, it created an innovative incentive program that rewards \nefficient, results-oriented child support enforcement efforts. These \nearned performance incentives must be used for child support \nactivities. One of every $4 from State expenditures to fund the child \nsupport program comes from CSPIA incentives and matched Federal funds. \nThe Deficit Reduction Act, DRA, of 2005 repealed the authority to use \nthe earned performance incentives as a match for Federal funds. The \nbill we have introduced today reverses the funding reduction imposed by \nthe DRA.\n  States are using the incentives in a variety of ways. In my State of \nWest Virginia, the incentive dollars are being used to invest in \ntechnology to upgrade services and enhance customer service. Thirty \nStates or territories are investing in staff and program operations. \nSixteen States are investing in\n\n[[Page S10706]]\n\ntechnology, and three others are investing in customer service \nprograms.\n  The Child Support Protection Act would give States the authority to \nuse earned performance incentives to fund this important work and \ncontinue the impressive results that are being achieved. This permanent \nreversal is critical so that those in State and local government can \nbudget for 2011 and beyond. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to \ncosponsor this much needed legislation that is not only important to \nchild support enforcement, but our children, their families, and the \nStates.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise with my colleagues, Senators \nRockefeller, Cornyn and Snowe, in support of the Child Support \nProtection Act. Our bipartisan group has joined together in a fight for \nour states, counties and the people we serve every day. The legislation \nwe are introducing today represents a renewed effort in that fight, as \nwe work to restore cuts to the child support enforcement program.\n  This fight began in 2005 during Senate debate of the Deficit \nReduction Act, or the DRA. That bill included cuts to the child support \nenforcement program--one of the most effective federal programs and one \nthat directly benefits hardworking, single parent families. During \nconsideration of the DRA, I joined 75 other Senators in support of a \nresolution rejecting child support funding cuts. But conferees ignored \nthe Senate's record, including a provision to prevent states from \nreceiving Federal matching funds on incentive payments.\n  Before passage of the Deficit Reduction Act, states with high-\nperforming child support enforcement programs were eligible for \nadditional funding. With the limitation included in the final bill, \nhowever, States like Wisconsin were suddenly penalized for their hard \nwork and success. These states saw their child support dollars \ndisappear--and were faced with tough budgeting decisions at both the \nstate and county levels. Within a year, child support offices in my \nState were forced to lay off workers and many were left with no option \nbut to scale back services.\n  Congress took a step towards fixing the problem as part of the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The Recovery bill temporarily \nrestored the funding process that was in place before the Deficit \nReduction Act, and allowed States--for fiscal years 2009 and 2010--to \ndraw down much needed Federal matching funds. In Wisconsin, the need \nwas so great that some offices used that funding to hire temporary \nstaff--to clear case backloads and assist the constituents who have \nbeen hurt by the funding cuts.\n  This is a short term solution--to a problem that Congress created. It \nis time to fix that problem. The economy has left families struggling, \nand child support is a lifeline for many of them. It is time to give \nStates and counties the ability to budget beyond the coming year. It is \ntime to help the thousands of families who rely on child support \npayments to stay out of poverty and off public assistance. It is time \nfor my colleagues to join me in supporting, and to pass, the Child \nSupport Enforcement Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/22/senate-section/article/S10706-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 320--DESIGNATING MAY 1 EACH YEAR AS ``SILVER STAR \n                              BANNER DAY''\n\n  Mr. BOND (for himself and Mrs. McCaskill) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services:\n\n                              S.

I now ask we proceed to H.J. Res. 26, after the Judiciary \nCommittee is so discharged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the joint resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 26) proclaiming Casimir \n     Pulaski to be an honorary citizen of the United States \n     posthumously.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the joint \nresolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, October 11, 2009, marked the 230th \nanniversary of the death of General Casimir Pulaski, a man who made the \nultimate sacrifice in pursuit of American independence.\n  In March, I introduced S.J. Res. 12 to grant honorary posthumous \ncitizenship to General Pulaski. The Senate passed my resolution \nunanimously. Recently, the House of Representatives passed H.J. Res. \n26, the House's version of this resolution, which was introduced by \nRepresentative Dennis Kucinich. Today, the Senate will consider H.J. \nRes. 26 and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I would like to thank Senator Lisa Murkowski, the lead Republican \ncosponsor of S.J. Res. 12, as well as the resolution's other \ncosponsors, Senators Mikulski, Cardin, Whitehouse, Dodd, Brown, Burris, \nand Pryor. I would especially like to thank the Polish Legion of \nAmerican Veterans, U.S.A., for their longstanding and tireless support \nfor this resolution.\n  This resolution is a long overdue tribute to a man who gave his life \nto the cause of American freedom, a man who is often referred to as the \n``Father of the American Cavalry.''\n  General Pulaski was born in Warsaw, Poland, and became a Polish \nnational hero for his struggles against Russian domination. His \nopposition to Russian influence and participation in an unsuccessful \nrebellion against Russia led to his exile from Poland.\n  Seeking refuge, Pulaski traveled to France, where he met Benjamin \nFranklin and was inspired to join the Continental Army in its fight for \nAmerican independence. Franklin recommended Pulaski to General George \nWashington as ``an officer renowned throughout Europe for the courage \nand bravery he displayed in defense of his country's freedom.''\n  On September 11, 1777, Casimir Pulaski fought with distinction in the \nBattle of Brandywine, where his bravery and military skill helped to \navert American defeat and save the life of George Washington. Upon \nWashington's recommendation, the Continental Congress promoted Pulaski \nto General and appointed him General of the Cavalry. That same year, \nCasimir Pulaski wrote to Washington, ``I came here, where freedom is \nbeing defended, to serve it, and to live or die for it.''\n\n[[Page S10709]]\n\n  General Pulaski recruited, outfitted, and trained America's first \ntrue cavalry. Pulaski often even used his own personal finances to \nprovide his troops with the finest equipment to ensure their safety in \nbattle.\n  Two years after he joined the fight for American freedom, Pulaski was \nmortally wounded during a major offensive against British forces in \nSavannaha, GA. He died at sea, aboard the USS Wasp, on October 11, \n1779.\n  General Pulaski's valiant service and heroic death inspired his \ncontemporaries and continue to inspire us today. Shortly after his \ndeath, the Continental Congress resolved to build a monument in his \nhonor that proved to be the first of many. In 1825, General Lafayette, \nan honorary American citizen, laid the cornerstone for the Pulaski \nmonument in Savannah, GA. In 1929, Congress resolved that October 11 of \neach year would be Pulaski Day in the United States, and several States \nhave followed that example. There are countless schools, streets, \ntowns, and memorials across this country that bear his name and honor \nhis contributions to our Nation's birth.\n  In my home State of Illinois, we are privileged to have a large and \nvibrant Polish American community. Chicago is home to the Polish \nAmerican Museum and the Polish American Congress, which includes three \nthousand Polish organizations from across the country. The Polish \nAmerican community also has a large presence in the Illinois National \nGuard, which has enjoyed a long-standing relationship with the Polish \nAir Force.\n  Illinois honored General Pulaski in 1973 by designating the first \nMonday of every March Pulaski Commemorative Day. In 1986, that day was \ndeclared a State holiday.\n  Honorary citizenship is long overdue and a proper tribute to a man \nwho gave his labor and life to the cause of American independence. I \nurge my colleagues to support H.J. Res. 26 to honor General Casimir \nPulaski and his indelible contribution to our Nation's birth.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the joint resolution be read a \nthird time and passed, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The joint resolution (H.J. Res. 26) was ordered to a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/22/senate-section/article/S10709-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 1858\n\n  Mr. REID.
