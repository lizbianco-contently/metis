Madam President, let me say I share the view of the \nmajority leader that we debate and vote on a number of amendments \ntoday. That certainly is our plan on this side of the aisle.\n  With regard to the SCHIP legislation, I do think we had a good day of \ndebate yesterday, in spite of the interruptions the majority leader \nreferred to in relation to the Finance Committee and the Appropriations \nCommittee action on the stimulus package. I know Members of both \nparties were participating in that business most of the day. I \nparticularly compliment Senators Coburn and Burr for the outstanding \njob they did managing the Republican time while our colleagues were \noccupied at that markup.\n  Republicans are committed to making sure every child has access to \naffordable health insurance. But there are some pretty important \ndifferences between Republicans and Democrats in how we get there.\n  Today the Senate will vote on our Republican alternative, the Kids \nFirst Act. To remind our colleagues, the Kids First Act refocuses SCHIP \non its intended purpose, which is providing insurance to low-income, \nuninsured children.\n  The Kids First Act closes a number of loopholes and gimmicks that are \nbeing used to expand the definition of ``low income'' to families \nmaking up to $88,000 a year. I don't know anyone in Kentucky who would \ncharacterize $88,000 a year as low income.\n  Some States have used SCHIP to cover adults--remember, this is a \nprogram for children--even when thousands of eligible low-income \nchildren\n\n[[Page S950]]\n\nare still lacking coverage. It is worth repeating. Insurance for \nchildren is being used instead for adults. That is wrong, and the Kids \nFirst Act would ban such practices.\n  The CBO reports that our legislation will provide coverage to nearly \n2 million low-income children who currently lack health insurance, and \nit does so in a fiscally responsible manner without raising taxes.\n  I know many of my Republican colleagues have other commonsense ideas \nto improve this legislation, and those will be offered. Republicans \nunderstand taxpayer resources are too scarce to be squandered away by \nwaste, fraud or abuse. And Republicans are prepared to offer amendments \nto fix those problems and make the bill better.\n  For example, one provision of the bill allows a select few States to \nexpand coverage to more than three times the Federal poverty level. Let \nme say that again. One of the provisions in the underlying bill allows \na few States to expand coverage to more than three times the Federal \npoverty level. We don't think it is fair to provide special treatment \nto certain States, and we expect an amendment to address that \nsituation.\n  The bill also provides Government health insurance to 2.4 million \nkids who already have health insurance, providing Government-paid \ninsurance to kids who already have health insurance. Republicans \nbelieve those kids should be able to keep the coverage they have, and \nwe will have amendments to let kids who already have health insurance \nkeep that coverage, freeing more resources for kids who are actually in \nneed.\n  Just as working families are trying to get the most out of every \ndollar, Republicans believe Government needs to do the same thing by \nrooting out waste, fraud, and abuse in all programs, including Medicaid \nand SCHIP.\n  These are a few of the ideas we will be discussing today and tomorrow \nas the Senate continues this very important debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/28/senate-section/article/S950-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate shall resume consideration of H.R. 2, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2) to amend title XXI of the Social Security \n     Act to extend and improve the Children's Health Insurance \n     Program, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       McConnell amendment No. 40 (to amendment No. 39), in the \n     nature of a substitute.\n       Grassley amendment No. 41 (to amendment No. 39), to strike \n     the option to provide coverage to legal immigrants and \n     increase the enrollment of uninsured low-income American \n     children.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 40\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, the amendment before us is the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell. It is a substitute \namendment to the bill before us. The bill before us is an expansion of \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program. It is very similar to the two \nbills that were taken up by Congress in 2007. Both were vetoed by \nPresident Bush. Both bodies had more than a majority. Both bodies \npassed the program. But the House did not get enough votes to override \nthe President's veto.\n  The point is this is a very popular expansion of children's health \ninsurance. The fact is we would add approximately 4 million more low-\nincome, uninsured children who currently do not have health insurance.\n  Today about 6.7 million low-income kids have health insurance. \nClearly, in this very difficult time of recession, parents are losing \ntheir jobs, their incomes are not what they once were. They have a hard \ntime getting health insurance for their kids.\n  We took the same bill--actually, there were two bills last year, but \nthey are very close--and mixed and matched a little bit, essentially \nthe same bills that passed in 2007 which President Bush vetoed, and we \nare bringing up that same bill today, with one exception, and that is \nincluding perfectly legal alien citizens. They are not citizens but \nperfectly legal kids in America. Not illegals but legals.\n  The other side is opposing this bill because they do not want to \ninclude perfectly legal kids in the program. I think that is a big \nmistake because these children are here legally. Their parents pay \ntaxes. If you are an 18-year-old, you could be drafted if we had a \ndraft. These parents are in line to be full citizens after several \nyears. They have green cards, but they will be full citizens. The \nperfectly legal folks in America receive food stamps. They are eligible \nfor lots of things. They are in public school. It seems to me, \ntherefore, they should be entitled to get health insurance, just like \nevery other kid.\n  What this comes down to is either you are for low-income, uninsured \nkids getting health insurance or you are not. It is pretty simple. It \nis pretty basic. I believe, and I think most people on this side of the \naisle believe, therefore, the bill should pass and the substitute \noffered by the Senator from Kentucky, which does not include these \nchildren, should not be adopted.\n  The other difference is the bill before us will add about 4 million \nmore children who are currently uninsured to the Children's Health \nInsurance Program. The amendment before us does not add that many. It \nadds about 2 million. Again, the point is, you are for kids or you are \nnot for kids. I think the answer to that is pretty clear. We do want to \nadd 4 million more low-income, uninsured kids to the Children's Health \nInsurance Program.\n  We are going to hear from the other side: Gee, the underlying bill \ncrowds out private coverage; that is, some parents will say: Gee, if \nthe addition passes, I can no longer insure my child with a private \nhealth insurance plan but, rather, go off private health insurance and \ngo into the public program.\n  The point is, that is a national phenomenon that occurs in a lot of \nways and in a lot of places. It occurs in Medicaid. For example, some \nperson might be on private health insurance but Medicaid might be \nbetter. And if you compare the two bills; that is, the underlying bill \nand the substitute being offered, essentially they are the same in that \nabout two-thirds of the additional children covered under the \nunderlying bill will go on the public program and about one-third will \ncome out from private coverage in the same proportion that occurs in \nthe substitute amendment--lower numbers but the same proportion.\n  It just seems to me that the main underlying point is we want low-\nincome, uninsured kids to have health insurance. That is what we want \nhere. In the next several months and in the next year, probably, we \nwill be doing health insurance reform, and then we can make sure \nprivate health insurance is bolstered so people who are not insured--46 \nmillion, 47 million people in America uninsured--will be able to get \ninsurance either through the public program or private coverage.\n  It is a bit difficult to explain here, but the main point is if every \nAmerican has to have health insurance and the low-income people have to \nhave subsidies to get health insurance, that is something the Congress \nshould do. But at this point here today, let's reject the substitute \namendment. Why? Because, as I said, a lot of kids who are here, \nperfectly legally, won't get health insurance, and that is not right. \nIt also doesn't go nearly as far as it should because there are so many \nkids who don't have health insurance here today but who should get it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, let me say to the Acting President pro \ntempore that it is a shame she has to be in the chair every time I give \na speech, hearing the same things twice.\n\n[[Page S951]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. I am enjoying that, I say to the \nSenator.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I shouldn't have put the new Senator in that position, \nbut I thought a little bit of humor around here doesn't hurt anything, \ndoes it?\n  I thank the Senator from Montana, the chairman of the committee, for \nhis remarks. Obviously, from what I stated yesterday, I have a \ndifference of opinion on that issue. I am not going to speak about that \nbecause I spoke about it yesterday.\n  Madam President, I would like to speak generally about the SCHIP \nbill, not about a specific amendment at this point, although I might \nmention some differences we have with the original bill.\n  I have been a Member of the Senate now for quite a few years. I have \nworked across the aisle on many initiatives in my time in the Senate. \nWe have worked together--we meaning Democrats and Republicans, and in \nmy case as an individual, the Senator from Iowa--and I am speaking \nabout a close working relationship I have with the Senator from \nMontana, the chairman of the committee now. We have worked together on \nmajor tax, trade, and health care legislation over the last few years \nwhere we were able to set aside partisanship and work together to make \ngood policy. I know what it means to make a compromise. I know what it \nmeans to keep that compromise.\n  In 2007, I worked with my friend Senator Baucus, as well as Senator \nHatch, a Republican, and Senator Rockefeller, a Democrat, to pass the \nreauthorization to the Children's Health Insurance Program. We twice \npassed a bill in the Senate with wide bipartisan margins. Was it a bill \nSenator Hatch and I as Republicans would have written? No. Was it a \nbill Senator Baucus and Senator Rockefeller would have written if they \nwere writing the bill all by themselves? No. The bill was a compromise, \nso everybody gives a little bit. We compromised to get a bipartisan \nvote, and we were successful in getting that bipartisan vote. We won a \nveto-proof majority in the Senate. We came just a few votes close of a \nveto-proof majority in the House. In fact, Senator Baucus and I worked \nwith House Republicans to try to get a few more House Republicans to \ncome around so we could have a bill on the books in 2007 or early 2008. \nUnfortunately, that didn't work out. Unfortunately, at the time, \nPresident Bush refused to sign the bill. I thought he was wrong to veto \nthe bill. I still think he was wrong to veto it. I said so loudly and \nclearly.\n  I would like to refer to some comments I made 2 years ago to the \nSenate at that particular time. I don't have the exact date, but it was \nduring the debate on the SCHIP bill at that particular time, and I \nwould quote from that debate. This is the Senator from Iowa saying this \n2 years ago:\n\n       First, the President himself made a commitment to covering \n     more children. I wish to refer to the Republican National \n     Committee in New York City in 2004, and President Bush was \n     very firm in making a point on covering children. Let me tell \n     you what he said.\n\n  This is the quote I read from President Bush at that time, and he \nrefers to a new term, meaning the term that would start in 2005.\n\n       American children must also have a healthy start in life. \n     In a new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll \n     millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up \n     for the government's health insurance programs. We will also \n     not allow a lack of attention or information to stand between \n     these children and health care that they need.\n\n  Now, that is the end of the quote from President Bush in 2004. And, \nMadam President, when I referred to the Republican National Committee \nin that quote, I think I made a mistake 2 years ago. I was referring to \nthe convention and I said committee.\n  At that time during the debate in 2007, I went on to say:\n\n       That was back in New York City, early September 2004. Three \n     months later the President is reelected, with a mandate. It \n     seems to me the President was very clear in his convictions \n     then. Let me repeat his words because I think they are \n     important. He said he would lead an aggressive effort to \n     enroll millions of poor children in government health \n     insurance programs.\n\n  Then I go on to speak for myself:\n\n       President Bush, this is your friend Chuck Grassley helping \n     you to keep the promise you made in New York City, and \n     helping you keep your mandate that you had as a result of the \n     last election. But somewhere the priorities of this \n     administration seem to have shifted. The Congressional Budget \n     Office reports that the proposal for SCHIP included in the \n     President's fiscal year 2008 budget would result in the loss \n     of coverage, not an increase of coverage as the \n     administration had been advocating for in the year 2004; and \n     that the loss of coverage would add up to 1.4 million \n     children and pregnant women.\n\n  That is the end of my speech for that day to the Senate. But I want \nto say that later in the debate, I referred to this again. So I was \ntrying to make very clear that I was speaking to the President of the \nUnited States. This is quoting me:\n\n       I quoted the President making a promise at the Republican \n     Convention in New York. I did that yesterday. I want to state \n     again what the President said. You can't say it too many \n     times. I hope at some time the President remembers what he \n     said.\n\n  And this is the President from the Republican Convention:\n\n       We will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of \n     poor children who are eligible but not signed up for the \n     government's health insurance program.\n\n  That is the end of the President's quote, but continuing to quote \nfrom myself.\n\n       An extension of law, which is what is going to happen if \n     the President vetoes this bill, will not carry out what the \n     President said at the Republican Convention in New York in \n     2004. Faced with that, your answer today on this bill, Mr. \n     President of the United States, should be yes. This bill gets \n     the job done that you said in New York City you wanted to do. \n     I hope the President's answer will be yes because if he \n     doesn't veto this bill, then we will do those things he said \n     he wanted to do. It will help more than 3 million low-income, \n     uninsured children. About half of the new money is just to \n     keep the program running. The rest of the new money goes to \n     cover more low-income children.\n\n  Before I go on with my remarks, I want to say that I think I and a \nlot of other Republicans who voted for that SCHIP bill in 2007 were \nvindicated when we made the point that, at $5 billion the President \ndidn't have enough money in his budget to cover kids currently enrolled \nin SCHIP because the next year, the President's budget for SCHIP was \n$20 billion. We kept saying to President Bush in 2007, you know, $5 \nbillion isn't going to do it. But I think that by putting $20 billion \nin for FY 2008, the President was admitting that $5 billion wasn't \nenough.\n  Now, why do I go to the trouble of explaining to the Senators who are \nlistening what I said 2 years ago? Because we had a Republican \nPresident.\n  I don't like the way this bill has worked out because the bill we \nhave before us today departs so much from that bipartisan compromise on \nwhich so many of us worked so hard. So maybe people listening are \nsaying: Well, Chuck Grassley, a Republican, we have a Democratic \nPresident, he is my President, but I am going to just be partisan. So I \nwant the public to know that I am approaching this issue in a way where \nwhen I disagree with the policy--whether it is the policy of the Bush \nadministration at that time, or the policy of the partisan bill we have \nbefore us now that I will speak out.\n  We have a President today who is going to sign this bill. \nUnfortunately, we are here with a bill that goes back on those \ncompromises we worked so hard on 2 years ago. For reasons I still don't \nfully understand, the majority is bound and determined to set aside \nthat hard work that led to that bipartisan agreement 2 years ago. They \nhave decided that going back on critical compromises is more important \nthan achieving the same bipartisan votes as we did in 2007. The Senate \nshould now be considering our second bill, our final compromise of \n2007.\n  I am disappointed because the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram is the product of a Republican-led Congress in 1997, signed \ninto law by a Democratic President. This has been a very bipartisan \nissue for 11 years down the road. It is a targeted program designed to \nprovide affordable health coverage for low-income children of working \nfamilies. These families make too much to qualify for Medicaid but \nstruggle to afford private insurance.\n  In 2007, Senator Rockefeller made the point that, ``CHIP,'' the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, ``legislation has a history of \nbipartisanship. I am quite proud of it.'' That is what Senator \nRockefeller said. In 2009, however, the Democratic leadership, having \nincreased their majority, has decided to abandon a number of good-faith \nagreements made between Members during the last Congress. In doing\n\n[[Page S952]]\n\nso, the Democratic majority has embarked on a reckless course of action \ndesigned to alienate the very Republicans who stood up to President \nBush when he vetoed the SCHIP bills and who still carry the scars from \nthose fights. It is very disappointing, then, that the first health \nbill the new Democratic Congress sends to the new Democratic President, \nmy President, is legislation that breaks from that bipartisan \ntradition.\n  I want my colleagues to understand that I am very reluctantly in a \nposition of having to fight against this bill. After the bruising \nbattles over SCHIP in 2007, and with the emergence of health reform as \na priority for the 111th Congress, I wanted to avoid another fight over \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program and direct all efforts to \nenacting a broadly bipartisan health reform bill, which I still think \nis a possibility. At least the meetings we are having lead me to say \nthat at this point. Maybe 6 months from now I will be disappointed, but \nI hope not.\n\n  However, the Democratic majority was determined on this bill that \nthey wanted a short-term ``win'' over a broader, larger effort, and \ntherefore I was told SCHIP was going to be one of the first bills \nconsidered by the new Congress.\n  I was informed that rather than move forward with the second vetoed \nbill--a bill with changes that Speaker Pelosi called, and this quote is \nabout that compromise of 2 years ago, which she said was ``a definite \nimprovement on the [first] bill''--the Democratic leadership had \ndecided to move ahead with the first vetoed bill instead of this \ncompromise that Speaker Pelosi said was better than the first bill.\n  Even though I could have insisted on negotiating off the second bill \nwhich represented a number of improvements, as Speaker Pelosi said, and \nI believed it strengthened the bill, I agreed to try to work out a \ncompromise somewhere between that first vetoed bill and the second \nvetoed bill of 2007. Unbelievably, under pressure from Democratic \nleadership, my willingness to work out a compromise that could have set \nus on a bipartisan pathway was met with a resounding: Thanks, but no \nthanks. No negotiations, no give and take, no compromises, no \nbipartisanship: Take it or leave it.\n  The Senate has abandoned moving forward with a bill that generated a \ngreat deal of Democratic praise just 2 years ago. The hard work and \nbipartisan cooperation that went into the children's health insurance \nbills in 2007 produced legislation that President Obama's new Chief of \nStaff, Rahm Emanuel, who was a Member of the House of Representatives \nat that time, said ``should have strong support from both Democrats and \nRepublicans.'' That is from 2 years ago.\n  However, on a number of key issues, the other side does not even want \nto support the first children's health insurance bill of 2007.\n  The bill before the Senate now completely eliminates policies on \ncrowdout of private insurance that were in both vetoed bills, which \nbrings me to a question: What exactly was wrong with the crowdout \npolicy of both of those vetoed bills? The Congressional Budget Office, \nin a 2007 report on crowdout, estimated that the Children's Health \nInsurance Program has a crowdout rate of ``between a quarter and a half \nof the increase in public coverage resulting from the Children's Health \nInsurance Program.''\n  The Congressional Budget Office goes on to elaborate that ``for every \n100 children who enroll as a result of SCHIP, there is a corresponding \nreduction in private coverage of between 25 and 50 children.''\n  I would be very interested in learning the reasons those on that side \nof the aisle completely eliminated the crowdout provisions from both of \nthe 2007 SCHIP bills. Certainly, it is not because Democrats have put \nforward a policy that addressed crowdout in a better or more efficient \nmanner in the bill before the Senate now. Certainly, it is not because \nDemocrats have a new analysis that crowdout is no longer occurring, as \nCBO says, especially in the expansion of public programs.\n  I hope Members of this body who supported the crowdout policy of 2007 \nand now are supporting its elimination will come to the floor and \nexplain to me and other Members of this body why the Democratic \nmajority is not concerned about the problem of replacing private \ncoverage with public coverage.\n  In other words, if people have insurance today, and you are setting \nup a program that, even though it increases the number of people \ncovered will not cover all the children eligible for public programs, \nwhy would you want to drive people out of private coverage into public \ncoverage? That is what happens, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice. The Congressional Budget Office is a nonpartisan group of \npeople who are experts in this area.\n  As I said yesterday, I believe it was, in a comment directed to \nsomething Senator Durbin of Illinois said--and I am not denigrating \nwhat he said, I am supplementing what he said--he led us to believe the \nreason you want to have this policy is because there might be some \npeople who have poor private coverage who would be better off in the \npublic program. I am not saying that might not be true. But the \nCongressional Budget Office tells us you get most crowding out in upper \nmiddle-income people, more than you do in lower income people. In other \nwords, maybe people who can afford it better and have higher incomes \ndecide: Why should I pay out of my pocket when I can go on the public \nprogram?\n  I think it is wrong to throw aside something that we had in 2007 that \nwas going to keep people in private coverage and encourage them to go \nwhere we do not have enough money to cover children who do not have \nanything.\n  Neither bill vetoed by President Bush in 2007 included a provision to \nallow States to be reimbursed at the Medicaid and SCHIP levels for \nlegal immigrant children and pregnant women. I am not going to go into \nthis issue in depth because I did that yesterday. But this issue does \nopen a difficult and contentious immigration issue that does need to be \nbrought up.\n  One of the reasons I was able to support the compromise of 2007 on \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program was it did not contain the \ncontroversial provisions to direct Federal resources to the coverage of \nlegal immigrants. I said yesterday how in some instances it could end \nup covering people who have come here illegally.\n  In the 1996 welfare reform bill, we required the sponsors of legal \nimmigrants to sign an affidavit that they would provide for those \nimmigrants for the first 5 years they were in the country. With this \nbill we are allowing sponsors to go back on that commitment. If you \nhave a contractual relationship, it seems to me to be only morally \nright that the Federal Government would want to have that moral \ncontract--not encourage ditching it. But this bill would allow that to \nhappen. We are allowing sponsors to go back on that commitment they \nmade to the taxpayers of this country.\n  Additionally, the $1.3 billion the bill provides for these immigrants \nwho were promised they would be taken care of is money that could be \nfar better spent on poor, uninsured American children. It is a little \nbit the same argument I just gave about crowdout.\n  If you have people on private insurance, then save the public money \nfor people who are currently eligible for public programs, but who are \nnot insured. Use the $1.3 billion for those people.\n  In 2007, during the debate, the majority leader, Mr. Reid, said this \nabout the Children's Health Insurance Program. It was ``a very \ndifficult but rewarding process for me. It indicates to me that there \nis an ability of this Congress to work on a bipartisan, bicameral \nbasis.''\n  You have an election in between, but it seems to me, kind of, comity \nwould dictate if that was a good statement to make in 2007, it would \nhold true for 2009 as well. This should have been an easy and quick \nbill to pick up and pass this year. Our bipartisan coalition fought \nside by side to get the Children's Health Insurance Program done in \n2007. Picking up that baton and carrying it across the finish line \nshould have been a straightforward exercise. For somebody like me in \nthe Republican Party who went against his own caucus to get a \nbipartisan agreement, to stand against my own President and work hard \nin the House of Representatives to get a few more Republican votes, it \nkind of leaves us dangling out there. Without a show of appreciation, \nhow can you work in a bipartisan way?\n\n  Instead, what are we headed toward? A process that will end up with a \nbill\n\n[[Page S953]]\n\nthat many Republicans, like this Senator, who have been strong \nsupporters of the Children's Health Insurance Program are no longer \ncomfortable supporting.\n  In 2007, the Children's Health Insurance Program received high praise \nfrom the other side. I would like to give a quote, ``a very difficult \nbut rewarding process,'' and one that indicated--showed the ability of \nCongress, quoting again ``to work on a bipartisan, bicameral basis.''\n  If the Senator from Montana--I am going to smile at you. That is your \nquote from 2 years ago.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I have three sentences, if I can have unanimous consent \nfor those?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. This is a very unfortunate beginning for the 111th \nCongress. I regret the Democratic leadership has so quickly abandoned a \nbipartisan process. It does not bode well for cooperative work in the \ncoming months.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that at 10:55 a.m. the Senate \nresume consideration of the Grassley amendment, No. 41, and proceed to \na vote on the amendment with no intervening action or debate; further, \nthat no amendment be in order to the Grassley amendment prior to the \nvote; that upon disposition of the Grassley amendment, the Senate \nresume consideration of the McConnell amendment under the previous \norder.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I also want to inform my colleagues that \nvote at 10:55 is expected to be a voice vote.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I have yielded the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. How long does the Senator wish to speak?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, if I can take 4 minutes, that will be fine.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 40\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, yesterday I spoke to this issue and \ndetailed the reasons the underlying legislation is not a good bill and \nwhy the substitute that is being offered by Senator McConnell will be a \nmuch better approach to this issue. I want to reiterate one of these \npoints because of a question a reporter asked me out in the hall. We \ntalked about the massive number of people, 2.4 million people, who will \nleave their private insurance coverage in order to participate in this \nGovernment-run program. It is called the crowdout effect.\n  The reporter said: Does it appear to you that this is just one more \nstep toward Government-run health care for Americans?\n  I said: Well, you can certainly conclude that. The reason I said it \nwas because there were efforts last year to try to fix this problem. \nEverybody acknowledges there are almost 2.4 million people who will \nleave private health insurance coverage because, obviously, the \nbusinesses that are paying for that today would not have to pay for it \nif their employees go to this Government-run program. It, obviously, \nmakes sense for them, therefore, to drop the coverage.\n  The reason I said what I did is because there is a way to handle \nthis. We tried to deal with it last year. When the legislation was \nfinally--the final version was written, it was written by the chairman \nof the committee and by other Democratic leaders in the House and in \nthe Senate.\n  It was approved by both Houses. It included the language that dealt \nwith this crowdout effect. Now, it was not very meaningful language, \nfrom my perspective, but at least it was a recognition of the problem. \nSurprisingly, that language was dropped from this bill, and I never \nhave been able to figure out why.\n  So I offered an amendment in the committee to reinsert the same \nlanguage that the chairman and other Democratic leaders had put \ntogether to deal with this problem. On essentially a party-line vote, \nmy amendment was defeated, so the problem remains. And it is the one of \nmany problems in the underlying bill.\n  The point of the Kids First Act, which is Senator McConnell's \nalternative, is that it is targeted and it is a responsible \nreauthorization to preserve health care coverage for millions of low-\nincome children. That is what the program is all about. That is what we \nshould be doing.\n  Unlike the underlying bill, the McConnell amendment adds 3.1 million \nnew children to SCHIP. It minimizes the reduction in private coverage, \nas I said before, by targeting SCHIP funds to low-income children and \nnot high-income families who have access to private coverage. And \nimportantly, it is offset without new tax increases or a budget gimmick \nas is the underlying bill.\n  So I think my colleagues and I have two choices here, either a budget \nbuster that does not protect SCHIP coverage for low-income children, \nrepresents an open-ended burden on taxpayers, and takes a significant \nstep toward Government-run health care, or a fiscally responsible SCHIP \nreauthorization that preserves coverage for low-income children and is \nfully offset without a tax increase, and minimizes the effect on \nemployer-sponsored health coverage.\n  The answer is clear, the Kids First Act is the right solution, and I \nurge my colleagues to vote yes on the McConnell amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan.) The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, the real question is, do we want more \nlow-income uninsured children to have health insurance? That is the \nbasic question. I am sure the answer to that question is yes. Most \nAmericans, certainly parents of low-income kids and low-income parents, \nwish to have their children covered.\n  Next question: How do we do it? The Children's Health Insurance \nProgram is immensely popular. It was enacted, I think, in 1997. It was \nset up as a block grant program. States had the option whether they \nwanted to participate. And immediately, in a very short period of time, \nall States decided, yes, they wanted to participate in the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, because it so helps their kids get health \ninsurance.\n  Now, many people have private health insurance. That is good. The \nquestion is, what about lower income people, not Medicaid levels, but \nworking poor who have private health insurance. What should they do? \nAnd this legislation gives people the option, gives States the option \nthat a person can continue his private health insurance. If he or she \nwants to, a person currently on private health insurance who has a \ncouple three kids and who qualifies for the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, because the parents are working poor, has the option to keep \nthe private health insurance or to put the children in the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program.\n  Now, this question always arises, that is, when there is a public \nprogram, a health program, there is always going to be a question for \nthose who have private coverage, should they stay in their private plan \nor should they move to the public plan?\n  About one-third of the new children who have health insurance under \nthe underlying bill will come from the private sector; two-thirds have \nno insurance whatsoever. The real answer to the dilemma is to make sure \nthat the people in our country have good private health insurance at \npremiums they can afford, benefits that make sense. The Children's \nHealth Insurance Program has good benefits. So, clearly, a mother whose \nincome is quite low, not quite as low as Medicaid levels, but quite \nlow, will probably want her child to enroll in the Children's Health \nInsurance Program.\n  We have to bolster private health insurance in this country. There \nare 47 million Americans who do not have health insurance. That is \nunconscionable. About 25 million Americans are underinsured; they have \ngot health insurance, but it is not very good.\n  So the answer to this question is, how do we insure more kids but in \na\n\n[[Page S954]]\n\nway that private health insurance is also a viable option for low-\nincome families. How do you do that?\n  We are going to take up health care reform this year in this \nCongress. It is so important. It should be a result where all Americans \nhave health insurance. It also means we have to figure out ways to get \nthe cost down, because health insurance is so costly, and health care \nis so costly.\n  Unfortunately, today, insurance in the individual markets is very \nexpensive. The benefits are not that great and the copays are pretty \nhigh. It is not a good choice for low-income people. That is the \nindividual market, even small group markets in many cases. So the goal \nhere of national health insurance reform, through all kinds of \nmechanisms, of health care delivery, and pay for performance, et \ncetera, is to make sure that private health insurance is a viable \noption for all Americans, more of an option than it is today.\n  That means insurance reform, eliminating preexisting conditions as a \nmeans to deny coverage. The fancy term ``guarantee issues'' means that \nwhen someone applies for health insurance, that health insurance \nprovides there is no discrimination on the basis of health care or age \nor whatnot.\n  That is the goal we are all striving for. And, fortunately, it is a \ngoal that almost all of our colleagues agree with. I very much hope--it \nis imperative that this year, this Congress move aggressively for \nnational health insurance reform, because that will then tend to \neliminate this question of crowdout.\n  But, more importantly, as we worry about crowdout, I do not think it \nis that much of a worry, frankly. We should keep our eye on the ball \nwhich is how do we get more low-income kids insured. That is what the \nunderlying bill does.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time of the quorum be charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I wanted to make a few observations \non the pending amendment, the McConnell amendment, before the vote. \nWhat we are trying to do here in this amendment is to refocus SCHIP \ntoward low-income children. This amendment would close loopholes that \nallow States to use SCHIP funds to cover both adults and children in \nhigher income families.\n  What has happened here is some States have drifted off in the \ndirection that was not the original intent of the measure, which was \nsupported on an overwhelming bipartisan basis, and written by both \nRepublicans and Democrats in the 1990s.\n  So the goal of the Kids First amendment, upon which we are about to \nvote, is to refocus the program on low-income children, and to take the \nfunds that are being diverted to high-income families and put them back \nin to cover low-income children, and it probably would cover up to 2 \nmillion additional low-income children.\n  So if you are in favor of putting kids first and focusing the SCHIP \nprogram as it was originally intended, I would recommend strongly that \nyou support the amendment upon which we are going to vote here shortly.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 41\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate resumes \nconsideration of amendment No. 41.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 41) was rejected.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I move to lay that motion on the \ntable.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 40\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, while we are waiting for the vote, which \noccurs in a few minutes, I will make a couple of points here.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the Senator from Montana yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I am reminded that I have not \nrequested the yeas and nays yet on my amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, very briefly in response to the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, the underlying legislation adds 4 million more children \nto the Children's Health Insurance Program for a total of about 10 \nmillion. I think that is a good goal. On the other hand, the substitute \namendment offered by the Senator from Kentucky does not go near that \nfar. It is about 2 million fewer children. I think we want to add more \nkids to the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  Second, he claims his substitute focuses more on low-income kids \nfirst. I might say that the underlying bill, the bill offered by myself \nand others, focuses on low-income first. How does it do so? There is a \nbonus to States to seek out low-incomes first.\n  Second, the bill phases out coverage of childless adults. That has \nbeen an issue; that is, should adults, who are not children, be covered \nunder the Children's Health Insurance Program? That is an issue because \nthis is a block grant program, and States have the option to cover whom \nthey want to. Some States have covered adults. Actually only one or two \nhave. And we are saying, no, no more of that. So we are phasing out the \nability of any State to cover an adult who does not have children.\n  Parents or pregnant women and kids are another issue. But childless \nadults are being phased out. So we are focusing more on low-income kids \nfirst. I might say too that there is a lower match rate for those \nStates at their own option that want to go to a higher level. Some \nStates want to go to a higher level. That is their choice under the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, because it is a State option. That \nis a choice those States can take.\n  But if they do so, the match is a lower rate than it otherwise might \nbe.\n  Again, I am trying to make sure that low-income kids are helped \nfirst.\n  And, finally, under the underlying legislation, 91 percent of \nchildren covered are at a level of 200 percent of poverty or lower; 91 \npercent, 200 percent or lower. So this legislation clearly is focused \non the working poor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question occurs on \nAmendment No. 40 offered by the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Chambliss).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, it is my understanding that the Senator \nfrom Florida, Senator Martinez, is going to offer an amendment.

He is just going to speak on the bill. Then, I \nwould arrange--general debate for Senator Menendez.\n  I will work with Senator McConnell to follow up with a time for a \nvote. We would like to do it before 12:30, but I will work with Senator \nMcConnell on that. Also, there would be no amendments in order to the \namendment offered by Senator Martinez.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 65\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 65 and send it \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Martinez], for himself, Mr. \n     Vitter, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Coburn, Mr. \n     Johanns, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. Chambliss, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 65.\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To restore the prohibition on funding of nongovernmental \n organizations that promote abortion as a method of birth control (the \n                        ``Mexico City Policy''))\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. RESTORATION OF PROHIBITION ON FUNDING OF \n                   NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROMOTE \n                   ABORTION AS A METHOD OF BIRTH CONTROL (``MEXICO \n                   CITY POLICY'').\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, regulation, or \n     policy, including the memorandum issued by the President on \n     January 23, 2009, to the Administrator of the United States \n     Agency for International Development, titled ``Mexico City \n     Policy and Assistance for Voluntary Family Planning,'' no \n     funds authorized under part I of the Foreign Assistance Act \n     of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq) for population planning \n     activities or other population or family planning assistance \n     may be made available for any private, nongovernmental, or \n     multilateral organization that performs or actively promotes \n     abortion as a method of birth control.\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, while we are debating SCHIP and \nconsidering the best ways to promote healthy children in our country, \nwe are going to look at many amendments covering a wide range of \ntopics. Whether we support extending this program or not, everyone \nwants children to have the best health care available. Into this broad-\nranging debate, I have also introduced an amendment to reinstate the \nMexico City policy--a policy that prohibits U.S. foreign assistance \nfrom going to groups in foreign countries that support or perform \nabortions.\n  The fact is, we often talk about promoting a culture of life. We talk \nduring political campaigns about how we wish we had fewer abortions and \nhow we wish to promote other alternatives such as adoption, and, in \nfact, that we want abortions to be rare. However, actions do matter, \nand last Friday President Obama changed the tone of this conversation \nby approving the use of taxpayer dollars to fund international \norganizations responsible for performing and promoting abortions in \nevery corner of the world.\n  Today, I am proposing an amendment to H.R. 2, the SCHIP bill, that \nwould return this policy to its original intent, which is to restrict \nthe use of taxpayer money to family planning organizations that are \nknown to perform and promote abortion. This policy, known as the Mexico \nCity policy, was first signed into Executive order by President Ronald \nReagan in 1984. Over the years, the policy has been wrongly attacked \nand falsely characterized as a restriction on foreign aid for family \nplanning. This policy is not about reducing aid, but it is instead \nabout ensuring that family planning funds are given to organizations \ndedicated to reducing abortions, instead of promoting them.\n  Reversing this policy means there is no longer a clear line between \nfunding organizations that aim to reduce abortions and those that \npromote abortions as a means of contraception. If not reversed, the \nfunding would enable organizations to perform and promote abortions in \nregions such as Latin America, countries in the Middle East, and \nAfrica, where the sanctity of life is not only respected but, in many \ninstances, is the law of the land and, in fact, where strong religious \nconvictions make this practice abhorrent.\n  The United States is a generous country. We give to countries around \nthe world for many reasons and for many purposes. At the same time, we \nalso want to be on the positive side of respecting the culture of so \nmany of the countries that would be impacted by this dramatic change in \nwhat has been the U.S. policy abroad.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment restoring the \nMexico City policy first enacted by President Ronald Reagan and then \nreenacted again by our last President. It is necessary--if we want to \ncontinue fostering a culture of life where every life is sacred, every \nchild is celebrated, and life at all stages is given the dignity it \ndeserves--that we support this amendment in promoting life, in standing \nfor the things we say we believe in during campaigns, which is \npromoting a culture of life and looking for abortions to be rare and to \nbe the last option and to not be something that comes into the picture \nas a result of a desire to use it as a family planning tool and not \nwith the understanding that it is disrespecting the very sanctity of \nlife we all believe ought to be observed from the moment of conception \nuntil the end of life.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, is Senator Brownback next?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Florida for \nraising this issue. This has come up recently as President Obama has \nchanged the Mexico City policy so that the United States can fund \nabortions and groups that promote abortions overseas. This, of course, \nwas not the policy of the United States in the last administration for \nthe last 8 years. It was prior to that in the Clinton administration. \nAnd prior to that in the Reagan and Bush years, it was not the policy. \nThis has been going back and forth for some time.\n  I think it is pretty clear as far as the U.S. public that they do not \nlike the idea of us funding abortions overseas. Some people may \ntolerate it here at home and say, OK, that is something I will just \nlive with, but they do not like the idea of our taxpayers' dollars \ngoing to fund abortions overseas. And at a time when we are staring at \n$10 trillion in debt going to $12 trillion, with a stimulus package of \nlots of different items, including some that do not seem particularly \nstimulative, this does not make any sense to people. Then you go \noverseas, and to a lot of places, it does not make any sense, either, \nas Senator Martinez mentioned, that in Latin American countries, \nAfrican countries that are very strongly pro-life, in many cases, we \nare supporting policies or groups or institutions that are promoting \nabortion.\n\n[[Page S956]]\n\n  What is going on with the United States? I thought you guys stood for \nlife and for the dignity of the individual, and then the United States \nis funding this? This has been back and forth, a long seesaw battle, \nwithin our overall discussion here. I simply point out that this does \nnot help us in foreign policy. This certainly does not help the budget \ndeficit or the debt. This certainly does not stimulate the economy. \nThere is no major policy reason to do this.\n  Some people will argue that we should be supporting this policy and \nthat this is something we ought to do to help people overseas. I think \nmost people overseas would much rather have us put this money in AIDS \nprevention work, in malaria work, in working on neglected diseases that \naffect so many people overseas that have a broad basis of support in \nthe United States and there, rather than this policy, which is such a \ncontroversial, negative policy that is being promoted and pushed and \nseen that way in so many places around the world. This does not help us \nout at all.\n  Then we look at some countries such as China where situations arise \nof forced abortions and forced sterilizations continuing to come out in \nthe media. We have family planning support there, in places where \nforced abortions and forced sterilizations still take place. Our money \nis associated with some of these efforts in different places around the \nworld. People do not like that policy. No matter how pro-choice they \nare, they do not want us associated with that, and they do not see any \nreason for us to be involved in it.\n  One can look at different things where one is on the choice or life \nspectrum. I am pro-life. I am strongly pro-life. I believe life has \ndignity from the very beginning to the very end and that it should be \nprotected. Then we add this into the mix, using U.S. taxpayers' \ndollars, dollars that we approve here, dollars from all the United \nStates to promote something that a whole bunch of people in the United \nStates completely disagree with on a whole variety of grounds.\n  I ask my colleagues to back up for a second and say: Aren't there \nbetter places for us to put this money if we are looking to do \nsomething that is life-affirming and helping people who are in \ndifficulty? There are much better places we can certainly agree on, and \nI listed several of those on which we could agree and we could work \ntogether in this supposedly postpartisan period we are in, that we \ncould work together on these issues. I pushed a number of them, and I \ncan tell you for sure we have a need on neglected diseases in Third \nWorld countries and that a little bit of interest and focus on our part \nyields a whole bunch of saved lives. People dealing with malaria has \nbeen a big one. But we need to go on to diseases such as elephantiasis, \nsleeping sickness--there is a series of them that would build up a lot \nof good will by the United States overseas, that would increase our \nstanding in places around the world, that there would be no controversy \nwhatsoever associated with but instead would be wholeheartedly embraced \nboth here and overseas.\n  For these reasons, I do not think it is wise for us to reengage with \ngroups that promote abortion overseas. I ask my colleagues not to do \nthat but to support the Martinez amendment and say to themselves: Let's \nnot do this. Let's do this better, let's do this together. Let's \nsupport the Martinez amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I say to Senators, if you want to save the \nlives of women around the world and you want to cut down on abortions, \nvote against the Martinez-Brownback amendment.\n  I say to my friend who is asking for bipartisanship, this vote will \nbe bipartisan. We will have more than 60 people in this Senate, I \nbelieve, who will vote against this amendment and affirm the action of \nour new President, President Barack Obama, who very wisely understands \nthat with a stroke of a pen, undoing what the Bush-Cheney \nadministration did will indeed save the lives of women.\n  I could talk quite a bit about generalities and the thousands of \nwomen who are waiting to have reproductive health care who cannot get \nit because of this Mexico City gag rule which says to nongovernmental \norganizations who work overseas: You cannot get U.S. funding if you \neven speak about the possibility that abortion is an option; all of \nyour funds will be cut off. So many of these groups gave up the funds \nso as not to be gagged.\n  If this was done in this country, it would be unconstitutional on its \nface because what the gag rule says to international nongovernmental \norganizations is: If you do not do what the Bush administration wants, \nyou cannot use your own money to provide health care which could \ninclude, for example, counseling when there is an unintended pregnancy.\n  Let me tell you the story of a 13-year-old girl named Min Min because \nI think it is important to put a face on this issue. She is from Nepal. \nShe was raped by a male relative. A relative helped her get an \nabortion, and Min Min was sentenced to 20 years in jail while the male \nrelative walked. In Nepal at that time, abortion was illegal, even in \nthe cases of rape or incest. Because of the gag rule, organizations in \nNepal that wanted to help girls like Min Min and change the laws and \nget children out of jail were told: You will lose all your U.S. funding \nif you even talk about it. So you know what one particular organization \ndid? They gave up the money and they struggled, and then they did not \nhave funding for family planning or for reproductive health care.\n  That is the kind of cruel policy that is called the Mexico City gag \nrule. That is the kind of cruel policy that my colleagues, Senator \nMartinez and Senator Brownback, want to put back into place. And they \ndo it in the name of life? How is that being done in the name of life \nwhen you put a 13-year-old child in prison because she was raped, the \nrelative who did this to her walks, and an organization that is seeking \njustice is shut out of U.S. support? That is not life-affirming.\n  I applaud our President for doing this. Again, a lot of these issues \nare difficult. This was a stroke of a pen. This is a reflection of a \nbipartisan majority in this country who thinks that it is cruel and \nwrong to tell these organizations they have to dance to the tune of \npolitics, the politics of America, before they get any funding from us \nto prevent abortion, to promote family planning, to help a little child \nsuch as Min Min get out of jail.\n  I am proud today to stand in front of you, Mr. President, and say \nthat with President Obama, this is just the start of the changes he \nwill bring that will help women, that will help families, that will \nhelp children. I hope we will defeat this amendment with an \noverwhelming vote, and I predict we will.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I respect very much Senator Martinez and \nSenator Brownback. Their views on the issue of abortion, I am sure, are \na matter of conscience. They come to us to raise this issue which has \nbeen debated so many times in the Senate.\n  I say at this point in time that many of us who oppose abortion also \nbelieve that a woman should be able to make that choice with her \nfamily, with her doctor, with her conscience, and, of course, we \nbelieve in the first instance that family planning avoids unintended \npregnancies. Unintended pregnancies lead to abortion. So reducing the \nnumber of unintended pregnancies is going to give women a chance to \ncontrol their own lives and to reduce the likelihood of abortion.\n  It is the law of the United States of America, and it has been for \nmany years, in a provision added in 1973 by Senator Jesse Helms \nexplicitly banning the use of American taxpayer funds for overseas \nabortion. Unequivocally, that is the law. Regardless of the Mexico City \npolicy, signed by President Obama or the situation before that, that is \nthe law. Not one penny of taxpayers' dollars can be used to fund \nabortions overseas.\n  The issue here is whether an organization which also counsels women \nthat they have an option for abortion is going to be denied these funds \nby this policy. Senator Martinez's amendment would deny them the funds \nto even offer family planning if they counsel a woman that abortion is \nan option. As Senator Boxer said, in the United States that is \nunacceptable.\n\n[[Page S957]]\n\nYou have to give doctors at least the opportunity, even if they do not \nperform an abortion, to tell a woman what her legal rights are. But \nthat is what is at the core of this issue.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me make two or three other points and then I will.\n  There are several points I would like to make about the importance of \nPresident Obama's decision.\n  First, when we provide family planning funds to organizations \noverseas that may counsel abortion but not spend a single U.S. dollar \non abortions, when we provide that money, we literally reduce the \nnumber of abortions worldwide. A report by Guttmacher Institute and the \nU.N. Population Fund estimated that providing family planning services \nto the 201 million women in developing countries whose needs are unmet \nwould prevent 52 million unintended pregnancies by family planning and \n22 million abortions. So when you reduce the family planning, there are \nmore unintended pregnancies and more abortions.\n  Secondly, an estimated 536,000 women, mostly in developing countries, \ndie from pregnancy-related causes. By giving a woman family planning \ncounseling, the pill or something similar, they will have access to \ncontraception and pregnancy-related deaths will drop by 25 to 35 \npercent of women who would give birth.\n  Finally, the repeal would save the lives of children in many \ndeveloping countries. Many of these women have successive pregnancies \nthat they cannot control, and the children, sadly, are weaker and \nweaker because the mothers cannot restore their bodily strength before \nthey have another child. That is the reality of this situation.\n  I will say, as I have traveled around the world with people such as \nSenator Brownback, the most important single question one can ask in a \ndeveloping country is, How do you treat your women? We should treat the \nwomen of the world with respect. We should give them access to sound \nfamily planning. Let them plan their lives and plan their families. \nThere will be fewer abortions, fewer maternal deaths, and fewer \nchildren dying as a result.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, first, I thank the Senator so much for adding those \nnumbers. We are talking about saving women's lives and we are talking \nabout stopping thousands of abortions. That is why it is so \ninexplicable to me that this amendment is coming from the other side.\n  I wanted to ask a couple of questions of my friend. Senator Brownback \nasked for us to find common ground, and I want to find common ground, \nand I said we are going to find common ground with this vote. But \nfurther, wouldn't my friend agree that family planning is the common \nground between those of us who support a woman's right to choose and \nthose who oppose it? Isn't family planning finding common ground?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say, through the Chair, that I am not one who \ncelebrates the incidence of abortion in this country or anywhere. I \nwish to see far fewer abortions. But let's be honest. How do you reach \nthat goal? You reach that goal by educating women and giving them \nopportunities to avoid unintended pregnancies. I think that is why this \namendment is inconsistent with the sponsor's goal. If you want fewer \nabortions, give women an option, let them control their bodies and \ntheir lives, and let them make family decisions that are right for \nthem, instead of being at the mercy of a situation they cannot control.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have one last question to ask through the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute, and to give \nSenator McCain an extra minute if he wishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I also wanted to make the point that this \ndenial of funds to these nongovernmental organizations--which the \nSenator is absolutely right to stress--is far-reaching. Even if they \ntell a woman what her options are, and as long as they know these \noptions are legal, it should be fine and they shouldn't be punished. \nBut does my friend know, because I wasn't clear until recently, that \nthis punishment of this gag rule goes beyond this?\n  In the case of Nepal, where a nongovernmental group wanted to simply \nchange the law so that abortion could be legal if a child was raped, \nthey were denied the funds because they wanted to go in front of their \ngovernment and say, sir and madam, let us have compassion for those \nlike this 13-year-old child. She is in jail for 20 years; she was \nraped. So is my friend aware that is how far this global gag rule went?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am glad the Senator from California made that point \nclear.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to address the issue of the \nlegislation before us, the SCHIP reauthorization.\n  We all know that the Children's Health Insurance Program is a vital \nsafety net program the Congress created to offer coverage to one of our \nNation's most vulnerable populations, and that is low-income children. \nIt is an objective that all of us stand behind. Unfortunately, the \nmeasure before us is an attempt to take a good program, expand it far \nbeyond its original scope, and to fund it by imposing higher tobacco \ntaxes. Remarkable. That is not the right approach.\n  When it was created, it was done to address the needs of millions of \nchildren who went without health coverage. I was pleased to join my \ncolleagues in supporting the establishment of the CHIP program. And \nthanks to this program, many low-income children have been able to \nobtain health care coverage they otherwise wouldn't have had. Today, \nobviously, this bill would drastically expand coverage, and as has been \ndiscussed several times on the floor, it contains loopholes, for \nexample, that would allow one State--the State of New York--to go ahead \nwith their planned expansion and cover children of families earning up \nto $88,000 a year. That will have a crowdout effect, where 2.4 million \nof the 6.5 million newly enrolled individuals would have had private \ncoverage without this legislation.\n  Some of us who look at this may view it as another effort to \neliminate, over time, private insurance in America, and I am concerned \nabout that. I am also concerned about the drastic expansion. We should \ntake the word ``children'' out of it, since it is now being expanded to \nmany other citizens than children. But what I find unacceptable here is \nthat we are basically going to count on Americans to use tobacco \nproducts--smoking--in order to fund it.\n  Is there anyone in this body who doesn't know that smoking and the \nuse of tobacco products is harmful and a danger to the health of these \nsame children we are insuring? Is there anyone who isn't concerned \nabout what seems to be a rise in the use of tobacco amongst young \nAmericans? One of the reasons for that is because the deal that was \nnegotiated between the lawyers and the attorneys general of this \ncountry was that these supposed funds from tobacco taxes were supposed \nto go to advertising for antitobacco usage and for treatment of \nillnesses associated with the use of tobacco, but it has now become \nanother source of revenue for every State in America.\n  Yesterday, during a Health and Education Committee roundtable \ndiscussion, the topic of preventive measures was discussed at length, \nand what did we talk about? We talked about the ill effects of the use \nof tobacco, particularly smoking and secondhand tobacco, and yet here \nwe are funding an attempt to improve the health of young Americans with \nbillions and billions of dollars of taxes on tobacco products. Couldn't \nwe have found somewhere in our budget programs that could have been \nreduced or even eliminated to fund the SCHIP program? Apparently not. \nApparently not.\n  So we now are at a point where the States no longer use the money in \nthe form of taxes on tobacco products that was supposed to go to \ndiscourage the use of tobacco. We are now going to depend on a tax on \ntobacco products for funding of insurance for children and others, \nthereby, at least in some ways, encouraging the use of tobacco. So I am \nvery much opposed to this legislation.\n  I am proud of what we did initially. But it seems to me that using \nthe ill-\n\n[[Page S958]]\n\ngotten taxes from the use of tobacco--smoking in particular--in order \nto fund any program is not an appropriate legislative remedy. So I \nbelieve the bill differs drastically from the original intention of \nSCHIP, and I disagree strongly with its funding mechanism of increased \ntobacco taxes.\n  I support the ideas contained in the alternative bill, which would \nkeep the Children's Health Insurance Program focused on low-income \nchildren, and would have done so without dramatic increases in Federal \nspending or higher taxes.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of my colleagues, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today, this Congress is facing a \nfundamental test of our values: whether to reauthorize the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program and expand it to cover millions of \nchildren who would otherwise be left uninsured. We must ask ourselves: \nIs this good for our Nation's children? The answer is, clearly, yes. \nAnd I say this as a father. There is nothing more important to parents \nthan the health of their children, and there is nothing more important \nto helping them grow up to achieve their potential and contribute all \nthey can to our society.\n  It is no secret what a major financial burden health care can be. We \nare reminded of the costs every time we go to the doctor or fill a \nprescription at the pharmacy. There are parents who work every day in \nsome of the toughest jobs in our country, but their jobs don't offer \nhealth insurance and their paychecks don't cover the cost of private \ncoverage.\n  They are not the only ones whose health is at serious risk because of \nthis lack of insurance. It is also a major risk for children. Parents \nstay up at night worrying about whether the hard cough they hear coming \nfrom their daughter's room means she has asthma; hoping that the pain \nin their son's stomach doesn't mean he is going to need surgery; \nwondering how they are going to pay for a routine checkup; and just \npraying--praying--that everyone stays healthy until they can afford to \nget the health care they need.\n  Here is one story: A boy named Jonathan took a trip to the New Jersey \nshore with his family. His head started to throb on the ride from his \nhome in New Hampshire, and finally the pain became unbearable. I want \nto read what Jonathan wrote about his experience. He wrote:\n\n       The pain was so bad; I had to crawl on the ground. My mom \n     drove me to the medical center. I remember my mom calling my \n     dad and asking the question, Do we still have medical \n     insurance? I remember being really scared. The doctor \n     explained that I had an arachnoid cyst about the size of an \n     ice cube growing on the left side of my brain. My mother \n     started to cry. There was another problem: Our insurance \n     coverage had ended. Going to the hospital and having all of \n     the CAT scans and MRI testing was super expensive. Suddenly, \n     insurance was a huge issue. Friends told us about a program \n     called New Hampshire Healthy Kids. My parents had to act \n     quickly and register my brothers and me for the program. The \n     people at NHHK were really helpful. I was able to get the \n     medical attention I needed.\n\n  Thank goodness Jonathan was okay. But stories such as this are why \nthe Federal Government and the States teamed up to create the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. It has been a great success across \nthe country, covering almost 7 million American children. In New \nJersey, it covers almost 130,000 of those American children. This year, \nCongress has an opportunity to make children's health even more \ninclusive, to pass a bill that will continue to provide health care to \nthe almost 7 million children already enrolled, and expand the program \nto include 4 million children across America, and that includes another \n100,000 in my home State of New Jersey.\n  As we are considering whether to reauthorize and expand children's \nhealth, we all have to ask ourselves two questions: One, would we have \nwanted Jonathan's story to have turned out differently? Absolutely not. \nAnd two, are we going to sit back as millions of other stories such as \nJonathan's don't end up as happily? The decisions we make today have \nvery clear implications for hardworking families across the country. \nThe difference here between no and yes can mean, for millions of \nchildren, the difference between helplessness, suffering, and pain \nversus opportunity, health, and a better quality of life. That is how \nhigh the stakes are.\n  Now, some in this Chamber may question whether we can afford health \ncare for our children. Let us look at the facts. First, this \nlegislation won't cost us a dime because it is completely paid for. \nSecond, making sure kids can get regular checkups and focus on \npreventive care has the potential to reduce emergency room visits and \nsave costs down the line.\n  We also need to be very clear that public health insurance does not \nmean free health insurance. Many families across America and in New \nJersey are responsible for copays and have to pay a premium every \nmonth. They are part of supporting their children's health care \ncoverage.\n  But all that aside, let us look at the bigger budgetary picture, at \nwhere our priorities have been for the last several years. The war in \nIraq is currently costing us $5,000 every second. With what is spent on \nthe war in Iraq in 40 days, we could insure over 10 million children in \nAmerica for 1 year. In fact, with the amount that has been spent on the \nwar, we could provide 2 years of health care coverage for all of the 47 \nmillion Americans who don't have health insurance, who play Russian \nroulette every day with their lives and their wallets. And even after \nproviding all that health care for every American who doesn't have it, \nwe would still have $30 billion remaining.\n  If we are willing to look at our priorities and choose our children--\nas we often say, and I have heard many of my colleagues speak on the \nfloor about how our children are our most precious resource, and they \nare, but they are also our most vulnerable resource--tackling America's \nhealth care crisis is something we can absolutely do within the \nreasonable constraints of our budget.\n  Now, some of our colleagues have also objected--I have heard it here \non the floor--to how States such as New Jersey are treated under this \nlegislation. They object to my home State's ability to cover children \nwhose parents' salaries are up to 350 percent of the Federal poverty \nlevel.\n  I want to give a round estimate of the monthly costs facing a family \nliving at 250 percent of the poverty level, or about $4,594 per month, \nin one of our counties, in Middlesex, NJ.\n  When you look at that monthly income and then look at the costs for \nhousing, for food, for childcare so you can go to work, for \ntransportation, for the taxes paid there, and then what it costs for \nhealth insurance, the reality is you have a set of circumstances where \nthat family has a monthly deficit, a debt of $898, which means they do \nnot have the wherewithal to do all of this. These are the basics. These \nare no frills. They find themselves in debt.\n  On top of that, comparable private health insurance in my home State \ncan cost almost $1,800 a month.\n  What does a family have left at the end of the month? The answer is a \nstaggering load of debt. If they are making 250 percent of the Federal \npoverty level, they are going to be in debt almost $900.\n  It is the same in other parts of the State as well. For example, if \nthey are living at that income level in Trenton, NJ, the State's \ncapital, they are going to be in debt about $856 every single month to \ndo the basics--to have a place to call home, to put food on the table, \nto have childcare, to go to work, transportation to be able to achieve \nthat, to pay their taxes, and then to have health insurance. They do \nnot have enough money to make ends meet.\n  The Federal poverty level does not reflect the difference in cost of \nliving between States. For example, if you are a family making 250 \npercent of the Federal poverty level in Phoenix, AZ, after all is said \nand done, under the same set of criteria--housing, food, childcare, \ntransportation, and taxes and health insurance--you have a monthly \nsurplus of about $1,347. That is left over at the end of the month \nbecause the cost of living is lower.\n  There is a huge difference in the family's reality with a surplus and \nbeing able to have all of these essentials versus having a debt in the \ntwo examples I showed before.\n  Let me give another example. In Salt Lake City, UT, the same set of \ncircumstances--housing, food, childcare, transportation, taxes, health \ninsurance--you have a $1,469 surplus, so you\n\n[[Page S959]]\n\nhave disposable income to be able to make other choices for your family \nwith the same set of circumstances in terms of the Federal poverty \nlevel.\n  The reality is, we face a much higher cost of living. The \nconsequences are real to New Jersey families. Let's compare State by \nState.\n  I understand 350 percent of the Federal poverty level sounds somewhat \nhigh if you do not see the numbers. But what it takes to meet that \namount in New Jersey is, it takes a much less amount in all of these \nStates--from Kentucky, Arizona, Oklahoma, Georgia, Tennessee, Utah, \nMissouri, North Carolina--much less. It takes much less to meet the \nsame level of the Federal poverty level.\n  The bottom line is, we simply have a higher cost of living and one \nsize does not fit all. I wish our citizens could get the same quality \nof life in terms of the essentials for much less money, but that is not \nthe reality. So it makes perfect sense for different States to cover \nchildren at different levels of income in order to accomplish the same \ngoal, which is ensuring that children at the end of the day are \ncovered.\n  Even former President Bush understood that when he approved New \nJersey's waiver, as he did for a long time. Even then, I would like to \npoint out, the number of New Jersey children who fall into that \ncategory is just about 3,300 children, a tiny fraction of those \nenrolled nationally. Only about 2.5 percent of our children are covered \nunder this level of the Federal poverty level.\n  Finally, the last time legislation to expand children's health came \nup, hundreds of thousands of children were left out, children who are \nlegal--underline legal, emphasis legal--permanent residents of the \nUnited States. They follow our laws every step of the way, children \nwhose parents work hard and pay taxes. Some of them are actually in the \nservice of their country. These children are eventually eligible for \nMedicaid or CHIP, but the law says we have to bar them from coverage \nfor 5 years first.\n  To a young child, 5 years is a lifetime. Here is what it means to bar \nlegal permanent resident children and pregnant mothers from affordable \npublic health for that long. As it stands, a girl with asthma has to go \nthrough 5 years of attacks before she can get an inhaler. A boy whose \nvision gets so blurry he can't see the chalkboard in the fourth grade \nhas to wait until high school before he gets glasses. A pregnant woman \nwho urgently needs prenatal care can't get it until her child will be \nready for kindergarten.\n  I have not met anyone who is not outraged when they hear kids with \ncancer would have to wait 5 years for chemotherapy. Most people cannot \nbelieve that is the law, and it should not be. Children should not have \nto wait a single day to get the care they need to save and improve \ntheir lives. Good health care is essential for them to be able to fully \nrealize their God-given potential. Children, whether they be in a \nclassroom or on a playground, are contagious. So whether it is a legal \nimmigrant child or a U.S.-born citizen, the bottom line is they are \nplaying in that playground together, sitting in the classroom together. \nIf one has health care and the other doesn't because we have an \narbitrary bar, it is easy to get some cold or disease that is \ncontagious, so there is a public health interest for all of us.\n  We have the opportunity to do what is right and make a major step in \nensuring no child goes to bed at night without health care in the \ngreatest Nation on the Earth. This would bring a half million kids \nnationwide into the State health insurance programs in this category.\n  Let me conclude. For all of us, this is a matter of values. Do we \nvalue our children and do our actions match our values? For those who \nvalue life, who have spoken very eloquently in this Chamber about its \nsanctity, and those who value family, who consider it the bedrock of \nour lives and our country, now is the time to show the depth of that \nbelief because if children's health is not about protecting life, I do \nnot know what is. If this bill is not profamily, I do not know what is.\n  Now is the time to give new security to millions of young lives to \nhelp America's children achieve their God-given potential and to \nreplace fear in millions of minds with hope for a better day. That is \nthe opportunity before the Senate, and that is the one I hope we will \nadopt at the end of this process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have listened to the debate on the \namendment offered by Senator Martinez to reverse President Obama's \ndecision to overturn the Mexico City policy. I have been struck by the \nstatements of proponents of the amendment that the President's action \nmeans Federal funds will now be used for abortions overseas. That is \nnothing more than a scare tactic and a flagrant misrepresentation of \nfact.\n  As those who make such statements know well, U.S. law has banned the \nuse of Federal funds for abortion overseas for more than 30 years and \nthat is the law today. Most recently, it can be found in title III of \nthe fiscal year 2008 State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, \nshould they choose to refresh their memories. Whether or not the \nMartinez amendment passes, no U.S. funds are available for abortion, \neven in countries where, like the U.S., abortion is legal.\n  The irony of this debate is that the Martinez amendment would prevent \nfunding to private organizations that, thanks to the President's \naction, would be eligible to receive U.S. funds for contraceptives \nwhich prevent unwanted pregnancies and abortions. Yet they claim that \nunless we pass the Martinez amendment the number of abortions will \nincrease. It is a counterintuitive, disingenuous argument that has been \nconsistently proven to be false. The facts are indisputable. Where \nfamily planning services are available, the number of abortions \ndeclines.\n  Another false claim by proponents is that unless we pass this \namendment U.S. funds will be used to support coercive family planning \npolicies in China. They know that is not true. The Mexico City policy \nhas nothing to do with coercion, pro or con. Another provision, also in \nthe State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, provides the \nPresident with the authority to prohibit funds to any organization that \nsupports coercion. And the law explicitly prohibits the use of U.S. \nfamily planning funds in China. The President's action reversing the \nMexico City policy does not change that.\n  We all want the number of abortions to decline. But one would hope \nthat even as we disagree on how best to achieve that, those who oppose \nthe President's decision would stick to the facts and not try to \ndistort or misrepresent U.S. law.\n  The Mexico City policy is discriminatory, it would be \nunconstitutional in our own country, it would deny women in poor \ncountries access to family planning services, and it would increase \nunwanted pregnancies and abortions. The amendment should be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the vote in \nrelation to the Martinez amendment, No. 65, occur at 12:10 p.m. today, \nand the additional time be divided and controlled by Senators Boxer and \nMartinez or their designees, with the remaining provisions of the \nprevious order in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to \nspeak for 2 minutes to close on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, this amendment is to reinstate the \nMexico City policy which President Obama, just a couple of days ago, \neliminated with the stroke of a pen. Much has been said in opposition \nto this amendment, which I think is erroneous. I think at the core of \nwhat this amendment is about is whether we want U.S. taxpayer dollars--\nmy taxes, as someone who finds abortion to not be something I can live \nwith, which is not consistent with my faith and personal beliefs--\nwhether my tax dollars and those of other people similarly situated \nshould be utilized to fund family planning that utilizes abortion as a \nmeans of family planning with organizations abroad.\n  That, I think, is wrong. That, I think, is abhorrent. It is not about \ndenying organizations family health assistance when they are simply \nlooking after a person's health. It is not about those rare exceptions \nof rape and incest, which are dragged in to try to\n\n[[Page S960]]\n\nmake what is unjustifiable justifiable. Abortion should not be utilized \nas a means of family planning.\n  We talk about wanting to have fewer abortions not more, to have it be \nrare not frequent, but then we do things like this, and that is \ncompletely contrary to what is the avowed intent of what so often is \nportrayed as the position on this issue during political campaigns.\n  This policy does not restrict foreign aid funding. It is to ensure \nthat American taxpayer dollars will not go to promote nor support \nabortion or abortion-related services. I think it is that simple. I \nhope my colleagues will join in this effort. This is about what the \ntaxpayer dollars of America should be funding overseas, in countries \nwhere very often we find that the culture and the religion of the host \ncountry is consistent with the Mexico City policy.\n  This is a vote to reinstate the Mexico City policy which has been the \npolicy of this country until last week. I hopefully urge my colleagues \nto support amendment No. 65.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, despite the previous unanimous consent \nagreement, I ask consent the Senator from California be allowed to \nspeak for 1 minute prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to have an up-or-down vote on this \namendment. I am not going to make a motion to table. I think this is a \nvery bad amendment, an amendment that would consign women all over the \nworld to desperate situations because what Senator Martinez wants to do \nis restore the gag rule. That means that nongovernmental organizations \noverseas who help women get reproductive health care and tell them what \ntheir legal options are and make birth control available to them so \nthey can plan their families will lose every dollar of American support \nif they even try to do those things.\n  President Obama, like President Clinton, did the right thing. With \nthe stroke of a pen, he stood for the lives of women and for family \nplanning and for the health of women all over the world. We have \nstatistics that are very clear. Senator Durbin read them. Tens of \nthousands of abortions will be avoided because of the actions of our \nnew President. For the life of me, I do not understand how someone who \nis against abortion could offer such an amendment which in essence will \nconsign women to back-alley abortions and death.\n  If you really want to vote to promote life and health, vote against \nthe Martinez amendment and stand with President Obama on what I know \nwill be an overwhelming majority of Senators from both sides of the \naisle in favor of doing away with this global gag rule.\n  If it were tried in America, it would be unconstitutional. Stand for \nfreedom. Stand for women. Let's definitely vote this down.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the next \nspeakers be the following Senators: Senator Murray for 10 minutes, \nSenator Cornyn for 5 minutes, and Senator Roberts for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, regular health care is critical for a \nchild to grow up to be a strong and healthy adult. We all know that. \nYet every day millions of American children are denied access to this \nvery basic need. They cannot get regular checkups or see a family \ndoctor for sore throats or ear aches or fevers. So as our economy \ncontinues to struggle, this problem is growing worse.\n  At the end of 2007, all of us came together on a bipartisan bill that \nwould have taken big steps toward helping millions more kids get health \ncare. It would have renewed the Children's Health Insurance Program and \nmade sure that almost 10 million low-income children would be covered.\n  It is a tragedy and a shame that children's health care became the \nvictim of a partisan fight. But, this week, now we have the opportunity \nto make children's health a priority by renewing and expanding the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program and getting it signed into law. And \nit could not come at a moment too soon.\n  In the year since former President Bush last vetoed CHIP, \nunemployment has skyrocketed nationally and in my home State of \nWashington. As a result, millions of families across our country have \nlost their health care in just this last year alone. That is wrong, and \nit is one of the reasons we have now put CHIP at the top of our agenda \nthis year.\n  In difficult times such as this, it is more important than ever we \nmake sure our Nation's children have a place to go where they can get \nmedical care. So I am here to urge all my colleagues to support the \n2009 CHIP reauthorization. It is the smart thing to do for our economy. \nIt is the moral thing to do for our children.\n  Most of us in the Senate support reauthorizing and improving the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program because we share the goal of \nensuring that all our kids can get health care. Study after study has \nshown the benefits. Children in this program are much more likely to \nhave regular doctor and dental care. The health care they do receive is \nbetter quality. They do better in school because they are healthy.\n  This bill is almost identical to the one we passed overwhelmingly in \n2007. It ensures the children already enrolled in CHIP will continue to \nreceive health care, and it provides another 3.9 million low-income \nchildren with coverage. Most of those are kids who never had insurance \nbecause their parents could not afford it or kids who lost Medicaid \ncoverage or kids who were recently dropped from private insurance \nrolls. I think it is critical we expand health insurance to make sure \nthey are covered.\n  Now, there are a couple specific provisions in this bill I wish to \nhighlight to make sure everyone understands why it is so important to \npass this bill now.\n  First, as I said at the beginning of my remarks today, the economic \nrecession has made it even more critical that we make children's health \ncare a top priority and reauthorize this CHIP program.\n  On Monday of this week, some of the strongest companies in our Nation \nannounced they would cut 75,000 jobs\n\n[[Page S961]]\n\ncombined. Unemployment is now at the highest level in 16 years, and we \nare being told we have not seen the worst of it yet.\n  The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates every time the unemployment \nrate increases a point, 700,000 more children lose their health \ninsurance. By those numbers, well over a million more children have \nlost their insurance in the last year alone, and many more will lose \ntheir coverage in the weeks and months to come.\n  This bill makes it easier for our States to ensure those children \nwill continue at least to get health care. It adds more flexibility to \nthe program and sets funding rates based on State budget projections, \nso our States that are in the worst financial shape will get more money \nto help pay for health care. This would be a huge help for my home \nState of Washington and for the many families who are struggling to \nprovide health care for their children.\n  At the same time, the bill will strengthen CHIP by making sure \nresources are targeted at covering the low-income, uninsured children \nCongress meant to help when we created CHIP back in 1997. It gives \nStates new tools to raise awareness about CHIP in rural, minority, and \nlow-income communities to help reduce the disparity in care for \nminority children and extend care where it is most needed. Also, it \ncreates a performance-based system that rewards our States for reducing \nthe number of uninsured children by making sure that the lowest income \nchildren are the top priority for CHIP and Medicaid.\n\n  Finally, CHIP is paid for. The $32.8 billion cost is covered by a 61-\ncent per pack tax increase on cigarettes and other tobacco products. We \naren't taking away from our other economic priorities, Social Security \nisn't raided, and the deficit won't be increased. It is a win-win for \neveryone because experts estimate that by increasing the cost of \ncigarettes, almost 2 million adults will quit smoking and then we will \nprevent millions of kids from ever getting hooked. It is good for our \nchildren now and it will help millions stay healthy in the future as \nwell.\n  Although this bill does have broad bipartisan support, some of our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have tried to throw up some \nobstacles that distract us from the real issues. I wish to make clear \nright now what this bill is about. It is about our kids. This \nlegislation is about making sure our children can see a doctor when \nthey are sick. It is about making sure they get medicine that will help \nthem get better. It is about honoring our promise to provide 10 million \nkids with health care that will help ensure they can grow into happy \nand healthy adults.\n  I come to the floor this afternoon to share a story about a little \ngirl from my home State because I think it puts the importance of this \nlegislation in perspective.\n  Meet Brenna. She is 6 years old, a bright and happy child, but she \nhas a serious genetic condition called cystic fibrosis. Brenna's family \nlives in Marysville, WA, in a part of my State that has been hit \ntremendously hard by the economic downturn. Like a lot of people with \ncystic fibrosis, Brenna's health care costs are about 10 times more \nthan the average child. It is nearly impossible for her to get private \nhealth insurance to cover the bills she and her family are facing. In \nfact, almost half of the children with cystic fibrosis would not have \nhealth care at all if they didn't have CHIP or Medicaid.\n  Brenna's mother Brandy recently wrote to me to tell me that her \nfamily depends on CHIP for Brenna and to keep her family going. I wish \nto read what she wrote. She said:\n\n       I don't know what I would do if I did not have this \n     wonderful program. I simply would not be able to pay for her \n     to receive the care she does now. I would be in never-ending \n     medical debt, and in the end of it all, I would most likely \n     lose my daughter either way.\n       The economy is rough enough right now. The SCHIP program is \n     something I am extremely thankful for. It provides me sanity \n     and strength every year to take care of my child and her \n     needs. Please allow this program to continue. Our lives \n     depend on it.\n\n  Those are heart-wrenching words from a mom. Most of us can't even \nimagine being in Brandy's shoes. Her daughter's story shows us how \ncritical this Children's Health Insurance Program is. This bill in \nfront of us today is about Brenna and the millions of children like her \naround the country.\n  What it comes down to is this: When a child gets a cut that needs \nstitches, has a fever or an earache or develops a serious illness such \nas cystic fibrosis, they should be able to get health care period. I \nwant to make sure Brenna's mom never has to worry about her going into \ndebt to keep her own child alive, or whether health care will be there \nfor her daughter.\n  So let me say it again: This bill is about making sure our kids can \nsee a doctor. Passing it is the smartest thing we can do for our \neconomy, but it is also the moral thing to do for our children. So on \nbehalf of 6-year-old Brenna, the 115,960 uninsured children in my home \nState of Washington, and the almost 9 million uninsured children across \nthe country, I urge all of our colleagues to support this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 67\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 67 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 67.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To ensure redistributed funds go towards coverage of low-\n  income children or outreach and enrollment of low-income children, \n rather than to States that will use the funds to cover children from \n                        higher income families)\n\n       On page 45, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n       ``(3) Limitation.--\n       ``(A) In general.--A State shall not be a shortfall State \n     described in paragraph (2) if the State provides coverage \n     under this title to children whose family income (as \n     determined without regard to the application of any general \n     exclusion or disregard of a block of income that is not \n     determined by type of expense or type of income (regardless \n     of whether such an exclusion or disregard is permitted under \n     section 1902(r))) exceeds 200 percent of the poverty line.\n       ``(B) Grants to states with unspent funds.--Of any funds \n     that are not redistributed under this subsection because of \n     the application of subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall make \n     grants to States as follows:\n       ``(i) 75 percent of such funds shall be directed toward \n     increasing coverage under this title for low-income children.\n       ``(ii) 25 percent of such funds shall be directed toward \n     activities assisting States, especially States with a high \n     percentage of eligible, but not enrolled children, in \n     outreach and enrollment activities under this title, such \n     as--\n\n       ``(I) improving and simplifying enrollment systems, \n     including--\n\n       ``(aa) increasing staffing and computer systems to meet \n     Federal and State standards;\n       ``(bb) decreasing turn-around time while maintaining \n     program integrity; and\n\n       ``(II) improving outreach and application assistance, \n     including--\n\n       ``(aa) connecting children with a medical home and keeping \n     them healthy;\n       ``(bb) developing systems to identify, inform, and fix \n     enrollment system problems;\n       ``(cc) supporting awareness of, and access to, other \n     critical health programs;\n       ``(dd) pursuing new performance goals to cut `procedural \n     denials' to the lowest possible level; and\n       ``(ee) coordinating community- and school-based outreach \n     programs.''.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I am here today to lend my full support \nto the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram.\n  SCHIP was created with the noblest of intentions: to cover low-income \nchildren whose families did not qualify for Medicaid but who could not \nafford private health insurance. Unfortunately, there are too many \nchildren today who are eligible for CHIP who are not enrolled. I \nstrongly believe that before we consider expanding the scope of this \nprogram, as the present bill does, we need to focus on the currently \neligible population of low-income children.\n  That is why I have joined with a number of my colleagues in \nsupporting an alternative known as Kids First that focuses on the \noriginal intent of SCHIP, and that is to cover low-income children. \nKids First provides funding to Texas--my State--over the next 5 years \nat levels beyond projected spending by the Texas Health and Human \nServices Commission.\n  Across the country, thousands of children are eligible but not \nenrolled in health insurance programs such as\n\n[[Page S962]]\n\nMedicaid or SCHIP, and I believe we need to focus on those children \nfirst. Frankly, in my State--not something I am proud of--850,000 \nchildren are eligible for Medicaid and SCHIP, but they are not \nenrolled. I think it is important we focus our efforts on getting these \nchildren covered. That is why Kids First provides $400 million for 5 \nyears for outreach and enrollment.\n  We can all agree that during these tough times it is important that \nwe assist as many low-income children as we possibly can, but it is \nalso necessary that we accomplish this goal without placing excessive \nburdens on taxpayers. Kids First protects taxpayer dollars and pays for \nthe funding by reducing administrative costs, duplicative spending, and \neliminating earmarks.\n  Unfortunately, the bill that is now on the floor is structured in \nsuch a way that it provides billions of taxpayer dollars to cover \nchildren whose parents earn up to $100,000 and more and eliminates the \nrequirement that States first cover low-income children before \nexpanding their programs. One might ask how that could possibly be so. \nWell, through a mysterious thing known as ``income disregard'' that \nwould, under this bill, allow coverage at 300 percent, 350 percent, and \nhigher of poverty, but then allow States to disregard certain income \nwhich, if fully employed, would mean that a family earning about \n$120,000--a family of four--would be eligible for CHIP coverage, even \nthough children in my State with families of four who make only $42,000 \nwould not be covered. It is important we take care of the low-income \nchildren who are the original focus of the SCHIP program before we see \nthat money being drained off, using it in other States to cover adults \nor to cover families making as much as 400 percent of poverty and more.\n  I think the bill on the floor takes an unfortunate step backward in \nterms of fiscal responsibility as well. The bill imposes a regressive \ntax on middle and low-income families and relies on the creation of 22 \nmillion new smokers to afford the future imposition of an additional \ntax--a staggering fact.\n  To improve the bill and to focus on low-income children, I have \noffered this amendment that prohibits redistributing funds to States \nthat have expanded their SCHIP program to higher income families or \nadults, at least until we take care of the low-income kids first. The \ncurrent bill rewards States for exceeding their budget, even if they \nspent outside of the original intent of the program. In fiscal year \n2007, for example, of 14 shortfall States that received redistributed \nfunds, out of those 14, 7 of them had expanded the SCHIP program for \nchildren beyond the 200 percent of poverty level. Of those 7, 4 had \nexpanded their programs above 300 percent. Redistributed funds should \nbe reserved for covering low-income children to assist States with \nspecific outreach and enrollment activities that will help enroll a \nlarge number of low-income children who are eligible but not enrolled.\n  We have a choice. We can either focus on low-income children or we \ncan choose to expand the program and leave many low-income children \nbehind. I hope my colleagues will join me in refocusing our efforts to \ncover low-income children first, which is what my amendment will do.\n  Madam President, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit CHIP coverage for higher income children and to \nprohibit any payment to a State from its CHIP allotments for any fiscal \n year quarter in which the State Medicaid income eligibility level for \n  children is greater than the income eligibility level for children \n                              under CHIP)\n\n       Strike section 114 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 114. LIMITATION ON FEDERAL MATCHING PAYMENTS.\n\n       (a) Denial of Federal Matching Payments for Coverage of \n     Higher Income Children.--Section 2105(c) (42 U.S.C. \n     1397ee(c)) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(8) Denial of payments for expenditures for child health \n     assistance for higher income children.--\n       ``(A) In general.--NO payment may be made under this \n     section for any expenditures for providing child health \n     assistance or health benefits coverage under a State child \n     health plan under this title, including under a waiver under \n     section 1115, with respect to any child whose gross family \n     income (as defined by the Secretary) exceeds the lower of--\n       ``(i) $65,000; or\n       ``(ii) the median State income (as determined by the \n     Secretary).\n       ``(B) No payments from allotments under this title if \n     medicaid income eligibility level for children is greater.--\n     No payment may be made under this section from an allotment \n     of a State for any expenditures for a fiscal year quarter for \n     providing child health assistance or health benefits coverage \n     under the State child health plan under this title to any \n     individual if the income eligibility level (expressed as a \n     percentage of the poverty line) for children who are eligible \n     for medical assistance under the State plan under title XIX \n     under any category specified in sub-''paragraph (A) or (C) of \n     section 1902(a)(10) in effect during such quarter is greater \n     than the income eligibility level (as so expressed) for \n     children in effect during such quarter under the State child \n     health plan under this title.''.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, first, I ask unanimous consent to add \nSenator Collins as a cosponsor of this amendment, which is already \ncosponsored by Senator Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I rise today to offer an amendment to \nrefocus this bill and to more accurately reflect our priorities in \nregard to low-income children. After all, that is what this bill is \nsupposed to be all about.\n  The SCHIP program was established in title XXI of the Social Security \nAct. We had one goal, and that goal was to cover targeted low-income \nchildren. A targeted low-income child is defined as one who is under \nthe age of 19 with no health insurance, whose family makes too much \nmoney to qualify them for Medicaid but not enough to be able to afford \nto buy them health insurance.\n  The statute is very clear about who SCHIP is intended to cover. Low-\nincome children should be our priority. That is the intent of the \nprogram. That is what the authors of the program had in mind when it \nwas first passed in 1997.\n  In Kansas, we take this priority very seriously. Our SCHIP is called \nHealthWave, and it covers children under the age of 19 whose families' \nincomes are up to 200 percent of the Federal poverty line. That is \nabout $44,000 per year for a family of four. In 2007, we were able to \ncover nearly 40,000 children through HealthWave, but an estimated \n32,000 low-income kids still remain uninsured. So my colleagues can \nimagine my surprise and frustration when I learned that some States \nwere not following the intent of SCHIP. This was under the previous \nadministration. That administration had granted, I think, something \nlike 14 waivers to States that violated, in my mind, the intent of this \nprogram. So instead of prioritizing low-income children, they were, \ninstead, exploiting loopholes and waivers granted by the previous \nadministration to cover high-income kids and even adults--adults being \ncovered by a program intended for low-income children. It shows us what \ncan happen to a program.\n  In the 2007 SCHIP reauthorization bill, which I and other Republicans \nsupported--and, I might add, at no small political cost--we worked hard \nto close some of those loopholes and to refocus our priorities toward \nlow-income kids. Now, this new bill, H.R. 2, cancels all of our good \nwork.\n  I wish to ask my colleagues a question about H.R. 2: Do you know, and \ndo the folks back home whom you represent know, that this bill allows \nyoungsters from families with incomes of $128,000 in some States to be \neligible for SCHIP--$128,000? If that is low-income children--I don't \nknow what the allegory is. I will think of it. I will come back to it.\n  So consider this: Under H.R. 2, the State of New York will be allowed \nto cover children from families with incomes up to 400 percent of the \nFederal poverty line. Now, start right there.\n\n[[Page S963]]\n\nThat is $88,200 for a family of four. In other States, 200 percent, \nmaybe 250 percent; in New York, 400 percent. When I asked the Senator \nfrom New York how on Earth I could go back to Kansas taxpayers and say \nwhy are you paying taxes--or why am I paying taxes, on the part of the \nconstituent for SCHIP for low-income kids, and yet you are providing it \nto a State where they are having the income level at 88,200? The answer \nI got back is that when you are poor in New York you are poorer than \nyou are in Kansas. My response to that is, they might want to move.\n\n  In addition, a State can use something called--now get this. This is \nbureaucratic talk. This is--I don't know what kind of talk this is. It \nis gobbledygook. A State can use something called an income disregard. \nSo we can use this income disregard which the expert panel at our \nFinance Committee markup admitted could exclude as much as $40,000 of \nadditional income.\n  So in New York, a family of four making $128,000 per year could be \neligible to receive SCHIP. In the last SCHIP bill, we closed this \nloophole. We put a hard cap on income at 300 percent of poverty, still \nhigher than some of us like, to target those low-income kids. It is a \nlot easier to raise that level, find those kids, and add them to the \nrolls than go after the low-income kids and give them the insurance the \nprogram was intended to do. We came up with a compromise I thought was \nworth the extra coverage for Kansas youngsters.\n  In addition, we disallowed the practice of block income disregards. \nThe current bill reverses that policy. How can I explain this to my \nKansas families making $40,000 a year? What does this say about our \npriorities? We just considered an $825 billion economic stimulus bill \nin the Finance Committee late last night, 9:30, with amendment after \namendment after amendment after amendment after amendment. It pretty \nwell wore us out. All were defeated except one by a party-line vote.\n  Now we are talking about an additional $33 billion to provide health \ninsurance to kids in families with incomes close to $130,000. I repeat, \nwith incomes close to $130,000. That does not make any sense.\n  I have one more question for my colleagues, Mr. President. Are they \naware that H.R. 2 could result in bonus payments being made to States \nfor expanding their Medicaid Programs to cover kids from families \nmaking over $128,000 a year? Let me explain how this works.\n  In order to increase the enrollment of the lowest income kids into \nMedicaid, which is a good cause, we establish a bonus payment program \nfor States that go out and identify and enroll these young people. \nHowever, some States, using their existing Medicaid flexibility, have \nadded a new layer of Medicaid eligibility on top of their maximum SCHIP \nincome eligibility level. They mixed the two. This Medicaid group is \nmade up entirely of people with incomes that are above the maximum \nSCHIP income levels, which we have seen under H.R. 2 could be over \n$128,000.\n  We call this phenomenon in some circles the Medicaid-SCHIP sandwich. \nIt is an extra sandwich. It is frosting on the cake, and the cake is \n$128,000. It will unintentionally result in States being eligible for \nbonus payments for expanding their Medicaid enrollments to cover very \nhigh income kids. It would be a nice thing to do if we could afford it, \nbut we cannot.\n  Obviously, this is a gross abuse of congressional intent. Increasing \nthe coverage of low-income children is and should be our priority with \nthese bonus payments. No more sandwiches to add on to SCHIP. Even so, I \nstill believe SCHIP is a program that is worth keeping and putting the \nSCHIP program back where it belongs--on low-income children.\n  SCHIP is not supposed to be the Adult Health Insurance Program. It is \nnot the Rich Kid's Free Health Care Program. It is not the Pathway to \nGovernment-Run Health Care for All Program. This program is supposed to \nbe targeting, again, low-income children. So let's make sure we take \ncare of them first. Let's get our priorities right.\n  The amendment I am offering will close some of the loopholes I \ndescribed in H.R. 2 that corrupt the intent of this program and skew \nour priorities.\n  Let me say something I do not have in my prepared remarks, and it \nrefers to a good conversation I had with the former leader of the \nSenate, Senator Tom Daschle, who is now the designee to be Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services. That is a job I would not want, and I told \nhim that when he came to the office and we had a nice chat.\n  He asked me: Pat, what could we do, like the President wants to do, \nto reach out across the aisle, pass something bipartisan where \neverybody could agree that we could do it, do it quickly, and say: \nThere, we have done something, instead of the back-and-forth politics \nlike last night when we had, what, 40 amendments--I don't know, 30, 40, \n50 amendments, straight party-line votes. This is not the road we want \nto take.\n  I said: Tom, why don't we take SCHIP that was passed in the last \nCongress. It was vetoed by President Bush, but we had large majorities. \nIt could be passed again, same bill.\n  That did not happen. SCHIP popped out of the woodwork. The SCHIP \nhorse came out of the chute, and it was a different rodeo. Underneath \nthat saddle were four burrs. In the SCHIP program, there is a crowdout \nprovision in regard to private insurance. That is the problem we have \ntoday. There is the problem of inserting immigration into this bill, \nwhich is a very passionate issue. We should not do that either. There \nare other things wrong with the bill.\n  This is not the bill we intended, we passed, everybody voted--not \neverybody voted for it; some on our side, everybody over there--and we \npassed it. It was the same thing in the House. We could have done it \nagain, the same bill, but the bill is changed. And, I might add, I \ndon't like the way it was done. This is not the way this place is \nsupposed to run. This is not the way the Senate is supposed to run. We \nshould have regular order. We should have committee jurisdiction. We \nshould have hearings. We could have passed that other SCHIP bill we \npassed in the last session of Congress. It did not happen.\n  All of a sudden we had a new bill. I went to our ranking member, the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley. I said: What happened?\n  I went to the distinguished chairman of the committee, the Senator \nfrom Montana, and I asked Senator Baucus: Max, I don't understand this. \nWe usually meet as Republicans; we meet as Democrats. We get together \nand the Finance Committee is usually bipartisan and then we come up \nwith something and figure out if we cannot do a bipartisan bill, we \nshould not do it.\n  This is a brandnew ball game. This is not what the President said \nyesterday when he met with Republicans and said: I want to work with \nyou. This is not what the President said when he said: I am going to \nreach out; I need your suggestions. This is a cramdown. This is a thing \nwhere we had SCHIP, and then, boom, here we are. We have SCHIP, a \ndifferent bill. I cannot now vote for it. I voted for the last one, but \nI am not going to vote for this one because of the problems it has.\n  This is not the way to do business. I feel very badly I advised Tom \nDaschle who, obviously, advised the transition team who may have \nadvised the President to start off with SCHIP. Now we have SCHIP and it \nis not SCHIP; it is sandwich plus and plus and plus, most especially \nfor New York and New Jersey. I have been picking on New York. I might \nas well pick on New Jersey.\n  The amendment I am offering will close some of the loopholes of H.R. \n2 that corrupt the intent of the program and skew priorities. My \namendment strikes section 114 of H.R. 2 and replaces it with language \nthat prevents any State from receiving Federal SCHIP funds to cover \nkids, young people, children, not adults, from families with incomes \nwhich are the lower of $65,000 or the State median income for a family \nof four.\n  Why do I do that? Because I want to target the program to the low-\nincome kids. You raise all of these caps and all of these income \ndisregards--income disregards; I love those two words, ``income \ndisregards.'' Does that make any sense? That is not an oxymoron; it is \nsomething that does not make any sense. Income disregard. We are going \nto disregard this income--your house, your car, I don't know, maybe \nyour dog. It would have to be a pure-bred dog.\n\n[[Page S964]]\n\n  At any rate, this is ridiculous. You raise it and you spend money on \nthose folks, if you can find them. They are sure going to come to the \nwaterhole. But you need not do that and fine the low-income kids who \ndesperately need it. They desperately need it in Kansas and desperately \nneed it in every State. Again, we cover families with incomes which are \nthe lower of $65,000 the State median income for a family of four.\n  In addition, my amendment addresses the Medicaid-SCHIP sandwich--\nSCHIP funding for bonus payments for higher income Medicaid kids.\n  To be sure, even if this amendment is accepted, a lot of my concerns \nwith this bill will remain, although this would be a giant step \nforward.\n  I am also concerned--this is another one of the burrs under the \nsaddle of the SCHIP horse that came out from the chute looking entirely \ndifferent from the old SCHIP horse which was about to finish first in \nthe race. I am very concerned about the removal of the crowdout \nprovision that had been included in both SCHIP 1 and 2 of last year.\n  What am I talking about? My concerns are confirmed by the CBO's \nestimate that over 2 million out of the 6 million new children who will \nbe covered by SCHIP or Medicaid under this new bill already have \ninsurance in the private market. So here we have 6 million youngsters, \n2 million of whom are already covered by private insurance. That is the \nvery definition of crowdout, and it needs to be addressed.\n  What is going to happen to the insurance company that covers these \nkids? Of course, we are trying to find the low-income kids. But we find \nout that 2 million--actually it is more than that--are covered by \ninsurance. Do you think that insurance company is going to cover them? \nOf course not. They are going to get the free Federal program. And what \ndoes that do to the insurance company that is covering them now? It \nmeans they will probably say: I think we are not going to go into that \nbusiness anymore. That could leave a lot of other people without \ninsurance. So it is crowding out private insurance, and that needs to \nbe addressed.\n  I am also upset that this debate over children's health insurance has \nlargely been hijacked by an amendment which inserted one of the most \npassionate and divisive issues of the past decade into the bill. I am \nobviously talking about immigration. That has been debated on the floor \nbefore. That is the immigration issue. I am very disappointed it was \ninjected into this debate.\n  Finally, I reiterate my discouragement with the partisan character of \nthis new bill. I think I have indicated that. It is an insult to myself \nand to my Republican colleagues who worked so very hard to convince our \nown caucus in the Senate--very difficult--and over in the House to \nreach across the aisle to work on a bipartisan basis on an issue of \nhuge importance to the children and families of this country. All of \nthat time in good faith. Again, the horse came out of the chute. Wrong \nhorse. Wasted now. It is unfortunate and sets a very negative tone for \nfuture health care reform discussions in the 111th Congress.\n  I said when we started the debate on this bill, and I appealed to the \nchairman who is a very fair man, a great chairman who works closely \nwith Senator Grassley--either one, it doesn't make a difference who is \nchairman; we work in a bipartisan way--this tears at the fabric and the \ncomity of the Finance Committee, the very committee that is in charge \nof the economic stimulus that affects every American. If we are going \nto do this, simply ram it down our throats, burrs under the saddle and \neverything, or fish hooks or whatever you want to call it, that is a \nvery bad precedent.\n  Now, all that being said, I hope my colleagues will support my \namendment. I hope we can recapture some of that bipartisan spirit that \naccompanied the previous SCHIP bill just in the last session. And I \nhope we can again--that we can again, Madam President--place our \npriority on covering low-income children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, it appears to me that a quorum is not present. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I support the amendment offered by \nSenator Roberts. I would like to say a few things about it at this \npoint.\n  The Roberts amendment would focus the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram back to the original purpose of the program, which is coverage \nof low-income children. This amendment eliminates the earmarks in the \nbill which make it easier for States to cover children from families \nwith incomes above 400 percent of poverty.\n  The amendment sets an actual threshold on a State's ability to expand \nSCHIP at higher income levels. It does this by capping eligibility for \ntaxpayer-subsidized health coverage in the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram at $65,000 in annual income. The amendment fixes another \nloophole in the bill which would permit States to set Medicaid \neligibility higher than the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  Last night the Senate Finance Committee voted out an economic \nstimulus package with $87 billion in increased Medicaid spending. The \nincreased Medicaid spending is in the form of higher Federal payments \nto States for the coverage of people in the Medicaid Program.\n  We heard over and over, from the other side of the aisle, how the \nFederal taxpayers need to pay for more Federal dollars going into \nMedicaid because, if they do not, then States will cut benefits or cut \nback on the already dismal payments for providers who see Medicaid \npatients. In fact, I offered an amendment to that stimulus bill to \nprotect the safety net. It was defeated on a party-line vote.\n  My amendment essentially said that if Congress is going to give \nStates $87 billion for their Medicaid Programs, then we should make \nsure they do not undermine access to vital services with cutbacks to \nchildren's hospitals and public hospitals that are already struggling, \nand we should make sure States do not cut funds for health centers and \nfor pediatricians.\n  The $87 billion in the so-called stimulus bill will not do much good \nto protect low-income children and families' health coverage if States \nare allowed to take these billions of dollars intended to protect the \nsafety net and instead use them as their own slush fund to do whatever \nthey want.\n  But, sadly, my amendments to protect the safety net were defeated. \nWhat we now have is the so-called stimulus bill. In that is nothing \nmore than a $87 billion slush fund for the States.\n  With States crying out for a multibillion dollar bailout from the \nFederal Government, it seems to me very ironic that we have come to \nsuch a logjam over whether to allow States to expand income levels as \nhigh as 300 percent to 400 percent of poverty.\n  In one State, I believe it is New York, that is above $87,000-a-year \nincome, plus $40,000 to disregard above that.\n  On the one hand, the other side is fighting so hard to allow States \nto expand the Children's Health Insurance Program to allow coverage at \nthese higher income levels while, on the other hand, they are saying \nthat unless the Federal Government dumps billions of dollars into State \ncoffers, States will be forced to eliminate benefits and services at \nvery lowest income levels.\n  That argument obviously makes no sense whatsoever. We should be \nfocusing our efforts on covering low-income kids first. The other side \nwill come down here and say that is what they are doing. But when they \nare unwilling to back up their rhetoric with changes to actually do \nthat, I wish to make sure everyone understands what we are talking \nabout with this legislation and particularly the Roberts amendment.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program provides higher Federal \nmatching dollars to States to provide health coverage for low-income \nchildren. That is what it does. The higher Federal matching dollars are \nthere to encourage States to expand their program and get these kids \ncovered. This program has been in place now since 1997--obviously 12 \nyears--and still there are about 6 million low-income uninsured \nchildren in America today. The Children's Health Insurance Program \nreauthorization should be focused on getting these low-income kids \ncovered and\n\n[[Page S965]]\n\nthat should be the top priority in this bill. But this bill goes in a \ndifferent direction. It allows coverage of kids and families with \nincomes of $83,000.\n  The median family income in America is roughly $50,000, and I imagine \nin my State it is probably even lower than that. The median income is \nthe point at which half the households have incomes above that level \nand half have incomes below that level. So when the Government steps in \nand says let's have the taxpayers pay for your health coverage, those \nscarce dollars should be focused on the low-income kids this program is \nintended to insure--those kids, obviously, who are still uninsured. \nThat ought to be our first priority.\n  But when the program is allowed to cover children in families at \n$83,000, and even higher, that means families below the median income \nare being forced to pay for the health care costs for children of \nfamilies in the top half, and they are being forced to have their taxes \ngo up to pay for that coverage in the top half, when they may not even \nhave coverage for their own children. That is just plain wrong.\n  What Senator Roberts' amendment does is cap the eligibility for \nprograms at families with incomes of $65,000. Some people are going to \nsay even that is too high. But at least we are kind of keeping it \ntoward the national median income. That is still a family income that \nis above, obviously, the median income. A lot of people would say that \nis still way too high. I cannot say that too many times because I know \nwhat the grassroots of America are saying about what we do around here, \nparticularly in rural America; that it seems like we do not understand \nhow the average family lives. But the Roberts amendment is better than \nthe unlimited coverage this Children's Health Insurance Program bill \nwould allow.\n  But the other side does not want to have any amendments. This is a \nfundamental difference we have in how we think about things. They \nbelieve the Government has to be the solution. They will oppose putting \nany income limits on eligibility. They want to allow States to expand \ntheir programs so taxpayers in the bottom half of incomes in America \nare helping to buy health coverage for people in the top half of the \nincome or in my State of Iowa, where the average income is less than \n$50,000, they are going to say Iowans ought to support New York \nfamilies with incomes of $83,000 for a Children's Health Insurance \nProgram in that State. They believe Government has to be a solution to \ncover higher income kids. They believe if the Government does not do \nit, then it will not happen--even though we have about 6 million low-\nincome kids still uninsured in this country; even though States are \ncrying out for the multibillion dollar bailout that is going to be in \nthe stimulus package. They still want to say they will oppose putting \nany limits on this program. It is outrageous.\n  When we are headed toward a Federal budget deficit of $2 trillion or \nmore this year, we need to get a grip on reality. Policies that \nencourage expansions at such high income levels, $83,000 and above, are \ncounter to that effort and are at odds with the fiscal reality and the \ncurrent demands of States.\n  I say that every Member ought to take a look at the Roberts \namendment. It is a commonsense step to make this bill do what the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program was supposed to be doing for the \nlast 12 years, since it was first instituted in 1997--to help low-\nincome kids get the coverage that they would not otherwise have.\n  I support this amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today to offer my strong support \nfor the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram because I have been a longtime advocate. It is so crucial to my \nState, to the Presiding Officer's State, and to the country in terms of \nthe magnitude of the problem it seeks to address with uninsured \nchildren.\n  Before I address the merits of the legislation, I wish to recognize \nthe exceptional leadership of the chairman of our committee, Senator \nBaucus, for bringing us to this point, for a long overdue \nreauthorization. It has been quite a journey over the last few years.\n  I know there have been some differences, ones that have been \nexpressed by the ranking member, Senator Grassley, as we have heard \nhere on the floor, but he has been a constructive voice to bridge the \ndivide and to reach a mutually acceptable agreement on this \nlegislation. So his good-faith efforts always should be saluted.\n  Regrettably, the stakes are monumentally higher than when we first \ntried to pass a reauthorization bill a year and a half ago. Just this \nweek, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that 7.4 \nmillion children were enrolled in the SCHIP program in 2008, which is a \n4 percent increase over the previous year. While part of that increase \nis attributed to state outreach efforts, which should certainly be \npromoted, the fact remains that SCHIP is offsetting the continued \ndeclines we have been experiencing in employer-sponsored coverage. And \nwe cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that a 1 percentage point rise \nin the national unemployment rate boosts Medicaid and SCHIP enrollment \nby 1 million, including 600,000 children.\n  For many working families struggling to obtain health care, if \nbenefits are even accessible to them, the costs continue to rise, \nmoving further out of their reach. In my own State of Maine, a family \nof four can expect to pay $24,000 on the individual market for \ncoverage. For most, taking this path is unrealistic and unworkable.\n  The fact is, SCHIP for years has been a saving grace to millions of \nparents who have had to make wrenching choices when it comes to \nbalancing adequate health insurance coverage with the cost of \nmortgages, heating bills, trying to save for their child's college \neducation, and myriad other financial pressures. While some may \nmistakenly characterize SCHIP coverage as a welfare benefit, they may \nnot realize that nearly 90 percent of uninsured children come from \nfamilies in which at least one parent is working.\n  The anguish of parents who work hard to make ends meet, yet still \ncannot afford to pay for health coverage for their children, is truly \ndevastating indeed. They face decisions no parent should have to \nconfront such as whether their child ``is really sick enough'' to go to \nthe doctor. They worry about their children doing simple, everyday \nactivities such a playing on the playground, riding a bicycle, or \nparticipating in sports, merely because they cannot afford the \nconsequences of a broken arm or a sprained ankle. All too often, their \nonly alternative is to ratchet up their credit card balances, often \nirrespective of mounting debt.\n  And over the past 10 years, Maine has been one of the most aggressive \nstates in the nation in enrolling eligible children. Today, SCHIP \ncovers 15,000 children in Maine. Yet there are 11,000 children who are \neligible and still un-enrolled. That is why a strong reauthorization is \nso critical. The bill before us will maintain health coverage for the \nchildren who are already enrolled and reach nearly 4 million additional \nchildren. It provides $100 million explicitly for outreach efforts. And \nit changes the funding formula to recognize the gains States like Maine \nhave made in successfully enrolling low-income children, while at the \nsame time building in performance incentives for States that have room \nto improve their outreach and enrollment efforts.\n\n  I know many in my caucus will have amendments that condition \neligibility expansions in the program to the ability of States to reach \nnearly all eligible but un-enrolled children. Make no mistake, I share \ntheir goal in trying to reach out to as many children as we can. One \nway is through the ``express lane eligibility'' option which is already \npart of this bill. More than 70 percent of low-income uninsured \nchildren live in families that already receive benefits through Food \nStamps, the National School Lunch Program, or the Special Supplemental \nNutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, WIC. Giving States \nthe option to use Express Lane Eligibility will simplify the way States \ndetermine who is eligible. It will lead to quicker and more meaningful \ncoverage gains.\n  Beyond simply enrolling children in the program, this bill provides \nus an opportunity to emphasize preventive care, so not only are \nchildren covered, but we also improve their care. I am\n\n[[Page S966]]\n\nparticularly heartened that the package recognizes that dental care is \nnot a ``luxury'' benefit, but one that is paramount to the healthy \ndevelopment of children. Under current law, dental coverage is not a \nguaranteed benefit under SCHIP. While all States offer dental coverage \ntoday, the lack of a Federal guarantee for dental care in SCHIP has \nleft children's oral health unstable and unavailable in some States. An \nunstable benefit that a State may offer one year and then drop the next \nthreatens a dentist's ability to see a child regularly and can even \ndiscourage dentists from participating in SCHIP altogether. That is why \nI am pleased that the bill contains a guaranteed dental benefit under \nSCHIP, a policy that Senator Bingaman and I have advocated both in the \nFinance Committee and here on the Senate floor.\n  And even beyond access to a guaranteed benefit, we had an opportunity \nto further meet an unmet need. Today, there are 4.1 million children in \nour country under 200 percent of poverty who have private medical \ncoverage but not dental. That is why I am delighted that the Finance \nCommittee accepted by voice vote the Snowe-Bingaman-Lincoln amendment \nthat builds on a guaranteed dental benefit under SCHIP by giving States \nthe option to provide dental-only coverage to income eligible children.\n  A number of my colleagues have expressed concern about SCHIP crowding \nout private coverage. Our amendment addresses part of that problem. \nAnecdotal evidence suggests that some parents eventually drop employer-\nsponsored coverage for a child in order to access dental coverage \nthrough SCHIP. We give States this option so that working families \nwithout dental coverage have an incentive to maintain private medical \ncoverage, while gaining parity with their peers who are now guaranteed \ndental coverage through SCHIP. It is a win-win situation.\n  All children should have access to comprehensive, age-appropriate, \nquality health care, including dental coverage, whether they are in \npublic coverage or private coverage. Proper dental care is crucial to a \nchild's health and well-being. Yet more than half of all children have \ncavities by age 9, and that number rises to nearly 80 percent of \nteenagers by the time they graduate from high school.\n  And if we required any more reason why we should support better \ncoverage of dental care, consider the heart-breaking story of the late \nDeamonte Driver from Maryland. His tragedy puts an all-too-human face \non the critical need for proper preventive dental care. The cost of \ntreating his brain infection that resulted from an abscessed tooth at \nChildren's National Medical Center 2 years ago was over $250,000, and \ndespite their best efforts, the medical team failed to save his life. \nYet a tooth extraction in a dentist's office would have cost under \n$100. In describing this tragedy, the Washington Post reported that \n``there can't be a more vivid reminder of how shortsighted our system \nis in not fostering access to preventive health care that saves not \nonly money, but lives.''\n  Another accomplishment of this bill is the option for States to \nextend coverage to low-income pregnant women through SCHIP. It is \ninconceivable to me that the most prosperous nation on earth continues \nto lag behind the rest of the developed world in providing quality \nhealth care to expectant mothers. The United States ranks 41st among \n171 countries in the latest U.N. ranking of maternal mortality. Our \ncountry is better than this. That is why Senator Lincoln and I have \nlong been involved in promoting investments in maternal health both in \nthis country and globally.\n  The benefits of covering pregnant women are clear. Women who \nregularly see a physician during pregnancy are less likely to deliver \nprematurely, and are less likely to have other serious medical issues \nrelated to pregnancy. Sometimes, these medical problems can be caught \nearly on and can be addressed before the child is born. Other times, \nknowing about these health issues ensures that the necessary facilities \nwill be available at the time of birth so that the baby has the best \nchances for a healthy start. Without a doubt, coverage of low-income \npregnant women through SCHIP, combined with the development of quality \nmeasures so we know how we can improve, will build stronger, healthier \nfamilies.\n  I also supported Senator Rockefeller's amendment to give States the \noption to provide coverage of legal immigrant children. More than 20 \nStates make this coverage available using their own dollars, and the \nlonger we wait to extend coverage to legal immigrant children and \npregnant women, the more likely they will be in worse health if they \neventually are covered by Medicaid and SCHIP. Allowing States the \noption to extend coverage to new legal immigrants would reduce these \nhealth disparities, as well as address inefficient health care spending \nby ensuring access to preventive care, as opposed to relying on \nexpensive emergency room care.\n  I hope that my colleagues will see the true benefits of this bill and \nsupport it. This bill would allow states to increase SCHIP eligibility \nup to 300 percent of poverty, or $61,950 for a family of four, a boost \nthat represents the right policy in view of the fact that over 8 \nmillion children remain uninsured today in the United States. The data \navailable demonstrate that drawing the eligibility line at 300 percent \nof poverty will help maximize the number of children we help with this \nbill. In Maine alone, for example, approximately three-quarters of \nuninsured children are from families with incomes of 300 percent of \npoverty or below.\n  The bill contains exemptions for State expansions that are already in \nplace or for States that already have a State law allowing an expansion \nin coverage in place today. From the start, States were given \nflexibility in how they could count income. The reason is due to the \nfact that there are strong variations among States in cost of coverage. \nA poverty rate of 200 percent in the New York metropolitan area is very \ndifferent than that same rate in rural regions of the country.\n\n  This bill addresses the concerns over future coverage expansions. \nGoing forward, if a State wants to exclude large blocks of income and \nexpand beyond 300 percent of poverty, they can do so at the regular \nMedicaid match not the enhanced SCHIP match. And to further ensure that \nwe are creating incentives for States to concentrate on the poorest \nchildren before expanding to higher income children, the bill provides \nover $3 billion in bonus incentives for increasing Medicaid enrollment \nof eligible children.\n  And yet, inexplicably, we will hear a chorus of reasons why we should \nnot expand SCHIP. Some will express concerns about the size and cost of \nthe package, which is $32 billion. Given the fact that over 8 million \nchildren in this country are uninsured, I would respond that it is a \nreflection of the magnitude of the problem. Is it any wonder that \nStates have responded to the call of families who are struggling every \nday with the cost of health insurance and are assuming a tremendous \nburden in the absence of Federal action? This bill is a critical first \nstep towards greater health reform.\n  Some of my colleagues will say that SCHIP will crowd out private \ncoverage. Again, parents are choosing SCHIP because their employer \nsponsored coverage is often too expensive if it is even offered at all. \nIn the early days of SCHIP, employers covered about 90 percent of the \ncost of health insurance for employees. Today, it is loser to 73 \npercent. And according to a recent Corporate Executive Board survey, \none-fourth of large employers increased health insurance deductibles by \nan average of 9 percent in 2008, and 30 percent plan to increase \ndeductibles by an average of 14 percent in 2009. This bill is reaching \nout to these families who are struggling with the costs while aligning \nthe incentives for States towards coverage of families below 200 \npercent. And under this bill, 91 percent of children will come from \nfamilies under 200 percent of poverty.\n  Some of my colleagues will argue that SCHIP is the first step toward \nGovernment-run health care. Our 10-year experience thus far with SCHIP \ndemonstrates that this absolutely has not happened. Moreover, these \nclaims ignore the fact that today, 73 percent of the children enrolled \nin Medicaid received most or all of their health care services through \na managed care plan.\n  SCHIP has been the most significant achievement of the Congress over \nthe past decade in legislative efforts to assure access to affordable \nhealth coverage to every American. Compromise\n\n[[Page S967]]\n\non both sides of the aisle helped us create this program 10 years ago, \nand hopefully a renewed sense of bipartisan commitment will help us \nsuccessfully reauthorize this vital program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                       Amendments Nos. 67 and 75\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

That the time until 2:15 p.m. be equally divided between \nthe chairman and ranking member, or their designees; further, that at \n2:15 p.m., the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Cornyn \namendment No. 67; following disposition of the Cornyn amendment, the \nSenate proceed to a vote in relation to the Roberts amendment No. 75; \nfurther, that no amendments be in order to the Cornyn and Roberts \namendments prior to the votes; that there be 2 minutes for debate \nequally divided prior to the second vote; and that the second vote be \nlimited to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 46\n\n(Purpose: To reinstate the crowd out policy agreed to in section 116 of \nH.R. 3963 (CHIPRA II), as agreed to and passed by the House and Senate)\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nbusiness be laid aside for the purpose of my offering amendment No. 46.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 46.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Tuesday, January 27, 2009, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this amendment deals with a problem we have \ndiscussed before, the so-called problem of crowdout. This problem was \ndealt with in the amendment by my colleague Senator McConnell. But the \nSenate did not see fit to adopt that amendment, so I have now offered \nthe amendment to specify that as to this one specific problem, \nhopefully, we can get together and resolve it.\n  First of all, what is ``crowdout''?\n  Put simply, the more individuals you enroll in a Federal health \nprogram such as SCHIP, the more you crowd out or displace from \nemployer-sanctioned or sponsored coverage. In other words, the more \nopportunity there is for the Government program, fewer employers will \noffer insurance to their employees.\n  The Congressional Budget Office actually did a study of this in May \nof 2007, and here are some of the things they said: For every 100 \nchildren who enroll as a result of SCHIP, there is a corresponding \nreduction in private coverage of between 25 and 50 children. So that is \nbetween 25 and 50 percent will leave private insurance to come to \nSCHIP.\n  They said: The potential for SCHIP to displace employer-sponsored \ncoverage is greater than it was for the expansion of Medicaid because \nthe children eligible for SCHIP are from families with higher income \nand greater access to private coverage. Again, that is from CBO.\n  Unfortunately, we have exacerbated this problem because, as I had \nexplained earlier, in the underlying bill we have actually allowed some \nStates to cover families with very high incomes.\n  For example, there is an exception for two States: New Jersey and New \nYork. New Jersey will be allowed to continue covering children from \nfamilies earning as much as $77,175 per year. New York will be allowed \nto cover children from families earning as much as $88,200 per year. \nThat is 400 percent of poverty.\n  Making matters worse, the committee counsel acknowledged that States \ncan exploit a loophole in the current law whereby a State may disregard \nthousands of dollars' worth of income in order to make a child eligible \nfor SCHIP.\n  So you add these numbers together. If we set an income level for New \nYork, for example, of $88,200, and then the State disregards an \nadditional $40,000 worth of income for expenses such as clothing or \ntransportation or the like, then children whose families earn over \n$130,000 would be eligible.\n  Not only, obviously, is that wrong, not only is it unfair for those \nof us who come from States that cover half that number--in other words, \nour citizens would be subsidizing the coverage at twice as much as a \nState such as Arizona provides--but it will also exacerbate the problem \nof crowdout because these are higher income families more likely to \nhave insurance coverage that would then devolve to the SCHIP program.\n  So this is the essence of the problem of crowdout, the problem we are \nseeking to deal with.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator from \nArizona yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I would ask the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arizona, it is my understanding section 116, the anticrowdout \nsection from the previous bill--meaning SCHIP II which passed both the \nHouse and the Senate by big majorities last year, and was recommended \nby some of us as the first bill that should come up this year so we \ncould demonstrate bipartisan support, thinking, of course, the \nanticrowdout legislation would be in it. It is my understanding that \nsection 116 was left out of the SCHIP bill that we are considering \ntoday.\n  Section 116 required that all States submit a State plan amendment \ndetailing how each State will implement best practices to limit \ncrowdout--the very problem the Senator has been talking about. It also \nrequired the Government Accountability Office to issue a report \ndescribing the best practices by States in addressing the issue of \nSCHIP crowdout. Finally, it required the Secretary of HHS to ensure \nthat States which include higher income populations in their SCHIP \nprogram to cover a target rate of low-income children, or these States \nwould not receive any Federal payment. This is the very thing we are \ntalking about here whereby under H.R. 2, two States are allowed to \nexpand eligibility up to 400 percent of poverty--that is $88,200--and \nthen you allow income disregards on top of that--that is a marvelous \nterm: ``income disregard''--which allow you to subtract $10,000 for \nyour car; $10,000 for your house; $10,000 for your food, clothing, \nwhatever; up to $40,000 on top of $88,200--how on Earth am I going to \nexplain to a Kansas taxpayer, an Arizona taxpayer, any taxpayer that \nyou are giving a program intended for low-income kids to children of \npeople earning $128,000?\n\n  At any rate: Section 116 required that states that included these \nhigher income populations in their SCHIP programs cover a target rate \nof low-income children, or these States would not receive any Federal \npayment for such higher income children. That was section 116. What \nhappened to that?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, well, that is exactly the point of my \namendment. The bill the Senator from Kansas voted for last year had \nsection 116 language in it. The Senator is precisely correct about what \nit did. That was not Republican language. That was drafted by the \nchairman of the committee and the leadership in the House, Democratic \nleadership, and supported by Members on both sides of the aisle when \nthat bill passed. But in writing the bill this year, they dropped that \nlanguage.\n  Now, I do not know why they dropped it, but it was dropped. All my \namendment does is to add back that language. I have not changed a comma \nor a period or a semicolon. I took the language they drafted last year, \nin the bill that passed, and reinserted it in this bill.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator from \nArizona yield for another question?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would. If I could ask the Senator from \nTexas, who has one of the pending amendments, if he wants to speak on \nhis amendment, I will yield.\n\n[[Page S968]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, first, I might remind all my colleagues 69 \nSenators voted for the underlying bill, essentially, when it was last \nbefore the Senate in 2007, and that bill did not include the amendments \nthe Senators on the floor are now suggesting; that is, 69 Senators \nvoted for the bill without these two limiting amendments that are being \nsuggested on the floor.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program is clearly helping lower \nincome families. In 2007, 91 percent of children enrolled in CHIP were \nin families living at or below 200 percent of poverty. It is helping \nthose people. The bill also, I might say, with respect to this so-\ncalled issue of crowdout, provides States with bonus payments--\nadditional money--to cover more uninsured low-income kids in Medicaid, \nand those are the kids from the lowest income families. This bill \ntargets low-income people.\n  Also, there are other outreach initiatives designed to encourage \nStates to find low-income kids who are eligible but not enrolled.\n  Now, I must say, it is true in some States kids are eligible in \nfamilies earning more than twice the poverty level. These two \namendments would reduce Federal funding to these States. I think that \nis not a good idea. We should resist efforts to kick kids off the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. That is what those amendments \nwould do.\n  One of the hallmarks of the Children's Health Insurance Program is \ngiving States flexibility in designing their own programs. Remember, \nthis is a block grant program.\n  States have the option to participate. States decide if they want to \nparticipate. I must also say this bill before us takes the more limited \nversion of the two bills that were voted on by very large margins in \nthis body last year with respect to the 300 percent of poverty.\n  What I am getting at is this. If the States want to go above 300 \npercent of poverty, they get the lower match rate. The lower Medicaid \nrate. They do not get the higher Children's Health Insurance Program \nmatch rate. It is a discouragement to those States that, at their own \noption, decide they want to go above 300 percent of poverty.\n  Do not forget the poverty rate is a national figure. It is not the \npoverty rate of one State versus another State. It is a national \nfigure. Some States are healthier States. Some incomes are higher than \nthey are in other States. So it makes sense some States, at their own \noption, might decide they want to cover children above the national \nFederal poverty level. But if they do so, the bill provides a lower \nmatch rate. I must also say, this bill gives States a reduced Federal \nmatch rate along the lines I have indicated.\n  Let me add to that and make one more point. It is a difficulty with \nthe Roberts amendment because it caps the Federal match at families \nwith $65,000 or median State income. What is the problem?\n  First, the amendment uses a flat dollar amount and does not index it \nfor inflation. Obviously, over time, that means the Federal funds would \nhave to be fewer and fewer for families because inflation would cut \ninto the families' ability to participate, as inflation eats away at \nthe value of the dollar.\n  Second, using median State income is an additional problem because \nthe program is directed at helping families who make just a little more \nthan Medicaid levels but not enough to afford private insurance.\n  The Federal poverty level for a family of four is just a little more \nthan $21,000. In many States, the median State income is less than \ntwice the Federal poverty level--less than twice, less than 200 percent \nof the Federal poverty level. Thus, the Roberts amendment would \nconstrain Children's Health Insurance Program funding severely in those \nStates compared with other States.\n  For example, in Mississippi, the median household income is $35,900. \nThat is 170 percent of the Federal poverty level--not 200 percent; it \nis 170 percent. That means we would have to cap the match rates in \nMississippi at lower than 200 percent of poverty; that is, at the 170 \npercent level.\n  In 10 States, the median household income is less than 200 percent of \npoverty. Those States include New Mexico, Montana, Tennessee, Oklahoma, \nAlabama, West Virginia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi.\n  So the effect of the Roberts amendment would be to further constrain \nStates to take kids off CHIP--those kids who are in families at less \nthan 200 percent of poverty. I do not think that is what we want to do, \nbut that is the effect of the Roberts amendment.\n  The policy on low-income kids in the bill is the same policy that was \nin this first Children's Health Insurance bill. The Senate passed that \nbill with 69 votes, including Senator Roberts, I might say, and Senator \nHatch. They both voted for the underlying bill and without these \namendments that have been on the floor. True, that bill was vetoed by \nPresident Bush, and the House was unable to override the veto. But 69 \nSenators voted for these policies that are in this bill, without the \namendments that have been suggested on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom North Carolina be recognized for 1 minute and that then I be \nrecognized for 1 minute following that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  The chairman alluded to the fact that some States need more \nflexibility because the income in their States is higher. One of those \nStates that is grandfathered is the State of New Jersey. It is allowed \nto include up to 350 percent of poverty for SCHIP participants.\n  Now, it is important to understand that when you increase \nflexibility, you decrease the likelihood of people under 200 percent of \npoverty being enrolled. New Jersey ranks 47th out of 50 States in the \nenrollment of kids 100 percent above poverty to 200 percent above \npoverty. Twenty-eight percent of the kids in that category in New \nJersey are uninsured.\n\n  Increase flexibility, decrease the number of enrollees targeted in \nthe 100 to 200 percent of poverty--the uninsured, at-risk, low-income \nchildren. It is very simple.\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 67\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the question I think the American people \nwant to know every time we come to the floor with some legislation is, \nWill it work? Will it work? Well, SCHIP, as laudable as it is, is not \nworking the way Congress intended when we passed it.\n  I came to the floor and mentioned the fact that with 850,000 Medicaid \nand SCHIP-eligible children in Texas, that now the money that will be \nspent on this program will be spent to insure much higher level income \nfamilies as well as adults without focusing on those low-income kids \nfirst. My amendment would redirect those funds to make sure they are \nreserved for covering low-income children or for outreach and \nenrollment activities. I think it is important we put some money into \nthat, to let people know, to educate them that this is available for \ntheir children and then sign them up, rather than the use of those \nfunds to cover children from higher income families.\n  This amendment sends a message that Congress will meet its \nresponsibility of putting first things first by taking care of low-\nincome children.\n  I yield the floor and urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this is very simple. The real question is, Do we want \nto kick kids off of the Children's Health Insurance Program--kids who \nare currently qualified, and qualified because that was a State \ndecision, that was the State option. Most States made that decision for \nthose kids to be included. The Federal poverty level is a national \nfigure, so we cannot apply the Federal poverty level fairly to New York \nor Mississippi or other States because it\n\n[[Page S969]]\n\nis not relevant because the income levels of States are different. It \nis not fair to take kids, in my judgment, off SCHIP. There are also \nprovisions in the States that eliminate childless adults, We do not \nallow waivers. There was a waiver by President Bush that allowed New \nJersey to have that higher level.\n  The bottom line is let's keep the program. It is good. Sixty-nine \nSenators voted for the underlying bill last time.\n  We did it for the right reasons. Let's do it again.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the Cornyn amendment and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

There is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on Roberts amendment No. 75.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, my amendment is very simple, I say to all \nthose milling about. My amendment strikes section 114 of H.R. 2 and \nreplaces it with language that prevents any State from receiving \nFederal SCHIP funds to cover kids from families with incomes which are \nthe lower of $65,000 or the State median income for a family of four.\n  It also addresses the Medicaid-SCHIP sandwich by preventing States \nfrom receiving SCHIP funding or bonus payments for any higher income \nMedicaid kids.\n  We now have States that can cover kids with family incomes up to \n$128,000. I do not think that is right.\n  Let me tell the chairman he is absolutely wrong if he says median \nincome is too low. It is median family income, as determined by the \nSecretary, look at page 2 of my amendment. But how on Earth can we \nexplain to people that we are giving money to a $128,000 income family \nof four when this is supposed to be for low-income kids? You are \nruining SCHIP.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, there are at least 10 States with median \nincomes at such a level that the effect of this amendment would take \nkids off the rolls, even when the parents' incomes are lower than 200 \npercent of poverty. That is because in those States, the median family \nincome is lower than what is prescribed in this amendment. I can list \nthe States. It makes no sense for kids of families who are at lower \nthan 200 percent of poverty to be taken off the Children's Health \nInsurance Program. That is the effect of this amendment.\n  In addition, the amendment denies States the opportunity to set the \nlevels they want. Some States are much more wealthy than other States. \nIt is also an optional program. We also cut the reimbursement rate. \nThat is the match rate for States that are wealthier States.\n  The main point I want to say is, already 91 percent of the kids are \nin families under 200 percent of poverty. The effect of this amendment \nwould take the kids lower than 200 percent of poverty in 10 States off \nthe rolls, and that is not the right thing to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to Roberts amendment No. 75.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 46\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the amendment of the \nSenator from Arizona, amendment No. 46.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this amendment which I laid down before the \nlast two votes deals with the problem of crowdout, the problem CBO \nidentified, that for every 100 children who enroll as a result of \nSCHIP, there is a corresponding reduction in private insurance coverage \nof between 25 and 50 percent. In fact, CBO's number, their estimate, as \na result of people leaving private coverage and going into the \nGovernment program as a result of this bill, is nearly 2.5 million \nindividuals. That is what this amendment seeks to address.\n  The amendment is the identical language in the bill that was written \nby the House majority last year, passed when that bill then came back \nover to the Senate, passed this body, was sent to the President, and he \nvetoed the language. It was not written by Republicans, it was written \nby Democrats, and it attempted to deal with the problem of crowdout. I \nwill describe that after a while. It is not the language I would have \npreferred, but at least it recognizes the problem.\n\n[[Page S970]]\n\n  As a result, I ask my colleagues, what is wrong with the language? \nWhy do we not want to address this problem of crowdout? Since I \nborrowed your language, didn't change a period or a comma, what is \nwrong with including that in this bill?\n  The chairman of the committee noted that 69 percent of the Senators \nvoted for the original bill that did not have the language in it. True. \nBut also, whatever similar number voted for the bill after it passed \nthe House, that did have the language in it.\n  But that is not the important point. The important point is that, \nrecognizing there was a problem, the House, along with the chairman of \nthe committee here in the Senate, wrote the language, put it in the \nbill, yet did not include it in the legislation that is pending before \nus. That is why I have offered this amendment--the same language--to \ntry to deal with this problem.\n  I was told the Senator from Kansas had a question he wanted to ask, \nand I yield for the purpose of a question.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask whether the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arizona will respond to a question?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will be happy to.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I am trying to figure out the practical effect of this. \nYou have already described the fact that this is exactly the same \nlegislation, the same language in the legislation that was passed by \nthis body and the House last year--CHIP I, CHIP II--and then it was \ndeleted. They were talking about crowding out, and that is what happens \nwhen public subsidies encourage people to give up their private \ninsurance.\n  So I am sitting here trying to figure this out. The CBO analysis says \nthat 400,000 children will be covered in higher income families, but \nanother 400,000 children will drop their existing private coverage as a \nresult.\n  I think you had another figure that you just said.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the reason for the disparity is this: CBO \nsays 2.5--2.4, to be exact, 2.4 million people will lose coverage from \ntheir private health insurance as a result of this legislation. For the \nhigher income, it is almost a 1-for-1, and that is the 400,000 number \nthe Senator from Kansas is talking about. Literally, for every person \nwho is added, a person is dropped.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. So the SCHIP legislation ensures one new child for the \ncost of two. That doesn't seem like a very good deal.\n  But here is what I want to get to. Is this correct, in the view of \nthe Senator from Arizona. You are an insurance company--BlueCross \nBlueShield in Kansas, for that matter, Arizona, or John Deere from \nIowa--I know they provide this kind of insurance for low-income \nfamilies. What happens to them when SCHIP expands and crowds them out? \nAnd another thing, I'm assuming that providers get less in terms of \nreimbursement from SCHIP than they do from private insurance. So if I \nam a provider--and this story has been told in Medicaid, it has been \ntold in Medicare, and now it is going to be told in SCHIP--and I get \npaid less, some providers are going to say: Adios. I am sorry, I am not \ngoing to see you.\n  Basically, we had that with Medicare Part D and pharmacists, where \nthey were only reimbursed up to 70 percent, and some of them say: I am \nnot going to do this anymore.\n  Now we are doing it with SCHIP because we are crowding out the \nprivate insurance companies. If you are a private insurance company, if \nyou are John Deere of Iowa, and all of a sudden somebody comes along \nand takes away this number of youngsters from the coverage, how are you \ngoing to exist?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Senator from Kansas makes a very good \npoint. There are cascading effects of this, first, on private insurers, \nwho will not have the people to cover; second, the Senator mentioned \nproviders. Physicians, for example, will get paid a lot less under this \nprogram than they would otherwise. We have seen what happens with \nMedicare when they reduce their reimbursement to physicians. You have a \nlot fewer physicians available to treat the patients, as a result of \nwhich, probably not only will you have the problems I discussed, but \nyou will have a problem with access and quality of care as a result. \nThat is something that had not occurred to me, and I appreciate the \nSenator from Kansas making that additional point.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I had promised the Senator from Michigan I \nwould go no more than 5 minutes, and I would appreciate being advised \nwhen I am at the 5-minute mark.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be advised.\n  Mr. KYL. I appreciate that. My presentation is now going to have to \nbe interrupted yet a third time here.\n  I will describe what the amendment does in precise terms. It calls \nfor various reports and studies and efforts by States to ensure they \nhave a plan for making sure there is a minimum amount of crowdout and \ncalling for the Secretary to determine if a State is doing a good job \nof covering these low-income kids. We can go into more detail about \nthat. Again, it is not language I wrote; it was written by the House \nand Senate Democrats.\n  Why is this important? One of the reasons is that as we keep \nexpanding the people who are entitled to coverage here, why are not the \nlower income kids being covered? There is a very simple explanation. \nThe Senator from North Carolina brought it out earlier: It is easier to \nidentify a higher income cohort of families and cover their kids than \nit is to find the low-income kids.\n  This is the problem with a State such as New Jersey. It is why we \ncover up to 350 percent of poverty there. What they are doing is taking \nthe higher income people. They can find them, they can get them \ncovered, they already have insurance. And as the Senator from Kansas \npointed out, on the higher income families, there is almost a one-to-\none ratio. You add a person on, one person drops off of private health \ninsurance coverage. It is much easier to do that and build up your \nnumbers than it is to do the tough work of finding those low-income \nkids, and that is who this program is supposed to be all about. I \nregret we did not adopt the amendment of the Senator from Kentucky, \nbecause the thrust of his amendment was to find the low-income kids, \nthe kids at 200 percent of poverty or below, and get them into this \ncoverage. That is where we are failing.\n  Instead, under the bill we are considering, we keep adding more and \nmore people at higher incomes. Sure, you can find them, we are covering \nmore kids, but are we covering the kids who need the help? The answer \nis no. That is why this is so important. That is why this crowdout \nissue, in addition to the points the Senator from Kansas pointed out, \nis so important for us to try to resolve.\n  Again, I do not understand why it is not appropriate to include the \nsame language that was in the legislation last year that went to the \nPresident of the United States, because at least it is a modest effort \nto address the problem of crowdout.\n  One more point here. What has happened since this effect has become \napparent to us. Since 1997, 11 States expanded their programs to make \nfamilies at 300 percent of the poverty level or higher eligible for \nSCHIP. That is the problem, that we are going up, rather than finding \nthose kids in the lower income bracket.\n  When Secretary Leavitt tried to do something about that, and on \nAugust 17 of last year issued his crowdout directive to try to cover \nthe low-income kids first, Members of this body objected. I will \npredict that what will happen is that it is likely Secretary Leavitt's \ndirectives are going to be rescinded because what they try to focus on \nare the low-income kids, rather than simply allowing more higher income \nkids to be covered.\n  If that happens, then the entire crowdout issue falls directly in our \nlap. If we do not have language to deal with it, such as that which I \nam proposing in my amendment, then not only will the bill become far \nmore expensive, not only will fewer families be covered by private \ninsurance with the attendant consequences there, but we will still have \nthe problem of the low-income kids who are not covered and who have not \nbeen found.\n  We will be speaking more on this amendment before we have the vote on \nit a little bit later on this afternoon. I will at that time deal with \na couple of other points that I want to make.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n\n[[Page S971]]\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, and the fact that we will be \nadding 4 million children for a total of 10 million American children \nfrom families predominately who are low income, who have parents who \nare working but do not have insurance, and have a very difficult time \ngoing into the private sector and paying very high premiums to try to \nbe able to cover their children.\n  We do not want families choosing between keeping the lights on and \nkeeping the heat on, food on the table, and whether their children can \nget health care. And for too many families in America right now, that \nis what is happening.\n  So I am pleased to be a part of this, to know we have a President who \nwill enthusiastically and quickly sign this bill as one of his first \nactions. I think it will be very exciting to see that, after having \nworked so hard on a bipartisanship basis with colleagues to pass not \nonce but twice children's health insurance, and to have it vetoed by \nthe former President.\n  This is a real opportunity for us. I certainly thank Chairman Baucus \nand his staff for all of the work, and also the work of Senator \nRockefeller and Senator Grassley and Senator Hatch, who are expressing \nconcerns, but there has been a tremendous amount of bipartisan work \nthat has gone on.\n  Frankly, the bill we have in front of us is very much the bill that \nwe worked on together in a bipartisan way and brought to the floor in \nthe past. It was a compromise. There are things that, frankly, if I \nwere doing this by myself, I would want to go back and change if we \nwere not keeping to the bipartisan agreement. We were originally \ntalking about adding more children, a larger pricetag of $50 billion. I \nwould have been very happy to go back to that number.\n  But, again, in agreeing to work within the confines of the bipartisan \nagreement from last session to be able to move it quickly, we did not \ndo that. Also, there are certainly elements relating to low-income \nadults that I would like, coming from Michigan, to revisit. But we have \nnot done that.\n  So I think there has been a tremendous good-faith effort to operate \nwithin the framework of the bill that was passed, worked on by leaders \non both sides of the aisle. We have a wonderful opportunity right now \nto do something very important for the children of Michigan, the \nchildren of Oregon, the children all across this country.\n  There are very important changes from the current program that we are \nadding in this bill, making improvements in outreach and enrollment. \nOur colleagues on the other side of the aisle have talked about \nconcerns about not having enough outreach to low-income children. \nDollars are placed in this bill that would allow more of that to occur. \nI think that is very important.\n  Dental coverage. Mental health coverage. We have all heard the horror \nstories of children who had tooth problems or an abscess turning into a \nsituation that in certain cases has caused death, tremendous tragedies. \nIt is inexcusable that in the United States of America we would have \nchildren who could not get the dental care they needed or the mental \nhealth care they needed.\n  I am very pleased to have worked on the areas of health information \ntechnology where we are adding the ability to pilot a pediatric \nelectronic medical record to make it easier to track children and to be \nable to have a more efficient way to gather the information about \nchildren's health records and to have it available for providers.\n  This bill is a huge step forward in so many areas. The Children's \nHealth Insurance Program has been a success story since its beginning. \nI was pleased as a new House Member from Michigan in 1997 to have voted \nto pass the original Children's Health Insurance Program, and the \ncompanion program with it under Medicaid, which has reduced the number \nof uninsured children by over one-third. I think that is something we \nshould feel very proud about.\n  These gains have occurred even as health care costs have risen, \nskyrocketing in many places, and employer-based coverage has, \nunfortunately, been declining because of the cost. I know in my home \nState of Michigan, the Children's Health Insurance Program and the \npartner program of Medicaid have made a huge difference in people's \nlives, a huge difference in a family's ability to care for their \nchildren, to be able to sleep at night and not worry about what happens \nif their children get sick.\n  Working families in Michigan have been losing their employer-\nsponsored coverage for over a decade now, unfortunately, increasing the \nneed for an expansion of affordable health insurance options for \nchildren. A report recently released from the University of Michigan \nand Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Michigan found that between 2000 and the \nyear 2006, employer-sponsored insurance decreased over 10 percent, \nmeaning that we are talking about families who otherwise had insurance \nthrough their employer and now they do not. They then turned to the \nprivate individual marketplace. It is extremely expensive. And for many \nfamilies, that is not an option. So they have turned to this wonderful \npublic-private program called the Children's Health Insurance Program. \nIn Michigan it is known as MIChild. This is a wonderful partnership \nthat has helped families of working parents, folks who are working \nhard, but who are not poor enough to be able to qualify for health care \nunder Medicaid for low-income individuals. They are not in a job or \nwealthy enough to be able to purchase health care themselves in the \nprivate sector, but they are working. They are working hard every day, \nmaybe one job, maybe two jobs, maybe three jobs. But they do not have \nhealth insurance.\n\n  That is who we are focused on when we talk about the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program. It is not about rich kids, as we have heard \nsome discussion about. In Michigan, a family of four cannot make more \nthan $40,000 a year to qualify for MIChild. Those families are working \nvery hard, and that is not a lot of money to try to hold together a \nfamily of four and pay the mortgage, put food on the table, and then \nfind some way to pay big insurance premiums.\n  Let me share a few stories from families in Michigan who have \ncontacted me. Five-year-old Ryland has a heart condition that causes \nhis heart to race. He had two unsuccessful surgeries for his condition \nwhen the family lived in Canada. When they returned to Michigan, there \nwas no insurance company that would cover Ryland because he had a \npreexisting condition--a very common story for families.\n  Michigan used a portion of its funding to expand what we call Healthy \nKids. Through that program, Ryland was able to receive a successful \nsurgery.\n  Six-year-old Ethan has a serious heart condition called long QT \nsyndrome, which causes seizures and blackouts and makes the heart race \nuntil it stops completely. Ethan had received insurance through his \nfather's employer, but when his father died, his mother did not know \nwhat to do. Luckily, Ethan's mother was able to enroll him in the \nMichigan program MIChild. He was then able to get the care he needed to \nget help for his heart condition early on. It has made a tremendous \ndifference in his life and in his mother's life.\n  This is not only the right thing to do, the moral thing to do; \ntreating illnesses and chronic conditions early also is the economical \nthing to do. I do not want to put it in dollar terms because what is \nmost important is the ability for children to be able to be healthy and \nlive long lives and have opportunities for the future of this great \ncountry. But we all know that if a parent is forced to wait until it is \nan emergency situation and use the emergency room, or worse, in terms \nof waiting until a child is in a very serious illness, we are talking \nabout huge costs. So this is the one time where we save money and save \nlives. We save money and we improve the quality of life for 10 million \nchildren in America through this program.\n  Sharing another story: Chad and his wife have two young children. He \nworks for a small landscaping business with an off-season of 3 to 4 \nmonths. Sometimes the winter can be pretty long in Michigan. If they, \nChad and his wife, purchased insurance through their employer, it would \nbe an additional $300 a month which, unfortunately, was not affordable \nfor them. But through MIChild children's health insurance, both of \ntheir sons were able\n\n[[Page S972]]\n\nto get the inhalers they needed for their asthma. That significantly \nchanged their life, their qualify of life.\n  Pam is a full-time preschool teacher and mother. Her monthly premiums \nof $384 a month would have taken up over 20 percent of her pay. She was \nnot able to do that. Through MIChild she was able to get the \nspecialized care she needed for her youngest daughter, who suffers from \na rare seizure disorder.\n  Pam's story, in particular, illustrates the problems facing working \nfamilies. According to the Commonwealth Fund, nearly three-quarters of \npeople living below 200 percent of poverty found it difficult or \nimpossible to afford coverage. That is what is happening to families \nall across the country.\n  The situation is even worse for individuals with chronic conditions \nsuch as asthma or diabetes. If they are able to purchase coverage in \nthe private individual market--if--then costs are much higher.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues that reauthorizing the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program is about all children--no matter \nwhere they live, whether they live in the city, the suburbs, or in \nrural Michigan or rural America.\n  The nonpartisan Carsey Institute found that in the vast majority of \nStates a higher percentage of rural children live in poverty today than \nthey did 5 years ago. This fact has translated into a higher need for \nhealth care like children's health insurance in rural areas. In fact, \n32 percent of all rural children rely on the Children's Health \nInsurance Program and Medicaid compared to 26 percent of urban \nchildren. So this is something that certainly affects every part of my \nState--from the cities, to northern Michigan, to southwest Michigan, \nand every part of this great country.\n  Because of the importance of the children's health program, I urge my \ncolleagues to put aside negative attacks and join to support a bill \nthat is basically the same bill we worked on together in a bipartisan \nway that we brought to the floor in the last Congress that, \nunfortunately, was vetoed. But we now are in a position, using this \ndocument that was worked on with leaders across the aisle, to do \nsomething about which we can all be very proud. This bill will make a \nreal difference in the lives of children and families across America, \nand it is a great way to start the new year.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise today in support of the Children's Health Insurance Program, \nmore commonly known as CHIP. I believe the expansion we are considering \nright now is long overdue. But I also must express my dismay at the way \nin which we are paying for the expansion in this program.\n  Since 1997, the Children's Health Insurance Program has been helping \nlow-income and disadvantaged children access medical services to treat \nor prevent conditions that can affect their ability to lead a healthy \nand productive life. If this bill is not passed, we will be \njeopardizing coverage for the roughly 10 million young children whom \nthis bill helps, over 4 million of whom are currently without health \ncare. With our economy in dire straits, job losses increasing and job \nopportunities decreasing, and with the rising cost of health care, the \nstaggering thought of 10 million young children without the health care \ncoverage they need is unacceptable to me and to many of my colleagues.\n  For every 1 point rise in our national unemployment--which we have \nseen a lot of to date--700,000 more children join the ranks of the \nuninsured. Importantly, 91 percent of all children covered under CHIP \nlive in families with incomes at or below 200 percent of the Federal \npoverty level. In North Carolina, this would represent $42,000 for a \nfamily of four, with which they would then have to purchase their own \ninsurance without the program.\n  Not passing this bill is simply not an option. But it is important to \nnote, too, that the original CHIP legislation passed almost 12 years \nago by a Republican Congress with the support of a Democratic \nPresident, and it was an extremely bipartisan measure. So, too, was an \nalmost identical bill last year which was passed by two-thirds of the \nSenate and vetoed by the President. This program has widespread \nbipartisan support, and we should not allow differences over particular \nprovisions of this bill to obscure that fact.\n  I commend Chairman Baucus and Senator Rockefeller for the inclusion \nof several important provisions, including providing financial \nincentives for States, including my home State of North Carolina, to \nlower the number of uninsured children by enrolling eligible children \nin CHIP and Medicaid; creating an initiative within the U.S. Department \nof Health and Human Services charged with developing and implementing \nquality measures and improving State reporting of quality data--I think \nover time this data will improve healthy outcomes in our children; \nimplementing initiatives to reduce racial and ethnic health care \ndisparities by improving outreach to our minority populations; and \nprioritizing the coverage of children under this program, not the \nadults without children and others who in the past have been given \nwaivers to participate.\n  But my vigorous support of this program itself does not mean I \napprove of the way this expansion is being funded. I vehemently believe \nthe increase in the tax on cigarettes this bill includes is regressive \nand patently unfair to States such as North Carolina, which employs \nmore than 65,000 people in jobs related directly to the tobacco \nindustry.\n  While 30 percent of the adults earning less than $15,000 are smokers, \nonly 15 percent of adults earning more than $50,000 are smokers. \nThrough the funding mechanism we are putting in place in this bill, the \nresult is this: We are asking for the lowest income households to pay \nfor the health care for children in homes that make more than they do.\n  Under this bill as written, in my home State of North Carolina a \npackage of cigarettes will ultimately cost $4.27, of which more than \nhalf--51 percent--of the price represents Government taxes. \nFurthermore, taxing cigarettes now is shortsighted and an unreliable \nsource of funding for this program.\n  Since fiscal year 1999, the average price of a package of cigarettes \nhas increased by 80.5 percent.\n  If we are going to include this provision on the assumption that \ntaxing cigarettes reduces youth smoking and therefore increases the \nnumber of healthy, productive, and successful children in our country, \nwhy aren't we also taxing sugary soft drinks, junk food, and sweets? \nThe obesity epidemic is so strong in children, yet the only funding \nmechanism right now is cigarettes. All of the above lead to an increase \nin conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure \nin our children, which in turn we know leads to an increase in health \ncare costs.\n  This is a matter of fairness. Taxing only tobacco could cost the \nState of North Carolina up to 3,000 jobs and $32 million to $36 million \nin revenue shortfalls for our State budget. While I applaud the desire \nto pay for the increased spending under this bill, which I think we \nshould be doing, I believe singling out just one industry concentrates \nthe impact in a few States, such as North Carolina, in a way that is \nfundamentally unfair. In 2009 alone, the 61-cent increase we are \nproposing in this bill--61-cent increase in taxes on cigarettes--adds \nup to $3.69 billion, and in 2010 that number increases to $7 billion \nfrom one industry alone.\n  I am a cosponsor of and I would like to voice my support for the \namendment of my colleague, Senator Jim Webb, which would reduce the \nproposed tax on cigarettes by 24 cents. As I have said before, the way \nin which this bill taxes only cigarettes is unfair, and I believe the \nproposed 61-cent increase per package is outrageous. It is my hope this \namendment represents a compromise palatable to all sides in this \ndebate.\n  I have outlined my complete support for this vital program but also \nmy dismay in the way in which it is funded. But this is the bill in \nfront of us, and this is what we are being asked to vote on. When I was \na State senator, I worked hard to protect and expand North Carolina's \nSCHIP. As the mother of three children, I know what it is like when one \nof your kids wakes up in the middle of the night with an earache or a \nstomachache or worse. I have seen firsthand how important this program \nis and the unmet need for its services.\n\n[[Page S973]]\n\n  With the health and vitality of 10 million of our Nation's children \non our hands, I cannot in good faith vote against this bill. Less than \na month into my service here in the Senate, I am faced with a situation \nin which the health of millions of my State's children is at odds with \na key industry in North Carolina. But, ultimately, I have to vote on \nbehalf of the 10 million low-income and disadvantaged children whom \nthis bill helps. In this economy, when families are being forced to \nchoose between paying their bills and putting food on their tables, I \ncannot make it harder for them to keep their children healthy, safe, \nand cared for.\n  I cast this vote in the affirmative as a mother and as a former \nbudget chairman for the State of North Carolina who knows how difficult \nit is for the State to close the gap in funding for this critical \nprogram when the Federal Government drops the ball and as a Senator who \nsees in this bill a chance for our neediest families and our most \ndisadvantaged kids to get ahead in the face of the daunting odds they \nwill no doubt face in their future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from North \nCarolina. She is doing what a good Senator should do. First, she is \ndefending the interests of her State. She is here representing the \nState of North Carolina, and she is doing an excellent job, pointing \nout some of the problems this bill contains for constituents in her \nState of North Carolina. But she also is looking at the larger picture, \ntoo, and the status of low-income children. It is a classic case that \nmany of us face in the Senate. It is balancing interests and what is \nmost important. It is not an easy decision. But I highly compliment the \nSenator from North Carolina for such articulation in expressing the \nviews of constituents in her State and the interests of her State but \nalso recognizing it is probably not right to deprive 10 million \nuninsured, lower income children of health insurance. So I compliment \nthe Senator.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, if it is OK with my colleagues, I would \nlike to give a short statement as in morning business and then give a \nlonger one on the Kyl amendment. Is that OK?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, yes, that would be fine.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, first of all, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for a few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Grassley are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 46\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to speak on Kyl amendment No. 46, \nnamed after Senator Kyl from Arizona.\n  I strongly support the amendment that has been offered by Senator \nKyl. This is to the children's health insurance bill. This amendment \nwould reinstate the crowdout policies that were agreed to by both sides \nin the bipartisan children's health insurance bills that we debated in \nthe Senate in 2007. For reasons that I cannot fathom, this important \nsection of the bill was dropped this year.\n  A high incidence of crowdout is problematic for many reasons. Before \nwe go any further, I wish to make sure it is clear what the term \n``crowdout'' means. Crowdout can have many meanings, in fact, so let me \nelaborate.\n  The crowdout we are referring to is when a family already has health \ncoverage for their child and they cancel that policy to put them on a \ngovernment program. This is referred to as crowdout with the idea that \nwhen the government comes in and offers taxpayers subsidized health \ncoverage, it crowds out the coverage that was already there in the \nfirst place. This is a bad thing when it happens for a number of \nreasons, so I will go into those reasons.\n  First of all, crowdout makes it more difficult for employers to offer \nhealth insurance coverage. It especially impacts small employers who \nmay be unable to meet health plan participation requirements. It has \nimplications for the cost of coverage for those who have private plans \nbecause it removes a large number of young and healthy individuals from \nthe risk pool, thus spreading the cost of high-risk individuals across \nsmaller and, in most cases, older pools.\n  The second reason crowdout is bad is it inappropriately uses \ntaxpayers' dollars to fund coverage that could have been provided by an \nemployer. Individuals either leave coverage that had been funded in \npart by their employer or do not enroll in plans offered and subsidized \nby their employer to enroll in a private plan. When this occurs, the \nemployer contribution to those plans is replaced by taxpayer dollars.\n  So crowdout is bad because it crowds out health coverage that was \nalready there. It means taxpayer-subsidized coverage is gradually \ncreeping in and taking over the market. But it is also bad because it \nis a waste of taxpayers' money. That is what we ought to emphasize \nbecause even though this bill meets a good goal of millions of more \nkids being covered, the question is, are we making the best use of \ntaxpayers' dollars because there are another several million out there \nwe ought to be covering. So when we are incentivizing people leaving \nprivate coverage for taxpayer support, then that money isn't available \nfor the millions of people who aren't being covered.\n  When crowdout happens, it means the Federal taxpayers are being told \nto pay for coverage for someone who already had coverage. If that child \nalready had coverage, then it goes without saying this child was not \nuninsured.\n  Remember the whole problem is when the taxpayers end up paying for \ncoverage that was already there. So the more the children's health \ninsurance programs are allowed to expand to high incomes, the bigger \nthe problem of crowdout becomes.\n  The focus of this bill should be covering the millions of uninsured \nkids we have in America with emphasis on the lower the income, the more \nrationale there probably is for covering kids.\n  Crowdout is also a bigger problem when the children's health \ninsurance programs try to cover higher income kids. It is easy to see \nwhy. Children who live in families with higher incomes are much more \nlikely to have access to private coverage. It means more taxpayer \ndollars being spent on kids who already have coverage, and it means \nfewer dollars to cover the lower income kids who are still uninsured. \nSo it is backwards when this happens.\n  When scarce taxpayer dollars are used to pay for coverage for someone \nwho wasn't uninsured in the first place, this is a complete waste and a \nmismanagement of scarce resources, and it is a waste of scarce Federal \ndollars at a time when we cannot afford to do that. It also means one \nless dollar that could have been used to cover a child who doesn't have \nany health insurance whatsoever.\n  The policies that Members on both sides of the aisle agreed to in \nboth of the bipartisan children's health insurance bills we debated in \n2007 had a very good policy to minimize crowdout. First of all, those \nbills--the similar children's health insurance bills that were debated \nand passed in 2007--had very good policies to minimize this problem we \nrefer to as crowdout. First of all, those bills set out a process in \nplace to study the issue of crowdout. It asked the Government \nAccountability Office to do a report for Congress describing the best \npractices that each of the 50 States are using to address the issue of \ncrowdout and whether things such as geographic variation or family \nincome affects crowdout. The provision eliminated in the bill before \nthe Senate--and this is this year, in 2009--also would require the \nInstitute of Medicine to report on the most accurate, reliable, and \ntimely way to measure the coverage of low-income children and the best \nway to measure crowdout. That provision was eliminated in this bill.\n  Based on these recommendations, the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices was required to develop and publish recommendations regarding \nbest\n\n[[Page S974]]\n\npractices for States to address crowdout. The Secretary was also \nrequired to implement a uniform standard for data collection by States \nto measure and report on health coverage for low-income children and \ncrowdout.\n  The bipartisan crowdout policy of 2 years ago would also require \nStates, having received the recommendations from the Secretary, to \ndescribe how the State was addressing the children's health insurance \nprogram crowdout issue and how the State was incorporating the best \npractices developed by the Secretary. The crowdout policy in both \nbipartisan bills 2 years ago included an enforcement mechanism to hold \nStates accountable for minimizing crowdout when they expand to higher \nincome levels.\n\n  This is a very important issue because as we learned from the 2007 \nreport from the Congressional Budget Office, crowdout is a particularly \nacute problem in children's health insurance programs because crowdout \noccurs more frequently at higher income levels.\n  The Congressional Budget Office report also concludes that:\n\n       In general, expanding the program to children in higher \n     income families is likely to generate more of an offsetting \n     reduction in private coverage than expanding the program to \n     more children in low-income families.\n\n  I wish to emphasize for the public at large--my colleagues know \nthis--the Congressional Budget Office is a nonpartisan, fiscal expert. \nSo this is not a partisan issue of that Congressional Budget Office \nreport.\n  Going on to refer to the Congressional Budget Office, that office \nestimates that:\n\n       The reduction in private coverage among children is between \n     a quarter and a half of the increase in public coverage \n     resulting from SCHIP. In other words, for every 100 children \n     who enroll as a result of SCHIP, there is a corresponding \n     reduction in private coverage of between 25 and 50 children.\n\n  That is the end of the quote from CBO.\n  Therefore, under both bipartisan bills, the Secretary, using the \nimproved data mechanism, would determine if a State that was covering \nchildren over 300 percent of poverty was doing a good job of covering \nlow-income children. That is to emphasize the point: What was the \npurpose of SCHIP in 1997? To cover low-income kids who never had any \ncoverage. So you spend a lot of time covering higher income families, \nand you have less money then to cover low-income kids, and then you \nhave the crowdout that exacerbates that problem.\n  If it was determined that a State was not doing a good job covering \nlow-income children, then the State will not be able to receive Federal \npayments for children over 300 percent of poverty. So here there is \nkind of a sense that we are not arguing if you want to cover people \nabove 300 percent, but, by golly, as a State, you aren't doing a good \njob of taking care of the low-income kids--where the problem was and \nwhy we passed the bill in the first place. You shouldn't be covering \npeople over 300 percent of poverty.\n  This crowdout policy in both bipartisan bills of 2007 would have \nworked to minimize crowdout by making sure the States are staying \nfocused on covering low-income kids. So it is a very important issue, \nand it is one on which we worked together on a bipartisan basis.\n  There was a lot of debate about crowdout in 2007 when we had \nextensive discussions about the Children's Health Insurance Program. \nEverybody recognized this to be a very big problem. So this is why I am \nso entirely baffled as to why my Democratic colleagues would abandon a \nprovision they helped develop in a bipartisan bill 2 years ago. I don't \nknow why they would want to strike such an important part of the bill \nand one that also helps blunt sharp criticism of the bill when it \nallowed States to expand eligibility to 300 percent of poverty.\n  The bill before us now allows expansion to even higher and higher \nincome kids.\n  As the Congressional Budget Office says, the crowdout problem is \ngoing to be even worse under this bill than it is already.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office table detailing \nestimates of enrollment based on this bill, 2.4 million children will \nforgo private coverage for public coverage. This is a very troubling \nnumber. The fact that the Senate bill does not address this problem and \ngoes back on policies that were worked out on a bipartisan basis is \nproblematic.\n  I hope Members will reevaluate their opposition to policies to reduce \ncrowdout and to vote in support of the amendment I have been talking \nabout that my colleague, Senator Kyl from Arizona, has offered.\n  We need to do the right thing here. We need to keep the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program focused where it first started out in 1997 on \nlower income kids, for sure, in the case of a handful of States \ncovering more adults than they do even kids.\n  We need to prevent scarce taxpayer funds from being used to pay for \nkids who already have health coverage. We need to put this bipartisan \npolicy that we had in two bills in 2007 back in this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Kyl amendment and do just that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The senior Senator from \nMontana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, the Children's Health Insurance Program \nReauthorization Act of 2009 will extend the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram to cover more than 4 million additional children whose parents \nwork but cannot afford insurance on their own.\n  These low-income working families make too much to qualify for \nMedicaid, but they cannot afford private insurance. Ninety-one percent \nof the children covered by the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram live in families making less than twice the poverty level.\n  Let me repeat that. Ninety-one percent of the children covered by \nthis program live in families making less than twice the poverty level. \nThat is not very much. These are the working poor. Ninety-one percent \nof the kids covered by this program live in families who are working \npoor. Let's not make perfect the enemy of good. Ninety-one percent is \npretty good. It is not 100 percent. It is 91 percent. That is pretty \ngood.\n  I know some of my colleagues are concerned that this bill will cause \nindividuals to drop their private coverage in order to join the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. Around here that is called \ncrowdout; that is, leaving private health insurance coverage to move \nover to the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  The fact is that any attempt to reduce the number of uninsured will \ninevitably result in some level of substitution of existing coverage. \nIt just happens. The Medicaid Program--not many, but some families who \nmay have had private insurance, as expensive as it is, decided Medicaid \nis a little bit better, and they chose Medicaid. As with every public \nprogram, it happens.\n  The next question is, what do we do to minimize too much of it? What \nis the right policy? Where do we draw the line?\n  Clearly, we want kids to have health insurance. We want it done in an \nefficient way, a way that makes sense that is good public policy but \nnot do it in a way that disrupts the private health insurance market. \nBut there is going to be some reduction in private coverage when kids \nleave the private health insurance market to go to CHIP.\n  Why would a family want to do that? I can think of several. One is \nthe private coverage is not very good. The premiums are very high. The \nbenefits are pretty low. It is not good. It costs a lot, particularly \nwhen we are talking about low-income families. It may not cost quite as \nmuch, it may not be quite as much of a burden on someone making \n$45,000, but it is going to be a big burden on somebody making $20,000 \n$30,000, $40,000, $50,000. They have to pay the food bills, make the \nmortgage payments. They have a car payment. You name it. It is \nexpensive to also pay for private health insurance on top of all that.\n  I can very much understand some people--we are talking about low-\nincome families now--think it makes more sense to maybe try not to pay \nthose health insurance premiums but, rather, go on the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program.\n  Let's remember, SCHIP is optional. It is up to the States. States can \nset the levels they want. That is their\n\n[[Page S975]]\n\nprivilege. That is their option. This is not an entitlement program. \nSome people think this is an entitlement program. It is not. It is a \nblock grant program. What does that mean? That means every several \nyears, Congress reauthorizes the program, allocates a certain amount of \ndollars, and distributes them through a formula to the States, and it \nends after a certain period of time. This is a 4\\1/2\\-year \nauthorization. If you want to participate in this program, you have to \nset up your own match rates. Uncle Sam will give you more than half of \nit, but you have to come up with your own match rates. If they want to \nset income eligibility levels a little higher because they are a State \nwith higher income than other States, that is their privilege, that is \nwhat they should do, that is the State's option. It makes sense to me \nthat we should formulate policy to try to draw a line that is fair--\nfair to States, fair to kids.\n  This legislation also recognizes the problem--if it is a problem--of \nkids leaving private coverage to go to the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. What do we do? A couple things. One, we make bonus payments to \nStates that focus more on low-income kids. If you have a program in \nyour State and you show you are putting out an extra effort to help \nlow-income kids, you get a bonus. That is very good because that means \nwith lower income people, there is less likely going to be this so-\ncalled crowdout.\n  We also give premium assistance. What is that? We tell States, you \ncan take some of your money and help people pay their private health \ninsurance premiums so they stay on private insurance instead of moving \nover to the Children's Health Insurance Program. So this bill \nrecognizes the issue that some say is extremely important, namely, we \ngive States the option to provide dollars for premium assistance, that \nis dollars to families to help them pay their health insurance \npremiums. That is only fair.\n  This is complicated. We are a big country. We have different States \nwith different income levels. And we are a Federal system. We have \nUncle Sam and we have States. It is very complicated. It is our job to \ntry to find a way to put it all together in a way that is fair and \nmakes sense.\n  The bottom line is what is fair and makes sense is give a little \npriority to the kids. Let's find some way to help low-income kids in \nthe country, as we are still trying to be sensitive to concerns of \nStates and concerns of the private health insurance industry.\n  I believe it makes eminent sense for us to not adopt the amendment \noffered by the good Senator from Arizona. What does that do? That \namendment basically tells States to try to affirmatively find ways to \nrestrict coverage which will have the effect of kids not getting off \nprivate health insurance. Do all the things you can to prevent kids \nfrom getting off private health insurance. That tilts the balance way \ntoo far. It tilts away from the kids. The goal here is kids. We want \nkids to get the best health insurance possible.\n  What this comes down to is the need for health reform in this \ncountry. We need to reform our health system. When we do, when we \naddress the 46 million, 47 million Americans who do not have health \ninsurance and find ways to make health insurance work for people, then \nthis so-called issue will not be such because people will have the \nability to go to the Children's Health Insurance Program or private \nhealth insurance that works.\n  Our legislation, if we pass it, will include health reform so the \nindividual market makes sense, so there is no discrimination in the \nindividual market, so the insurance company cannot discriminate on the \nbasis of health, history, age, and other bases which health insurance \ncompanies now utilize to drive up premium costs for people trying to \nbuy into the individual market. That was a guaranteed issue. That is \nthe goal we are striving for, and the insurance companies know that \nmakes sense.\n  I have talked with many of their CEOs. They want to move down that \nroad. They know it is right. Even though it will change their business \nmodel, a model from cherry-picking to one of guaranteed issue, they \nwill have more volume, they will make it up because everybody will have \nhealth insurance. They will sell more health insurance policies and \ngive subsidies to people who cannot afford health insurance. That is \npart of the plan. We are not quite there yet. We have a ways to go. \nThen this will not be the issue that is raised today, and even today I \nthink it is a bit of a red herring. I don't think that is what is going \non here. What is going on here is some people do not want--I hate to \nput it this way--do not want to use Government funds to give low-income \nkids health insurance. That is basically what is going on here. I do \nnot want to overstate that point, but I think it is obvious.\n  Bottom line, I think the amendment should be defeated. Sixty-nine \nSenators have already voted for this legislation, which did not include \nthis amendment. Sixty-nine Senators in 2007 voted for this very same \nChildren's Health Insurance Program which did not include this \namendment. If they could vote for it and it did not include this \namendment, I would think those who are here could vote for it again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I don't know if we are going back and \nforth. I know Senator Murkowski is here. I have about 5 or 6 minutes.\n  I rise in support of the legislation before us to renew and improve \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program. I begin by commending Chairman \nBaucus for his work on this legislation, not just this year, but so \nmany years before. We brought this bill to the floor in 2007. We have \nhad successful votes, a tribute to the chairman's leadership. I know at \nthe same time he is working on the stimulus package, which is \ncritically important to our economy. I personally thank him and commend \nhim for all his efforts.\n  This bill is virtually identical to the legislation that I previously \nvoted for on two occasions. Indeed, I voted, along with a large \nbipartisan majority, for this legislation in 2007. So I am hopeful \nCongress will act swiftly in a bipartisan manner to present this bill \nto President Obama for his signature. Uninsured children have already \nwaited for that moment for far too long.\n  This bill invests $32.8 billion to extend and expand CHIP through \nfiscal year 2013. According to the Congressional Budget Office, it will \npreserve coverage for 6.7 million children and expand coverage to an \nadditional 4.1 million uninsured children. In addition, the bill \nfacilitates enrollment and improves benefits by requiring dental \ncoverage and mental health parity.\n  For my State of Rhode Island, this bill is absolutely critical \nbecause it would end the persistent funding shortfalls that have \nrequired 11th hour stopgap measures. Over the years, I have been able \nto secure $77 million in additional funding to cover these shortfalls, \nbut these efforts at the very last minute are not something that can be \nsustained indefinitely.\n  This bill allocates funding based on actual spending and provides a \ncontingency fund for shortfalls. As a result, Rhode Island's allotment, \nthe amount of Federal funding available for the State to draw down, \nwill increase from $13.2 million to $69.5 million. This is the highest \npercentage increase of any State. This will preserve coverage for about \n12,500 children enrolled in RIte Care, which is our Children's Health \nInsurance Program, and allow the State to expand SCHIP coverage.\n  With the current economic crisis, this bill could not be more timely. \nAs parents lose their jobs, they and their children will lose their \nhealth coverage. Nationwide, the rise in unemployment has caused 1.6 \nmillion children to lose employer-based health insurance. In Rhode \nIsland, the unemployment rate is now in double digits at 10 percent. \nBehind this number are real families who are struggling to pay their \nmedical bills and whose children may be forced to forgo doctor visits, \nmedicines, and immunizations they need to lead healthy, productive \nlives.\n  Recently, Rhode Island was forced to make the very difficult choice \nof dropping coverage for 1,300 children who are legally here because \nthere was no Federal match. For many years, the State had provided \ncoverage for these children using State funds alone. This bill could \nresult in expanded coverage by providing Federal funds for these \nchildren who are legally here within the United States.\n  It also includes important provisions to increase enrollment of \npeople who\n\n[[Page S976]]\n\nare eligible for both the CHIP funding and Medicaid funding. The bill \nallows States to use Social Security numbers to verify citizenship, \nprovides grants to States for outreach activities, and provides bonus \npayments for the cost of increased enrollment in Medicaid.\n  However, I must point out, Rhode Island may not be able to fully \nbenefit from these latest provisions as they relate to Medicaid. In the \nwaning hours of the Bush administration, the State agreed to an \nunprecedented cap on total spending. The cap is based on projections \nthat do not factor in potential increases in Medicaid enrollment \nresulting from this legislation. As a result, the cap could prevent the \nState from taking up the option to cover legal immigrant children and \npregnant women and could discourage the State from renewing its \noutreach efforts, even though these were longstanding policies in the \nState prior to the economic downturn. I have strong concerns about the \ncap because there are too many unknowns about how it would interact \nwith both this bill and other efforts to expand Medicaid coverage.\n  States are struggling to grapple with rising health care costs, \nenrollment is increasing, and indeed the Federal Government, \nbusinesses, and families are also burdened by rising costs and the \nabsence of any discernible health care system. It is clear there can be \nno economic recovery in the long term unless we at last confront the \ncritical challenge of comprehensive health reform. The time has come to \nguarantee affordable, quality health care to all Americans. This bill \nis an important step forward and a downpayment on this effort.\n  Let me finally emphasize how critical this bill is to the children's \nhealth care program. It will dramatically increase the share that Rhode \nIsland is entitled to and it will prevent the eleventh-hour scramble to \nfund shortfalls in the State. On the Medicaid side, I hope the State is \nable to use these additional authorities to enroll more children who \ncould, in fact, receive help from this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am speaking on the floor about this \nvery important issue of how we provide for the best coverage, the \nmaximum coverage, for the rising number of Americans without health \ninsurance because we all recognize this is a problem. According to the \nmost recent data, 47 million Americans today are not receiving proper \nmedical care, so CHIP comes in--the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram.\n  This program has been an exceptionally important means of providing \nthe most vulnerable of our population--our children--with health care. \nAnd we all know that when our children are sick, it is not just the \nchild who is impacted, it is the whole family--it is the parent who \nmisses time from work to care for their child because they don't want \nto take their child to school for fear that the bug will spread. So the \nsocial and economic impact of a sick child goes well beyond the need \nfor cough syrups and bandaids, and the impact in my State of Alaska is \nfelt even greater within our Native communities.\n  I think it is fair to say SCHIP has always been a bipartisan bill. \nSince its inception back in 1977, with the then Republican-controlled \nSenate, working with Democrats in Congress and a Democratic \nadministration, we were able to ensure that the poorest of our children \nhave access to health insurance. Since then, we have seen continued \nsuccess with this program, with Republicans, Democrats, and \nIndependents alike rejoicing in a health care bill that has broad \nbipartisan support and that has been able to effectively cover our \npoorest children.\n  I supported both of the CHIP bills that passed in 2007. It expanded \nthe SCHIP eligibility to 300 percent of the Federal poverty level--the \nFPL--which is $66,600 for a family of four. But I will\n\n[[Page S977]]\n\ntell you I think the bill we have in front of us is not even close to \nwhat we passed in 2007. And quite frankly, I am not sure why a bill \nthat enjoyed such broad bipartisan support was gutted and filled with \nprovisions which, as we have seen on the floor today and yesterday, \nhave been pretty controversial. I am perplexed that the decision has \nbeen made to go in a different direction than the direction we took \nwhen we overwhelmingly passed this legislation before.\n  There are some provisions, particularly with regard to ensuring that \nour lowest income children are covered first, that have made this bill \ndifficult for some to support, even for some of those Senators who \nspearheaded the SCHIP bills in the past. So I would like to offer an \namendment that I believe will improve this bill in a significant way \nand will reassure many of us who are concerned about how we ensure that \nthe lowest income children will be covered.\n  I am offering an amendment to the CHIP bill that has been cosponsored \nby Senator Specter, Senator Johanns, and Senator Collins. Senator \nSpecter, Senator Collins and myself were all on the previous SCHIP \nbills. Senator Johanns, of course, is new to the Senate but a former \nGovernor.\n  Let me describe it quickly, briefly, because this is a pretty simple \namendment. You might say it sounds pretty similar to what we had before \nus in the past, and you would be correct. The amendment includes three \nbasic principles that I believe are essential to the continued success \nof the CHIP program.\n  First of all, it says we need to know and we need to have published \ninformation on how States are addressing the best practices for \ninsuring low-income children--those children from families who are \nearning less than 200 percent of the Federal poverty level.\n  So let's figure it out. We want to know, we need to publish it, we \nneed to accumulate the data, as to what States are doing to make sure \nthey are covering the poorest children. When we know what it is that \nother States are doing to be successful, let's share that with other \nStates so they, too, can use similar types of approaches to make sure \nwe are not losing any of these children through the cracks; that we are \nnot overlooking them. Let's share these best practices.\n  The second piece of this amendment says we also need to know and have \npublished information on what factors are attributing to kids over 200 \npercent of FPL that are enrolling in their State CHIP. Of course, this \ngoes back to the crowdout issue that has been discussed a great deal on \nthe floor this afternoon. What is it? What are the factors? Let's know \nand understand what it is that would be causing those families who may \nhave private insurance--what is causing the push then to enroll in \ntheir State's CHIP. Again, let's try to understand better what is going \non.\n  I can't imagine there is anything controversial with either the first \nor second part of this amendment.\n  The third part of the amendment says that if a State wants to exceed \n300 percent of the Federal poverty level for CHIP, they will have the \nflexibility in working with the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto ensure that the State first demonstrates an enrollment of at least \n80 percent of the children below 200 percent of FPL. So we are saying: \nOK, if you want to go above 300 percent, you are certainly able to do \nso, but please first demonstrate to us that you have covered 80 percent \nof your children who are below 200 percent of the Federal poverty \nlevel.\n  Now, we had some target language out here earlier, and there was \nactually target language in both CHIP I and CHIP II. This standard, if \nyou will, of 80 percent, is a much less rigorous and, quite honestly, a \nmuch more obtainable standard. If you look through the list of States, \nthere are various FPLs for each State and then what their percentages \nare in terms of how many of their children they are enrolling. I think, \nif you look to the State of Michigan, you are at 200 percent of FPL. In \nyour State, you are doing actually very well in terms of enrolling your \nchildren. You are about 90 percent. So you are in pretty good shape.\n  So for purposes of what I am laying out here, the State of Michigan \nis absolutely unaffected. You can move forward. You don't have any \nconcern because you have done the job of insuring at least 80 percent. \nIn fact, you have gone to 90 percent.\n  So this is a target we are setting that I believe is reasonable and \nachievable and workable. So what we are asking, again, is if you are \ngoing to exceed 300 percent of FPL--if Michigan wanted to go above 300 \npercent, you could because you have demonstrated that you have covered \nat least 80 percent of your children below the 200-percent Federal \npoverty level. If you haven't, then no Federal payment match will be \nmade for those individuals over 300 percent FPL, unless and until the \nSecretary establishes that the State is in compliance with these \nregulations in an amount of time not to exceed 12 months. Again, if you \nare a State that has already established you have covered that target \nrate of 80 percent of your kids, you could go above the 300 percent \nlevel.\n  My amendment is pretty straightforward. It allows the Secretary to \nensure that what we have is a built-in safeguard--a safeguard measure--\nfor at least 80 percent of the poorest of our children to be enrolled \nin SCHIP or a Medicaid expansion program before children from higher \nincome families--those earning above 300 percent--are enrolled. This \namendment provides flexibility to the States in working with the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to ensure that we are protecting \nour poorest kids by insuring them before we expand to higher income \npopulations.\n  I submit this is a very reasonable provision. Part of the components \nof this amendment we have seen in CHIP I and CHIP II, which a broad \nbipartisan group of Senators voted to back. I think it is reasonable, I \nthink it would be a good improvement to this bill, and I think it would \nhelp to allay some of the concerns that we are not working first to \naddress the enrollment of at least 80 percent of our more needy \nchildren.\n  With that, I would certainly encourage my colleagues to look \ncarefully at my amendment, I ask for their support, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, there is not a time agreement, so I \ndon't have to yield, but as a courtesy, as chairman, I yield for the \nSenator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Montana and \ncongratulate him for his leadership on this very important piece of \nlegislation.\n  I come to the floor to offer my strong support for the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program reauthorization. This is legislation that has \ncome out of the Finance Committee which Senator Baucus chairs. It will \nensure that 13 million American children will either maintain health \ncare coverage or receive that coverage for the first time.\n  We worked very hard in the committee to develop the best bill we \ncould. It is a major step forward for our Nation. As many Americans \nface grave economic uncertainty, it is critical we move quickly to pass \nthis legislation and send it to President Obama for his signature.\n  The State Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, represents a \npartnership between the States and the Federal Government. It works by \nproviding States with an annual allotment at an enhanced matching rate \nfor health care coverage for low-income residents. Since CHIP was \ncreated in 1997, it has been extremely successful. In fact, despite the \nfact that private coverage has eroded significantly since CHIP was \ncreated, many health care experts believe this program is the primary \nreason the percent of low-income children in the United States without \nhealth coverage has fallen by about a third during that same period.\n  CHIP is particularly important to my home State of New Mexico. The \npeople in New Mexico have a very difficult time acquiring health \ninsurance. We remain the second most uninsured State in the Nation. \nCurrently, more than 30,000 New Mexicans depend on CHIP for their \nhealth coverage. Under this legislation, my State would receive $196 \nmillion for CHIP this year. This represents a 277-percent increase over \nthe State's current CHIP allotment. This represents the fourth largest \npercentage increase of any State in the country.\n  With this additional funding, tens of millions of additional low-\nincome New\n\n[[Page S978]]\n\nMexico children--and adults--would have access to health care for the \nfirst time. This legislation also corrects an inequity in the Federal \nlaw that, despite our very high uninsurance rate which we have in New \nMexico, this inequity has prevented New Mexico from covering many of \nour children through Medicaid. It has required our State to return more \nthan $180 million to the Federal Government since 1997.\n  The bill also includes modest improvements to requirements that have \nmade it very difficult for New Mexicans to prove they are in fact \nAmerican citizens and, therefore, eligible for Medicaid. The State \nestimates that approximately 10,000 New Mexico children who are \ncurrently U.S. citizens have been denied health insurance because of \nthese requirements. I have offered an amendment to make further \nimprovement in this provision to ensure that U.S. citizens are not \ninappropriately denied the health insurance to which they are entitled.\n  I am glad to report that the legislation also includes a provision I \nhave championed for many years that will allow States to automatically \nenroll children in CHIP if they have already been deemed eligible for \nanother public program with comparable income standards, such as the \nNational School Lunch Program or the Food Stamp Program. This provision \nis often referred to as ``express lane,'' and it would help States use \ntechnology to cut through the bureaucracy that all too often prevents \nAmericans from receiving health benefits. Health experts tell us that \nexpress lane is one of the most important ways we have to reduce the \nnumber of uninsured Americans.\n  I also offered an amendment to clarify several of the express lane \nprovisions in the bill. It is my hope that can be accepted as well.\n  The bill contains many other provisions that are important to me, \nsuch as a mandate to provide dental coverage for children receiving \nCHIP benefits, as well as a wrap provision, which I proposed during the \ncommittee markup, to allow children with private coverage who do not \nreceive dental benefits to receive such benefits through CHIP.\n  The legislation also includes very significant improvements in the \nability of States to perform outreach enrollment to Native American \npopulations, as well as providing outreach funding to Promotoras and \nother community health workers. These people play a critical role in my \nState and throughout the country in reaching some of the most isolated \npopulations.\n  Finally, the bill also protects the provision of mental health \nservices to children.\n  As I mentioned earlier, I have worked hard on this bill, as have many \nof my colleagues. It is critical we move swiftly to get this to the \nPresident for his signature. Given the urgency we face, I am surprised \nby some of the opposition that has been expressed by my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle. As I read this legislation, it is very \nsimilar to the bills that were strongly supported by both Democrats and \nRepublicans in the 110th Congress. These bills passed with a \nfilibuster-proof majority here in the Senate. Provisions in the bill \nbefore us today regarding income eligibility, regarding adult coverage, \nand the other issues being raised, remain more or less the same as in \nthe bills that were strongly supported by Republicans in the last \nCongress. In fact, the most significant difference between the bill we \nare now considering and the bill we passed last year is the addition of \na State option to remove the current 5-year ban for health care \ncoverage for legal immigrant children and pregnant women. I hope the \noptional coverage for legal immigrants is not so objectionable to some \nof my colleagues that they would walk away from the millions upon \nmillions of American children who receive care through this program.\n  Americans are struggling and our economy is in a very serious \nsituation. The bill before us is urgently needed by many in this \ncountry. I hope my colleagues will support this important bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 58\n\n   (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a \n    revenue source through the treatment of income of partners for \n performing investment management services as ordinary income received \n  for performance of services and reduce accordingly the tobacco tax \n                     increase as a revenue source)\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 58.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Webb] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 58.\n\n  Mr. WEBB. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Tuesday, January 27, 2009, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I offered this amendment yesterday first \nby saying, and I would reiterate today, that I firmly support the \nlegislation that is before us. I have a great sense of appreciation for \nthe Senator from Montana for all the work he and his staff have done to \nbring this legislation to the floor. I offer this amendment in an \nattempt to resolve what I believe are two issues of fundamental \nfairness. They go to how this program is going to be paid for.\n  The first is that the offset being used right now, the 61-cent-per-\npack increase on cigarette tax, I believe--as does the Senator from \nNorth Carolina, as well as other Members I have discussed this issue \nwith on the floor--that this is unfairly singling out one industry that \nhas already been heavily taxed. Right now, tobacco is federally taxed \nat 39 cents per pack for this program and all 50 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia also impose an excise tax on top of that tax. In \nVirginia that is a 30-cent tax on top of it. Our States, which are also \nundergoing a lot of difficulty in their economies, are considering \nraising that tax as well.\n  My grandmother used to say you can't get blood out of a turnip. I \nthink we are about at the point with this particular industry, that we \nare getting as much out of it as possible, in a way that is inequitable \nto the industry--and not just to the industry but, as I mentioned \nyesterday, according to the Congressional Research Service, cigarette \ntaxes are especially likely to violate horizontal equity. They are \namong the most burdensome taxes on lower income individuals, and so we \nhave something of an anomaly here where we are levying a tax on a large \nproportion of people who are economically challenged in order to \nassist, with this CHIP program, others who are economically challenged. \nThat to me seems a little bit anomalous.\n  The second issue of fundamental fairness, the ``pay for'' that I \nproposed in this amendment, is to tax carried interest, which is \ncompensation based on a percentage of the profits that hedge fund \nmanagers make. My legislation would tax their compensation as ordinary \nearned income rather than the capital gains tax they presently pay.\n  This idea is not my own. President Obama campaigned in favor of \nchanging the carried interest tax rates during his campaign. Yesterday \nI read from a variety of editorials of major newspapers. I will not go \nthrough those in detail, but the Washington Post in a masthead \neditorial 2 years ago said:\n\n       This is a make or break issue for Democrats. If they can't \n     unite around this issue then they aren't real Democrats.\n\n  The New York Times, in a masthead editorial, said:\n\n       Congress will achieve a significant victory for fairness \n     and for fiscal responsibility if it ends the breaks that are \n     skewing the Tax Code in favor of our most advantaged \n     Americans.\n\n  USA Today and the Philadelphia Inquirer had masthead editorials. Even \nthe Financial Times, which is a conservative newspaper, editorialized:\n\n       This repair should be done at once.\n\n  That was 2 years ago.\n  In my view, taking this particular tax break, which characterizes \nearned income and calls it a capital gains with a much reduced tax, is \nan imbalance in our system. I am all for people making money. The \nAmerican system is founded on entrepreneurship. But I am also for \npeople paying their fair share.\n  I proposed this amendment that would provide partial relief from the \ncigarette tax. I still believe it would be\n\n[[Page S979]]\n\na good amendment, but I also can count votes and I do not think this \namendment has a chance of passing, frankly. I know the Senator from \nMontana has questions about it. I would appreciate very much if the \nSenator from Montana could tell me his hesitation on this so we might \nwork it out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, first, I strongly commend and applaud \nthe Senator from Virginia. He is doing what all good Senators do. He is \nrepresenting his State. He is quite concerned about the 61-cents-per-\npack tobacco tax to be levied, additional tax to be levied on \ncigarettes. Certainly his State has a big interest, as do several other \nState. I commend the Senator for what he is doing.\n  However, I must point out that this same provision passed this body \ntwice before. It passed the House of Representatives twice before--both \nbodies--with large margins. It is, I think, understood by those who \nsupport the Children's Health Insurance Program that this is the proper \nway to pay for that program.\n  The alternative method of financing which the Senator recommends is \none which I think many Members of this body, including myself, believe \nshould be addressed. Those editorials to which the Senator referred \nhave more than a grain of truth in them. Carried interest is something \nthat must be dealt with and I think it will be dealt with in the \ncontext of tax reform later this year or next year. But clearly we will \nhave tax legislation this year. We have to have tax legislation this \nyear because of the expiration of certain very important provisions.\n  Add it all together, I commend the Senator but say to the Senator I \ndo not think this is the proper time and place to bring up a very \nimportant issue, namely carried interest. But there soon will be a time \nthat we will take up that very important issue. The Senator has my \nassurance that I look at it extremely seriously. I have spoken about \nthis publicly, by the way, as have many others. But like a lot of \nissues, there is a time and place for everything and this is not the \nproper time and place but soon it will be. I commend the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                       Amendment No. 58 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. WEBB. I appreciate the Senator's comments. Again, I would like to \nemphasize my respect for the leadership that he has shown in our caucus \non all of these issues. I would also say, in my view, in terms of the \ntobacco industry, this is a Virginia issue, but in terms of both of \nthese issues I believe they are larger issues of equity.\n  I have a concern for people across the country on both of those \nissues, but I do take the Senator's point. There is a time and place \nfor everything. I would like to have seen the pay-for on this bill \nmitigated in terms of people who use cigarettes. I am a reformed \nsmoker, like a lot of people in this body. I do not encourage people to \nsmoke. But it is a legal activity, and there are certain protections \nthat all businesses deserve.\n  At the same time, I do take the Senator's point. I appreciate his \ncomments and his earlier remarks about the issue of carried interest. \nKeeping strongly in mind that we need to bring this legislation to a \nprompt conclusion, I withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I want to correct the Record. Not long \nago I misspoke. I said a moment ago the substance of the Kyl amendment \nwas not in the two previous children's health insurance measures that \npassed this body.\n  I was incorrect. The substance of the Kyl amendment was in the two \nbills to which I was referring. Why was the substance of the Kyl \namendment in those two bills? Very simply because they were a response \nto the directive of President Bush on August 17. What was that, the \nAugust 17 directive? It basically was a directive by the President to \nStates to develop policies to make it very difficult for people to \nleave private health insurance to move into the Children's Health \nInsurance Program.\n  That was Draconian. Frankly, it was so Draconian that we in the \nCongress adopted the substance of the Kyl amendment to moderate that \ndirective because the directive was so Draconian. Well, times have \nchanged. We have a new President now; there is not going to be an \nAugust 17 directive. It certainly will not be enforced. So there is no \nneed for the so-called section 116 provision to which the Kyl amendment \nis referring.\n  So even though I misspoke; it was in those bills, I still firmly \nbelieve because of the new election, a new President, the August 17 \ndirective will not be enforced, that we do not need that moderating \nlanguage in the prior bill.\n  Accordingly, I will still vote for the underlying legislation.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I rise in strong support of the SCHIP legislation. I \nfind it amazing that we have spent so much time debating it. This SCHIP \nlegislation would help more than 4 million children in this country get \nthe health insurance they desperately need. But I should point out it \nleaves approximately 3 million kids still uninsured.\n  As you well know, the United States of America remains the only major \ncountry in the industrialized world where this debate would take place. \nWe are spending weeks discussing an issue which every other country in \nthe industrialized world has long resolved.\n  So if we pass this piece of legislation tomorrow, and I hope we will, \n3 million kids still remain without health insurance. The common sense \nof insuring children is apparent to everybody because when kids are \ninsured, when parents are allowed to bring their children to a doctor, \nwhen kids have access to medical care in a school, professionals can \npick up the medical problems kids have so 10 years later they do not \nend up in a hospital with a serious illness and we spend hundreds of \nthousands of dollars trying to cure a child whose problems could have \nbeen detected when they were little.\n  This really is a no-brainer. Clearly, what we must do as a nation is \nmove to a national health care program guaranteeing health care to all \nof our people, but a step forward will be passing this SCHIP \nlegislation.\n  I think the American people are more than aware that our health care \nsystem is substantially broken. They understand not only do 46 million \nAmericans have no health insurance, they understand even more are \nunderinsured. They understand the absurdity of tying health care to \njobs because when we lose our jobs, then we lose our health care.\n  I hear some of my friends saying: Oh, the American people do not want \ngovernment health care. Well, you know what. Read the polls.\n  The American people do believe the U.S. Government should take the \nresponsibility of providing health care to every man, woman, and child, \nand I hope as soon as possible we, in fact, do that. But not only do we \nhave 46 million Americans, including many children--and that issue we \nare trying to deal with right now--who have no health insurance, what \nwe are also doing, because of the waste and inefficiency in our current \nsystem, is we end up spending far more per capita on health care than \nthe people of any other country.\n  I know the Presiding Officer is more than aware that General Motors \nspends more, for example, on health care than they do on steel in \nbuilding automobiles. What kind of sense is that? So I hope, at a \ncertain point--and I hope soon--we as a nation end up finally saying \nhealth care is a right of all people. The absurdity that one child in \nthis country does not have health insurance is an international \nembarrassment. Let's go forward, and let's develop the most cost-\neffective way we can provide health care to all our people.\n  Now, here is the irony: that even if tomorrow we guaranteed health \ncare to all our children, even if the next day we guaranteed health \ncare to all our people, do you know what. That does not mean people are \ngoing to be able to find doctors or dentists. Our infrastructure, \nespecially in primary care, is in\n\n[[Page S980]]\n\nsuch a bad condition that we need to revolutionize primary health care \nin America.\n  We just had a hearing, chaired by Senator Harkin, who has been very \nactive in the whole issue of preventative care in the HELP Committee. \nThis is unbelievable. We had a physician who is a professor of medicine \nat Harvard Medical School, in a State where presumably they have \nuniversal health care, and she cannot find a primary health care \nphysician. A professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School cannot \nfind a primary health care physician. That is how absurd this situation \nis.\n  We have over 50 million Americans today who do not have regular \naccess to a physician. We have many more who cannot find a dentist. \nMeanwhile, if we were not depleting the medical infrastructure of Third \nWorld countries, bringing in doctors and dentists from those countries, \nour entire primary health care system would be in even worse shape than \nit is right now.\n\n\n                        Community Health Centers\n\n  Madam President, I do wish to say a word about legislation we will be \nintroducing next week--I am proud to tell you we have 15 original \ncosponsors; I hope we will have more in the next few days--which \nessentially begins to address the crisis in primary health care by \nsignificantly expanding a program Senator Kennedy developed in the \n1960s which has widespread support--not just from Democrats but from \nRepublicans, not just from President Obama, who was a cosponsor of \nsimilar type legislation last year, but from Senator McCain, who talked \nabout community health centers during his campaign; and President Bush \nwas very supportive of the concept.\n  So we have widespread support, and now is the time to go forward and \nsay we will have a federally qualified community health center in every \nunderserved area in America. By expanding the number of FQCHCs from \nabout 1,100 to 4,800, at the end of the day, by providing primary \nhealth care, dental care, mental health counseling, and low-cost \nprescription drugs, do you know what we do. We save money. We save \nsubstantial sums of money because we keep patients out of the emergency \nroom, we keep patients out of the hospital because we are treating \ntheir illnesses at an early stage rather than allowing them to become \nill and then spending huge sums of money when they end up in the \nhospital.\n  I am very proud we have Senator Kennedy as a cosponsor, and Senators \nDurbin, Harkin, Schumer, Kerry, Boxer, Inouye, Leahy, Mikulski, Casey, \nCardin, Brown, Begich, Burris, and Wyden. I hope we will have more \ncosponsors.\n  This is legislation we can pass. This is legislation which has \nhistorically had bipartisan support because we all know primary health \ncare--giving people access to doctors, dentists, low-cost prescription \ndrugs--is the way to not only keep people healthy, it is the way to \nsave billions and billions of dollars.\n  Let me conclude by saying I hope very much we support this SCHIP \nlegislation. It will save us money by enabling kids to get to the \ndoctor before their problems become much more acute. It is the right \nthing to do, and it is the beginning of the United States trying to \njoin the rest of the industrialized world in saying health care must be \na right of all people--all people--rather than a privilege of just the \nfew.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN.

RECONCILIATION AND RECOVERY OF ALL SERVICE-\n                   CONCLUDED MEDICARE FEE-FOR-SERVICE DISEASE \n                   MANAGEMENT PROGRAM FUNDING.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services shall provide for the immediate \n     reconciliation and recovery of all service-concluded Medicare \n     fee-for-service disease management program funding.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this amendment would accomplish two \nimportant health care goals. It would correct a mistake in Medicare \npayments to five hospitals in my State. It would correct mistakes that \njeopardize access to critical health care. It would correct mistakes \nthat threaten the jobs of nurses and other hospital personnel in areas \nof Ohio that absolutely cannot afford more job loss. It would correct \nmistakes that hamstring hospitals that should and must provide quality \nhealth care but are receiving payments that reflect their costs.\n  My amendment would also enhance the ability of a NIH-designated \ncomprehensive cancer center in my State to offer hope to patients who \nare fighting the most serious and deadly forms of cancer.\n  Eleven cancer hospitals across the country already receive \nreimbursement from Medicare that reflects the costs of treating \npatients who have exhausted standard treatments and who are battling \nagainst steep odds to beat cancer.\n  These cancer hospitals deliver hope and results. They advance cancer \nresearch. They establish protocols for addressing the most aggressive \nforms of cancer.\n  The nonprofit University Hospitals system in Cleveland, OH, has \ninvested in establishing a 12th cancer facility of the same caliber of \nthose who today receive special reimbursement from Medicare.\n  The Ireland Cancer Center is already NIH designated, and, as I said, \nit is being expanded and enhanced to maximize its ability to contribute \nto the well-being of cancer patients and to the science of cancer care.\n  My amendment would ensure that the Ireland Cancer Center can fulfill \nits mission and promote the public health. I know the amendment I am \noffering will not only benefit Ohio and Ohioans, it will benefit our \nNation's health care system and our Nation's efforts to combat cancer.\n  My amendment is fully paid for. In fact, it is more than paid for. \nLet me explain how it would be financed. There have been more than a \nhalf a dozen programs testing disease management programming and, to \ndate, there have been very few successful outcomes. The fact that not \nonly have these results not borne fruit but that, amazingly, the \nprogram participants are still drawing a benefit from the fees they \ncharged was neither the Congress's nor the agency's intent when \npromulgating these initiatives.\n  The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services estimates that the \nGovernment is owed more than $750 million from these programs--$750 \nmillion--and, in fact, the most recently concluded program, the \nMedicare Health Support Program, has an outstanding price tag of more \nthan $80 million due to the program participants' failure to meet the \nstatutory savings and quality performance targets.\n  The bottom line is this: There are Medicare contractors who did not \nmeet performance goals. They are holding onto taxpayer dollars instead \nof returning those dollars to the Federal Government. That is how my \namendment is paid for, and it is paid for and then some.\n  Instead of paying for cancer care, we are letting private contractors \nearn interest on dollars they should never have had in the first place. \nThat is simply ridiculous. My amendment would recoup these tax dollars \nto the great benefit of the public health. I ask my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to support it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana, the chairman of the \ncommittee, is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the amendment of the good Senator from \nOhio would do two things. It would allow five hospitals to receive \ngeographic reclassifications for the purpose of receiving higher \nMedicare reimbursements; and, second, it would provide a prospective \npayment service exemption to a cancer facility, which would make the \nhospital eligible for extra Medicare reimbursement.\n  While I am sympathetic with the problems the Senator alludes to with \nrespect to, as I understand it, six facilities in his State of Ohio, \nthe fact is, these are so-called rifle shots. This is going to affect \nthe reclassification of five hospitals and change the reimbursement \nsystem for one other.\n  I would like to help out, but I must tell my good friend from Ohio, \nthere are over 50 other requests from other Senators for \nreclassifications in their home States. If we accept this, Katy bar the \ndoor. I can tell the Senator from Ohio, I am thinking of one Senator \nright now who talks to me constantly--constantly--about the \nreclassification of hospitals in his home State, and there are many \nothers.\n  The classification issue in this country is nuts. It is how we pay \nhospitals based upon--GPCI is the common phrase of what it is called in \nother formulas for hospitals. And it does not make a lot of sense. It \nis disparate. It is confusing. It is a mixture. It is not a fair way to \nreimburse hospitals. So we will be taking this up in health care reform \nlegislation later on this year. And we have to. That is the proper time \nand place to deal with it.\n  The same is also true for reclassification of cancer hospitals. That, \ntoo, must be taken up. This Congress, frankly, is not competent to \ndecide which hospitals receive which reimbursements. There are so many \nhospitals in this country that it is getting to the point where we are, \nas Members of the Senate, asked to decide what the proper reimbursement \nrate should be for individual hospitals. That is just hospitals. Think \nof all the other individual, separate medical reimbursement questions \nwe are asked to make. We are not competent as Senators to make that \ndecision.\n  It is too complicated, and it is getting worse every year--worse \nevery year--because Senators and House Members, appropriately \nrepresenting their States and their congressional districts, come to \nthe committees of jurisdiction and say: Do this for our State, do this \nfor me, and so forth, as they appropriately should. But this has been \ngoing on for year after year after year after year, and it is getting \nmore and more and more complicated. It is out of hand, and it is just \none reason why our health care system in this country is in such \ndisarray.\n  We do not have a health care system in this country. It is a \nconglomeration, it is kind of a hodgepodge of individual providers, \npatients, different groups, medical equipment manufacturers--kind of a \nfree market atmosphere--just asking for help for themselves, and they \ncome to Congress saying: Do this for me because I am not being treated \nfairly.\n  So I say to my good friend from Ohio, there is a proper time and \nplace to do this to address geographic reclassifications. However, this \nis not the time. Once we start going down this road on this bill, it is \nKaty bar the door. That is another reason we shouldn't go down this \nroad because we didn't pass this children's health insurance \nlegislation pronto, right away, with the House, and get it to the \nPresident's desk. The President very much wants us to get this \nlegislation passed very quickly.\n\n  I say to my good friend from Ohio if we start going down this road \nand adopting amendments to reclassify hospitals in one State, virtually \nevery other Senator is going to come up here and say, What about my \nState? You have to do it for me too. Then it is going to open up doors \neven more.\n  I urge us all to refrain from going down that road right now. Let's \nnot allow any of these--there are no rifleshots at this bill. None. \nThese are rifleshots. There are none in this bill, with the exception \nof a couple hospitals in Tennessee that were included in the last \nchildren's health insurance bill 3 years ago. It was a commitment I \nmade to those two Senators from that State that they would be in this \nbill too. That is the only commitment I have made. A deal is a deal. I \ntold them back then we would do it for various reasons, but other than \nthat, there are no rifleshots in this bill and I think it would be \nwrong to include more and go down this road of reclassification.\n  I urge the Senator to either withdraw his amendment or I will urge \nSenators not to vote for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n[[Page S982]]\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee and I appreciate his candor. I do plan to ask unanimous \nconsent to withdraw the amendment. We both want to see this children's \nhealth insurance program pass quickly. We wish to pass it today; we \nhope we can pass it tomorrow for sure and get it to the President. It \nwill have strong bipartisan support as it did last time when President \nBush vetoed it. We know President Obama will sign it. I want to get it \nto him as quickly as possible. I ask Senator Baucus on the wage index \nissue and on the cancer hospital, if we could work together in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Absolutely. I make that commitment to the Senator, \nbecause he makes a good point. There are a lot of hospitals in similar \nsituations.\n  Mr. BROWN. As I said, this hospital in Cleveland is NIH approved, so \nit should be near the front of the line when we do fix this in the \nfuture.\n\n\n                       Amendment No. 79 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw amendment No. 79.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:30 p.m., \nthe Senate resume consideration of the Kyl amendment No. 46; that the \nSenate then proceed to a vote in relation to the Kyl amendment, with no \nintervening action or debate; that upon disposition of the Kyl \namendment, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Murkowski \namendment No. 77; that there be no amendments in order to the Kyl or \nMurkowski amendments prior to the votes; and that there be 2 minutes of \ndebate equally divided between the two votes.\n  I amend that to say the balance of the time between now and 5:30 to \nbe equally divided and then 2 minutes for the Murkowski amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 46\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, that leaves about 6 minutes. What I wish to \ndo is speak for about 3 minutes and then reserve the balance of my time \nand then close out the debate, if that would be all right.\n  Mr. President, again, to remind my colleagues, this amendment is \ndesigned to deal with the problem of crowdout, which the Congressional \nBudget Office says will affect 25 to 50 percent of the people on SCHIP. \nIn fact, about 2.4 million people would leave private health insurance \ncoverage and go to the public coverage of SCHIP. There are a lot of \nproblems with that, as we have discussed before.\n  The main argument I have heard is that the amendment I have offered \nhere would affirmatively restrict coverage and get kids off the rolls. \nThere are two answers to that. No, it wouldn't. In fact, it has exactly \nthe opposite effect; it would ensure coverage. Secondly, it is not my \nlanguage. This is language that was written by House and Senate \nDemocrats. Every single Democrat--in fact, every single Republican who \nvoted for this legislation last year that the President vetoed has \nalready voted for the precise language of my amendment. I didn't change \na word. I simply took the language the chairman and others in the House \nhad drafted to deal with the crowdout and put it into this bill.\n  It is actually very minimal language. The official description we \nhave is as follows: Provisions to prevent crowdout. It removes section \n116--the underlying bill removes section 116 from the bill that was \npassed last year. That section required that all States submit a State \nplan detailing how each State will implement best practices to limit \ncrowdout. It requires the GAO to issue a report describing the best \npractices and requires the Secretary of HHS to ensure that States which \ninclude higher income populations in their SCHIP programs cover a \ntarget rate of low-income children. In other words, as I said, ensuring \ncoverage rather than restricting coverage.\n  So the bottom line is it is the same language that was developed by \nthe Democrats in the House and the chairman last year. Every person who \nvoted for the bill last year has voted for this. There is nothing wrong \nwith it. I wish it would go further. But I think we have to acknowledge \nthat this is a very real problem. One of the reasons it is a real \nproblem is because, unfortunately, some of the States are adding more \nand more higher income kids. Now, we understand why: because it is \neasier to find them and cover them, and that is why the State of the \nPresiding Officer, for example, covers kids up to 400 percent of \npoverty. It is easier to find those populations. The tough kids to find \nand get involved in the program are the very low income, at the poverty \nlevel, or 200 percent of poverty. That is what we should be striving to \ncover.\n  What our amendment does is to simply ensure that as many of the kids \nwho have private insurance as possible aren't going to lose their \nprivate insurance, thus encouraging coverage of higher and higher \nincome kids.\n  Let me reserve the last 3 minutes of my time to see if there is \nanything else I think I need to respond to.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is the same \nlanguage they have all already voted for. It certainly is not going to \ndo any harm, and I think it could do a lot of good.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I oppose the Kyl amendment. Senator Kyl \nhas mentioned that the provision which includes the substance of his \namendment was in the prior two bills, in the 2007 bills, and he is \ncorrect. The Senator is correct. I voted for those, as did many other \nSenators. However, the circumstances were different back then. That was \nin response to what is called President Bush's August 17 directive. \nThat August 17 directive, in my judgment, was a Draconian effort by \nStates to essentially, in effect, not let children leave private health \ninsurance for the Children's Health Insurance Program. So Congress, as \na response to that directive, enacted this section we are talking about \nhere, section 116. However, that directive was never put in place. We \nhave a new President who is certainly not going to issue a similar \ndirective, which makes the legislation we put in earlier--legislation \nto moderate the August 17 directive--not necessary.\n  So that is why I think it makes sense to vote for the bill, but not \nput this unnecessary language back in. It is unnecessary because the \nAugust 17 directive is no longer operable.\n  Let me also say a few words about the Murkowski amendment, which is \nthe second amendment we will be voting on. The Murkowski amendment \nwould take Federal funding away for kids above 300 percent of the \nFederal poverty level if the State cannot prove that at least 80 \npercent of the kids below 200 percent of poverty are covered. States \ncannot be held accountable for things beyond their control.\n\n  This amendment would make States responsible for things such as the \nprivate insurance market, the percent of employers offering health \ncoverage, and the overall economy--matters which are beyond the control \nof States. These factors and others contribute to the level of \nuninsured kids. States should be encouraged to cover as many low-income \nkids as possible, not penalized for doing so. This amendment draws an \narbitrary line between 200 percent and 300 percent of poverty. I don't \nthink that makes sense.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program was started as a joint \npartnership between States and the Federal Government--a joint \npartnership. We want to continue this partnership, not limit State \nflexibility, as was the intent of the original CHIP legislation. That \nis the hallmark of the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  The Murkowski amendment might sound reasonable, but the truth is that \nit jeopardizes health care for kids. Setting arbitrary targets for \nStates to meet is unfair, it is inappropriate, in a program designed to \nhelp kids--not discourage kids but to help kids--and to get them to the \ndoctor visits and the medicines they need.\n  I urge Members to vote against both the Kyl amendment, which will be \nthe next vote, and the Murkowski amendment, which will be the \nsubsequent vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wonder if the chairman would respond to a \nquestion. I am not certain I understood the point with regard to \nSecretary Leavitt's August 17 directive.\n\n[[Page S983]]\n\n  Do I understand that the chairman supports the policy directive of \nAugust 17 dealing with crowdout?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. On the contrary, just the opposite. I do not support it. \nI did not support it.\n  Mr. KYL. That is what I assumed was the case. Of course, the August \n17 directive was designed to try to deal with the problem we are \ntalking about. It is quite likely that directive is not going to exist, \nwhich is precisely the reason for the kind of language that we need to \nhave in this bill that is the Kyl amendment.\n  The whole point is that without something, either the directive such \nas Secretary Leavitt issued, or the language that is in the Kyl \namendment, you are not going to have any Federal directive with respect \nto States ensuring that the crowdout effect is kept to an absolute \nlimit. That is exactly why we need to do it. Circumstances are no \ndifferent than they were 6 months or so ago with respect to the problem \nof crowdout, except that the problem is getting much worse because we \nkeep adding more and more higher income kids.\n  As the CBO said, and as the Senator from Kansas noted before, CBO \nestimates that with regard to the higher income kids, it is about a \none-for-one ratio. For every one that you add, you take one away from \nprivate health care. That is not something we should be fostering. I \ndon't think any of us intends that result. The only people who would \nintend that result are those who want to wipe out private health \ninsurance coverage and get everybody on government health care. That is \nwhere this is taking us. If that is the real motivation of people, \nwell, at least I can understand it, and this legislation certainly \nwould carry us in that direction. But I haven't heard too many people \nwho are willing to admit that that is what they are trying to do, and I \ndon't think that is what the chairman of the committee is trying to do.\n  So there needs to be something to deal with the problem of crowdout. \nIf it is not going to be the directive of Secretary Leavitt, then it \nhas to be the language prepared by the House and Senate Democrats when \nthey passed the bill last year that President Bush vetoed. That \nlanguage is not strong enough, in my view, but at least it does require \na study of best practices and it requires the States to show whether \nthey are putting those best practices into effect.\n  The final provision with respect to that is that with respect to two \nStates and two States only, were they not to do that, they would--there \nwould be a limit on the States of New York and New Jersey as a result \nof the requirement of the best State practice. The higher income \nStates--and there are two--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an additional \n15 minutes equally divided be allocated on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate that. I certainly wouldn't need \nthe half of 15 minutes, but I certainly appreciate that, at least to \nfinish my thought, if not another couple of minutes.\n  The language that was written last year and that would be in my \namendment is that in the higher income States, the low-income kids must \nbe covered at a rate equal to the top 10 States, and if a higher income \nState fails the test, then it wouldn't receive the payment only for \nthose higher income kids.\n  So there is no difference between all of the other States and even \nNew York and New Jersey with respect to the lower income kids, but the \nincentive here is obviously not just to cherry pick the higher income \nkids but to try to make sure you are covering the lower income kids \ntoo.\n  To conclude my comment, either you go with something such as \nSecretary Leavitt proposed--and I don't think that with the new \nadministration that is going to remain on the books--or you are going \nto have to have something such as the language that was prepared by my \nDemocratic colleagues last year which at least minimally deals with the \nproblem of crowdout by identifying the best practices and ensuring that \nthe States at least have some kind of a plan to apply those best \npractices to prevent this huge problem of crowdout.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, without prolonging this debate, very \nsimply this comes down to whether you support the policy of President \nBush's so-called August 17 directive.\n  The amendment in question is kind of a watered-down version of that \nAugust 17 directive. That directive basically discouraged States from \nproviding children's health insurance availability to kids of moderate \nincome. That is what the August 17 directive did. It discouraged States \nfrom, at their own discretion, a State option, providing children's \nhealth insurance coverage for kids who are above 200 percent poverty \nand a little higher, which has a tendency to mean those families would \nnot have private health insurance but would have insurance under CHIP.\n  It is simple: If you are for discouraging kids going to the CHIP, \nmiddle-income people--actually, lower than middle income--vote for the \nKyl amendment because that basically is a watered-down version of the \nAugust 17 directive. If you are for the August 17 directive, you are \nprobably for the amendment. If you are not for the August 17 directive, \nyou are not for the Kyl amendment.\n  I oppose the amendment. I think most are opposed to it. We should not \nvote for it. I don't mean to disparage the Senator, but it is a \nwatered-down version of the August 17 directive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I find this argument curious because the \nchairman of the committee made the point that the language he and \nothers drafted was in response to the August 17 directive of Secretary \nLeavitt. This was their answer to it. They did not like it, so they \nsaid: We don't like that directive, we are going to propose some \nlanguage that is going to solve the problem. It is going to solve it \nhis way, not our way. That is the Kyl language. It is the identical \nlanguage they wrote last year in response to the Leavitt directive. \nThat is the point. They did not like the Leavitt directive, so they \nwrote this language.\n  The Leavitt directive is going to be history, I suspect, in short \norder. They wrote this language because they knew there had to be \nsomething to deal with the problem of crowdout. They could not support \nthe Leavitt directive, so they wrote their language.\n  I am the one who called it watered down. I will take authorship of \nthat phrase. It is watered down from what I would have done is what I \nmeant by that phrase. I am not speaking of it in pejorative terms. I \nwould have done much more. But my Democratic colleagues, in response to \nthe Leavitt directive, said: We don't like that; we are going to write \nsomething that is better. And that is what they wrote.\n  They knew there had to be something in here dealing with crowdout. \nAll I am saying, since the Leavitt directive is likely to be history \nsoon, No. 1, and No. 2, we do need to do something about crowdout, and \nNo. 3, there isn't any other language they have been willing to adopt, \nsurely language they already voted for that they wrote would be OK.\n  So anybody who voted for the bill last year, you are flipping. By not \nvoting for this amendment, you are saying: I guess I was wrong then, \nbut I don't see how that could be, given the fact this was specifically \ndesigned for the purpose the chairman identified.\n  I will close with this point. Everybody knows it is a problem. It is \nreal. CBO has identified it. I don't think anybody doubts the problem \nof crowdout. You either do something about it or not, and I am doing \nthe least thing about it by taking the language proposed by Democrats \nlast year, passed by Democrats last year, and I don't know why the \nlanguage now, this year, all of a sudden is not any good. What is wrong \nwith the language? That question has never been answered. What is wrong \nwith the crowdout language that was written last year and passed last \nyear? We have to address the problem somehow. This is the least way to \ndo it, in my view.\n  I urge my colleagues, think about this and think about what you will \nbe\n\n[[Page S984]]\n\nvoting against if you fail to support the Kyl amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Kyl amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, very simply, what is wrong with this \namendment? What is wrong is we don't know the consequences, what it \nwill do to States. It may have consequences we have not anticipated. \nTherefore, I think it is not proper.\n  Second, without belaboring the point, the provision we discussed here \nwas placed in legislation to counteract the August 17 directive. The \nAugust 17 directive is now going to be withdrawn; therefore, there is \nno need for this amendment. That is another reason this amendment is \nnot needed. The August 17 directive is going to be withdrawn totally. \nThat legislation was put in place to moderate the August 17 directive. \nIf there is no August 17 directive, there is no need to moderate; \ntherefore, we don't need the amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent--unless the Senator wants to say something--\nthat a quorum call be placed until a quarter of the hour.\n  Mr. KYL. If I can conclude with a quick point, to the extent we do \nnot use time, we can have it run equally. If that would be part of the \nunanimous consent request, I would support that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this is a useful exchange because the \nchairman has now made the point that the language of the Kyl amendment \nwas written in response to Secretary Leavitt's attempt to deal with the \nproblem of crowdout.\n  Again, everybody realizes the problem is real. Something should be \ndone about it. Secretary Leavitt did something about it. Most of my \nDemocratic colleagues did not like that, so they wrote the language of \nthe Kyl amendment to respond to that directive.\n  The Leavitt language is probably soon going to be history because of \nthe new administration. So the chairman of the committee is, in effect, \nsaying now that because that no longer exists, the Kyl language, the \nlanguage he supported before is not needed because we do not have to \ntop the Leavitt language. But, of course, what that means is there \nwould be no language dealing with crowdout.\n  I thought almost everybody agreed that it is a real problem and needs \nto be dealt with and that States should be engaging in the best \npractices to deal with it. That is all this amendment does, is to \nrequire that the best practices be identified and that they apply those \nbest practices to deal with it. It is not much, but it is something, \nand if the Kyl amendment is not adopted and nothing is done in \nconference, then there is nothing. There is no Leavitt directive, there \nis no crowdout language in this legislation. There is nothing to deal \nwith the problem that everybody acknowledges exists. The mere fact that \nit was written in response to the Leavitt language and that the Leavitt \nlanguage is no longer going to be extant is an argument for the \nlanguage, not against it.\n  Perhaps the amendment would have done better if I had identified the \nDemocratic leadership in the House who actually drafted it, and instead \nof calling it the Kyl amendment, I would call it the amendment of the \nDemocratic colleague in the House who drafted the language. Don't take \nthe fact that it now has that name to mean it cannot be any good.\n  I say to my colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle, this is \nsomething they supported before. It was a good idea then and a better \nidea now given there is not going to be an administration directive to \ndeal with the problem and something has to be done to deal with the \nproblem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the answer to this is to deal with it in \nhealth care reform. Nobody knows the degree to which this is an issue. \nThere is a lot of talk about this issue, especially from the other \nside. We don't know for sure what the dynamics are that cause or do not \ncause. We don't know what the consequences are. We don't know how much \nthis really is a problem, frankly. That is why we should have health \ncare reform legislation.\n  This country does not have a health care system really, just a \nhodgepodge of different people doing different things. Clearly, we want \na solution that is a combination of private insurance as well as public \ninsurance, a uniquely American solution that is a combination of public \ninsurance and private insurance.\n  There is a very strong role for private health insurance in this \ncountry. In fact, the private health insurance industry wants health \ncare reform. When they start to insure 46 million, 47 million Americans \nwho do not have health insurance, it is an opportunity for them. They \nalso want to engage us in insurance reform. They will have to change \ntheir business model, but they do agree the time has come to guarantee \nissue. That is a fancy word saying anybody who applies for health \ninsurance is guaranteed to get it, and there is no discrimination on \npreexisting conditions, no discrimination based on medical history, no \ndiscrimination based on age.\n  There is a lot we need to do in this country to get meaningful health \ncare reform so everybody has health insurance, all Americans have \nhealth insurance, and also so costs are brought down.\n  I remind my colleagues, we pay twice as much per capita on health \ncare in this country than the next most expensive country. If we keep \ngoing down the road we have been going down--that is, not addressing \ncomprehensively health care in this country--then that trend will \ncontinue to get worse and worse. That is a cost not just to families \nand individuals who pay so much more, but it is also a cost to our \ncompanies that have to pay so much more for health care than companies \nin other countries. Third, it is a big cost to our State and Federal \nbudgets. Their budgets are so high because health care costs in this \ncountry are so high.\n  Although this is more than an interesting question, we really do not \nknow the answer to it. We are addressing it by this amendment in a \npiecemeal way. That is what is the whole problem with what we have been \ndoing for the last 15, 23 years in this country.\n  I do not mean to be critical of the Senator from Arizona and \ndisparage what he is doing. If we come back with different Senators and \ndifferent amendments to address another health care issue, it is like a \nbig balloon: push it here and it pops up someplace else. We don't look \nat it comprehensively. I think the proper place to look, the place to \ndraw the line between public coverage and private coverage is in the \ncontext of national health care reform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, that is a good point. I certainly concur with \nthe chairman that we need to do national health care reform. But that \nis not an argument not to deal with crowdout in the very bill that is \ngoing to deal with crowdout and in the very bill that we dealt with \ncrowdout last year. In other words, the language of the Kyl amendment \nis the language that was put in the bill last year. It was not put in \ncomprehensive health care reform. It was put in the SCHIP bill because \nit is in the SCHIP bill that the problem of crowdout occurs.\n  The chairman notes that we do not know exactly how big the problem \nis, but CBO has given a good estimate. It provides that an Institute of \nMedicine study would describe the best way to measure crowdout. That \nhas to be submitted 18 months after enactment. This is not exactly warp \nspeed. We have 18 months to figure out the magnitude of the problem. \nGAO would submit a report to analyze the best way to address the \ncrowdout. And then within 6 months of receiving the reports, the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services would develop recommendations on \nhow to deal with it. We are now 2 years from now, or when the bill \npasses, and then 6 months after that the Secretary would publish the \nrecommendations, and eventually we get to the point, after the studies, \nto figure out how big the problem is and what to do about it. The \nSecretary publishes it, and then the States have the obligation to look \nat these options and best practices and to institute them, probably \n2\\1/2\\ years after this bill becomes law.\n  So we are not exactly jumping the gun here, and it is far more \nappropriate to put the language in this bill, the\n\n[[Page S985]]\n\nSCHIP bill, as we did last year, than it is to wait for some future \nhealth care legislation. I don't buy that argument.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to support the Kyl amendment. It is the \nsame thing everybody who will be voting for this legislation voted for \nlast year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Baucus has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am ready to vote.\n  They want us to wait 2 minutes, Mr. President. I suggest the absence \nof a quorum to be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Kyl \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 46. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this will be the last vote tonight. If there \nare other amendments people wish to offer, we will deal with those.\n  We hope tomorrow we can start again early. We can come in probably \nabout 9:30 in the morning and start working on these amendments. We \nhave had a lot of votes.\n  I just had a conversation with the distinguished manager of the bill \non our side and he is looking at these amendments. He has indicated for \nsome of them--there are several of them he might look at favorably. But \nwhat amendments we have, let's get to them and see if we can finish \nthis tomorrow at a reasonable hour.\n  I have spoken with the Republican leader. We have had a good \nconversation. What we wish to consider, subject to the will of the \nbody, is to finish this tomorrow at a good time. We would come in at a \nrelatively decent time on Monday. We would be allowed to move to the \neconomic recovery package. We would complete the 2 or 3 hours on Holder \nstarting at 1 or so in the afternoon. We will have a vote that evening \nand then spend the rest of the day on the economic stimulus bill--start \noffering amendments on that on Tuesday or if somebody wanted to offer \nsome Monday night. I think we would save the time Monday night for \nstatements on that legislation and then work toward completing the \nlegislation on the stimulus as quickly as we can.\n  Remember, our goal is to finish the legislation so that on Monday of \nthe following week we can start doing the conference so we can complete \nthat before the Presidents Day recess.\n  The Republican leader and I have talked about another issue or two \nthat we might try to complete before the recess while the conference is \ntaking place. We will talk about that at a subsequent time. But I think \nI have given a general overview of what we think will take place the \nnext week or so.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the distinguished majority leader \nyield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I understood from my earlier conversation with the \ndistinguished majority leader, and also a conversation with the \ndistinguished ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, that once we \nfinish this tomorrow--because of the real need to get somebody in our \ntop law enforcement office, which is a privileged matter--that we would \ngo to the nomination of Eric Holder tomorrow, even if it requires \ntomorrow evening, and go for a vote. I note he passed after a lengthy \ntime. He has been waiting much longer than the past three Attorneys \nGeneral did, from the time he was announced to the time he got out of \nthe committee. He passed the committee by 17 to 2 today.\n  I had understood and actually told Mr. Holder and others, based on my \nconversation with the distinguished leader, that we would go to Mr. \nHolder tomorrow once this bill was finished.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through the Chair to the distinguished \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, that was the conversation. It is \ntrue it is a privileged motion but it is debatable. I think we should \nquit while we are ahead.\n  If the minority will allow us to go to this at a set time on Sunday, \nthe fastest we could get to it anyway would be sometime--on Monday, I \nam sorry--the quickest we could get to it likely anyway would be on \nSunday and I don't think we need to do that if we are going to have the \npermission of the minority to allow us to do it sometime early in the \nday on Monday.\n  I know there is some urgency in this, but the Senate, being as it is, \nwe only need one person on the other side to say to do it at a later \ntime and we are obligated to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if I might respond to the distinguished \nmajority leader, my friend from Nevada, if somebody wants to vote \nagainst Mr. Holder, let him speak and vote against him. But I do not \nknow, if there are only one or two people who want to hold him up, why \nshould we have to hold it up? We do not have an Attorney General now. \nWe aren't able to put in all the other spots. It is the premier law \nenforcement office in this country. I would hate to think, over the \nweekend, we had some major law enforcement crisis. I hope that with a \nperson who has been endorsed by every single law enforcement agency \nacross the spectrum in this country, we could go to him sooner. I am \nhappy to be here Friday. I am happy to be here Saturday if that is what \nit takes to vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. Me too.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I hear the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. I was \nsupposed to lead a delegation to Davos, the World Economic Summit. I \nhave canceled that. I am prepared to go. Obviously, the leader is the \none who could bring up a privileged matter. I find it very frustrating \nwe are not going to go forward.\n  Mr. REID. I understand how my friend from Vermont feels. I have to \nsay I think we should accept ``yes'' for an answer. It may not be the \nexact time we want, but I think it is a pretty good package.\n  We would go to work on this at a reasonable hour early in the \nafternoon on Monday. The Attorney General will be approved sometime \nearly in the afternoon on Monday--probably about 5 o'clock. And we \nwould be able to go at that time to the economic recovery package. We \nwould not have to file on that.\n  I think we are doing pretty well here. Everyone seems to be getting \nalong well. I don't think we need to have a\n\n[[Page S986]]\n\nlong debate that is unnecessary over the weekend when we would only \nsave, at most, 24 hours anyway.\n  I know how much the chairman has worked on this, but I think it is \nbetter that we go as I have outlined.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, obviously the leader could bring it up any \ntime. If he wants to do it differently than we had discussed earlier, \nthat is his option. I am disappointed.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 77\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate prior to \na vote on the amendment offered by the Senator from Alaska, Ms. \nMurkowski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask that all Members listen for 1 \nminute. I would like to think I have earned the reputation of being a \nrelatively reasonable Senator in my approach. What I have before you \ntoday is a pretty reasonable amendment.\n  What I am proposing in this amendment we have before us is if a State \nwants to exceed the 300 percent FPL for CHIP, if they want to go above \nthat level, what my amendment says is, we are going to give the \nflexibility for the States to be working with the Secretary to ensure \nthat before they do that, if they can ensure that 80 percent of the \nchildren within their State are covered, those children below 200 \npercent of the Federal poverty level, if 80 percent of those are \ncovered, then you have the flexibility to go above that 300 percent.\n  What we are allowing for is to guarantee, if you will, that we are \ncovering those children we set out to do when we passed SCHIP in the \nfirst place. So, 80 percent, look at your State's level. Just about all \nStates can meet this. We want to provide a level of flexibility, but we \nwant to ensure that the children from the neediest families are going \nto be taken care of first. I ask for my colleagues' support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, this is frankly a cleverly designed \namendment which has dire consequences. Essentially it takes away \nFederal funding under the Children's Health Insurance Program where \nStates cover children above 300 percent of poverty where the State \ncannot prove at least 80 percent of all the children in the State are \nbelow 200 percent of poverty, as covered either under the CHIP program \nor privately.\n  The problem is this: States cannot control their economies. Let's say \nthere is a recession. Let's say there is high unemployment. Let's say \npeople lose their private health insurance coverage. States cannot \ncontrol that. They cannot control what the total coverage in their \nState will be, public and private.\n  If a State cannot guarantee that 80 percent, it cannot control it, \nthen that State loses its Federal funds. So I think that even though it \nsounds pretty good on the surface, the trouble is States cannot control \nthe dynamics that are going to determine whether the States get those \nFederal dollars.\n  Therefore, I urge that the amendment not be adopted.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell).

The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 49\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 49.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 49.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To prevent fraud and restore fiscal accountability to the \n                      Medicaid and SCHIP programs)\n\n       Strike section 602 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 602. LIMITATION ON EXPANSION.\n\n       Section 2105(c)(8) (42 U.S.C. 1397ee(c)(8)), as added by \n     section 114(a), is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(C) Requirement.--Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and \n     (B), on or after the date of enactment of this subparagraph, \n     the Secretary may not approve a State plan amendment or \n     waiver for child health assistance or health benefits to \n     children whose family income exceeds 300 percent of the \n     poverty line unless the improper payment rate for Medicaid \n     and CHIP (as measured by the payment error rate measurement \n     (PERM)) is equal to or is less than 3.5 percent.''.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, this is a pretty straightforward \namendment. I am having trouble understanding what we are doing. The \naverage improper payment rate, as published by GAO and OMB, is around \n3.5 percent for the programs. We, just now, after 7 years, are starting \nto see the improper payment rates for Medicaid and SCHIP reported.\n  What is interesting is that the payment Medicaid error rate for \nfiscal 2008 is 10.5 percent. Madam President, $32 billion was \nimproperly paid out of Medicaid this last year; $18.6 billion of that \nis the Federal share. The SCHIP rate was a 14.7-percent improper \npayment rate.\n  This is the first time we have seen that SCHIP has reported its \nimproper payment numbers for a full year, and it is important in this \nregard: The worst offender in the country is the State of New York, \nwith an estimated 40-percent improper payment rate. The purpose of this \namendment is to restore fiscal discipline by making the Medicaid and \nSCHIP programs more accountable and efficient and to limit earmark \nexpansions until the programs are working at least within the range of \nwhat other Government programs work.\n  Now, we have an earmark in this SCHIP bill for the State of New York \nthat allows citizens in the State of New York an elevated level of \naccess to the SCHIP program that is some $30,000 above the rest of the \ncountry. We can decide to do that. That is fine. But what we should not \ndo is allow the worst State in terms of offense in fraud in Medicaid to \nbe able to expend additional moneys up to 400 percent of the poverty \nlevel until, in fact, they bring their improper payment levels down.\n  Let me refer to a 2005 New York Times article where the former State \ninvestigator of Medicaid abuse estimated that questionable claims \ntotaled 40 percent of all Medicaid spending in New York--nearly $18 \nbillion a year in New York alone.\n  One dentist somehow built the State's biggest Medicaid dental \npractice. This dentist--she--claimed to have performed 991 procedures a \nday in 2003. Get that again: 991 procedures a day. Van services \nintended as medical transportation for patients who cannot\n\n[[Page S987]]\n\nwalk were regularly found to be picking up scores of people who walked \nquite easily when a reporter was watching nearby. These rides cost \ntaxpayers $50 a round trip, adding up to $200 million a year, of which \na large portion of that was fraud.\n  So what this amendment does--it does not affect existing SCHIP \nprograms or States that wish to expand eligibility for families making \nup to 300 percent of the Federal poverty level. What it says is, until \nMedicaid and SCHIP payments reach the improved level of 3.5 percent--\nthe average of other Federal agencies--we should not give New York a \nspecial earmark for people making 400 percent of the Federal poverty \nlevel.\n  First of all, it is a matter of common sense. Why would we allow the \nState with the worst fraud rate on Medicaid to have an additional \nexception over everybody else in the country, when they are the least \nefficient with spending their money on the people whom they are \ncovering today?\n  Now, I do not know if 40 percent is accurate. It may not be. But the \nfact is, the whole Medicaid Program and SCHIP program are three to four \ntimes what the rest of the Federal Government is in terms of fraud and \nabuse. I think it is important we condition the expansion and the \nearmark for New York State on them coming into alignment with the rest \nof the Federal Government in terms of its abuse.\n  So with that, I yield the floor to the chairman.\n  He has no comments. I will move on to another amendment.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 50\n\n  Madam President, I call up amendment No. 50.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting the pending \namendment aside?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, reserving the right to object, let me \nget a sense of the lay of the land here. Let me see what this amendment \nis first.\n  Madam President, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 50.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To restore fiscal discipline by making the Medicaid and SCHIP \n                programs more accountable and efficient)\n\n       At the end of section 601, add the following:\n       (g) Time for Promulgation of Final Rule.--The final rule \n     implementing the PERM requirements under subsection (b) shall \n     be promulgated not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, this is another amendment. It is about \nbeing prudent with the taxpayers' money. It is about us doing what we \nare expected to do. It is about us controlling improper payments. This \namendment would require that the final rule implementing the payment \nerror rate measurement requirements under section 601(b) shall not be \nmade later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this act.\n  Now, the problem that we have is, the legislation, in its current \nform, would effectively erase this long overdue progress by placing an \nunnecessary moratorium on the reporting requirements for Medicaid \nimproper payment numbers. Let me say that again. In its current form, \nthis legislation erases this long overdue progress by placing a \nmoratorium on the reporting requirements for Medicaid improper payment \nnumbers.\n  Section 601 of the bill states:\n\n       The provision would prohibit the Secretary from calculating \n     or publishing national or state-specific error rates based on \n     PERM--\n\n  The ``payment error rate measurement''--\n\n     for CHIP until six months after the date on which a final \n     PERM rule, issued after the date of enactment of this Act, is \n     in effect for all states.\n\n  However, there is no deadline for the final rule.\n  So all we are saying with this is, if we really want improper payment \ninformation released to the American public and released to Members of \nthe Senate, we ought to be able to get the PERM done within 6 months of \nthe enactment of this bill. It is a fair compromise between those \nseeking clarification guidance on PERM while ensuring there will \neventually be progress and movement to guarantee the continuation of \nthe measuring of improper payments. For the life of me, I don't know \nwhy we don't want to measure improper payments with the Medicaid \nProgram. Maybe it is because we know what we are going to see, as with \nthe first 17 States where we have a 10.3 percent error rate, of which \nover 90 percent is payment out in error.\n  Six months is more than enough time for CMS to write the PERM \nguidelines, especially since it took our Founding Fathers only 4 months \nto write the Constitution.\n  The Medicaid composite error rate for 2008 is 10.5 percent. That is \n$32 billion of Medicaid money that could have been redirected in a more \nproper manner. This marks the first time the SCHIP has reported its \nimproper payment rate, and it was at 14.7 percent. To put that in \nperspective, the Congressional Research Service notes the average for \neach of the other Federal agencies is 3.5 percent. This bill, as it is \ncurrently written, ignores a law that has been on the books and for \nwhich CMS has 7 years to prepare. All we are saying is, after we pass \nthis bill, make them do it within 6 months. They can do it. They know \nthey can do it, and we have said no. I don't understand that. I am \nwilling to learn why we would not want improper payments reported to \nboth us and the American people. CMS itself has advocated for more \ntransparency on improper payment.\n  CMS is aware of the challenges and noted the lack of information \nabout payment error rates. We have actually had hearings in the \nFinancial Management Subcommittee on improper payment rates in both \nMedicare, SCHIP, and Medicaid. Kerry Weems, the former Director of the \nCMS stated: There is a substantial vulnerability in preventing and \ndetecting fraud, waste, and abuse in the Medicaid Program. Measuring \nperformance, publicly reporting the results, and providing payment \nincentives that encourage high quality and efficient care are paramount \nto keeping CMS accountable to the beneficiaries and the American \ntaxpayers.\n  What this bill does is strip the transparency and the information CMS \nneeds to detect and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. Supporting this \namendment is consistent with what our new President has said in terms \nof his pledge to make sure government works, that government is \ntransparent, and that we actually know where we are spending our money \nand whether it is working and effective. We have a duty to make sure \ntaxpayers are only paying for the services and the people who are \nentitled to benefits. This is a simple amendment to just shed \ntransparency on a government bureaucracy.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside that amendment \nand call up amendment No. 47.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I would \nlike to see the amendment.\n  Madam President, might I ask if the Senator from Oklahoma could right \nnow begin talking about his amendment while we have a chance to look at \nit, and then we could bring it up as soon as we have a chance to look \nat it. It saves some time.\n  Mr. COBURN. The Senator does not want to move on this amendment?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am just saying speak on the amendment. Then we will \nmake a decision to move it after we have had a chance to look at it.\n  Mr. COBURN. OK. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 47\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, the purpose of this amendment is to make \nsure children don't lose their private insurance and uninsured children \ncan get access to private health insurance.\n  This amendment would require a premium assistance approach for new \nMedicaid or SCHIP expansions under this act. It would cut bureaucratic \nredtape for States to use a premium assistance approach.\n  I will be the first to say SCHIP was created for targeted low-income \nchildren, those families making less than 200 percent of the Federal \npoverty\n\n[[Page S988]]\n\nlevel, and I believe that is where the program should stay focused. The \nDepartment of Health and Human Services just released new numbers on \nthe Federal poverty level. For a family of four, it is $22,050 a year. \nThat means the current SCHIP without expansions is available to \nchildren whose families are making $44,000 a year. That is close to the \nnational median income of $50,000.\n  The underlying bill will expand the SCHIP program up to families \nmaking $66,000 a year or $88,000 if you are fortunate enough to live in \nthe State of New York. I am concerned about this for a number of \nreasons, but there is little question the majority has the votes to \npass the underlying bill and President Obama will pass it. Therefore, \nmy amendment is not about whether to expand SCHIP; my amendment is \nabout how to expand SCHIP.\n  Are we going to put the majority of American kids on a government-run \nprogram? If that is our goal, then we should totally reject this \namendment. Or are we going to use an approach that ensures children in \nAmerica have access to market-based insurance?\n  Let me tell my colleagues why this is important. Today, only 40 \npercent of the physicians will take an SCHIP or a Medicaid patient. \nSixty percent would not even let them darken their door. So what we \nhave in essence done is put a stamp on the foreheads of people in these \nprograms that says: You get the doctors who are not busy enough so they \nhave to take SCHIP and Medicaid.\n  What this amendment is designed to do is, if they have an opportunity \nfor insurance, we give them that opportunity, which takes that stamp \noff their foreheads. In other words, we don't relegate them to lower \nclass health care.\n  My amendment would require States to use a premium assistance \napproach to keep kids in private coverage if they want to expand their \nMedicaid or SCHIP under this bill. The American people know the market \ngenerally does a better job of controlling costs and improving the \nquality than government can. We know that because when we look at \noutcomes of Medicare versus private insurance, we see it. When we look \nat outcomes of private insurance versus Medicaid, we see it. When we \nlook at outcomes of private insurance versus SCHIP, we see it. We know \nthat is true. If they need a little extra help to get the private \ninsurance, this amendment would make sure they have it. I believe \nparents--not government bureaucrats--should be able to make the \ndecisions about the health care of their kids. This amendment will \nreduce crowdout of private insurance.\n  Anytime the government offers to give something away for free, it is \ncommon sense that an employer or an individual will take them up on the \noffer. As we offer free health care to higher income children, many of \nwhom already have coverage, we are going to see a resulting drop or \ncrowdout in the number of employers willing to pay for private \ncoverage.\n  The Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Jonathan Gruber \nhas estimated the crowdout rate of expanding SCHIP to new eligibility \ngroups at 60 percent. The Congressional Budget Office shows that \n400,000 children will be newly covered in higher income families, and \nthere will be a reduction in existing private insurance for another \n400,000 children. That is our own Congressional Budget Office. If we \nsend the bill as it is written to President Obama, it is going to break \none of his campaign promises when he stated last fall:\n\n       If you already have insurance, the only thing that will \n     change under my plan is that we will lower your premiums.\n\n  Voting in support of this amendment ensures that President Obama can \nkeep his promise. Not only does crowdout take away the private coverage \nhigher income children have now, it is a bad deal for taxpayers. \nFor those new populations covered by CHIPRA 2009, the SCHIP \nlegislation, one new child for the cost of two. CBO says the bill will \ncover 1.9 million SCHIP kids in 2013 at a cost of $2,160. However, \nbecause of crowdout, taxpayers will actually pay $4,430 for every newly \ninsured kid because we are picking up the tab for those kids who \nalready had insurance. The purpose of this amendment is to minimize \nthat crowdout. Rather than encourage government dependence, it is to \nhelp people stay in a private insurance plan. It is also cost effective \nbecause the State will only have to subsidize the employee's share of \nthe health insurance benefit rather than having taxpayers pay the \nentire benefit.\n\n  This amendment also cuts bureaucratic redtape to make it easier for \nStates to use a premium assistance approach. Current laws allow premium \nassistance, but the administrative requirements are so cumbersome that \nonly a handful of States have premium assisted programs. I will note \nthat the underlying bill permits premium assistance but would also note \nthat the administrative burdens would once again discourage States from \nusing this approach.\n  According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 55 percent of the 78.6 \nmillion children in America have employer-sponsored insurance. If that \ncoverage is working for the majority of American kids, why can't it \nwork for kids who are eligible for SCHIP? The answer is, it can and we \nhave a duty to make sure it does.\n  The premium assistance language in the underlying bill also denies \nparents the right to choose certain types of coverage for their \nchildren. This language gives parents the right to choose from more \ncoverage options. Parents, not bureaucrats, know best about what fits \nthe needs of their children. A parent should be able to use premium \nassistance for their share of the employer-sponsored insurance, to buy \ninsurance in the nongroup market, or to buy a consumer-directed \nproduct. All this does is give parents that right to make individual \ndecisions about what is best for their children, about what doctor they \nwill have for their children.\n  Don't forget most people in SCHIP don't get a real choice about who \nis going to take care of their children. They have a very limited \nchoice. What this amendment does is ensures that a large portion of \nthem can actually choose the doctor they want for their child.\n  It is not about--this amendment isn't about whether we should cover \nAmerican kids; it is about the best way to cover those kids. I believe \nkeeping kids with their parents and market-based coverage is going to \nbe better for American kids, better for our country in the long run, \nand I will guarantee it will give us better outcomes for the children \nwho are covered.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I listened carefully to the Senator from \nOklahoma, and I might say he has some interesting thoughts and \ninteresting ideas. Let me think about them and maybe there is something \nwe can do about them, and I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the chairman for his consideration.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam Chairman, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I do not wish to speak to the \namendments on the floor but to the underlying bill, and I rise today to \nexpress my strong support for H.R. 2, the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram Improvements Act.\n  Providing children access to doctors and medicine is absolutely \ncritical to a good start in life, but there are many children in New \nHampshire and across this country whose families can't afford private \nhealth insurance but who are also not eligible to receive help such as \nMedicaid. It is the future of these children that we are considering \nthis week on the floor of the Senate.\n  This is an issue that is near and dear to me. After children's health \ninsurance was first passed--and I appreciate the efforts of so many \npeople in this body to get that done--I was the Governor of New \nHampshire, and I tried to start a children's health insurance program \nin New Hampshire, but the State legislature was unwilling to fund New \nHampshire's share of the cost. I believed the program was important \nenough to keep working on it, and so we secured a waiver to allow \nprivate foundations to put up what would be the State's share. The \nprogram was successful and the State's share was funded in the next \nbudget because there were so many families in New Hampshire who had \nreceived health insurance for their children, they came to the \nlegislature and the legislature agreed to support it.\n  After enacting New Hampshire's children's health insurance program, \ntens\n\n[[Page S989]]\n\nof thousands of New Hampshire children have obtained affordable \ncoverage through this program. I have seen firsthand what a difference \nthe program can make for middle-class working families.\n  Consider the case of Quint Stires from Keene, NH. I had the pleasure \nof meeting Quint on the campaign trail last year. Quint had advanced \nthyroid cancer, and he had to quit his job after becoming too sick to \nwork. Then his wife also lost her job. Of course, they lost their \nhealth insurance. But, fortunately, in this instance, in the toughest \nof circumstances, Quint and his wife didn't have to worry about how \nthey were going to provide health care for their two sons. They had New \nHampshire's children's health insurance.\n  Unfortunately, Quint has since passed away, and my thoughts go out to \nhis family. But I think it is important to share his story as we talk \nabout this children's health insurance legislation on the floor of the \nSenate because sometimes we lose sight of the individuals the \nlegislation we enact is really going to help. The Children's Health \nInsurance Program offered help to the Stires family when they needed it \nthe most, and we have the opportunity to make sure other families have \nthe same safety net available to them.\n  Due to the uncertain economy we face today, there are going to be \nmany more parents and children in tough circumstances. Families and \nbusinesses are being forced to cut back on just about everything. \nPeople are losing their jobs, and employers are struggling to offer \nhealth care, leaving a rising number of Americans in need of affordable \ncoverage options for their kids.\n  The legislation we are considering reauthorizes children's health \ninsurance through September 2013 and provides enough funding to cover \nan additional 4 million uninsured children across the country. In New \nHampshire, the estimate is that over two-thirds of our uninsured \nchildren are eligible for either Medicaid or children's health \ninsurance, what we call New Hampshire Healthy Kids Silver. The Senate \nlegislation increases funding for outreach so we can identify eligible \nchildren and enroll them, it streamlines the signup process, it \nprovides incentives to States that achieve enrollment benchmarks, and \nit provides enough funding to cover every eligible child in New \nHampshire.\n  For those who are as concerned about our mounting national debt as I \nam, the costs of this bill are fully offset through an increase in the \nFederal tobacco tax. Moreover, it is simply more cost-effective to get \npreventive health care for children than to have them treated in \nemergency rooms or to suffer from permanent conditions due to lack of \ncare.\n  Today, more than 76,000 children in New Hampshire have health \ncoverage, either through Medicaid or through our Children's Health \nInsurance Program. But I know we can do better because all children \nneed regular checkups, all children need access to medicine, all \nchildren deserve a shot at preventing disease later in life, and all \nfamilies need to know they can provide for their kids without going \ninto insurmountable debt.\n  I am pleased that the Senate is considering this very important \nlegislation so early in the 111th Congress. I believe it reflects our \ncommitment to the children of this country. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                     Getting America working Again\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today to urge the Senate and the \nCongress to act now to put people back to work and begin taking the \nsteps necessary to restore economic growth in the near term and \nopportunity over the long haul.\n  The House passed a jobs bill yesterday, and the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee passed its jobs bill out of committee on Tuesday. As a new \nmember of that committee, I look forward to working with my colleagues \nfrom both sides of the aisle to pass a good jobs bill and get it to the \nPresident so we can start to get people back to work now and lay the \nfoundation for broad-based economic growth and opportunity.\n  The need for this jobs bill is as plain as day. Each day, news brings \nfresh evidence that America's economy is on the wrong track. According \nto the experts, unemployment last month rose by 632,000 workers to 7.2 \npercent. Those are the highest levels in nearly 16 years, and the \ntrendline is downright scary. Even so-called growth companies, such as \nMicrosoft, are announcing layoffs, while retail companies such as \nCircuit City go belly-up in the wake of the meltdown of the financial \nmarkets. Just this week, Home Depot, Caterpillar, General Motors, \nUnited Airlines, Pfizer, and Sprint Nextel have announced massive job \ncuts, some 75,000 in 1 day, and the numbers continue to go higher and \nhigher.\n  In Montana, we unfortunately are not immune to the economic gloom. \nMining companies are experiencing significant layoffs. Car dealers are \nstruggling. And the timber industry in our State is on the verge of \ncollapse. The Montana Contractors Association said last month that the \nconstruction sector in our State has fallen more than 7.5 percent in \nthe last year and a half. And the wild volatility of the worldwide \nenergy markets has left both consumers and producers in the Treasure \nState feeling the effects of the boom-and-bust roller coaster ride.\n  Let me tell you, when you take away a worker's job, you take away the \nfamily's hope for the future. Montanans do not want an unemployment \ncheck. What they want is a job and a paycheck.\n  A recent picture in the Whitefish Pilot explained it well. A lone man \nstood on a street corner with a cardboard sign that said, ``Work \nneeded.'' In the caption, he is quoted as saying:\n\n       It's humbling, but I'm a workaholic. I do whatever it takes \n     to pay my bills.\n\n  A woman from Kalispell wrote me about herself and her husband, both \nof whom are out of work. She said:\n\n       I would be happy to clean your office, answer phones or do \n     office work for you . . . or I will sweep streets with a \n     broom if you can recommend me to the right person.\n\n  The unemployment rate hit 8.7 percent in Flathead County last month. \nThese are proud working folks, and they are not looking for a handout. \nThey are looking for a job, an opportunity to make a living, to provide \nfor their families.\n  I come to my job in the Senate from our family farm in Montana. \nAlthough we might not register much more than a blip on the radar \nscreen of national statistics, let me tell you, folks in rural America \nand our frontier communities feel the effects when the big picture is \nout of whack. We feel the effects of a national turndown in a big way.\n  Virtually every economic recession in American history started in \nfarm country. This one is no different. Input costs are high and \ncommodity prices are low. This is a recipe for financial failure.\n  So what do we do? The first thing we need to do is pass a good jobs \nbill, and we need to do it now. Rather than continuing to lurch from \nbailout to bailout, we need a good jobs bill that will put people to \nwork right now and begin to rebuild our economy from the ground up by \ninvesting in infrastructure.\n  Yesterday, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave efforts to \nrepair our Nation's infrastructure a grade of D. They said the repair \ncosts have grown more than $500 billion in the last 4 years. \nSpecifically, more than 26 percent--that is more than one in four--of \nour Nation's bridges are either structurally deficient or functionally \nobsolete. One-third of America's major roads are either poor or in \nmediocre condition.\n  In Montana, water is a huge infrastructure. I will give a few \nexamples. The town of Stevensville's water supply dates to 1909, and \nthere have been no significant or substantial improvements to that \nwater system in 30 years. That town alone needs 150,000 bucks to \nupgrade the system to bring it into compliance with Federal drinking \nwater standards and to ensure good public health. The town of Dutton, \nMT, needs half a million dollars to rehabilitate wastewater lagoons \nbuilt back in 1946 to avert possible catastrophic dike failure and to \nserve the citizens of the town in compliance with current standards. \nThese are just two examples of the need for infrastructure funding that \nwill get people working now, enhance quality of life, and set the\n\n[[Page S990]]\n\ngroundwork for vigorous economic growth.\n\n  Some may criticize the need to upgrade infrastructure as nothing more \nthan filling potholes. But I can tell you that after many years of \nfailure at the national level to fund infrastructure, our national \n``front end'' is a little more than a little out of alignment.\n  If we do it right, investing in infrastructure will be a win-win. \nSmart long-term infrastructure projects will put people to work right \nnow and will also build for the future, for future generations, for our \nkids and our grandkids.\n  We know that every billion dollars in infrastructure investment \nproduces 30,000 good jobs in our communities. When these infrastructure \ndollars are spent correctly, they will result in good-paying jobs and \nimprovements that will allow our communities and businesses to grow and \nprosper.\n  We have sound local projects in process right now. All they need is \nan infusion of capital. These local projects will put people to work \nbuilding roads, bridges, water systems, modernizing schools, bringing \nnew sources of energy online, and the list goes on and on.\n  These Federal dollars will produce results that will benefit our \ncommunities for generations to come. We need an effective partnership \non the Federal, State, and local levels to identify these priority \nprojects with rock-solid merit, and we will work as public servants to \nget worthy projects the money they need to make them happen.\n  The jobs bill must have first-rate accountability. We have seen \nenough bridges to nowhere to know a boondoggle when we see one. We need \nfull transparency so the American people can judge for themselves the \nworthiness of individual projects through a process that is more open \nthan ever.\n  We need to pass this jobs bill in the Senate for one reason: We need \nto get America working again. Beyond the bricks and mortar and asphalt \nand concrete, we need to invest in our people. That is human \ninfrastructure. A good first step would be to pass the children's \nhealth insurance bill that is on the floor right now to ensure the \nyoungest and most vulnerable Americans have access to quality, \naffordable health care. I hope the Senate can get that goal done \ntomorrow. We need to focus on education and training to equip middle-\nclass families to succeed over the long haul. We need to modernize our \nschools with new technology and build new ones where necessary.\n  Unfortunately, we have seen some folks playing politics with our \ncountry's future. They even criticize a proposal to increase Pell \ngrants for working families to send their kids to college. Anyone who \ndoes not get how important college financial aid is to Middle America \nis out of touch with the tough decisions that are made around kitchen \ntables every day in this country.\n  It is also important to consider how we got here. Years of trickle-\ndown economics, massive tax breaks for the well-to-do and the well \nconnected, and a complete lack of regulation in the marketplace--that \nis the legacy of greed and abuse we need to correct. Just like the \nreferees on the football field for Super Bowl Sunday, we need to put \nthe referees back on the field on Wall Street. We need to make sure the \ncrooks never again swindle honest people.\n  Our Founding Fathers said:\n\n       If men were angels, no government would be necessary.\n\n  Thomas Jefferson noted in his first inaugural address that among the \nelements of good government is the need to ``restrain men from injuring \none another.''\n  We have our marching orders. We need to get to work. I serve on the \nSenate Banking Committee, and I want to make sure the Treasury \nDepartment, the Justice Department, and the Securities and Exchange \nCommission all have the tools they need in their toolbox. If they need \nmore tools, we need to go out there and get them for them.\n  Over the long haul, we need balanced priorities to rebuild this \neconomy from the ground up. We need jobs. We need to put people first.\n  I am proud to give a voice to family farmers and ranchers. I want \nWashington, DC, to start seeing the world through the eyes of rural \nAmerica. The wealthy special interests have had the run of this place \nfor all too long and have run this economy into the ditch.\n  I was pleased to hear the Senate minority leader state last week that \nhe intends to cooperate to pass a jobs bill and other vital \nlegislation. Working together always results in a better work product.\n  I am disappointed, though, that others have decided to play politics \nat a time when so many American workers are struggling and families are \nworried about how to make ends meet. We have financial markets melting \ndown, an economy that is cratered, and a future that is bleaker than \nany we have faced in generations. We need a new plan. We need a new \ndirection. We need change.\n  I applaud President Obama for his leadership in proposing this new \njobs bill, and I stand ready to work with him and all my colleagues to \nrebuild this economy from the ground up. We don't need bailouts. We \nneed jobs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is no secret that I have worked for \ndecades to bring greater transparency and accountability to all facets \nof Government operations. If there is one thing I have learned over \nthose years, it is that you cannot achieve the goal of greater \ntransparency and accountability without the access to information.\n  Today, we are experiencing the greatest financial crisis of our \nNation's history. Daily we hear of more companies failing and the need \nfor many more billions of Federal funds to save this bank or that \ninvestment company. In response to this crisis, the Treasury Department \nunveiled an initial plan to buy stakes in banks and other financial \nfirms. That program is known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program known \nto all of us around here by the acronym TARP, T-A-R-P, and it is \ncosting the American taxpayers nearly three-quarters of $1 trillion.\n  In an effort to bring maximum accountability to the people for the \nTARP funds, Congress created a strong Inspector General with the broad \npowers to investigate and oversee the program, including access to the \nrecords of TARP fund recipients. Similarly, in an effort to provide \nmaximum transparency, Congress required the Government Accountability \nOffice, known around here as GAO, to monitor and oversee the TARP \nprogram as well. The Government Accountability Office's mission is to \nlook at the overall performance of the initiative and its impact on the \nfinancial system.\n  The Government Accountability Office is also required to prepare \nregular reports for Congress. However, the Government Accountability \nOffice cannot do its job without access to information, and I have \nlearned that it does not have all the access it needs. Although the \nGovernment Accountability Office can examine the records of the \nTreasury itself and of any of its agents or representatives, the \nGovernment Accountability Office does not have access to the books and \nrecords of private entities that receive TARP funds. The connection \nthere is public dollars. The public ought to have the right to know.\n  Believe it or not, the Government Accountability Office can't have \naccess to information from the banks and investment companies that \nreceive billions of taxpayers' dollars; that is the problem. This \nlegislation I am introducing is intended to fix that as well. The \nGovernment Accountability Office is supposed to be the eyes and ears of \nthe Congress of the United States. Well, it can't do that job wearing \nblinders and ear plugs.\n\n[[Page S991]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/28/senate-section/article/S991-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Corporal Joseph M. Hernandez\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the \nlife of CPL Joseph M. Hernandez from Hammond, IN. Joseph was 24 years \nold when he lost his life on January 9, 2009, from injuries sustained \nfrom a roadside bomb attack in Jaldak, Afghanistan. He was a member of \nthe 1st Battalion, 4th Infantry Regiment of Hohenfels, Germany.\n  Today, I join Joseph's family and friends in mourning his death. \nJoseph will forever be remembered as a loving husband, father, brother, \nson, and friend to many. Joseph is survived by his wife, Alison; his \nsons, Jacob and Noah; his brothers, Jesse and Jason; his parents, Elva \nand Jessie; and a host of other friends and relatives.\n  Joseph joined the Army in 2005 and had been stationed in Afghanistan \nfor 1 month. Prior to entering the service, Joseph graduated from Mount \nCarmel High School in Chicago, attended the College of the Holy Cross \nand had entered the mechanical engineering and biology programs at \nPurdue University in West Lafayette, IN. Joseph was a man of great \nfaith and an active member of Our Lady of Perpetual Help Church of \nHammond, where he served as an altar boy and was a member of the choir. \nJoseph had many passions in life: he was a volunteer at the local \nanimal humane society, and his interests ranged from boxing to model \nairplanes and vintage cars. Above all, Joseph's greatest passion was \nhis family, who he hoped to take to a Chicago Cubs game at the end of \nhis deployment.\n  While we struggle to express our sorrow over this loss, we can take \npride in the example Joseph set as both a soldier and a father. Today \nand always, he will be remembered by family, friends and fellow \nHoosiers as a true American hero, and we cherish the legacy of his \nservice and his life.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Joseph M. Hernandez in the \nRecord of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. I pray that \nJoseph's family can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who \nsaid, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe \naway tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Joseph.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/28/senate-section/article/S991-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S991-S992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RURAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2009\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support as a \ncosponsor of S. 150, the Rural Law Enforcement Assistance Act of 2009, \nintroduced by my colleague on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator \nLeahy. As our Nation copes with economic turbulence, we here in \nWashington are faced with tough decisions regarding the Federal budget. \nBack in our home States, State and local legislators are facing their \nown tough decisions and are examining drastic cuts to budgets that \ncould impact law enforcement services provided to citizens. These cuts \nare leaving law enforcement administrators wrestling to do more with \nless. Unfortunately, we are finding out that these administrators are \nforced with the only choice of serving their public with fewer \nofficers, less money for training and less money for tools and \nresources for the more than 800,000 men and women who keep our citizens \nsafe from crime. I fear we have only seen the tip of the iceberg that \nis our present economic state. Large cities and small towns are seeing \nthe possibility of not filling vacant law enforcement officer positions \ndue to the recent budget crisis. In my home State of Utah, with the \nexception of a few law enforcement agencies, most of the departments \npatrol rural jurisdictions. Some of the hardest hit areas by this \neconomic downturn are rural communities. Police agencies in these \ncommunities often lose out to larger metropolitan areas for \nconsideration of justice assistance grants. Under the present form of \nthe Department of Justice's Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant \nProgram, the sheriff's departments and police departments in Utah have \nseen a 65-percent decrease in justice assistance grant funding received \nfrom this program. These areas have their own challenges--issues such \nas illicit drug use that are not just unique to cities but transcend \ncity limits and have manifested themselves in rural communities in much \nthe same way they do in urban settings.\n  Press reports in the preceding weeks have been very grim to say the \nleast. Joblessness is on the rise. The combination of revenue losses \nand budget shortfalls will see an increased demand for services on the \npart of these rural agencies. These issues will make it challenging to \ncontinue to meet the demands of normal calls for service. According to \nthe chiefs and sheriffs in Utah, because of this economic downturn, the \ncost of everything is going up, including crime.\n  If passed, the Rural Law Enforcement Assistance Act would level the \nplaying field by reauthorizing the rural law enforcement assistance \ngrant under the Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program. This \nreauthorization will make agencies located in rural States and populous \nStates with rural areas candidates for this grant assistance. These \ngrants can be used to hire officers, pay for officer training, crime \nprevention programs, and victim assistance programs. For example, in \nthe coming fiscal year some Utah agencies may not be able to purchase \nessential items and tools like rape-investigation kits which are \ncritical in the gathering of physical evidence after a victim has been \nassaulted. Grants awarded under the Rural Law Enforcement Assistance \nAct could be used to purchase these kits and other critical tools \nneeded for investigations. As a longtime advocate for victims' rights, \nI find this troubling that there might be agencies in this country that \nmay not have the necessary budget to purchase essential tools needed to \ninvestigate these heinous crimes.\n  For decades criminologists and economists have debated the link \nbetween crime and the economy. Some researchers have concluded that \nthere is a ripple effect from the economy and it radiates out and \ndisplays itself in the form of increased calls for service, increased \ndomestic violence, and increased property crimes. Presently, we do not \nhave current crime statistics for 2008, but I will use a less \nscientific method: it is called listening to the professionals who each \nand every day answer the calls for police services in these rural \nareas. They tell me that they are seeing an increase in burglaries, \ndomestic violence, emergency mental health committals, and more calls \nfor service. Some agencies are down in personnel numbers. However, \nthese law enforcement professionals are forging ahead doing the very \nbest they can with whatever means they have. They are not looking at \nthese grants as a free pass to purchase frivolous big-ticket items that \nhave little to do with their agency's mission. These administrators \ntell me they are hopeful this act will pass so that they can continue \nto serve the rural communities who have come to expect the most basic \nof police services as a right guaranteed by the Constitution in \n``ensuring domestic tranquility.''\n  My colleagues in this Chamber have taken great pains to examine and \ndiscuss a way to lead our country out of this crisis and get our \neconomy moving again. We should be scrutinizing Government spending in \nthis tight economy. But I cannot think of a better form of economic \nstimulus than making justice assistance grants available to rural \ncommunities and metropolitan areas alike. However, rural agencies \ncurrently find themselves on the outside looking in under the present \nJAG formula. The reauthorization of the Rural Law Enforcement \nAssistance Act would give rural agencies a better opportunity at \nreceiving this grant assistance.\n  In closing, I quote the Greek philosopher Plato who said the \nfollowing about communities: ``The community which has neither poverty \nnor riches will always have the noblest principles.''\n  This Nation is one large framework of communities and was founded on \nsome of the noblest principles ever recorded in history. Some of our \ncitizens choose a city lifestyle, and some have selected a rural small \ntown life. Crime does not distinguish between urban and rural. The more \nthan 800,000 men and women who make up the law enforcement community \nthat keep our streets\n\n[[Page S992]]\n\nsafe in metropolitan cities and Main Street USA know this firsthand. \nOne of the viscous subplots of this economic turmoil is that crime and \nthe need for police services undoubtedly will increase. The small town \nrural police department may be the only Government entity that answers \nthe phone in the middle of the night when a citizen has just lost a job \nand is contemplating suicide. A sheriff's deputy or police officer \ndispatched to the scene might be the only direct intervention that this \ncitizen has with a government service. If there are not enough deputies \nor officers to go around, the response to this cry for help may be \ndelayed or, worse yet, might not get there in time. When you reframe \nthis issue relative to the scenario that I just laid out, it troubles \nme deeply and impresses upon me just how much our rural law enforcement \ncommunity needs this reauthorization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/28/senate-section/article/S992-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING HARRY ROBERTS\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of a true \nWyoming gentleman, a public servant, a veteran, a father to five girls, \nand--I am privileged to say--a friend.\n  Kearsley Harrison Roberts, better known to us as Harry Roberts of \nKaycee, WY, died today, January 28, 2009, in Vero Beach, FL.\n  Harry Roberts was really a renaissance man, the kind of which are the \nlore of Western legends.\n  He was a Yale-educated sheep rancher, a Navy veteran of ``the \ngreatest generation,'' an expert in public education--successfully \nelected statewide as Superintendent of Wyoming's public schools, a \nleader in Wyoming economic policy, and most of all he was a caring \nfather.\n  I think we can imagine what brought him the most joy his family and \nof course, his five spirited daughters Mandy, Joan, Sheila, Ginny, and \nSusan.\n  Harry led quite a ranch crew. Picture five girls growing up on the \nWyoming wildlands in the same area where Butch Cassidy and the Hole in \nthe Wall Gang stowed rustled livestock and outran the law.\n  This was north central Wyoming, Barnum, a small community near Kaycee \nwhere to this day more rodeo cowboys than any one town in the West call \nhome.\n  They call this part of Johnson County, WY, Outlaw Country, and after \nan eastern education, it inspired one western soul to work a sheep \nranch for the love of the Wyoming way of life.\n  Harry Roberts found home and heart on this ranch, and today, I like \nto think of him back on his range, with the great western sky warming \nhis big, signature smile.\n  Wyoming's Harry Roberts was the genuine Wyoming gentleman.\n  He was also the proud father-in-law to this body's beloved former \ncolleague, U.S. Senator Craig Thomas. Harry's daughter Susan Roberts \nThomas married Craig Thomas and the two were inseparable in life.\n  Susan, I speak for so many here in this Chamber and for all of \nWyoming when I say our thoughts and prayers are with you today and with \nyour entire family.\n  We grieve, as we did for Craig, the natural end of a purposeful life.\n  We recall a man who served his State, his country, and his family \nselflessly.\n  And we say, we remember Harry, as we do Craig, because of what he did \nand how he did it always with distinction and with honor.\n  Harry is and always will be a proud and patriotic member of the \n``greatest generation.''\n  In fact he was what sailors call a ``plank owner.''\n  At that time, a ``plank owner'' referred to an individual who was a \nmember of the crew of a ship when that ship was placed in commission. \nAs part of the vessel decommissioning and disposal process, the Navy \nformerly removed a small portion of the deck as a traditional reminder \nof the time when ``wooden walls and iron men'' were a key part of the \nNavy.\n  In Harry's case, it was a boat--a submarine in fact.\n  After his military service Harry worked and lived in Wyoming, \neventually running for superintendent of Public Instruction in 1967. \nHarry was known as a reformer of course and someone who cared deeply \nfor Wyoming children.\n  In 1970, in one of the closest races in Wyoming's history, Harry lost \na race for Wyoming's lone U.S. House race losing by only 608 votes to \nTeno Roncalio.\n  Harry was a leader in our State on issues that went well beyond \neducation. He served as director of the Wyoming Heritage Foundation and \ncounted many successes during an especially exciting and challenging \ntime in our State's history.\n  It was at the Heritage Foundation that my wife, then Bobbi Brown, \nfirst met Harry and learned so much under his guidance for several \nyears.\n  Harry personified the Wyoming Heritage Foundation's mission for a \nstrong, prosperous, diverse and sustained economy for the citizens of \nWyoming. His goals and initiative are felt to this day.\n  More recently after his retirement, he returned to Washington often \nto visit his daughter Susan and to see his son-in-law Craig Thomas.\n  Susan became a teacher of course, following in the footsteps of her \nfather who held the profession so highly.\n  It was in May of 2004 that Senator Thomas hosted a very special \nreception along with Vice President Cheney here in Washington.\n  Craig invited Harry and his fellow ``plank owners'' to be recognized \nalong with the dedication of the National World War II Memorial on the \nNational Mall.\n  It was a special occasion to acknowledge and pay tribute to the duty, \nsacrifices, and valor of all the members of the Armed Forces of the \nUnited States who served in World War II.\n  And it was also for Harry and his fellow sailors.\n  I have talked to several folks who were there that day. I know the \npride that Susan and Craig felt for their father, for his service, and \nfor his example.\n  I will end now with the Navy Hymn, a song and a benediction that \nHarry would have heard often at sea in service to our country. I will \nrecite the first and last verse.\n\n     Eternal Father, Strong to save,\n     Whose arm hath bound the restless wave,\n     Who bid'st the mighty Ocean deep\n     Its own appointed limits keep;\n     O hear us when we cry to thee,\n     for those in peril on the sea.\n\n     O Trinity of love and power!\n     Our brethren shield in danger's hour;\n     From rock and tempest, fire and foe,\n     Protect them where-so-ever they go;\n     Thus evermore shall rise to Thee,\n     Glad hymns of praise from land and sea.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/28/senate-section/article/S992-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S992-S993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING THE SHURRAB FAMILY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have all seen the photographs of houses, \nschools and other civilian infrastructure destroyed in Gaza, and the \nreports of civilian deaths, including over 400 children, and many \nthousands more injured. Behind each of these statistics is a story of a \nfamily tragedy. I want to take this opportunity to talk about one that \nhas touched the lives of Vermonters, and which should cause each of us \ndeep concern.\n  Amer Shurrab is a recent graduate of Middlebury College, which is \nlocated not very far from my home in Vermont. Amer is also a \nPalestinian, whose family was living in Gaza during the recent Israeli \ninvasion. His father, Muhammed Kassab Shurrah, is a farmer who grows \nfruits and vegetables on a small plot of land.\n  On January 16, Amer's father and brothers were returning home with \nprovisions from their farm during the 3-hour humanitarian cease-fire \nthat was in effect that day. Although there was apparently no \nindication that the route was unsafe for a civilian vehicle carrying \ncivilian passengers, Israeli soldiers fired from a civilian house at \ntheir car as it passed for reasons that remain unknown. In a panic, \nAmer's brother, Kassab, already wounded, got out of the vehicle and was \nshot a total of 18 times and died a short distance away. Israeli \nbullets also hit Amer's father and younger brother Ibrahim, who were \nunable to leave the car to get medical attention because Israeli \nsoldiers refused to allow movement in or out of the area.\n  Muhammed tried everything he could to save his son Ibrahim, who was \nbleeding to death before his eyes. He phoned a hospital with his cell \nphone, but the hospital told him the Israeli Army was\n\n[[Page S993]]\n\npreventing an ambulance from reaching them. He called relatives, who \ncontacted the Red Cross on his behalf to ask for assistance, but the \nRed Cross had to wait for assurance from Israeli authorities that an \nambulance would get through unscathed, assurance which was not \nforthcoming. He spoke with several members of the press, including the \nBBC, who even broadcast his plea for help. But an ambulance could not \nreach them until 22 hours after the incident, even though the hospital \nwas located less than a mile away. By this time, Ibrahim had died in \nhis father's arms. Israeli troops reportedly looked on and ignored \nMuhammed's pleas for help.\n  This case cries out for an immediate, thorough, credible and \ntransparent investigation by the Israeli Government. Any individuals \ndetermined to have violated the laws of war should be prosecuted and \nappropriately punished.

This should include the use of white phosphorous \nin heavily populated areas, which is alleged to have caused serious \ninjuries to civilians.\n  Mr. President, this is a heartbreaking story. My thoughts and prayers \ngo out to Amer Shurrab and his family and friends, and to the families \nof other civilians, Palestinian and Israeli, who died or suffered other \ngrievous losses in this latest escalation of violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/28/senate-section/article/S993-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 TRIBUTE TO CAROLYN E. ``BETSY'' FLYNN\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Carolyn E. \n``Betsy'' Flynn of Benton, KY, for her recent appointment to the \nFederal Reserve Board's Consumer Advisory Council.\n  Mrs. Flynn currently serves as president and vice chairman of \nCommunity Financial Services Bank in Benton, KY, which manages around \n$400 million in assets. This institution has served the Benton \ncommunity for almost 120 years and Mrs. Flynn has contributed to its \nsuccess since 1976. For 24 years, Betsy Flynn has also instructed at \nthe Barret School of Banking in Memphis, TN. Her public service record \nis extensive as well. She has served on several economic development \nboards, the city council, the chamber of commerce, the tourist \ncommission, and has recently been appointed to the Kentucky Investment \nCommission.\n  The Consumer Advisory Council serves a vital role in advising the \nFederal Reserve Board on guidelines under the Consumer Credit \nProtection Act and issues regarding consumer financial services. Mrs. \nFlynn's impressive resume provides a solid foundation for her new role \non the council. Her expertise in the banking and financial industry \nwill serve her and the advisory council well.\n  I now ask my fellow colleagues to join me in congratulating Mrs. \nFlynn for her remarkable achievement. Kentucky and the entire country \nshould be proud to have such a distinguished individual serving \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/28/senate-section/article/S993-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING GEORGE FOREMAN\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate and \nrecognize a distinguished citizen of Kentucky, Mr. George Foreman of \nDanville, who was recently named Danville Art Citizen of the Year by \nthe Arts Commission of Danville/Boyle County.\n  This prestigious award is meant to identify an individual in the \ncommunity who has made it possible for the arts to become an integral \npart in other people's lives. The Arts Commission of Danville/Boyle \nCounty issued the first Art Citizen of the Year award in 2004.\n  As managing director of the Norton Center for the Arts and Associate \nProfessor at Centre College, Mr. Foreman has accomplished impressive \nthings, including forming and directing Danville's own Advocate Brass \nBand, receiving the 1996 Bruce Montgomery Leadership Award, and also \nfounding the Great American Brass Band Festival. There is no doubt that \nMr. Foreman's service has made his community a better place because of \nhis dedication to the arts and the citizens of his town.\n  During his years of service, Mr. Foreman has played host to all the \nmajor U.S. military bands, who presented their concerts free to the \npublic. He also partnered with Stage One, a children's theatre in \nLouisville, to bring the Norton Center a children's theatre. Mr. \nForeman has made the arts a central focus in his life, and I look \nforward to his future projects.\n  Once again, I congratulate Mr. Foreman on this award. He is truly an \ninspiration to all of Kentucky, and I wish him luck on all of his \nfuture endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/28/senate-section/article/S993-3", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S993-S994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING EAST RESTAURANT & LOUNGE\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I wish to recognize a small business \nin my home State of Maine that has risen to the top during its very \nshort existence. East Restaurant & Lounge, located in Wells, was \nrecently named one of the top Chinese restaurants in America--the first \ntime a Maine restaurant has been recognized with such a distinction.\n  Opened in June 2008 by owner Ri Teng Li, East Restaurant & Lounge has \nquickly impressed its clients with delicious Chinese, Thai, and \nJapanese cuisine. Mr. Li previously owned and operated the popular Yum \nMee Restaurant in Wells, and East Restaurant allows him to keep long-\nloved classic dishes from the prior establishment while greatly \nexpanding his menu. With more than 400 items, ranging from Peking duck \nto sushi to Pad Thai, as well as an expansive and impressive buffet on \nSundays, East has something for everyone. The restaurant also has a \nspacious lounge, where guests can relax after work and enjoy a \nspecialty cocktail. And East offers catering services for a variety of \nevents.\n  Perhaps most notable about East Restaurant is the building. It is \nhoused in a striking and eye-catching structure, with a stunning \ninterior full of beautiful decor, from ornate chandeliers and \nstaircases to gorgeous glass doors. There is also a gift shop on the \nrestaurant's upper level, with unique and rare gifts that include \ncharming jewelry.\n  Despite its youth, East Restaurant has rapidly accumulated regular \ncustomers and well-deserved accolades. Most recently, Chinese \nRestaurant News, a San Francisco-based monthly publication dedicated to \nthe more than 45,695 Chinese restaurant owners and operators across \nAmerica, named East Restaurant as one of the top 10 Chinese restaurants \nfor overall excellence in the United States, a truly remarkable feat. \nRestaurants were evaluated for eight categories, including decor and \natmosphere, food quality, and sanitation. And because of its \nastonishing appearance, East Restaurant was recognized as the No. 1 \nestablishment in the best decor category. Mr. Li was recently presented \nwith the awards at a ceremony in Las Vegas earlier this month.\n  Mr. Li is an entrepreneur who has consistently aimed to improve each \nof his new ventures. He came to the United States in the mid-1980s with \nminimal knowledge of English and knowing hardly anyone. He began \nworking at the restaurant of a friend of his in New York City, and \nthrough hard work, determination, and perseverance, Mr. Li realized his \ndream and opened his own restaurant. After moving to Maine, he \nestablished several other restaurants and now operates one in the \nneighboring town of Kennebunk, as well as a gift shop in Portland.\n  A civic-minded restaurateur, Mr. Li has constantly found ways to give \nback to the community. An avid contributor to the local Rotary Club and \nthe Wells & Ogunquit Senior Center, Mr. Li has also donated to \nscholarship funds at Wells High School, where his daughter attends.\n  Mr. Li's marvelous story is a reminder of the benefits and rewards of \ncommitment and resolve. His dedication to providing quality food in an \ninviting and distinctive atmosphere is commendable, and the results \nhave been astounding.

A bill to prohibit the importation of ruminants and swine, \nand fresh and frozen meat and products of ruminants and swine, from \nArgentina until the Secretary of Agriculture certifies to Congress that \nevery region of Argentina is free of foot and mouth disease without \nvaccination; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I introduce the Foot and Mouth \nDisease Prevention Act of 2009 with my colleague from Wyoming, Senator \nMike Enzi, and with broad organizational support. I drafted this bill \nwith one goal in mind: to keep America Foot and Mouth Disease, FMD, \nfree.\n  The United States Department of Agriculture, USDA, under the Bush \nadministration proposed throwing open our borders to Argentine \nlivestock, fresh meat and fresh product. While the United States of \nAmerica has been free of FMD without vaccination since 1929, Argentina \nhas consistently struggled with the disease, experiencing outbreaks as \nrecently as 2006. Argentina has failed to remain FMD free for any \nlength of time and arguably lacks the infrastructure necessary for this \nproposal to fly. In fact, a 2001 outbreak in Argentina went unreported \nand was hidden by the Argentine government, raising serious questions \nregarding their communication on this front.\n  The Foot and Mouth Disease Prevention Act of 2009 doesn't interrupt \nthe status quo. Argentina can import product that is dried or cooked, \nfor example, that doesn't pose a risk for disease transmission. And \nwe're not saying that increased trade is permanently prohibited. We are \nsimply asking for Argentina to comply with certain acceptable standards \nfor trade that would ensure the country as a whole is FMD free, and FMD \nfree without vaccination. Additionally, our requirement that the \nSecretary of Agriculture ``certifies to Congress'' that Argentina as a \ncountry is free of FMD is merely a reporting process regarding \nArgentina's disease status.\n  Senator Enzi and I consulted extensively with nationally recognized \nlivestock health experts on USDA's proposal. These livestock health \nexperts resoundingly voiced their concern for USDA's plan, which fails \nto put American farmers and ranchers first. Dr. Sam Holland, South \nDakota State Veterinarian and Past President of the National Assembly \nof State Animal Health Officials, NASAHO, has been instrumental with \noffering his guidance and expertise. A poll was taken within NASAHO and \nthe majority of state veterinarians oppose regionalizing for FMD. While \nregionalization may be an appropriate approach in various other \ncircumstances, it is unequivocally unacceptable in responding to Foot \nand Mouth Disease. An FMD outbreak in the United States is projected to \ncost our agricultural economy billions of dollars, and it is with good \nreason that the American Veterinary Medical Association, AVMA, has \ndeemed FMD to be the most devastating of all livestock diseases.\n  USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services, APHIS, arguably \nviolated its own World Organization for Animal Health-complaint \nregionalization plan in proposing increased meat trade with Argentina. \nAPHIS must address eleven points when initiating the regionalization \nprocess, including points six and seven which speak to the degree of \nseparation of the region and the extent to which movement can be \ndetermined and controlled. Nationally recognized livestock health \nexperts believe that in the case of regionalizing for FMD, sound \nscientific evidence argues against USDA's proposal.\n  This past fall, USDA APHIS Chief Veterinarian Dr. Clifford discussed \nwith my staff his intention not to proceed with the Argentina plan \nuntil a review of the 2005 risk assessment was completed. It is my \nunderstanding that a team will be sent to Argentina to conduct this \nreview in late February. Additionally, the new Administration is \nreviewing proposed rules, of which the Argentina plan is included. \nWhile both of these developments are encouraging, it is essential that \nwe continue to communicate the potentially disastrous consequences of \nthis plan.\n  Organizations across the agricultural industry support this \nlegislation, including the American Sheep Industry Association, United \nStates Cattlemen's Association, R-CALF, National Farmers Union, South \nDakota Stockgrowers Association, South Dakota Cattlemen's Association, \nWyoming Stock Growers Association, South Dakota Farmers Union, Women \nInvolved in Farm Economics, and Dakota Rural Action.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                      South Dakota\n\n\n                                        Animal Industry Board,\n\n                                     Pierre, SD, January 27, 2009.\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Johnson: As a follow-up to our conversation on \n     Regionalization of Argentina for FMD:\n       As you recall NASAHO was overwhelmingly opposed to such \n     regionalization during the last session of congress.\n       As I understand a more current review and risk assessment \n     is planned regarding such regionalization. While a recent \n     review will provide useful risk information, concerns remain.\n       Personally, the issues I stated in the past appear still \n     valid.\n       (1) Economic benefits do not justify the risk of embarking \n     on a regionalization for this disease.\n       (2) Inability to effectively monitor risk on an ongoing \n     basis.\n       (3) Resources, Biosecurity, and experience in monitoring \n     FMD freedom are inadequate.\n       (4) Regionalization for one of the world's most highly \n     contagious virus disease(s) (FMD) is much more complicated \n     than regionalization for tuberculosis, brucellosis and many \n     other diseases. FMD virus is not only arguably the most \n     contagious virus known for animals, but also is particularly \n     resilient in the environment and may persist in fomites and \n     be transmitted by such through aerosol or contact.\n       While I certainly support trade based on science, \n     prioritization must occur. Regionalization efforts should \n     start at home and resources should be spent on enhancing \n     animal health in the United States, along with efforts to \n     increase our exports, prior to spending precious resources in \n     foreign countries in attempts to increase food imports.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Sam D. Holland,\n     State Veterinarian and Executive Secretary.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 U.S. Cattlemen's Association,\n\n                                  San Lucas, CA, January 28, 2009.\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     Hon. Mike Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Sirs: The U.S. Cattlemen's Association (USCA) applauds \n     your leadership in introducing the Foot and Mouth Disease \n     Prevention Act. This bill would prohibit the importation of \n     ruminants and swine and fresh or frozen ruminant and pork \n     products from any region of Argentina until the United States \n     Department of Agriculture (USDA) can certify to Congress that \n     Argentina is free of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD).\n       This bill is extremely important as it protects the U.S. \n     cattle herd from FMD. If FMD\n\n[[Page S996]]\n\n     infiltrates our borders, entire herds would be destroyed \n     leaving ranchers in financial ruin. Furthermore, the scare \n     would immediately shut global markets to U.S. beef products, \n     a move that would have a disastrous economic effect on rural \n     economies.\n       The American Veterinary Medical Association has deemed FMD \n     the most economically devastating of all livestock disease. A \n     recent study by Kansas State University found that an \n     outbreak of FMD would cost the State of Kansas alone nearly \n     $1 billion.\n       Despite the risks, the Department of Agriculture continues \n     to consider the implementation of a regionalized beef trade \n     plan with Argentina. FMD is an airborne disease that will not \n     stop at an imaginary border controlled by a foreign nation. \n     Argentina has proven time and time again that it does not \n     have America's best interests at heart. This is a country \n     that has attacked U.S. agriculture in the World Trade \n     Organization (WTO) and has intentionally turned its back on, \n     and still refuses to pay, billions in U.S. loans despite U.S. \n     court judgments mandating it do so.\n       USCA is committed to working with you and moving this bill \n     forward by garnering support both on Capitol Hill and in the \n     country. USCA is firmly resolved to ensuring the U.S. cattle \n     industry is protected by the highest import standards \n     possible, and to seeing that this bill becomes law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Jon Wooster,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       National Farmers Union,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 27, 2009.\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington D.C.\n       Dear Senator Johnson: On behalf of the family farmers, \n     ranchers and rural residents of National Farmers Union (NFU), \n     I write in strong support of your legislation to prohibit the \n     importation of Argentine ruminants, swine, fresh and frozen \n     meat, and fresh and frozen products from ruminants and swine \n     until the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary \n     certifies the country Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) free \n     without vaccination. I applaud your leadership to ensure all \n     measures are employed to protect the American livestock \n     industry and consumer confidence in our meat supply.\n       The ban proposed in your legislation is necessary in order \n     to prevent jeopardizing our own efforts to eradicate \n     livestock diseases, and thereby protecting the food supply. \n     Your legislation enhances food safety through requiring every \n     region of Argentina to be FMD-free without vaccination before \n     exporting ruminants, swine and meat products to the United \n     States.\n       FMD is a highly infectious virus that, if introduced into \n     the United States, could contaminate entire herds and leave \n     producers in financial ruin, as infected herds must be culled \n     to prevent the spread of the disease. FMD is so devastating \n     the American Veterinary Medical Association considers it to \n     be the most economically destructive of all livestock \n     diseases. The United States suffered nine outbreaks of FMD in \n     the early twentieth century, but has been FMD-free since \n     1929. According to USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection \n     Service, the economic impacts of a re-occurrence of FMD in \n     the United States could cost the economy billions of dollars \n     in the first year alone.\n       America's family farmers and ranchers produce the safest, \n     most abundant food supply in the world. FMD presents a very \n     real threat to American agriculture and its introduction into \n     the United States can and must be prevented. Requiring a \n     country like Argentina, with such an apparent problem with \n     this devastating disease, to prove FMD-free status is an \n     acceptable standard to trade. Opening our borders to \n     Argentine ruminant products is a risk that American producers \n     simply cannot afford. Your legislation is needed to ensure \n     harmful products are not allowed into the United States and \n     that Argentina is not an exception to the rule.\n       I thank you for introducing this important legislation, and \n     look forward to working with you to ensure its passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Tom Buis,\n     President, National Farmers Union.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                            R-CALF\n\n\n                               United Stockgrowers of America,\n\n                                   Billings, MT, January 26, 2009.\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mike Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Johnson and Enzi: On behalf of the thousands \n     of cattle-producing members of R-CALF USA located throughout \n     the United States, we greatly appreciate and strongly support \n     the reintroduction in the 111th Congress of your joint \n     legislation to prohibit the importation of certain animals \n     and animal products from Argentina until every region of \n     Argentina is free of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) without \n     vaccination.\n       Foot-and-mouth disease is recognized internationally as one \n     of the most contagious diseases of cloven-hoofed animals and \n     it bears the potential to cause severe economic losses to \n     U.S. cattle producers. Your legislation recognizes that the \n     most effective prevention measure against this highly \n     contagious disease is to ensure that it is not imported into \n     the United States from countries where FMD is known to exist \n     or was recently detected.\n       R-CALF USA stands ready to assist you in building both \n     industry and congressional support for this important \n     disease-prevention measure. Thank you for reintroducing this \n     needed legislation in the 111th Congress to protect the U.S. \n     cattle industry from the unnecessary and dangerous exposure \n     to FMD from Argentinean imports.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             R.M.

In light of \n     numerous unanswered questions regarding the status of Foot \n     and Mouth Disease in Argentina, we believe passage of the \n     Foot and Mouth Disease Prevention Act is critical to ensure \n     this devastating disease doesn't enter the U.S. cattle herd \n     through the importation of Argentine cattle and beef \n     products.\n       SDCA supports free and fair trade based on OIE standards \n     that will protect the health of our cattle herd and the \n     economic livelihood of our cattlemen. Our top trade priority \n     is to regain market access for U.S. beef in order to \n     recapture the lost value of exports that occurred after the \n     occurrence of BSE in 2003. To that end, we've worked closely \n     with elected and regulatory officials to ensure adequate \n     measures are taken to protect our herd health and maintain \n     consumer confidence in U.S. beef.\n       We commend your willingness to stand up for South Dakota's \n     beef producers and look forward to working with you on this \n     important issue.\n           Regards,\n                                                    Jodie Hickman,\n                                               Executive Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 338. A bill to amend the Omnibus Indian Advancement Act to modify \nthe date as of which certain tribal land of the Lytton Rancheria of \nCalifornia is deemed to be held in trust and to provide for the conduct \nof certain activities on the land; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Lytton \nGaming Oversight Act, a bill that will ensure federal law is followed \nwhen a Native American tribe seeks to operate any new gaming \nfacilities.\n  This legislation is simple, straightforward, and fair. It would amend \nlanguage inserted in the Omnibus Indian Advancement Act of 2000 that \nrequired the Secretary of the Interior to take a card club and adjacent \nparking lot in the San Francisco Bay Area into trust for the Lytton \ntribe as their reservation. That legislation also required that the \nacquisition be backdated to October 17, 1988, before the passage of the \nIndian Gaming Regulatory Act, IGRA.\n  The ``two-part'' determination process in the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act is a critical component to tribal land acquisition for \ngaming purposes and should not be circumvented. Specifically, it \nrequires the Governor's consent and the Secretary of the Interior to \nconsult with nearby tribes and the local community and its \nrepresentatives.\n  The legislation that I am introducing would require the Lytton Band \nof Pomo Indians to follow these same critical oversight guidelines laid \nout in Section 20 of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act before engaging \nin Class III, or Nevada-style, gaming on land acquired after the \npassage of IGRA in 1988.\n  The bill allows the tribe to continue operating a Class II facility \nat the current site provided the tribe follows IGRA regulations for \ngaming on newly-acquired lands in the future. The bill also precludes \nany expansion of the tribe's current Class II facility.\n  The bill would not modify or eliminate the tribe's federal \nrecognition status, alter the trust status of the new reservation, or \ntake away the tribe's ability to conduct gaming through the standard \nprocess prescribed by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. The bill serves \nonly to restore the jurisdiction of IGRA over the gaming process, as \noriginally intended by Congress.\n  Section 20 of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act provides an \nestablished and clear process for gaming on newly-\n\n[[Page S997]]\n\nacquired lands taken into trust after the enactment of IGRA in 1988. \nThe ``two-part determination'' process allows for federal and state \napproval, and for input from nearby tribes and local communities.\n  Circumventing this process can have negative and severe impacts on \nlocal citizens and deprive local and tribal governments of their \nability to represent their communities on an incredibly important and \ncontentious issue.\n  If this bill is not approved, the Lytton tribe could take the former \ncard club that serves as their reservation and turn it into a large \ngaming complex operating outside the regulations set up by the Indian \nGaming Regulatory Act. In fact, this is exactly what was proposed in \nthe summer of 2004.\n  I am pleased that the tribe has abandoned a plan seeking a sizable \nClass III casino, but without this legislation the tribe could reverse \nthese plans at any time. Allowing this to happen would set a dangerous \nprecedent in California and any state where tribal gaming is permitted.\n  Instead, Congress should reaffirm its intent that all new gaming \nfacilities should be subject to IGRA without preference or prejudice.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, Mr. Begich, and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 342. A bill to provide for the treatment of service as a member of \nthe Alaska Territorial Guard during World War II as active service for \npurposes of retired pay for members of the Armed Forces; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Last Thursday evening I came to the floor to speak to \na decision by the United States Army, I understand at the urging of the \nDepartment of Defense, to reverse its position on whether service in \nthe Alaska Territorial Guard during World War II is creditable toward \nmilitary retirement. I have asked repeatedly for a copy of the legal \nopinion supporting this decision. I am still waiting.\n  One of the most troubling aspects of the decision was that it was to \ncome into effect on February 1, 2009, in the dead of Alaska winter, and \nwithout any advance warning to those affected. The decision reduces the \nretirement pay received by 25 or 26 former members of the Territorial \nGuard by as much as $557 a month for one individual. The reduction in \nretirement pay to several others exceeds $500 a month. That is a \nsubstantial loss of income at any time of the year but it is especially \ndifficult during the winter.\n  This afternoon, Pete Geren, the Secretary of the Army, announced that \nthe Army would make a onetime gratuitous payment from funds \nappropriated to cover emergency and extraordinary expenses to these \nindividuals, representing 2 months of the difference between what each \nwould receive if service in the Alaska Territorial Guard were included \nin the retirement pay calculation and what each will receive as a \nretirement check beginning on February 1, 2009. I deeply appreciate \nSecretary Geren's compassionate decision. Increases in the cost of food \nand heat are making it very difficult for our Native people in rural \nAlaska to make ends meet this winter. I understand that the vast \nmajority, if not the entire list of people who will receive this \nadditional payment live in the villages of rural Alaska.\n  However, I remain disappointed that the Army cannot continue its \npolicy of paying retirement benefits on account of Alaska Territorial \nGuard service. Today I join with my colleagues in introducing \nlegislation that clarifies that service in the Alaska Territorial Guard \nduring World War II is creditable toward military retirement.\n  Since I raised this issue on the floor last Thursday evening the \nresponse I have received from around the country has been nothing but \noverwhelming. I deeply appreciate all of those who have called and \nwritten to express their support for our efforts to protect the \nbenefits that the members of our Alaska Territorial Guard earned \nthrough their legendary service.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nsupporting material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 342\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

So they've cut off some men in their 80s who \n     worked for nothing to defend Alaska during the war. The \n     argument is that a law that recognized their service was only \n     intended to provide benefits like health care, not retirement \n     pay. The Army says the law was misinterpreted. Then the Army \n     should stand by its misinterpretation and pay these men. \n     They're in their 80s. They served their country at a time \n     when neither their country nor their territory fully \n     recognized their rights because they were Natives. Their \n     guard service should count toward retirement pay out of sheer \n     decency. Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Mark Begich are working on \n     legislation to make the misinterpretation stand by making it \n     the law. Good. We don't care if the means is legislation, \n     executive order, administrative waiver or papal dispensation. \n     Just fix this so that some old men who did honorable service \n     get their due. Now. These soldiers earned their retirement \n     pay. They should receive it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, Jan. 25, 2009]\n\n    Credit for Service: Restore Retirement Pay to the Eskimo Scouts\n\n       The wheels of bureaucracy turn slowly, but they grind no \n     less thoroughly for their lack of speed. Unless the federal \n     administration and Alaska's congressional delegation can \n     reverse a recent decision, retirement pensions for a few \n     dozen old soldiers from Alaska's Territorial Guard will fall \n     victim to those wheels. The question of whether service in \n     the Territorial Guard--better known as the Eskimo Scouts--\n     counted as active-duty service for purposes of calculating \n     military retirement pay was answered years ago. In 2001, \n     Congress said yes, it counts. At least that's what most \n     people thought Congress said. The Department of Defense, for \n     example, concluded as much and began sending retirement \n     checks to elderly Alaskans based on their service as Eskimo \n     Scouts. Recently, the Department of Defense reversed its \n     decision. It now asserts that the law requires credit when \n     calculating military benefits such as health care--but not \n     when calculating retirement pay. So, as of Feb. 1, according \n     to the congressional delegation, retirement benefits will be \n     cut by more than $500 per month in some cases. An Army \n     spokesman said the decision simply reinterprets the 2001 law \n     as it should have been all along. If that's the case, the law \n     should be clarified. That could take some time for the \n     congressional delegation to accomplish, though. In the \n     meantime, the Defense Department needs to find a better \n     solution than simply cutting the pay to a group of elderly \n     military pensioners. The issue arises because the Eskimo \n     Scouts from 1942 to 1947 were volunteers. Their service was \n     no less real than others in the military, especially since \n     they worked in Alaska, the only place in the country where \n     enemy forces successfully occupied territory during World War \n     II. The Japanese held several islands in the Aleutian chain \n     and bombed Dutch Harbor. It was real military service; those \n     who signed up deserve full credit for it, as Congress \n     intended.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/28/senate-section/article/S997-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S997-S998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 24--COMMENDING CHINA'S CHARTER 08 MOVEMENT AND \n  RELATED EFFORTS FOR UPHOLDING THE UNIVERSALITY OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND \n                 ADVANCING DEMOCRATIC REFORMS IN CHINA\n\n  Mr. CASEY (for himself and Mr. Brownback) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n[[Page S998]]\n\n                               S.

WILLS, which nominations were received by the Senate and \n     appeared in the Congressional Record of January 7, 2009.\n\n\n                     Nomination of Dennis C. Blair\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today as chairman of the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence to urge the Senate to confirm Admiral Dennis \nC. Blair to be the next Director of National Intelligence.\n  Admiral Blair is well known to many of us from his years of service \nas the Commander in Chief of the U.S. Pacific Command. He has served \nwith distinction in the national security field all his adult life, \nentering the Naval Academy in 1964 and serving for 34 years.\n  During his naval career, Admiral Blair was involved in the \nintelligence field and in policymaking. He worked twice in the White \nHouse, first as a fellow and then on the National Security Council \nstaff. He worked for 2 years at the CIA as the Associate Director for \nMilitary Support. And he was named to be the Director of the Joint \nStaff in 1996.\n  He has been a consumer and a manager of intelligence through his \ncareer, and he has a strong understanding of the importance of \nproviding the President, the Congress, and other policymakers with \naccurate, actionable, and timely intelligence.\n  Admiral Blair will be the Nation's third Director of National \nIntelligence, a position that was left vacant by the resignation of ADM \nMike McConnell earlier this week. It is critical that Admiral Blair be \nconfirmed so that the intelligence community has the leadership it \nneeds.\n  I hope that the Senate will confirm Admiral Blair on a strong \nbipartisan basis, sending the signal that we are united in our support \nfor the nominee and in our interest in strong leadership of the \nintelligence community.\n  The position of the Director of National Intelligence was created so \nthat there would be a single leader of the 16 intelligence agencies who \ncould bring greater integration to the work of U.S. intelligence. The \njob of the Director is to break down the stovepipes and put \nintelligence agencies back on the right track when they go astray.\n  Progress has been made by the previous Directors, Ambassador \nNegroponte and Admiral McConnell, but they would agree much work is \nahead. As Admiral Blair said to the committee, it will be his job as \nthe DNI to see that ``the whole of the national intelligence enterprise \nis always more than the sum of its parts.''\n  Admiral Blair has pledged, however, to take forceful action when \nthere are disagreements or when he believes an agency is not performing \nas it should.\n  He has a keen appreciation both for the many smart, dedicated and \nbrave professionals in the intelligence community workforce and for the \nrole of the DNI to give these professionals the right missions, and the \nright tools, to collect the intelligence we need and conduct \nprofessional and accurate analysis.\n  President-elect Obama announced his intention to nominate Admiral \nBlair on January 9, 2009, and then President Obama submitted the \nnomination to the Senate on his first afternoon in office. The \nIntelligence Committee carefully reviewed Admiral Blair's record and \nhis views on the role of the Director of National Intelligence, the \nthreats facing the United States, and the appropriate way for the \nintelligence community to handle its missions.\n  The committee held a public hearing with Admiral Blair on January 22, \nat which he was introduced and supported by our distinguished colleague \nand very first chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator \nInouye.\n  Before and after the hearing, Admiral Blair answered numerous \nquestions for the record. His answers can be found on the committee's \nWeb site, and I commend them to all Members and the public for a better \nunderstanding of his views about the important office to which he has \nbeen nominated, and the challenges he will face on behalf of the \nAmerican people.\n  I have been especially pleased with the commitment of Admiral Blair \nto address the issue of congressional oversight. In our prehearing \nquestions, we asked Admiral Blair about his views on keeping the \nintelligence committees fully and currently informed of intelligence \nactivities.\n  We asked him to address in particular the failure to brief the entire \nmembership of the intelligence committees on the CIA's interrogation, \ndetention, and rendition program, and the NSA's electronic surveillance \nprogram. His direct answer recognized a fundamental truth: ``These \nprograms were less effective and did not have sufficient legal and \nconstitutional foundations because the intelligence committees were \nprevented from carrying out their oversight responsibilities.''\n  Admiral Blair has pledged that he will work closely with the \ncommittee and the Congress to build a relationship of trust and candor. \nHe has said that the leadership of the intelligence community must earn \nthe support and trust of the intelligence oversight committees if it is \nto earn the trust and support of the American people. I wholeheartedly \nagree.\n  I am confident that Admiral Blair will ensure that the membership of \nthe select committee is given access to the information it needs to \nperform its oversight role, and U.S. intelligence programs will have a \nstronger foundation because of it.\n  He has also agreed to come before the committee on a monthly basis to \nhave candid discussions with all members on the major issues he sees \nand the challenges he faces. These sessions are enormously important \nfor the committee to truly understand the workings of the intelligence \ncommunity and to carry out our oversight responsibilities.\n  In addition, Admiral Blair will have a pivotal role in the \nimplementation of the recent presidential Executive orders to close the \ndetention center in Guantanamo and ensure there is a single standard \nfor the humane and lawful treatment of detainees by U.S. military and \nintelligence services.\n  These executive orders represent an extraordinarily important turning \npoint for our Nation. Admiral Blair has made strong statements to the \ncommittee that torture is not moral, legal, or effective, and that the \nU.S. Government must have a single clear standard for the treatment and \ninterrogation of detainees. I am convinced he will help ensure we are \nonce more true to our ideals and protecting our national security.\n  Having been an early advocate of the creation of the position, it is \nfor me a distinct honor that my very first floor responsibility as the \nnew chairman of the Intelligence Committee is to report this \nnomination.\n  I am pleased to relay to my colleagues that the Intelligence \nCommittee met today, on January 28, and voted to report favorably the \nnomination of Admiral Blair to be the Director of National \nIntelligence.\n  The Senate has moved quickly to act on this recommendation. It is a \ntestament to the importance of the position and the qualifications of \nthe nominee. I thank the vice chairman for working with me to move the \nnomination quickly but with the due diligence appropriate for this \nposition.\n  Admiral Blair has my strong support to lead the intelligence \ncommunity and I look forward to working with him closely in the days to \ncome.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Admiral Denny \nBlair on his unanimous confirmation as the Director of National \nIntelligence, one of the most important and demanding jobs in our \ngovernment. This position requires a leader with tremendous management \nskills--someone capable of bringing the 16 disparate agencies of the \nintelligence community into a cohesive organization that provides \ntimely, accurate intelligence to our government.\n  This intelligence is necessary to keep our Nation and our people \nsafe, so Admiral Blair undertakes a sober, solemn responsibility today. \nHe will take on this task at a time when we are fighting two wars as \nwell as a global fight against terrorist networks, not to mention \nenormous long-term strategic challenges--including those that have \narisen in recent months in the wake of the global financial and \neconomic crisis.\n  These are perilous times, but I am confident he is up to the task. \nAdmiral Blair brings a wealth of valuable experience to the job. As a \nsenior military commander he was a high level consumer of intelligence \nand familiar with the systems used to collect and produce intelligence. \nHe also knows the Central Intelligence Agency having spent time as the \nfirst Associate Director for Military Affairs.\n\n[[Page S1004]]\n\n  Perhaps his greatest attribute, however, is his experience directing \na large, sprawling organization, made up of disparate agencies and \ncultures, to achieve a common mission. That is what he accomplished \nsuccessfully as the commander of all U.S. military forces in the \nPacific, and that is exactly what his mission will be as the DNI.\n  I think this is a very promising time for our intelligence community \nand our national security, and Admiral Blair's confirmation is a big \npart of that. I want to underscore what he told us in his confirmation \nhearing--that we are entering a ``new era in the relationship'' between \nCongress and the executive branch on matters of intelligence.\n  Specifically, Admiral Blair said that he will place great importance \non keeping Congress informed--not just formally notified, but fully \ninformed--on intelligence activities. He said that he will work to \nensure that classification is not used as a way to, in his words, \n``hide things'' from Members of Congress who need to know about them.\n  He stated clearly and I quote, ``We need to have processes which \ndon't just check a block on telling somebody but actually get the \ninformation across to the right people.''\n  These are very important commitments, and they portend good things \nfor our intelligence community and for our national security. I have \nhad the opportunity to speak with Admiral in great depth over the past \nseveral months, and these discussions have given me confidence in his \nsincerity with these commitments.\n  And I expect that, likewise, he and the Obama administration have \nconfidence that Congress will hold them to it. In fact this cooperation \nhas already begun.\n  With this new era of cooperation in mind, I want to state for the \nrecord that we have an opportunity to make a sharp turn toward new \nintelligence policies that will bolster our counterterrorism efforts \nand strengthen our national security in general.\n  To be accurate and valuable, intelligence must be politically neutral \ninformation, not spin. And it must be collected with methods that enjoy \nbipartisan support as both legal and effective.\n  To ensure this, secret intelligence activities must be subject to \nrigorous congressional oversight. We are the only independent reviewers \nof secret intelligence activities, and we are the only outside check on \nactivities that are not legal or not effective.\n  Oversight should not be adversarial--it is a necessary partnership \nbetween the executive branch and the Congress.\n  I have fought to remove politics from intelligence and to restore \nCongress's vital oversight role since I joined the committee in 2001, \nand I will keep fighting for it now.\n  I don't want to get into who is at fault for the cycle we were caught \nin over the past several years. Instead I want to look ahead to what is \npossible now.\n  I think there is a real chance that in this new year, we can have a \nnew start.\n  We can and should debate how we go about collecting and analyzing \nintelligence--for instance on interrogation policies--but we can do \nthat without the stain of political considerations.\n  Between the executive and legislative branches, we can and should \nengage and debate these policies, but we can do that in partnership, \nwith the knowledge that more information exchanges and deliberations \ngive rise to better intelligence collection and analysis.\n  In short, we can recognize that we are all on the same team when it \ncomes to finding out the sensitive information we need to protect this \ngreat Nation.\n  If we play on that same team, I know we can have accurate, reliable \nintelligence that is collected in a way that makes this country proud, \nand is analyzed without the taint of political influence.\n  I congratulate Admiral Denny Blair on his confirmation.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I wish to express my support for the \nnomination of ADM Dennis Blair to be the next Director of National \nIntelligence.\n  Over the past several weeks, Admiral Blair and I have spoken at \nlength about the role of the DNI and the expectations that we in \nCongress will have of him.\n  First and foremost, we expect that the DNI will direct the \nintelligence community and not be a coordinator or consensus-seeker or \ngovern by majority.\n  Second, the DNI must be a strong leader, standing on equal footing \nwith the Secretary of Defense and other Cabinet officials.\n  Third, the DNI must assert appropriate authority over the CIA--it is \nthe DNI, and the DNI alone, who should speak and act as the President's \nintelligence adviser.\n  I am pleased that Admiral Blair has pledged that he will come back to \nCongress to ask for any additional authorities if he determines that \nsuch authorities are needed to direct the intelligence community.\n  The intelligence community needs a strong leader right now. As we \nknow, last week the President signed a number of Executive orders that \nnot only will have a lasting impact on how we fight this war on terror \nbut have created immediate and serious legal and practical problems in \nhandling terrorist detainees.\n  Admiral Blair will play a key role in the implementation of these \nExecutive orders.\n  I believe that the sooner he learns all the facts about the CIA's \ninterrogation and detention program and the ramifications of closing \nGuantanamo Bay, the better he will be able to guide that process in a \nmanner that will not jeopardize American lives.\n  Admiral Blair has had a long and distinguished career in Government \nservice. He brings a lifetime of sound judgment and strong character to \nthis difficult job.\n  I believe Admiral Blair is up to the task of leading the intelligence \ncommunity and I would urge my colleagues to support his nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/28/senate-section/article/S1004-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NOMINATIONS DISCHARGED\n\n  Mr. TESTER.
