Pursuant to the order of the Senate \nof January 24, 1901, as modified on January 30, 2009, the Senator from \nNebraska, Mr. Johanns, having been appointed by the Vice President, \nwill now read Washington's Farewell Address, as follows:\n  Mr. JOHANNS, at the rostrum, read the Farewell Address, as follows:\n\n  To the people of the United States:\n  Friends and Fellow Citizens: The period for a new election of a \ncitizen to administer the executive government of the United States \nbeing not far distant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts \nmust be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with \nthat important trust, it appears to me proper, especially as it may \nconduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I \nshould now apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to decline \nbeing considered among the number of those out of whom a choice is to \nbe made.\n  I beg you at the same time to do me the justice to be assured, that \nthis resolution has not been taken without strict regard to all the \nconsiderations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful \ncitizen to his country--and that, in withdrawing the tender of service \nwhich silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by no \ndiminution of zeal for your future interest, no deficiency of grateful \nrespect for your past kindness, but am supported by a full conviction \nthat the step is compatible with both.\n  The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the office to which \nyour suffrages have twice called me have been a uniform sacrifice of \ninclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what \nappeared to be your desire. I constantly hoped that it would have been \nmuch earlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at \nliberty to disregard, to return to that retirement from which I had \nbeen reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this, \nprevious to the last election, had even led to the preparation of an \naddress to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then \nperplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations, and \nthe unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence, impelled me \nto abandon the idea.\n  I rejoice that the state of your concerns external as well as \ninternal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible \nwith the sentiment of duty or propriety; and am persuaded, whatever \npartiality may be retained for my services, that in the present \ncircumstances of our country you will not disapprove my determination \nto retire.\n  The impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust were \nexplained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust, I \nwill only say that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards \nthe organization and administration of the government the best \nexertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not \nunconscious in the outset of the inferiority of my qualifications, \nexperience, in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, \nhas strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself; and, every day, \nthe increasing weight of years admonishes me more and more that the \nshade of retirement is as necessary to me as\n\n[[Page S2350]]\n\nit will be welcome. Satisfied that if any circumstances have given \npeculiar value to my services, they were temporary, I have the \nconsolation to believe that, while choice and prudence invite me to \nquit the political scene, patriotism does not forbid it.\n  In looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate the \ncareer of my political life, my feelings do not permit me to suspend \nthe deep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my \nbeloved country for the many honors it has conferred upon me, still \nmore for the steadfast confidence with which it has supported me and \nfor the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my \ninviolable attachment by services faithful and persevering, though in \nusefulness unequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to our country \nfrom these services, let it always be remembered to your praise and as \nan instructive example in our annals, that, under circumstances in \nwhich the passions agitated in every direction were liable to mislead, \namidst appearances sometimes dubious, vicissitudes of fortune often \ndiscouraging, in situations in which not unfrequently, want of success \nhas countenanced the spirit of criticism, the constancy of your support \nwas the essential prop of the efforts and a guarantee of the plans by \nwhich they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I shall \ncarry it with me to my grave as a strong incitement to unceasing vows \nthat Heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence; \nthat your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual; that the free \nconstitution, which is the work of your hands, may be sacredly \nmaintained; that its administration in every department may be stamped \nwith wisdom and virtue; that, in fine, the happiness of the people of \nthese states, under the auspices of liberty, may be made complete by so \ncareful a preservation and so prudent a use of this blessing as will \nacquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applause, the \naffection, and adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.\n  Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare, \nwhich cannot end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger \nnatural to that solicitude, urge me on an occasion like the present to \noffer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent \nreview, some sentiments which are the result of much reflection, of no \ninconsiderable observation, and which appear to me all important to the \npermanency of your felicity as a people. These will be offered to you \nwith the more freedom as you can only see in them the disinterested \nwarnings of a parting friend, who can possibly have no personal motive \nto bias his counsel. Nor can I forget, as an encouragement to it, your \nindulgent reception of my sentiments on a former and not dissimilar \noccasion.\n  Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your \nhearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm \nthe attachment.\n  The unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now \ndear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of \nyour real independence, the support of your tranquility at home, your \npeace abroad, of your safety, of your prosperity, of that very liberty \nwhich you so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that, from \ndifferent causes and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, \nmany artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this \ntruth; as this is the point in your political fortress against which \nthe batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly \nand actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of \ninfinite movement that you should properly estimate the immense value \nof your national Union to your collective and individual happiness; \nthat you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment \nto it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the \npalladium of your political safety and prosperity; watching for its \npreservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may \nsuggest even a suspicion that it can, in any event, be abandoned; and \nindignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to \nalienate any portion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the \nsacred ties which now link together the various parts.\n  For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens \nby birth or choice of a common country, that country has a right to \nconcentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you \nin your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of \npatriotism more than any appellation derived from local \ndiscriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same \nreligion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have in a \ncommon cause fought and triumphed together. The independence and \nliberty you possess, are the work of joint councils and joint efforts--\nof common dangers, sufferings and successes.\n  But these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves \nto your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more \nimmediately to your interest. Here every portion of our country finds \nthe most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the \nUnion of the whole.\n  The North, in an unrestrained intercourse with the South, protected \nby the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of \nthe latter, great additional resources of maritime and commercial \nenterprise, and precious materials of manufacturing industry. The \nSouth, in the same intercourse, benefiting by the same agency of the \nNorth, sees its agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning \npartly into its own channels the seamen of the North, it finds its \nparticular navigation invigorated; and while it contributes, in \ndifferent ways, to nourish and increase the general mass of the \nnational navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime \nstrength to which itself is unequally adapted. The East, in a like \nintercourse with the West, already finds, and in the progressive \nimprovement of interior communications by land and water will more and \nmore find a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from \nabroad or manufactures at home. The West derives from the East supplies \nrequisite to its growth and comfort--and what is perhaps of still \ngreater consequence, it must of necessity owe the secure enjoyment of \nindispensable outlets for its own productions to the weight, influence, \nand the future maritime strength of the Atlantic side of the Union, \ndirected by an indissoluble community of interest as one nation. Any \nother tenure by which the West can hold this essential advantage, \nwhether derived from its own separate strength or from an apostate and \nunnatural connection with any foreign power, must be intrinsically \nprecarious.\n  While then every part of our country thus feels an immediate and \nparticular interest in union, all the parts combined cannot fail to \nfind in the united mass of means and efforts greater strength, greater \nresource, proportionably greater security from external danger, a less \nfrequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is \nof inestimable value! they must derive from union an exemption from \nthose broils and wars between themselves which so frequently afflict \nneighboring countries not tied together by the same government, which \ntheir own rivalships alone would be sufficient to produce, but which \nopposite foreign alliances, attachments, and intrigues would stimulate \nand embitter. Hence likewise, they will avoid the necessity of those \novergrown military establishments, which under any form of government \nare inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as \nparticularly hostile to republican liberty. In this sense it is, that \nyour Union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty, and \nthat the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the \nother.\n  These considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting \nand virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the Union as a \nprimary object of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt whether a common \ngovernment can embrace so large a sphere? Let experience solve it. To \nlisten to mere speculation in such a case were criminal. We are \nauthorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the \nauxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions, will \nafford a happy issue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and \nfull experiment. With such powerful and obvious motives to union, \naffecting all parts of our\n\n[[Page S2351]]\n\ncountry, while experience shall not have demonstrated its \nimpracticability, there will always be reason to distrust the \npatriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to weaken its \nbands.\n  In contemplating the causes which may disturb our Union, it occurs as \nmatter of serious concern, that any ground should have been furnished \nfor characterizing parties by geographical discriminations--northern \nand southern--Atlantic and western; whence designing men may endeavor \nto excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests \nand views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within \nparticular districts, is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other \ndistricts. You cannot shield yourself too much against the jealousies \nand heart burnings which spring from these misrepresentations. They \ntend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together \nby fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our western country have \nlately had a useful lesson on this head. They have seen, in the \nnegotiation by the executive--and in the unanimous ratification by the \nSenate--of the treaty with Spain, and in the universal satisfaction at \nthat event throughout the United States, a decisive proof how unfounded \nwere the suspicions propagated among them of a policy in the general \ngovernment and in the Atlantic states, unfriendly to their interests in \nregard to the Mississippi. They have been witnesses to the formation of \ntwo treaties, that with Great Britain and that with Spain, which secure \nto them everything they could desire, in respect to our foreign \nrelations, towards confirming their prosperity. Will it not be their \nwisdom to rely for the preservation of these advantages on the Union by \nwhich they were procured? Will they not henceforth be deaf to those \nadvisers, if such they are, who would sever them from their brethren \nand connect them with aliens?\n  To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the \nwhole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts \ncan be an adequate substitute. They must inevitably experience the \ninfractions and interruptions which all alliances, in all times, have \nexperienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon \nyour first essay, by the adoption of a Constitution of government, \nbetter calculated than your former, for an intimate Union and for the \nefficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the \noffspring of our own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full \ninvestigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its \nprinciples, in the distribution of its powers, uniting security with \nenergy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, \nhas a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its \nauthority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are \nduties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of \nour political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter \ntheir constitutions of government.--But the Constitution which at any \ntime exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the \nwhole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the \npower, and the right of the people to establish government, presupposes \nthe duty of every individual to obey the established government.\n  All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and \nassociations under whatever plausible character, with the real design \nto direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and \naction of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this \nfundamental principle, and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize \nfaction; to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in \nthe place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party, \noften a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community; \nand, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make \nthe public administration the mirror of the ill concerted and \nincongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent \nand wholesome plans digested by common councils, and modified by mutual \ninterests. However combinations or associations of the above \ndescription may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely, in \nthe course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which \ncunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the \npower of the people, and to usurp for themselves the reins of \ngovernment; destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted \nthem to unjust dominion.\n  Towards the preservation of your government and the permanency of \nyour present happy state, it is requisite, not only that you steadily \ndiscountenance irregular opposition to its acknowledged authority but \nalso that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its \nprinciples, however specious the pretext. One method of assault may be \nto effect, in the forms of the Constitution, alterations which will \nimpair the energy of the system and thus to undermine what cannot be \ndirectly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, \nremember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true \ncharacter of governments as of other human institutions, that \nexperience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of \nthe existing constitution of a country, that facility in changes upon \nthe credit of mere hypotheses and opinion exposes to perpetual change \nfrom the endless variety of hypotheses and opinion; and remember, \nespecially, that for the efficient management of your common interests \nin a country so extensive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is \nconsistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable; \nliberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly \ndistributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is indeed little else \nthan a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand the \nenterprises of fraction, to confine each member of the society within \nthe limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure \nand tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.\n  I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state, \nwith particular reference to the founding of them on geographical \ndiscriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view and warn you \nin the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of \nparty, generally.\n  This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having \nits root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under \ndifferent shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, \nor repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its \ngreatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.\n  The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by \nthe spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different \nages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is \nitself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal \nand permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result \ngradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the \nabsolute power of an individual; and, sooner or later, the chief of \nsome prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his \ncompetitors, turns this disposition to the purpose of his own elevation \non the ruins of public liberty.\n  Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind, (which \nnevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight) the common and \ncontinual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it in \nthe interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.\n  It serves always to distract the public councils, and enfeeble the \npublic administration. It agitates the community with ill founded \njealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against \nanother, forments occasional riot and insurrection. It opens the door \nto foreign influence and corruption, which finds a facilitated access \nto the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus \nthe policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and \nwill of another.\n  There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks \nupon the administration of the government, and serve to keep alive the \nspirit of liberty. This within certain limits is probably true--and in \ngovernments of a monarchial cast, patriotism may look with indulgence, \nif not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the \npopular character, in governments\n\n[[Page S2352]]\n\npurely elective, it is a spirit not to be encouraged. From their \nnatural tendency, it is certain there will always be enough of that \nspirit for every salutary purpose. And there being constant danger of \nexcess, the effort ought to be by force of public opinion to mitigate \nand assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, it demands a uniform \nvigilance to prevent it bursting into a flame, lest instead of warming, \nit should consume.\n  It is important likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free \ncountry should inspire caution in those entrusted with its \nadministration to confine themselves within their respective \nconstitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one \ndepartment to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends \nto consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to \ncreate, whatever the form of government, a real despotism. A just \nestimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which \npredominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the \ntruth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the \nexercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into \ndifferent depositories, and constituting each the guardian of the \npublic weal against invasions of the others, has been evinced by \nexperiments ancient and modern, some of them in our country and under \nour own eyes. To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute \nthem. If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or \nmodification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, \nlet it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution \ndesignates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for though this, \nin one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary \nweapon by which free governments are destroyed. The precedent must \nalways greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient \nbenefit which the use can at any time yield.\n  Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political \nprosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain \nwould that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to \nsubvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of \nthe duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the \npious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not \ntrace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it \nsimply be asked where is the security for property, for reputation, for \nlife, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths, which are \nthe instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with \ncaution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without \nreligion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined \neducation on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both \nforbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of \nreligious principle.\n  It is substantially true, that virtue or morality is a necessary \nspring of popular government. The rule, indeed, extends with more or \nless force to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere \nfriend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the \nfoundation of the fabric?\n  Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for \nthe general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a \ngovernment gives force to public opinion, it is essential that the \npublic opinion should be enlightened.\n  As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public \ncredit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as \npossible, avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but \nremembering, also, that timely disbursements, to prepare for danger, \nfrequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding \nlikewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of \nexpense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge the \ndebts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously \nthrowing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear. \nThe execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives, but it \nis necessary that public opinion should cooperate. To facilitate to \nthem the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should \npractically bear in mind that towards the payment of debts there must \nbe revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can \nbe devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant; that \nthe intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the \nproper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to be a \ndecisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the \ngovernment in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the \nmeasures for obtaining revenue, which the public exigencies may at any \ntime dictate.\n  Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace \nand harmony with all; religion and morality enjoin this conduct, and \ncan it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be \nworthy of a free, enlightened, and, at no distant period, a great \nnation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a \npeople always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can \ndoubt but, in the course of time and things the fruits of such a plan \nwould richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a \nsteady adherence to it? Can it be that Providence has not connected the \npermanent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment, at \nleast, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. \nAlas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?\n  In the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential than that \npermanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and \npassionate attachment for others should be excluded and that in place \nof them just and amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated. \nThe nation which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an \nhabitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its \nanimosity, or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead \nit astray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy in one nation \nagainst another disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury, \nto lay hold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and \nintractable when accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur. \nHence frequent collisions, obstinate, envenomed, and bloody contests. \nThe nation, prompted by ill will and resentment, sometimes impels to \nwar the government, contrary to the best calculations of policy. The \ngovernment sometimes participates in the national propensity and adopts \nthrough passion what reason would reject; at other times, it makes the \nanimosity of the nation's subservient to projects of hostility, \ninstigated by pride, ambition and other sinister and pernicious \nmotives. The peace often, sometimes perhaps the liberty of nations, has \nbeen the victim.\n  So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another \nproduces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, \nfacilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases \nwhere no real common interest exists and infusing into one the enmities \nof the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels \nand wars of the latter, without adequate inducements or justifications. \nIt leads also to concessions, to the favorite nation of privileges \ndenied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the \nconcessions, by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been \nretained and by exciting jealously, ill will, and a disposition to \nretaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld. And \nit gives to ambitious, corrupted or deluded citizens (who devote \nthemselves to the favorite nation) facility to betray or sacrifice the \ninterests of their own country, without odium, sometimes even with \npopularity gilding with the appearances of virtuous sense of \nobligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable \nzeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, \ncorruption, or infatuation.\n  As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments \nare particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent \npatriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic \nfactions, to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, \nto influence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment of a small \nor weak towards a great and powerful nation, dooms the former to be the \nsatellite of the latter.\n  Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to \nbelieve me, fellow citizens) the jealousy of a free\n\n[[Page S2353]]\n\npeople ought to be constantly awake, since history and experience \nprove, that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of \nrepublican government. But that jealously to be useful must be \nimpartial; else it becomes the instrument of the very influence to be \navoided, instead of a defense against it. Excessive partiality for one \nforeign nation and excessive dislike for another cause those whom they \nactuate to see danger only on one side, and serve to veil and even \nsecond the arts of influence on the other. Real patriots, who may \nresist the intrigues of the favorite, are liable to become suspected \nand odious, while its tools and dupes usurp the applause and confidence \nof the people to surrender their interests.\n  The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is, in \nextending our commercial relations, to have with them as little \npolitical connection as possible. So far as we have already formed \nengagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us \nstop.\n  Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none or a \nvery remote relation. Hence, she must be engaged in frequent \ncontroversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our \nconcerns. Hence therefore it must be unwise in us to implicate \nourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her \npolitics or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships \nor enmities.\n  Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a \ndifferent course. If we remain one people, under an efficient \ngovernment, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury \nfrom external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will \ncause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously \nrespected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making \nacquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us \nprovocation, when we may choose peace or war, as our interest guided by \njustice shall counsel.\n  Why forgo the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own \nto stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with \nthat of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the \ntoils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice?\n  It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any \nportion of the foreign world--so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty \nto do it, for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing \ninfidelity to existing engagements. (I hold the maxim no less \napplicable to public than private affairs, that honesty is always the \nbest policy)--I repeat it, therefore, let those engagements be observed \nin their genuine sense. But in my opinion, it is unnecessary, and would \nbe unwise to extend them.\n  Taking care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on \na respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary \nalliances for extraordinary emergencies.\n  Harmony, liberal intercourse with all nations, are recommended by \npolicy, humanity, and interest. But even our commercial policy should \nhold an equal and impartial hand: neither seeking nor granting \nexclusive favors or preferences; consulting the natural course of \nthings; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of \ncommerce but forcing nothing; establishing with powers so disposed, in \norder to give trade a stable course--in order to give to trade a stable \ncourse, to define the rights of our merchants, and to enable the \ngovernment to support them, conventional rules of intercourse, the best \nthat present circumstances and mutual opinion will permit, but \ntemporary, and liable to be from time to time abandoned or varied as \nexperience and circumstances shall dictate; constantly keeping in view, \nthat it is folly in one nation to look for disinterested favors from \nanother--that is must pay with a portion of its independence for \nwhatever it may accept under that character--that by such acceptance, \nit may place itself in the condition of having given equivalents for \nnominal favors and yet of being reproached with ingratitude for not \ngiving more. There can be no greater error than to expect or calculate \nupon real favors from nation to nation. It is an illusion which \nexperience must cure, which a just pride ought to discard.\n  In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and \naffectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and \nlasting impression I could wish--that they will control the usual \ncurrent of the passions or prevent our nation from running the course \nwhich has hitherto marked the destiny of nations. But if I may even \nflatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, \nsome occasional good, that they may now and then recur to moderate the \nfury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign \nintrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism--this \nhope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by \nwhich they have been dictated.\n  How far in the discharge of my official duties, I have been guided by \nthe principles which have been delineated, the public records and other \nevidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To \nmyself, the assurance of my own conscience is, that I have, at least, \nbelieved myself to be guided by them.\n  In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe, my proclamation of \nthe 22d of April 1793 is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your \napproving voice and by that of your representatives in both houses of \nCongress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed me, \nuninfuenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.\n  After deliberate examination with the aid of the best lights I could \nobtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the \ncircumstances of the case, had a right to take, and was bound in duty \nand interest to take--a neutral position. Having taken it, I \ndetermined, as far as should depend upon me, to maintain it with \nmoderation, perseverance and firmness.\n  The considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct it is \nnot necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe that, \naccording to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from \nbeing denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually \nadmitted by all.\n  The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without \nanything more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on \nevery nation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain \ninviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.\n  The inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be \nreferred to your own reflections and experience. With me, a predominant \nmotive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and \nmature its yet recent institutions and to progress, without \ninterruption to that degree of strength and consistency which is \nnecessary to give it, humanly speaking, the command of its own \nfortunes.\n  Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration I am \nunconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my \ndefects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. \nWhatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or \nmitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me \nthe hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence \nand that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service \nwith an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be \nconsigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.\n  Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by \nthat fervent love towards it which is so natural to a man who views in \nit the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several \ngenerations, I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat, in \nwhich I promise myself to realize without alloy the sweet enjoyment of \npartaking in the midst of my fellow citizens the benign influence of \ngood laws under a free government--the ever favorite object of my \nheart, and the happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors \nand dangers.\nGeo.

The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Universal Health Care\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, for the past several years, it has \nbeen my great privilege to travel around my home State of Rhode Island \nand hear directly from the people I was elected to serve--to listen to \nwhat is on their minds, their good news and their worries and the \nchallenges and opportunities they and their families face every day.\n  I regularly hold community dinners in Rhode Island. We serve pasta \nand meatballs or hamburgers and hotdogs. We invite people from the \ncommunity and we talk about the issues that matter to them. Sometimes I \nask people to come together to talk about a particular issue, which is \nwhat we did Sunday, 2 weeks ago, at the Tri-City Elks Lodge in Warwick. \nI invited Rhode Islanders to join me to talk about our broken health \ncare system and what we might do to fix it.\n  More than 200 people came, from at least 14 different cities and \ntowns. The parking lot was jammed; the room was packed; Seniors and \nstudents, patients and providers, business-owners and veterans. They \nknow what is wrong with our system--they experience it first hand every \nday. They came to share their frustration, their anger; to tell what's \nhappened to them in a system that too often leaves them nowhere to \nturn.\n  That evening, I launched a new feature on my web site to help people \nshare their stories about health care. At whitehouse.senate.gov/\nstoryboard, there is a forum where Rhode Islanders can read about \nothers' experiences with this broken system, and tell me about their \nown. We gave people who came to the dinner the chance to write their \nstories, right then and there. And one after another, the stories came.\n  Mr. President, if anyone believes we can afford to wait to fix the \nhealth care system, that this is not an urgent, crisis-level problem \nfor the people of this country, I urge them to listen to what these \nRhode Islanders had to say.\n  Sandra from Smithfield wrote:\n\n       As of this month I will no longer be treating my Rheumatoid \n     Arthritis. The treatment costs almost $6,000 every six weeks. \n     The kicker is that I have help from the drug company to pay \n     for the drug portion, but that is only half the cost of \n     administering the infusions. I do not have $3,000 this month. \n     I am begging for universal health care. I am 52 years old. I \n     worry every day when the crippling effects of rheumatoid \n     arthritis will put me in a wheelchair because I cannot afford \n     to treat my disease. Please fight for universal health care. \n     Please help.\n\n  David from Warwick, stood up at the dinner and explained that he \nbegan receiving Social Security and Medicare 3 years ago:\n\n       Each year since, the amount I get has gone down because the \n     Social Security cost of living raise has not kept up with the \n     rising cost of my medical coverage. This year I had to cut my \n     coverage. My co-pays are now more than I can afford.\n\n  Brande is a young woman from Johnston, Rhode Island who has struggled \nwith juvenile diabetes since age 11. She wrote:\n\n       Although I have done everything humanly possible to control \n     my diabetes, [I] still am not able to achieve tight blood \n     sugar control. My diabetes doctor believes the best hope for \n     my health is continuous blood glucose monitoring sensors that \n     would accommodate my insulin pump. Through many requests, and \n     many letters to Blue Cross, I have still been denied these \n     life saving sensors that I desperately need.\n\n  Many, many Rhode Islanders at this dinner shared stories of their \nfrustration with the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit. Frances \nin Cranston wrote:\n\n       Humana changed its premium from $25 to $39.95 per month and \n     at the same time the copayment to fill a prescription went \n     from $25 to $40. When I complained that I would leave for \n     another Medicare Part D provider, they said I would have to \n     wait until next November.\n\n  Everett from Warwick and his wife saw their Part D premiums go up by \n40 percent without notice, and they had to pay a 3-month penalty when \nthey finally decided to switch plans:\n\n       Now, my new provider, First Health, wants to charge my wife \n     another $3.50 per month. I am appealing but why should the \n     provider get the extra money? It is already costing her more \n     to have this plan.\n\n  Robert, also from Warwick, was flatly frustrated with the whole Part \nD process. He said:\n\n       We have to simplify the Medicare Part D plans. There are \n     too many choices and too many plans, and too many cards. They \n     should just all be the same.\n\n  The health care stories went on. From Carolyn in Warwick:\n\n       All my doctors are dropping out of my insurance plans. My \n     primary care doctor is going to MDVIP--$1500 a year up front. \n     I can't afford to see him anymore.\n\n  From Amanda in Providence:\n\n       My father is a Medicare recipient. My family and I live \n     with constant worry that he will lose certain benefits. It is \n     frustrating and painful that in his last few years with us we \n     have to spend so much time worrying about his healthcare \n     access.\n\n  From Joyce in Warwick:\n\n       I take two medications. The insurance will pay for one \n     medication for 30 days. I am supposed to take two a day!\n\n  From Maggie in Johnston:\n\n       I'm self-employed and am unable to afford health insurance. \n     My business partner finally had to drop hers. It was costing \n     her $1,000 a month.\n\n  From Annette in Cranston:\n\n       I was buying my health insurance for my daughter and myself \n     from Blue Cross direct . . . I can no longer afford it, so I \n     had to let it go.\n\n  Ronald in Wakefield:\n\n       I am middle class, so no one speaks for me. Please don't \n     forget those of us who have coverage and pay for it out of \n     our own pocket.\n\n  Carol in West Kingston:\n\n       I am faced with the option of providing health insurance \n     for myself or food on the table for my family . . . I decided \n     to opt out of COBRA. I am taking a risk being a cancer \n     survivor but what else can I do?\n\n  Jean in West Warwick:\n\n       I really don't know at is going to happen.\n  Roberta in Coventry:\n\n       Between my son's medications and mine, it is just out of \n     reach for me. So in order to keep my son healthy, I go \n     without. Last year, I fell ill and could not afford to go to \n     the doctor. I have been a nurse for almost 40 years, and I \n     have worked myself to the bone healing sick people. My health \n     is failing, and I am afraid I will not see my grandchildren \n     grow up. Please help us.\n\n  And on and on it went. Every time someone at the community dinner \ntook the microphone to speak about the complexity and unfairness of \nMedicare Part D, heads around the room nodded. Every time someone stood \nand called for universal health coverage, this Rhode Island crowd \napplauded. Every time we heard a story from someone battling their \ninsurance company for the care they needed, there were groans around \nthe room of recognition and exasperation. There was not a single person \nthere--even in this economy--who thought health care reform should not \nbe one of Congress's top priorities.\n  I am looking forward to attending President Obama's State of the \nUnion Address tomorrow evening with one of the Rhode Islanders who \nattended this dinner in Warwick. Lauren Goddard is a medical student \nwith Crohn's disease who is facing a lifetime of expensive health care \ncosts. I appreciate her attendance and her willingness to share her \nstory of how difficult the health insurance system can be for an \nindividual who has chronic health care needs.\n  These Rhode Islanders, Lauren, and everyone else who came to our \ndinner in Warwick need us to listen. They need us to hear their \nstories, and they need us to get it and to do something about it.\n  Two weeks ago, Congress took an enormous step toward addressing the \noverwhelming economic challenges our country faces. We passed the \neconomic recovery legislation that President Obama signed last week. \nThis means extra money in people's pockets, new jobs, and patched holes \nin the social safety nets on which we count. That will surely help. But \nit is not enough.\n  For those 200 Rhode Islanders who joined me in Warwick, burdensome \nhealth care costs are the forgotten story. Families are forced to \nchoose between prescription drugs and food, clothes, or transportation. \nSmall businesses cannot afford to hire new employees or provide health \ncoverage. Entrepreneurs cannot take that plunge\n\n[[Page S2355]]\n\nbecause they cannot just walk away from their health insurance. And \nlooking beyond those local family perils and sorrows, we see the $35 \ntrillion unfunded liability for Medicare that is bearing down on us.\n  Unless we begin to undertake serious and meaningful reforms right \naway, this recession will seem like only a small hurdle compared to \nthat moment when $35 trillion in Medicare costs come due. That wave of \ncost, that tsunami of cost is coming at us, and we have to prepare. \nKnowing what we know, sharing the responsibilities we do as Senators, \nthis is our duty. Failure is dereliction.\n  Every one of us shares the goal of making sure health insurance \ncoverage reaches all Americans. But as I have said in this Chamber \nbefore, it is not enough just to bring everyone into the boat. The boat \nitself is sinking. It is not enough just bringing everybody into the \nboat, not with what we know is coming.\n  What is needed is reform of our health care delivery system, an \ninformation technology infrastructure so that every American can count \non their own secure electronic health record, improvement in the \nquality of health care so we maximize the effectiveness and efficiency \nof care delivered, and to reform how we pay for health care so the \nhealth care we are paying for is the health care we want. Nothing less \nwill save this boat.\n  All of this is doable, but we need to start now. We took a good step \nin President Obama's economic recovery legislation with a nearly $20 \nbillion investment in health information infrastructure. But there is \nmuch more to be done, and because it is a bit complex and will take \nsome doing, we cannot dawdle, we cannot delay, we cannot shirk that \nduty.\n  To enact health care reforms that will lower costs by improving the \nquality of care for all Americans, we have to start now. To improve the \nway we deliver health care to give us a modern, efficient, interactive, \ntrusted health care system, we have to start now. To improve the way we \ndeliver health care by spending wisely for disease prevention and \nbetter health outcomes, we have to start now. If we are to sustain \nhealth care coverage for the 46 million Americans--9 million of them \nchildren who have no health insurance at all--we have to achieve these \nreforms and we have to start now.\n  That is what the Rhode Islanders I met on Sunday are asking for. That \nis what all Americans deserve. For God's sake, let us not fail them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       honoring our armed forces\n\n                   Army Specialist Darrell Fernandez\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, as I rise today, flags across \nNew Mexico are at half staff. Our State is recognizing a New Mexican \nwho gave his life in service to our country. Army SPC Darrell \nFernandez, age 25, died on Saturday, January 31, in Kirkuk, Iraq, when \nthe car he was riding in flipped over.\n  At times like this, the words of elected officials seem inadequate. \nDeath brings suffering. It is no less heartbreaking when the deceased, \nas in this case, was a brave young soldier. Words will not ease the \npain of Specialist Fernandez' wife, Katrina Fair, or of his mother and \nstepfather, Susie and Bill Smith. Nor can words add to the glory that \nSpecialist Fernandez has earned through his actions.\n  But a death like this demands something of the living.\n  In the best tradition of service and sacrifice, Specialist Fernandez \ndied for us. We owe it to him to acknowledge that, to be grateful, and \nto remember. His death was not an accident. He died in one of the \ndisasters that war makes commonplace. He died because he chose to serve \nhis country. And he did serve.\n  A Senators or as citizens, we cannot fully experience the sadness of \nthis day of mourning, the sadness experienced by Darrell's family and \nfriends. But when a soldier dies, the Nation as a whole feels the loss. \nWe are linked to Specialist Fernandez by the ties that bind a grateful \nNation to its faithful servant. His loss is ours.\n  As your colleague and your friend, I ask you to participate in my \nState's day of remembrance. As the flags fly at half staff and the \npeople of my State grieve, join us in celebrating the heroism of Army \nSPC Darrell Fernandez, who gave all he had for us.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have participated this afternoon in the \nsummit held by President Obama to examine the financial status of the \nNation. When the President spoke, as did the Vice President and other \neconomists, the emphasis was on the large deficit which our Nation \nfaces. The President spoke about his plans to cut the deficit in half \nby the year he finishes his first term. There were then breakout \nsessions. I participated in a session which dealt with the subject of \nhealth care.\n  There was a consensus among those present at the session that the \ncost of health care imposed the greatest problem for the deficit as we \nlook to the future years. My suggestions related to savings which I \nthink are possible on our health care system beginning with the cost of \nMedicare.\n  A study shows that some 27 percent of health care costs are incurred \nin the last few hours, few days, few weeks of a person's life. No one \nshould tell anyone else what to do with respect to terminal health care \ncosts, but I do believe it is fair to ask people to think about that \nand to make a decision in a living will.\n  Another suggestion on health care costs would involve prosecutions on \nwhite-collar crimes which involve health care, where there is a real \nopportunity for deterrence. My experience as a district attorney showed \nme that you cannot deal with deterrence when you are talking about \ndomestic violence, but if you are talking about white-collar crime, you \ncan.\n  While on the Judiciary Committee, I have raised the issue on a number \nof occasions about the need to carry forward white-collar prosecutions \nlooking toward jail sentences instead of fines. There was recently a \ncase involving Siemens which was not a medical issue but a case \ninvolving a $1.7 billion fine which seems large, except when measured \nagainst an $87 billion income stream.\n  The point is that fines are a license to do business and to violate \nthe public trust, but jail sentences could serve as a deterrent.\n  Beyond those suggestions on savings, the increase in the National \nInstitutes of Health, which has been raised from about $12 billion to \nalmost $30 billion in the decade between the mid-1990s and the first \nhalf of the decade of this century, showed tremendous savings which \nhave been registered on stroke, on cancer, from the reduction in the \ndeath rate. The additional $10 billion added recently is a further \neffort along the promotion of those savings.\n  Beyond the issue of research and savings through the National \nInstitutes of Health, there is the benefit of savings from lifestyle. \nRecently with a bout of Hodgkin's, I have even modified further the \nexercise pattern I have had for decades as a squash player, eliminated \nsugar from the diet, looking for antioxidants. This is an issue where \nthere could be a modest investment by the Federal Government which \ncould pay great dividends.\n  The final suggestion I had was on trying to use the Wyden-Bennett \nplan which has 14 cosponsors, equally divided between Democrats and \nRepublicans, to utilize Wyden-Bennett as a\n\n[[Page S2356]]\n\nstarting point for a serious discussion in the Senate to cover the 47 \nmillion-plus Americans who are now not covered, modeled after the \nMassachusetts plan put in by former Governor Romney, with the Federal \nassistance for those at the lower end of the economic brackets.\n\n\n                  Tribute to Former Senator Joe Biden\n\n  Mr. President, Senator Biden was one of the participants at the \neconomic summit. Seeing and talking to him brought to mind \nrecollections of his outstanding career in public life.\n  When there were comments on the Senate floor last month about Senator \nBiden in recognition of his 36 years in the Senate, I was engaged in \nthe proceedings on the confirmation of Attorney General Holder and did \nnot have an opportunity to participate. I thought it appropriate, \nhaving just come from conversations with Senator Biden, to comment on \nhis extraordinary career. I first knew of Senator Biden when he ran for \nthe Senate back in 1972. I was very much impressed with many facets of \nSenator Biden's resume, but one caught my attention; that is, that he \nwas 29 years old in 1972 when he ran for the Senate, and I knew that \nthe Constitution placed the minimum age at 30.\n  Senator Biden was elected, but he turned 30 between election day and \ninauguration day. That started a phenomenal Senate career. My first \ndirect contact with Senator Biden came in a curious way. Shortly after \ncoming to the Senate on a Friday, I had made plans to catch the 6 \no'clock train, thinking that the Senate would be adjourned by that \ntime. But the final vote did not begin until 8 minutes to 6. I called \nup my executive secretary Sylvia Nolde and said: Will you change my \nticket to the 7 o'clock train. She responded, having been secretary to \nSenator Javits for many years, that she could hold the train for 5 \nminutes. I did not know that was a possible problem under Federal law, \nbut the statute has run so I can speak freely about it at this point.\n  I went to the train station, got on the 6 o'clock train a little \nlate, and a few minutes later, a huffing and puffing Senator Joe Biden \nwalked into the car and approached me and said: I ran the three blocks \nfrom the Senate to Union Station. Running through the lobby, I hurdled \na few baby carriages.\n  I do not think he knocked down anybody, but they were at risk. He \njumped over the barrier and was running down the track to the train \nwhen a conductor stopped him, threw up his hand and said: Slow down, \nbud, there is a Senator coming.\n  Senator Biden then said to me: You have been in the Senate about 8 \ndays, I have been here 8 years. How did you figure out how to catch the \ntrain in this manner?\n  Senator Biden and I, on the Judiciary Committee, have worked on a \ngreat many sensitive issues together. I cosponsored his landmark \nlegislation protecting women against violence. We worked together on \nthe Second Chance Act, which was signed into law last year, which \nprovides for realistic rehabilitation for first offenders, juveniles, \nand second offenders, to try to stop the revolving door of recidivism. \nWe have worked together on supporting special funding for the so-called \nCOPS Program for putting more police on the street; have worked \ntogether on many civil rights issues, and many of the programs to \nsupport Amtrak.\n  When I was elected in 1980 and we faced our first budget resolution, \nthere was an effort made to zero out Amtrak. Senator Howard Baker, who \nwas then the majority leader, scheduled a meeting with David Stockman, \nthe Director of the Office of Management and Budget. A fair number of \nSenators from the Northeast Corridor met him at that time, Senator \nD'Amato and Senator Heinz and quite a few of us who were regulars on \nthe Amtrak line, and knew of its importance. When David Stockman \nadvanced the argument that we could deal without the Amtrak subsidy, I \npointed out that we would not be able to get through the Baltimore \ntunnels without Amtrak, you would not be able to land at National \nAirport. We kept the funding going. Largely over the years we were in a \ncollaboration, and Senator Biden was a key participant.\n  During his work on the Judiciary Committees as chairman, he presided \nat landmark hearings in a very dignified and professional way. During \nthe hearings on Judge Robert Bork for the Supreme Court back in 1987, \nSenator Biden was the chairman. One Friday afternoon we were not quite \nfinished with the hearing. That was on September 18. I remember the \nday, because the day before I traveled with President Reagan to \nPhiladelphia for the 200th anniversary of the signing of the \nConstitution. The Constitution was signed on September 17, 1787. The \n200th anniversary had occurred the day before.\n  I had not had a chance to question Judge Bork on that day. Senator \nBiden approached me late in the afternoon and asked me how much more \ntime I needed. He was not going to be there the next day and had \ndelegated the chairmanship, or asked Senator Kennedy to take over the \nchairmanship responsibilities--I should not say delegated; Senator \nKennedy himself had been chairman. When he asked me how much time I \nneeded, I paused for a minute, and he said: Well, how about a half \nhour? I continued to pause, thinking about it. Taking time to think \nabout it sometimes is viewed as a violation of Senate ethics. He said: \nOK, how about an hour? I still paused. He said: How about an hour and a \nhalf?\n  I said: OK, that should do it. Then Senator Thurmond, who was the \nranking Republican, came over to me, and in Strom Thurmond's inimitable \nSouthern accent--while it is inimitable, I will try to imitate it--he \nsaid: You want an hour and a half on Bork.\n  Translated, means: Do you want an hour and a half on Bork?\n  And I said: No, sir, I do not want an hour and a half on Bork, I want \nto question him until I finish.\n  OK, you can have your hour and a half on Bork.\n  Translated: OK, you can have your hour and a half on Bork. The next \nday, I took the hour and a half.\n  Senator Biden did another professional job in many of the hearings, \nbut again I particularize the one on Justice Clarence Thomas. There was \na question as to whether the Judiciary Committee ought to have access \nto the Thomas rentals from the video store, and Senator Biden took the \nposition that that was not an appropriate matter for inquiry.\n  Then we had a second witness who came up at the very last minute, and \nSenator Biden presided over the very delicate matter of making a \ndetermination as to whether that witness ought to be called at the last \nminute.\n  I notice my distinguished colleague, Senator Casey, has arrived for a \nlittle proceeding as to William T. Coleman, Jr. Since it is now 4 \no'clock, when he was scheduled to arrive, I will terminate within the \nnext few minutes.\n  Senator Biden had a very serious health problem with an aneurysm, \nvery serious operations in the early 1990s. When I had a serious \noperation on a mengionoma, a brain tumor, I returned to the Senate with \na big bandage on my head for the confirmation hearing of Justice \nGinsburg. Senator Biden was chairman and greeted me with a welcome to \nthe entry of the cracked head club, rather a unique distinction to be \ncalled out on the so-called cracked head club.\n  Senator Biden was elected to a sixth term last November. It is quite \na record to be a six-term Senator, 36 years in the Senate, at the age \nof 66. His tenure on that term was very short. He was sworn in on \nJanuary 4 and left 16 days later to become Vice President, where he now \nserves with distinction. I believe his years in the Senate will add \ngreatly to the stature and competency of the Office of Vice President. \nHis work as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee will stand the \ncountry in very good stead as he travels around the world, \nsupplementing the work of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, another \nformer colleague, and the work of the special envoys, as well as his \ndetailed knowledge of the inner workings of Government from his very \ndistinguished service.\n  I am glad to have a few minutes on the Senate floor to extoll the \nvirtues of a very good friend, an outstanding colleague, and a great \nSenator. He will be a great Vice President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. I say hello to Senator Specter. We have a lot of visitors \nfrom\n\n[[Page S2357]]\n\nPennsylvania here today. We are honored by their presence. I thank \nSenator Specter for being with us today. We will be seeing him a little \nlater.\n\n\n                           william t. coleman\n\n  Madam President, 2009 marks the 200th anniversary of the birth of \nAbraham Lincoln, the 200th birthday of our 16th President, who ushered \nin a new era of race relations and brought an end to the legalized \ndegradation of institutionalized slavery that people of color endured \nin the United States for more than 200 years. Every year the month of \nFebruary is dedicated to celebrating Black History Month and serves as \na time of reflection and reconciliation for the country.\n  I rise to honor the lifetime of achievements of a man whose life \nstory has embodied Lincoln's vision of a nation committed to the rule \nof law and equal justice under the law.\n  William Thaddeus Coleman, Jr., built upon the legacy of Abraham \nLincoln and distinguished himself and continues to distinguish himself \nas a pioneer in legal advocacy and the struggle for civil rights.\n  Bill Coleman was born in Philadelphia into a world where only \nstrength of character, intellectual prowess, and hard work could defeat \nthe evils caused by the Great Depression and the era of Jim Crow laws. \nHis mother was a teacher. His father was the director of the \nWissahickon Boy's Club and Camp Emlen. They led him, early on, to \npursue excellence while always enriching the larger community by \nenhancing the lives of everyone he encountered. Bill Coleman achieved \nacademic excellence, first, in a racially segregated elementary school \nbefore entering Germantown High School, where he was one of seven Black \nstudents. Despite the environment of bigotry, he attained excellent \ngrades and was admitted to the University of Pennsylvania, where he \ngraduated summa cum laude, after just 3\\1/2\\ years, with a B.A. degree \nin 1941.\n  To fulfill his childhood dreams of becoming a lawyer, he entered and \ngraduated magna cum laude and first in his class from the Harvard Law \nSchool in 1946, as one of only three minority students. Bill Coleman \ninterrupted his studies at Harvard to enlist in the U.S. Army Air Corps \nto serve in World War II for nearly 3 years, training as an aviator at \nTuskegee Army Airfield, a statistical control officer at the Harvard \nBusiness School, and a defense counselor of soldiers during court-\nmartial proceedings.\n  After the war, Coleman returned to Harvard and received the highly \nesteemed Joseph E. Beale Prize and became the third person of color to \nserve on the Board of Editors of the Harvard Law Review. In 1947, \nColeman began his legal career as a law clerk to the late Judge Herbert \nF. Goodrich of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Soon \nafter in 1948, he became the first person of color to clerk for the \nU.S. Supreme Court, under the late Justice Felix Frankfurter.\n  After his clerkship, Bill Coleman joined the New York law firm of \nPaul, Weiss, Rifkin, Wharton & Garrison as an associate. In 1950, he \nwas approached by Thurgood Marshall, to help develop a legal strategy \nand prepare legal briefs in the five cases commonly referred to Brown \nv. Board of Education of Topeka. The ruling in this historic case \nbrought an end to the previously accepted doctrine of separate but \nequal, establishing that separate educational facilities were \ninherently unequal, tearing down the barriers of racial segregation to \npave the way for a new era of integration. In 1952, Coleman returned to \nPhiladelphia to be the first lawyer of color at Dilworth, Paxson, \nKalish, Kohn and Levy. While serving as a senior partner and head of \nthe Litigation Department, he specialized in corporate, trademark and \nantitrust litigation and gained national recognition for his expertise \nin transportation law, nuclear energy matters, and banking issues.\n  In 1950, Bill Coleman was appointed to the President's Commission on \nEmployment Policy, a.k.a. the Branch Ricky Commission, under President \nDwight Eisenhower to increase minority hiring in the Federal \nGovernment. In 1964, he served as cocounsel in McLaughlin v. Florida, a \ncase he argued before the Supreme Court, which found part of the \nantimiscegenation laws of Florida to be unconstitutional and paved the \nway for overturning other statues prohibiting interracial marriage. \nSoon after in 1965, former Governor of Pennsylvania William Scranton \nretained Bill Coleman to remove the racial restrictions at Girard \nCollege in Philadelphia.\n  Mr. Coleman continued a distinguished life of public service as a \nmember of the U.S. Delegation to the 24th Session of the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly in 1969; member of the National Commission on \nProductivity for 1971-1972; member of the Price Commission from 1971-\n1973; consultant to the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency from \n1963 to 1975; senior consultant and senior counsel to the President's \nCommission on the Assassination of President Kennedy in 1964; and a \nmember of President Eisenhower's Committee on Government Employment \nPolicy from 1959 through 1961 and member of the Federal Advisory \nCommittee on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n  In 1975, Bill Coleman was sworn in as the fourth Secretary of \nTransportation under President Gerald Ford, making him the second \nperson of color in history to hold a position in the United States \nCabinet. He developed a comprehensive national transportation policy \nand was instrumental in creating the 53-page study ``A Statement of \nNational Transportation Policy'', which he sent to Congress in 1975, \noutlining general principles that he felt should guide the government's \ndecision making process. In 1977, upon his resignation when President \nCarter took office, Mr. Coleman returned to the private sector to join \nthe Washington office of O'Melveny & Myers as senior partner and senior \ncounsel, where he continues to work today.\n  In 1982, Coleman was appointed amicus curiae by the Supreme Court to \nsupport the lower courts' holdings in Bob Jones University v. United \nStates and Glasboro Christian Schools, Inc. v. United States which \nfound that discriminatory private nonprofit schools were not entitled \nto federal tax exemptions. Bill Coleman continued his fight for civil \nrights as Chairman of the Board of the NAACP Legal Defense and \nEducational Fund, where he currently serves as the Senior Director.\n  In all, Bill Coleman has served as a trusted attorney and public \nservant of our nation for more than 50 years and has advised seven \npresidents of the United States. He has received numerous distinguished \nhonors including: the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1995 from \nPresident Bill Clinton; Officer of the National Order of the Legion of \nHonor from the Republic of France; the Thurgood Marshall Lifetime \nAchievement Award from the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund; The \nChief Justice John Marshall Award from the American Bar Association \nJustice Center; the Judge Henry J. Friendly Medal from the American Law \nInstitute; the Marshall-Wythe Medallion from the College of William & \nMary, Marshall-Wythe Law School; the Thaddeus Stevens Award from the \nPublic Interest Law Center of Philadelphia; the Lamplighter Award from \nthe Black Leadership Forum; the ``We the People'' Award from the \nNational Constitution Center; the Fordham-Stein Prize from the Fordham \nUniversity School of Law; the Golden Plate Award from the Academy of \nAchievement; the Legends of the Bar Award from the District of Columbia \nBar Association; the Spirit of Excellence Award from the American Bar \nAssociation; the David A. Clarke School of Equal Justice Award from the \nUniversity of the District of Columbia Law School; the Founder Award \nfrom the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.\n  When we encapsulate those awards, we are reminded that in terms of \nhonorary degrees, Bill Coleman has received honorary degrees from 21 \ncolleges and universities throughout the Nation.\n  Bill Coleman is married to the former Lovida Mae Hardin of New \nOrleans, LA. The Colemans have three children, two of whom are \npracticing lawyers and one of whom is the dean of the School of \nEducation at Boston University. Mr. and Mrs. Coleman have five \ngrandchildren. It does give me great pleasure to highlight Mr. \nColeman's life of extraordinary achievements in this 200th year since \nthe birth of Abraham Lincoln during Black History Month.\n  William T. Coleman, Jr., is an American whose life of public service \nand advocacy, whose life of integrity and excellence, courage and \ncommitment to\n\n[[Page S2358]]\n\njustice under the law has helped to make our great Nation a more \nperfect Union.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I compliment my distinguished colleague \nfor the remarks he made about William T. Coleman, Jr. I further \ncompliment him for scheduling a symposium later this afternoon on the \ndistinguished career of Mr. Coleman. Noting Black History Month, it is \nvery important to recognize the great accomplishments of African \nAmericans in society and the reference to the 200th birthday of \nPresident Lincoln is most appropriate since President Lincoln presided \nover the Civil War, issued the Emancipation Proclamation, and began the \nseries of historical events leading to the 13th amendment which \nprohibited slavery, the 14th amendment which provided for equal \nprotection of the law and due process of law, providing the legal \nframework, although it took a long time, to overcome Plessy v. Ferguson \nshortly before the turn of the 20th century and then Brown v. Board of \nEducation in 1954.\n  We are still making major efforts to defeat racism. There are \nperiodic calls for a discussion on racism. Beyond any question, it \nremains in our society. The problem is substantially ameliorated today \nbut still there is a great deal more to be done.\n  I recollect on my tenure in public service running for district \nattorney back in 1965. I had the opportunity to meet Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr., at a reception in Philadelphia, receiving advice from him on \nthe problem of police brutality in Philadelphia and elsewhere and the \nnecessity to have a police advisory board, a civil advisory board, some \nof the issues I worked on with Robert Casey, Sr., Senator Casey's \nfather, at that time auditor general of Pennsylvania when I was \ndistrict attorney, later Governor of the State of Pennsylvania.\n  Those recollections are very appropriate as we pay honor to the \nillustrious career of Bill Coleman.\n  I knew Bill Coleman when I was a beginning lawyer in Philadelphia in \n1956. At that time, Bill Coleman had already been to New York City, \nwhere he went to get a job, after finishing at the top of his class at \nthe Harvard Law School, clerking for Justice Frankfurter, as Senator \nCasey has already noted, and came back to Philadelphia to be a partner \nin the Dilworth office--a very distinguished law firm, and he was a \nvery distinguished addition to it.\n  I got to know Bill Coleman better and best when he and I were \nassistant counsel on the Warren Commission investigating the \nassassination of President Kennedy. The Warren Commission staff was \ndivided into two groups--the seniors and juniors--and Bill Coleman was \none of the senior lawyers and I one of the junior lawyers, although \nwhen the masthead was finished, we were all assistant counsel. The one \nthing I never understood about Bill Coleman's assignment on the Warren \nCommission was how he avoided being assigned the ``single bullet \ntheory.'' And certainly I would have yielded that to Bill, but he \nmanaged to avoid it. He was on another area of the investigation.\n  I read that when Bill Coleman helped Thurgood Marshall prepare the \nbriefs in Brown v. the Board of Education, he put in a full day at the \nNew York law firm. That was probably about 14 hours, the way the New \nYork law firms worked, and then he went to do his work helping Thurgood \nMarshall--later Justice Marshall--preparing that brief. His work with \nthe Warren Commission was about the same. His law firm agreed to let \nhim go do the work, but he took the 5 o'clock plane on Friday and went \nback to Philadelphia on Monday to put in his full 5 days with the \nDilworth law firm.\n  There are a lot of fascinating stories about Bill Coleman and his \nwork in public service. One story he tells is about President Lyndon \nJohnson trying to persuade him to become a circuit court of appeals \njudge for the Third Circuit, and I think President Johnson had the \nright idea, he just had the wrong court. But, at any rate, as Bill \nColeman tells the story, he told President Johnson he really could not \nundertake that job because he had very heavy financial responsibilities \nwith his family. And, as Bill described it, President Johnson put his \nright arm--maybe it was his left arm--over the credenza and pulled over \nsome papers and started to rustle some papers and said: Yes, I know \nwhat a financial sacrifice it would be. Now, I do not think President \nJohnson was looking at his tax returns because that would have been \nquestionable under Federal law. But, at any rate, that was an \ninteresting vignette Bill told.\n  In the mid-1980s--I think after the 1984 election--Bill Coleman told \nme he had a very bright young fellow he wanted me to meet who would \nhelp us rebuild the Republican Party, something which we are still \nworking on; we haven't been very successful at that either. I said: \nWell, come. We will have lunch in the Senate Dining Room. And the young \nman's name was Clarence Thomas. He had been with the EEOC, I think. \nBut, at any rate, he was Bill Coleman's nominee to help rebuild the \nRepublican Party. We outlined a long agenda, a long list of things to \ndo, and I was glad to pay for the lunch to promote this young man's \nefforts on rebuilding the Republican Party. Nothing happened for a \nyear, so I invited him back to lunch. I said this time Clarence Thomas \nwas going to have to pay for lunch. I was only kidding about that. But \nClarence Thomas moved on to other lines of endeavor.\n  More recently, Bill Coleman has been an activist for judicial pay \nincreases--something that still remains to be accomplished. But that is \nthe kind of public service he gets into.\n  Last month, he was an active participant for promoting the nomination \nof Eric Holder to be Attorney General of the United States. When Bill \nColeman makes a recommendation, it is given very substantial weight.\n  So I am glad to join my distinguished colleague, Senator Casey, on \nthis event to pay tribute to Bill Coleman.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Madam President, to have the full text of my \nprepared statement printed in the Congressional Record at this point, \nwith the introduction that it is a prepared statement so the repetition \nbetween that and some of my earlier comments will be understood if \nanyone should ever read the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        William T. Coleman, Jr.\n\n       Mr. President, today, in commemoration of Black History \n     Month, I would like to pay tribute to my good friend from \n     Philadelphia, William T. Coleman, Jr. Bill Coleman is an \n     American hero, who, as a lawyer, public official and \n     statesman, has advanced the cause of civil rights, justice \n     and equality for all Americans under the law. He was a main \n     architect of the legal strategy leading to the Supreme \n     Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education and the \n     desegregation of schools and other public facilities \n     throughout the United States.\n       Bill attended a racially segregated elementary school, \n     before moving on to Germantown High School, which was all \n     white save for a contingent of seven black students. He \n     survived numerous slights throughout his public school \n     career. To mention just one incident--when Bill tried joining \n     the all-white swimming team at his high school, he was \n     suspended from the school. Later, school officials reinstated \n     him, but they also cut the sport until he graduated.\n       Bill's academic excellence enabled him to attend some of \n     our nation's most prestigious universities. In 1941, he \n     graduated from my alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, \n     summa cum laude. He went on to the Harvard School of Law. \n     World War II prompted Bill to leave school to serve our \n     country as a member of the U.S. Army Air Corps. During his \n     time in the Army, he served as a defense counsel in 18 court-\n     martial proceedings, even though he had not yet completed his \n     law degree. Of those courts-martial, Bill won 16 acquittals, \n     with 1 of the 2 convictions later reversed.\n       After the war ended, Bill reentered Harvard and had the \n     distinction of being one of the first African Americans ever \n     to serve on the board of editors of the Harvard Law Review. \n     In 1946, he earned his LL.B. degree magna cum laude, \n     graduating at the top of his class.\n       Bill Coleman was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar in 1947 \n     and was law secretary to Judge Herbert Goodrich of the U.S. \n     Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. He went on to serve \n     as a law clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Felix \n     Frankfurter. He was the first African-American to serve as a \n     clerk for the Nation's highest Court.\n       In 1949, he became an associate at the New York law firm of \n     Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton, and Garrison. While practicing \n     at that firm, he was approached by Thurgood Marshall, the \n     founder and head of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational \n     Fund, NAACP-LDF, who asked for his legal help--on a volunteer \n     basis--on cases that the NAACP hoped would lead to the end of \n     segregation. For the next 3 years, Bill worked a\n\n[[Page S2359]]\n\n     9-6 shift at his law firm, then went over to the NAACP-LDF \n     until 10 or 11, and then returned to his law firm for more \n     work. He also worked on the weekends.\n       In 1952, Bill accepted a job at the Philadelphia law firm \n     of Dilworth, Paxon, Kalish, Levy and Green and became the \n     first African-American in Philadelphia to join an all-White \n     firm. He continued to volunteer his services to work on civil \n     rights cases, including coauthoring the brief in Brown v. \n     Board of Education, 1954, and representing a couple convicted \n     of violating State antimiscegenation laws in McLaughlin v. \n     Florida, in which the Supreme Court held that the State law \n     was in violation of the equal protection clause of the 14th \n     Amendment.\n       In 1959, President Eisenhower asked Bill to serve on the \n     President's Commission on Employment Policy. He served on \n     several Presidential commissions over the next two decades \n     for Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon. It was in 1964, \n     when Bill was on the Warren Commission, which investigated \n     the assassination of John F. Kennedy, that my long \n     friendship with Bill began. Most recently, Bill's support \n     of Eric Holder, our new Attorney General, was a \n     significant factor in my vote in favor of confirmation.\n       In 1971, Bill was elected president of the NAACP-Legal \n     Defense and Education Fund. Then, in 1975, President Ford \n     appointed Bill Secretary of Transportation. As Secretary, \n     Bill made it his first priority to develop a comprehensive \n     national transportation policy.\n       Bill stayed in the Capital to head the Washington office of \n     O'Melveny & Myers. He continues to practice law today and is \n     a frequent visitor in my office. His interests and work are \n     not limited to the law. He has enjoyed the strong support of \n     his loving family--his wife Lovida Hardin Coleman; his three \n     children, William Coleman III, Lovida H. Coleman, Jr., and \n     Hardin Coleman; and his grandchildren, William IV, Alexander \n     Amadeus, Flavia Colgan, Aaron Coleman, and Jesse Coleman.\n       In 1995, Bill received the highest honor given to \n     civilians, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, for \n     distinguished civilian service. President Clinton said, ``I \n     can honestly say, if you are looking for an example of \n     constancy, consistency, disciplined devotion to the things \n     that make this country a great place, you have no further to \n     look than William Coleman, Jr.''\n       In 1997, Bill was honored with the Thurgood Marshall \n     Lifetime Achievement Award of the NAACP-LDF.\n       In 2004, Justice Antonin Scalia presented Bill with a \n     lifetime achievement award at the We The People Award Dinner, \n     which honors individuals who best exemplify the qualities of \n     active citizenship envisioned by our Nation's Founding \n     Fathers.\n       In 1975, in an interview with the magazine Black \n     Enterprise, William Coleman said that his first concern was \n     to leave Washington ``with the same reputation for integrity \n     that I had when I came here.'' Well, Bill, while you haven't \n     left Washington yet and while I am sure that you will be here \n     for a long time to come, I can say without a doubt that you \n     have nothing to worry about.\n       I am proud to have Bill Coleman as a friend.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor. \nIn the absence of any other Senator seeking recognition, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his request?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise to amplify a little bit the \nprepared remarks I made regarding Bill Coleman. I thank Senator Specter \nfor the words he spoke of someone he has known a long time and for his \npresence here on the floor, as well as we will be seeing him at a great \nsymposium later this afternoon when we further discuss not only Mr. \nColeman's life but what it means in the larger context of the American \nstory.\n  There are a number of people in the gallery here whom both of us \nwould like to point out, although the rules do not allow that. So as I \nlook at the Presiding Officer, I want those people in the gallery to \nknow we know you are here. We are thrilled you are here, but the rules \ndo not allow us to acknowledge people in the gallery and to wave and do \nthe kinds of things we would like to do. But we will do that later.\n  But I do want to thank Senator Specter for highlighting so many \nfeatures of Bill Coleman's life. I think maybe the best way to sum it \nup, to encapsulate what his life means for America, is to allow us \ntoday, on just 1 day, to highlight such a remarkable life, such a great \nAmerican story as an inspiration not only to people like me and others \nbut, of course, to young people, to convey the message that if you are \ncommitted to academic excellence, if you are committed to achievement, \nif you are committed to doing things the right way and to working hard, \nthere is virtually nothing you cannot do. Bill Coleman, and so many \npeople in his generation like him, had to overcome so many obstacles. I \nthink it is a great lesson for all of us but especially for young \npeople. So we will be remembering that today when we celebrate his life \nof great achievement at the symposium. I do commend and thank Senator \nSpecter for being with us today.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, on an unrelated item, I note there is \non the desk S. 160, ``a bill to provide the District of Columbia a \nvoting seat and the State of Utah an additional seat in the House of \nRepresentatives.'' I would like to be added as an additional cosponsor, \nwith a very brief statement that I think it is long past due to have a \nvoting seat for the District of Columbia with its 700,000 population. \nAs a matter of basic democratic fairness, they ought to be represented \nin the U.S. House. So I ask unanimous consent that I be added as an \noriginal cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                     Prosecuting Wall Street Fraud\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, the collapse of Wall Street that \nprecipitated today's economic crisis has many causes--from regulatory \nfailures to recklessness and greed.\n  But before Congress begins writing new rules, one more factor we must \nexamine is criminal behavior by anyone, from the local mortgage broker \nto some of our biggest banks. Let's commit ourselves to enforcing the \nlaws that were on the books and to throwing those who broke them in \njail.\n  I am not prejudging anyone. We may well find that only a small \npercentage of cases involved outright criminal behavior, and we must \ntake care that our anger does not cloud our judgment. But people know \nthat if they rob a bank they will go to jail. Bankers should know that \nif they rob people they will go to jail too.\n  We have seen anecdotal evidence that mortgage brokers may have \nfraudulently solicited mortgages or used predatory practices; bankers \nmay have neglected due diligence in the design and marketing of some \nmortgage-related products; credit rating agencies may have been \nconflicted by the fees they earned from the very bankers whose shaky \nproducts they stamped ``AAA,'' the highest credit rating; and, finally, \nas the housing bubble burst, banks may have engaged in a widespread \nfailure to disclose material information as they went from supposedly \nprofitable institutions to insolvent overnight, leaving investors \nholding the bag.\n  Where were the lawyers and accountants who are paid to keep an eye on \nsuch actions? Was there so much cash around that the professionals who \nmake these deals possible became blind to their duties?\n  Attorney General Eric Holder has emphasized it is only by drilling \ndown into the records of complicated financial transactions that \nFederal law enforcement officials can understand exactly what happened \nand investigate the people and firms involved. Unfortunately, right \nnow, the resources are not available to do so.\n  That is why Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Pat Leahy, Senator \nChuck Grassley, and I introduced S. 386, the Fraud Enforcement and \nRecovery Act of 2009. This is a bipartisan bill. It provides financial \nsupport to the investigative arms of Federal law enforcement and \nregulatory agencies so they can find the crimes we know have already \nbeen committed. It also amends fraud statutes to protect us against \nthose who may be tempted to cheat like this in the future.\n  At a recent hearing, FBI Deputy Director John Pistole testified that \nthe\n\n[[Page S2360]]\n\nvery necessary shift of resources to counterterrorism efforts--it was \nright to shift resources in the FBI to counterterrorism efforts--has \nhad a significant impact on the FBI's ability to investigate \nsophisticated financial crime.\n  Mr. Pistole said the increasing financial fraud caseload ``is \nstraining the FBI's limited white collar crime resources.''\n  Currently, the FBI has only 240 agents investigating complex \nfinancial fraud. During the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s, the \nFBI had more than 1,000 agents investigating financial fraud. We must \nincrease dramatically the number and training of FBI agents \ninvestigating financial fraud.\n  Mr. Pistole told the committee the FBI is already investigating 530 \nopen corporate fraud investigations, and only 38 of those are directly \nrelated to the current financial crisis.\n  Again, as Mr. Pistole said:\n\n       More must be done to protect our country and our economy \n     from those who attempt to enrich themselves.\n\n  This bill authorizes $155 million a year for hiring fraud prosecutors \nand investigators at the Justice Department for 2010 and 2011. That \namount includes $65 million a year for 190 additional FBI special \nagents and more than 200 professionals to fight white collar crime.\n  We know prosecuting bad behavior by itself will not put an end to all \nbad behavior, but it will make those people in the boardrooms, at the \ntrading desks, and in the mortgage industry think twice before they \nlook the other way, give way to greed over financial duty or deal from \nthe bottom of the deck.\n  I believe deeply in the free market economy. I believe deeply in \ncapitalism and the importance of an open financial system. Indeed, I \nbelieve our very democracy depends on fair and functioning markets. \nThat is why we simply cannot give a pass to this kind of illegal \nbehavior.\n  The men and women who duped would-be homeowners, who defrauded the \nAmerican investor, who contributed to an economic crisis of historic \nproportions, need to be identified, prosecuted, convicted, and thrown \nin jail. And in cases where the conduct falls short of criminal, our \nregulators must also pursue civil cases to force perpetrators to pay \nback their ill-gotten gain and bar these people from future securities \nwork.\n  I have heard people say prosecutors must tread carefully, that the \nlaw is a blunt instrument. They will say that if we turn prosecutors \nloose on our key financial institutions, the economic repercussions \nwill outweigh any benefits.\n  To that I say: Of course, we must be judicious, but the law of the \nland applies to everyone. When it is pointed at you, the law can always \nbe characterized as a blunt instrument.\n  At the end of the day, this is a test of whether we have one justice \nsystem in the country or two. If we do not treat a Wall Street firm \nthat defrauded investors of millions of dollars the same way we treat \nsomeone who stole $500 from a cash register, then how can we expect our \ncitizens to have any faith in the rule of law?\n  For our economy to work for all Americans, investors must have \nconfidence in the honest and open functioning of our financial markets. \nOur markets can only flourish when Americans again trust that they are \nfair, transparent, and accountable to the laws.\n  In closing, I applaud Chairman Leahy and Senator Grassley for their \nleadership on this issue. I am proud to join with them in this effort. \nI am hopeful the Judiciary Committee will approve this bill when we \ntake it up on Thursday.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN.

Madam President, we have seen a historic and \nunprecedented expansion in United States leadership in global health \nover the last decade and especially over the last few years. I applaud \nthe previous administration's work in this regard, and I was proud last \nJuly when we came together across party lines to authorize $48 billion \nto combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. That was a courageous \ncommitment to save millions of lives, and it is critical that the \nUnited States deliver on our promises.\n  I am sympathetic to those who ask how we can maintain such a high \nlevel of investment in health abroad at a time when we are facing \nwidespread economic troubles here at home. Throughout my career, I have \nworked to try to bring fiscal responsibility to the Federal budget, and \nI am very concerned about the massive deficits we are running. This is \na time when we must have priorities, and our first priority must be \nprotecting and meeting the basic needs of the American people.\n  However, this does not mean that the global health challenges of our \ntime should be left unaddressed; indeed they too demand our continued \nand consistent engagement. Just last month,\n\n[[Page S2362]]\n\nour Intelligence Community released an assessment of the connections \nbetween health and our national interests abroad. They found that \ninfectious diseases--whether HIV/AIDS or SARS--as well as general \nmaternal and child mortality and the availability of healthcare can \nhave significant impacts on the economies, governments, and militaries \nof key countries and regions. Moreover, their assessment found that \nU.S. global health assistance provides substantial opportunities to \nadvance diplomacy, support stabilization in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nengage constructively with the rising powers of China and India, and \nease tensions within the developing world. I urge my colleagues to look \nat this report if they have not already.\n  I have seen firsthand--as I know many Americans have--the tremendous \ngood will generated for the United States by our leadership in global \nhealth. This has been especially true in sub-Saharan Africa. Just last \nDecember, I traveled to Tanzania and visited a health center funded by \nU.S. assistance that treats pregnant women and malaria patients. Over \nrecent years, as we have tried to reverse a growing trend of anti-\nAmericanism around the world, our health assistance has been a critical \ntool toward that goal. New levels of U.S. engagement in global health \nhave spurred thousands of Americans to become involved in service \nabroad and build cross-border relationships that foster mutual \nunderstanding. I strongly believe the power of citizen diplomacy cannot \nbe understated in an increasingly interconnected world.\n  For these reasons and more, I believe it is essential that we \ncontinue to lead in global health. It should not be a question of \nwhether we do so, but a question of how we do so in a time of limited \nresources. We need an approach that maximizes efficiency, demonstrates \nreal results, and fully leverages our programs toward our broader \nforeign policy objectives. American taxpayers should be confident that \nthey are getting the most for their money. That is why I believe that, \nmore than ever, we must develop a global health strategy that is all \ninclusive, integrated and sustainable.\n  Let me explain what I mean when I say those three things: all-\ninclusive, integrated and sustainable. First, all-inclusive. We all \nknow that the current U.S. approach to global health has been focused \non one disease, HIV. This is understandable, especially with tens of \nmillions of people still affected and more being infected every day. \nOur efforts in this area must continue. However, a failure to \nsimultaneously address other common infectious diseases can limit our \nprogress toward combating the AIDS pandemic, as well as promoting \noverall health. This is especially the case with malaria, which \ncontinues to kill over a million people each year despite the fact that \nwe have simple, affordable tools to prevent and treat it. I plan to \nwork with my colleagues in Congress and the Obama administration to \ncontinue and build upon the efforts of President Bush's Malaria \nInitiative. At the same time, we cannot forget there is much work to be \ndone to address tuberculosis and neglected tropical diseases, and we \nmust not give up on the goal of eradicating polio. Our efforts in each \nof these areas should be brought together under a comprehensive vision \nthat also incorporates the preventable and treatable illnesses that \nkill millions of men, women, and children each year. In fact, \ndeveloping a plan to address the basic challenges to child and maternal \nhealth should be the foundation of our global health work, not a \nsecondary initiative.\n  By ``all inclusive,'' I am also talking about the means by which we \nseek to pursue our overall global health objectives. Too often, \nrestrictions or requirements on U.S. health assistance have limited our \nflexibility to effectively balance prevention and treatment measures, \nor to pursue evidence-based approaches. This has especially been the \ncase with regard to reproductive health and family planning \ninitiatives, which I believe have an essential role to play if we are \nto stem the tide of HIV infections or reduce maternal mortality. To \nthat end, I am pleased that President Obama recently overturned the \nMexico City policy. I hope we can now move past the ideological \ndivisions surrounding this policy as we develop and implement a truly \ncomprehensive approach to advancing our global health objectives.\n  It is not enough, though, to balance and bring all of our initiatives \ntogether under one umbrella; they must also be integrated. In many \nplaces, U.S. health programs remain fragmented on the ground and not \nwell coordinated with each other. For example, we are funding some HIV/\nAIDS clinics that do not provide testing for malaria or tuberculosis \neven though these diseases often co-exist. As another example, we \nsupport some programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV \nthat are entirely disconnected from the provision of basic services in \nmaternal and child health. This lack of integration is inefficient, \nplaces a great burden on patients, and can ultimately render our \nefforts ineffective. Just as it is important to have a comprehensive \nstrategy, it is critical that its many parts are well coordinated. \nGreater integration can also ensure that our global health programs are \nworking in support of, not against, building stronger health systems.\n  This brings me to the third and what I believe is perhaps the most \nimportant point in developing a global health strategy: the need to \nplace greater emphasis on sustainability. Perhaps the greatest \nchallenge facing the global health community today is addressing the \ncontinuing weaknesses in health infrastructure around the world. I am \nconcerned that our current programs have not done enough to address \nthose infrastructure weaknesses, and in some cases may even be \nperpetuating them. We need to not only devote more resources and \nattention to strengthening indigenous health systems that can meet \nnational and local needs, but we need to do so effectively by engaging \nwith local communities and governments to understand where there are \ngaps and where the needs are greatest. Such a strategy includes help to \nrecruit, train, and retain a new health workforce. Toward that goal, I \nwas pleased to work with Senators Durbin and Coleman in the last \nCongress to introduce the Africa Health Care Capacity Act, and I hope \nto continue working on this issue in this new Congress. Until \ndeveloping countries have the healthcare professionals and \ninfrastructure they need, we will continue to fight an uphill battle \nfor decades to come against HIV/AIDS and other global health \nchallenges.\n  The time is now to put in place an all-inclusive and robust strategy \nfor global health. By doing so, we can help ensure that our leadership \nin global health is a good investment for the American taxpayer and \nthat the world's sick and vulnerable can see the results so desperately \nneeded. I look forward to working with the Obama administration and my \ncolleagues on these issues this Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/23/senate-section/article/S2362-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2362-S2363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HOH INDIAN TRIBE SAFE HOMELANDS ACT\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise today in support of the \nintroduction of the Hoh Indian Tribe Safe Homelands Act, introduced by \nSenator Murray and myself on Friday, February 13, 2009. This piece of \nlegislation is needed so that the Hoh tribe can move their village out \nof harm's way.\n  The Hoh tribe occupies a 1-square-mile reservation on the banks of \nthe Hoh River where it meets the Pacific Ocean in Washington State. Due \nto repeated storms, heavy rain, and the movement of the Hoh River, the \ntribe's village is threatened with flooding every winter. Ninety \npercent of the reservation now sits in a flood plain, and 100 percent \nof the land they reside on sits within a tsunami zone.\n  Many of the buildings located on the existing reservation are \npermanently sandbagged due to the threat of flooding, and several \nhouses have been lost to the river over the last 10 years. The tribe's \nwastewater treatment plant has also been threatened by flooding on \nmultiple occasions.\n  This legislation will allow the tribe to move out of danger by \ntransferring a 26 acre piece of Federal land to the tribe. This parcel \nof land is needed to connect the existing reservation with land the \ntribe has obtained on their own. Once the old village is collected with \nthe land the tribe already owns they can move their entire village out \nof harm's way.\n  Transferring ownership of a piece of Federal land should never be \ntaken\n\n[[Page S2363]]\n\nlightly, and this case is no exception. However, the Hoh tribe is in a \ndesperate situation. By transferring this small piece of land to the \ntribe and taking it into trust we can help the tribe remove themselves \nfrom a dangerous situation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/23/senate-section/article/S2363-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n RECOGNIZING THE ASHLAND-BOYD COUNTY AND CATLETTSBURG POLICE ATHLETIC \n                                 LEAGUE\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

The League's goal is to \nprevent young people from immersing themselves in drugs and other \nunruly behaviors, as well as giving them a safe place to go.\n  The Ashland-Boyd County and Catlettsburg Police Athletic League was \nformed 6 months ago and invites young people from Kentucky, Ohio, and \nWest Virginia. The League introduces young people to many different \nactivities, including exercise, sports and video games, and hopes to \nincorporate dance, martial arts, and the fine arts into its curriculum.\n  Currently more than 50 teenagers have registered with the \norganization and more are interested in joining. The League also has \nplans of opening a second facility due to a growing interest.\n  Again, I thank the Ashland-Boyd County and Catlettsburg Police \nAthletic League for giving young Kentuckians a safe place for mental \nand physical growth.

Students with two hundred hours of \ncommunity service are eligible to be named Hutton Scholars at \nCommencement. The university's student run organization, the Mountain \nOutreach program, has built 125 homes for local families in need of \nassistance, in the last 25 years.\n  Again, I congratulate the University of the Cumberlands for being \nnamed to the President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll. \nI hope that its leadership in community outreach serves as an \ninspiration to others in Kentucky and in the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/23/senate-section/article/S2363-3", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO THE 3RD BRIGADE, 98TH DIVISION, 108TH TRAINING COMMAND\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Each award \nspeaks of the character of these individuals.\n  Darlene Payette received the Emergency Medical Service Award for her \nactions at Summit Medical in Nicholson during a full arrest in April \n2008. During this situation, Ms. Payette's leadership and \nprofessionalism allowed her to resuscitate an individual under extreme \ncircumstances.\n  Richard Messingschlager was awarded the Chief Officer of the Year. \nHis lifelong contributions to firefighting in Kenton County, northern \nKentucky, and the Commonwealth serve as an inspiration to firefighters \nacross the State.\n  Clayton James received the Firefighter of the Year award for \ndemonstrating leadership during the September wind storm and using the \nrecent training he received to set up the National Incident Management \nSystem for Newport.

Madam President, for the last month the attention \nof the Senate has been focused on the Nation's economic troubles. \nHowever, while this is very important legislation, my attention has \nalso been focused on the thousands of Kentuckians who were impacted by \nthe ice storm in my State.\n  This storm caused the greatest electrical outage in Kentucky history, \nwith over 600,000 people losing power and forcing many to evacuate \ntheir homes. Of the 120 counties in Kentucky, 91 were forced to declare \na state of emergency. In response, the Kentucky governor was forced to \ncall up 4,600 National Guard troops to assist our first responders. \nThis was the largest mobilization of the Guard in our State's history. \nThis situation could have been much worse if not for the efforts of \nKentucky's public safety officials and the Kentucky National Guard. \nThese individuals worked around the clock to ensure that their \nneighbors had the help they needed during this crisis.\n  There are many stories of people going beyond the call of duty to \nassist their fellow citizens. National Guard units went door to door to \nensure that people had all the supplies they needed until power was \nrestored. Volunteers kept open shelters and soup kitchens to make sure \nfamilies had places to sleep and eat. All of these unsung heroes have \nmy respect and admiration.\n  In closing I am grateful for the efforts of all the first responders \nacross my State including the many volunteers from the Salvation Army, \nRed Cross, and countless other volunteer organizations that helped to \nlimit the devastation caused by this storm. While I wish that this \ndisaster had never occurred, I am very proud of the way all Kentuckians \nbanded together to support each other during this time of need.\n\n[[Page S2364]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/23/senate-section/article/S2364-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING KENTUCKY'S OUTSTANDING STUDENTS\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I would like to congratulate \nseveral outstanding young people from the Commonwealth of Kentucky who \nhave been selected as recipients of the 14th annual Prudential Spirit \nof the Community Award. These young people were selected from over \n20,000 nominees, and I would like to commend them on this wonderful \nachievement.\n  The Prudential Spirit of the Community Award was created in 1995 by \nPrudential Financial in partnership with the National Association of \nSecondary School Principals. The awards are meant to impress upon all \nyouth the value of community service and to recognize contributions \nmade in this area. This year I am very proud that Kentucky has two \nState honorees and four distinguished finalists.\n  The four distinguished finalists this year are Don Combs, Emily \nGoldstein, Arooshi Kumar, and Elizabeth Moore. Don is from Pikeville, \nKY, and was nominated by Pikeville High School because he started a \nrecycling program that now encompasses all schools in Pike County. \nEmily Goldstein is a senior at Atherton High School in Louisville, and \nshe volunteered over 1,000 hours of her time to help protect the \nenvironment. She started recycling programs at 12 local companies and \ndonated the proceeds to the Louisville Zoo. Arooshi Kumar is also from \nLouisville and is completing her senior year at Dupont Manual High \nSchool. For her service project Arooshi raised nearly $5,000 to help \nestablish schools for impoverished children in India. In order to raise \nthis impressive sum Arooshi made and sold jewelry, cashmere stoles, and \nIndian tunics. Elizabeth Moore of Catlettsburg created a Spanish \nsection in the Hatcher Elementary School library. Elizabeth chose this \nschool because it has the largest number of Spanish-speaking students \nin her school district. Elizabeth is a senior at Fairview High School \nin Ashland, KY.\n  The two State honorees from Kentucky are Jordan Campbell and Meg \nOlash. Jordan is a senior at Montgomery County High School and resides \nin Jeffersonville, KY. For his project, Jordan organized a student-run \nnonprofit theater company to help engage elementary students in the \narts. His efforts resulted in 85 children and 15 teen directors putting \non shows for the community that sold over 1,200 tickets. Meg is an \neighth grade student at St. Francis of Assisi Catholic School in \nLouisville. Meg helped refugees plant produce, which they in turn sold \nat a farmers market at her church. Meg, along with her fellow \nvolunteers, also spent 3 days of the week playing with children at the \nlocal refugee community center.\n  All of these young Kentuckians have my admiration, and I thank them \nfor their service. They demonstrate that with hard work and \nperseverance all of us can make a difference in our communities and \nmake them a better place to live.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/23/senate-section/article/S2364-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. ALISON DES FORGES\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I was deeply saddened to learn \nof the death of Dr. Alison Des Forges in the tragic crash of \nContinental flight 3407 on February 12. In her passing, we lost not \nonly one of the foremost experts on the state of human rights in Rwanda \nand Central Africa, but also one of the greatest advocates for human \nrights in our time. Alison's tireless appeals for international action \nto save lives both before and during the 1994 Rwandan genocide are \nlegendary in the human rights and Africa policy communities. Her \nefforts have been widely reported on since that time, and I hope they \nwill continue to inspire future generations. Her personal witness \nshould inspire and challenge us all as we seek an end to ongoing mass \natrocities, whether in Darfur, eastern Congo, or areas affected by the \nLord's Resistance Army.\n  Long after the genocide ended, Alison maintained her relentless \ncommitment to pursue the truth and promote human rights. Her \nauthoritative research on the genocide informed the International \nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda, national courts across Europe and North \nAmerica, and even this Congress. She was widely recognized over the \nyears for her objective and balanced analysis of the changing situation \nin Rwanda and Central Africa. This was not a standard easily achieved \nor without its sacrifices. Indeed, just last year, Alison was twice \nrefused entry by the Rwandan Government, a government that once praised \nher reporting on the genocide. As a Washington Post editorial recently \nnoted, while the current Rwanda Government has made impressive \n``accomplishments in righting its country and improving basic services \n. . . it continues to be intolerant of criticism.'' Alison was \nunwilling to allow that growing intolerance to go unnoticed--even when \nthe result made it more difficult for her to do her job.\n  Alison was never vindictive, but she was never afraid to speak the \ntruth about growing repression or threats to basic rights when she saw \nthem. In that sense, Alison Des Forges embodied the very best of \nAmerica's tradition of supporting human rights and pressing for \nmeaningful accountability for violations of those rights. She will be \ngreatly missed, but we can pay tribute to her by carrying that \ntradition forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/23/senate-section/article/S2364-3", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING PATTY JENNINGS\n\n Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, today I mourn an \nuntimely death and to celebrate a full and remarkable life. Patty \nJennings--committed activist, loving wife and devoted mother--died of \ncancer on February 14.\n  The world's libraries are full of quotes about turning adversity into \nachievement, and I might have thought that everything on the topic had \npretty much been said. But last week I heard one of the more eloquent \nstatements on the topic. It came from Senator Tim Jennings, Patty's \nhusband.\n  Cancer is horrible, Senator Jennings told the 18,000 people at \nPatty's memorial service, ``but it's not all bad. We have met some of \nthe nicest people in the world because of it.''\n  Tim's response to his wife's death tells you a lot about the couple. \nPatty and Tim rarely had it easy, but, as Patty put it, they didn't \nspend much time wishing things could be different. They took comfort in \nthe people they loved--those they worked with and those they tried so \nhard to help. They responded to their own struggles by struggling on \nbehalf of others.\n  When Patty's daughter could not get health insurance because of her \nDown syndrome, Patty and Tim fought to create an insurance pool that \nwould allow high-risk New Mexicans to get health care. Patty spent her \nlimited free time fighting for the developmentally disabled--both as an \nadvocate for systemic reform and as a caring supporter of individual \nyoung people.\n  And she responded to her own breast cancer by helping to fund \nlifesaving research on the disease. The University of New Mexico's \nbreast cancer program will soon be known as the Senator Tim and Patty \nJennings Program for Breast Cancer. I can think of no more fitting \ntribute.\n  While we cannot fully know the sadness that Patty's devoted family is \nfeeling today, all New Mexicans are worse off for having lost Patty \nJennings. Her compassion should continue to inspire us as we fight to \ncomplete her work. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring this \nremarkable woman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/23/senate-section/article/S2364-4", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2364-S2365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO AMBASSADOR ED ROMERO\n\n Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, today I wish to \nhonor Ed Romero, a great New Mexican. Mr. Romero recently won the \nSenator Dennis Chavez Civil Rights and Leadership Award. The award is \nrichly deserved.\n  When the U.S. Congress placed Senator Chavez's statue in Statuary \nHall, Reverend John Spence summed up the man nicely. Senator Chavez, \nSpence said, was ``ever a champion of the underdog, the poor and \noppressed.''\n  In everything he did, Senator Chavez showed his concern for the \nunderdog. He fought for public education, because he knew what it could \ndo to help the children of struggling families become successful \nadults. He supported farmers, because he knew how difficult life can be \nin the small communities where the trains don't stop and the roads \ndon't go. And he fought for civil rights, because Chavez believed that \nequality of opportunity is the core of the American creed.\n\n[[Page S2365]]\n\n  Dennis Chavez fought for the underdog because he was an underdog. \nBorn into poverty in Valencia County, NM, when the State was still part \nof Mexico, Chavez walked a long and difficult road to the pinnacle of \npolitical power. A child of an isolated small town, he would see the \nworld and help to shape it. A high school dropout, he earned a law \ndegree and became a lawmaker. A victim of ethnic discrimination, he \nwrote legislation that would eventually make employment discrimination \nillegal and then unthinkable.\n  Ambassador Ed Romero also has been an underdog. Those who know him as \nan international businessman might be surprised to know he started his \ncareer working in the fields. Ed Romero had to fight for his business \nsuccesses. And he fought for the political power that he has used to \nmake this world a better place.\n  If Ed Romero had just one career, he would be impressive.\n  If he had only risen from poverty to become a successful \nbusinessman--sought-after for corporate boards and respected by his \ncolleagues around the world--that would be an achievement.\n  But Ed Romero also has devoted his life to sharing what he has \nearned. As an activist, he has spent his time helping other underdogs \nplay an active role in their government. He has helped America work \nwith its allies to promote peace and human rights across the world. \nAnd, much like Senator Chavez before him, he has worked to ensure that \nmen and women of color are represented in this country's corridors of \npower.\n  Ed Romero has shown leadership at home and abroad. He is a founder of \nthe Hispanic Cultural Foundation and the National Hispanic Cultural \nCenter in New Mexico. He cofounded the Albuquerque Hispano Chamber of \nCommerce and serves on the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute \nexecutive board. He has served as a delegate to the Helsinki accords, \nand we are very proud that President Clinton named him U.S. Ambassador \nto Spain.\n  Linking these two great New Mexicans is very appropriate. Each man \nturned his own personal struggle into a lasting compassion for life's \nvictims. Both men fought for their people--and for every people that \nhave tasted the bitter fruit of injustice. Both men make me proud to be \na New Mexican.\n  Men like Ed Romero keep America true to its ideals. New Mexico is \nproud to call him a native son. And I am proud to call him a friend. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in congratulating Ambassador Ed Romero on \nreceiving the Senator Dennis Chavez Civil Rights and Leadership \nAward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/23/senate-section/article/S2365-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/23/senate-section/article/S2365-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/23/senate-section/article/S2365-3", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. HARKIN, from the Committee on Agriculture, \n     Nutrition, and Forestry, without amendment:\n       S.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 454. A bill to improve the organization and procedures of the \nDepartment of Defense for the acquisition of major weapon systems, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Weapon \nSystems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009, with Senator McCain as an \noriginal cosponsor. The Department of Defense faces huge problems in \nits acquisition system today. Every year, the Government Accountability \nOffice publishes a report assessing DOD's purchases of major weapon \nsystems, and every year, the picture seems to get worse.\n  Since the beginning of 2006, nearly half of DOD's largest acquisition \nprograms have exceeded the so-called ``Nunn-McCurdy'' cost growth \nstandards established by Congress to identify seriously troubled \nprograms. As Secretary Gates pointed out in his testimony before the \nArmed Services Committee last month, ``The list of big-ticket weapons \nsystems that have experienced contract or program performance problems \nspans the services: the Air Force tanker, CSAR-X, VH-71, Osprey, Future \nCombat Systems, Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter, Littoral Combat Ship, \nJoint Strike Fighter, and so on.''\n  Overall, DOD's 95 major defense acquisition programs (known as \n``MDAPs'') have exceeded their research and development budgets by an \naverage of 40 percent, seen their acquisition costs grow by an average \nof 26 percent, and experienced an average schedule delay of almost two \nyears. Last summer, GAO reported that cost overruns on DOD's MDAPs now \ntotal $295 billion over the original program estimates, even though we \nhave cut unit quantities and reduced performance expectations on many \nprograms in an effort to hold costs down.\n  These cost overruns happen because of fundamental flaws that are \nendemic to our acquisition system. We even know what these flaws are: \nDOD acquisition programs fail because the Department continues to rely \non unreasonable cost and schedule estimates, establish unrealistic \nperformance expectations, insist on the use of immature technologies, \nand adopt costly changes to program requirements, production quantities \nand funding levels in the middle of ongoing programs.\n  Particularly at this time, when the federal budget is under immense \nstrain as a result of the economic crisis we simply cannot afford this \nkind of continued waste and inefficiency. That is why I am introducing \nthis bill with Senator McCain today and why I have scheduled an \nacquisition reform hearing in the Armed Services Committee next week. \nThe problems in our acquisition system may not be easy to solve, but \nthey are far too big for us not to take whatever steps may be necessary \nto correct them.\n  The key to successful acquisition programs is getting things right \nfrom the start with sound systems engineering, cost-estimating, and \ndevelopmental testing early in the program cycle. Programs that are \nbuilt on a weak initial foundation, including immature technologies, \ninadequate development and testing, and unrealistic requirements, are \nlikely to have big problems in the long run.\n  Unfortunately, a number of previous so-called acquisition ``reforms'' \nhave taken the system in the wrong direction by cutting out people, \norganizations, and processes needed to establish a sound initial \nfoundation for major programs. For example in the mid-1990's, DOD \nexperimented with assigning ``total system performance responsibility'' \nto contractors, abdicating its role in overseeing and ensuring program \nperformance; beginning in the late 1990's, DOD eliminated organizations \nand capabilities responsible for providing system engineering and \noverseeing developmental testing on major weapon systems; beginning in \n2003, DOD revised its key guidance for major acquisition programs to \nmake the key early phases of an acquisition program optional, \nauthorizing MDAPs to skip over the concept refinement phase, the \ntechnology development phase, and even the system development and \ndemonstration phase of the acquisition process, effectively leaping \ninto production before design considerations were adequately addressed. \nThe result has been excessive cost growth in weapon systems and \nexcessive delays in fielding major defense acquisition programs.\n\n  Congress has already taken some steps to address problems that come \nlate in the acquisition process--for example, by establishing \ncertification requirements to ensure that programs meet minimal \nrequirements before they enter system development and by tightening the \nNunn-McCurdy requirements that are used to identify underperforming \nprograms.\n\n[[Page S2367]]\n\n  The bill that we are introducing today is designed to identify and \naddress major problems much earlier in program development--before a \nNunn-McCurdy threshold is breached, before a program is formally \ninitiated, and before the program's trajectory has been established. \nFor example, our bill would require the Department of Defense to \naddress problems with unreasonable performance requirements by \nrequiring DOD to reestablish systems engineering organizations and \ndevelopmental testing capabilities; make trade-offs between cost, \nschedule and performance early in the program cycle; and conduct \npreliminary design reviews before giving approval to new acquisition \nprograms; address problems with unreasonable cost and schedule \nestimates by establishing a new, independent director of cost \nassessment to ensure that unbiased data is available for senior DOD \nmanagers; address problems with the use of immature technologies by \nrequiring the Director of Defense Research and Engineering (DDR) to \nperiodically review and assess the maturity of critical technologies \nand by directing the Department to make greater use of prototypes, \nincluding competitive prototypes, to prove that new technologies work \nbefore trying to produce them; and address problems with costly changes \nin the middle of a program by tightening the so-called ``Nunn-McCurdy'' \nrequirements for underperforming programs to provide for the \ntermination of any such program that cannot be justified after \nundergoing a complete reexamination and revalidation.\n  Taken together, these provisions will require the Department of \nDefense to take the steps needed to put major defense acquisition \nprograms on a sound footing from the outset. If they are successfully \nimplemented, they should help these programs avoid future cost \noverruns, schedule delays, and performance problems.\n  I look forward to working with Senator McCain and our colleagues to \nenact these important reforms into law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a bill summary be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Summary of the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009\n\n       Report after report has indicated that the key to \n     successful acquisition programs is getting things right from \n     the start with sound systems engineering, cost-estimating, \n     and developmental testing early in the program cycle. Over \n     the last twenty years, however, DOD has eliminated \n     acquisition organizations and cut the workforce responsible \n     for taking these actions, and has tried to ``reform'' the \n     acquisition process by taking shortcuts around early program \n     phases in which these actions should be taken. The result has \n     been excessive cost growth in weapon systems and excessive \n     delays in fielding those systems.\n\n\n                   title 1: acquisition organization\n\n       Section 101. Systems Engineering Capabilities. The Defense \n     Science Board Task Force on Developmental Test and Evaluation \n     reported in May 2008 that ``the single most important step \n     necessary'' to address high rates of failure on defense \n     acquisition programs is ``a viable systems engineering \n     strategy from the beginning.'' The Government Accountability \n     Office has reached similar conclusions. Unfortunately, the \n     Committee on Pre-Milestone A and Early-Phase Systems \n     Engineering of Air Force Studies Board of the National \n     Research Council reported in February 2008 that the Air Force \n     has systematically dismantled its systems engineering \n     organizations and capabilities over the last twenty years. \n     The other services have done the same. Section 101 would \n     address this problem by requiring DOD to: (1) assess the \n     extent to which the Department has in place the systems \n     engineering capabilities needed to ensure that key \n     acquisition decisions are supported by a rigorous systems \n     analysis and systems engineering process; and (2) establish \n     organizations and develop skilled employees needed to fill \n     any gaps in such capabilities.\n       Section 102. Developmental Testing. Many weapon systems \n     fail operational testing because of problems that should have \n     been identified and corrected during developmental testing \n     much earlier in the acquisition process. The Defense Science \n     Board Task Force on Developmental Test and Evaluation \n     reported in May 2008 that this problem is due, in significant \n     part, to drastic reductions in organizations responsible for \n     developmental testing. According to the Task Force, the Army \n     has essentially eliminated its developmental testing \n     component, while the Navy and the Air Force cut their testing \n     workforce by up to 60 percent in some organizations. Section \n     102 would address this problem by: (1) requiring DOD to \n     reestablish the position of Director of Developmental Test \n     and Evaluation; and (2) requiring the military departments to \n     assess their developmental testing organizations and \n     personnel, and address any shortcomings in such organizations \n     and personnel.\n       Section 103. Technological Maturity Assessments. For years \n     now, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has reported \n     that successful commercial firms use a ``knowledge-based'' \n     product development process to introduce new products. \n     Although DOD acquisition policy embraces this concept, \n     requiring that technologies be demonstrated in a relevant \n     environment prior to program initiation, the Department \n     continues to fall short of this goal. Last Spring, GAO \n     reviewed 72 of DOD's 95 major defense acquisition programs \n     (MDAPs) and reported that 64 of the 72 fell short of the \n     required level of product knowledge. According to GAO, 164 of \n     the 356 critical technologies on these programs failed to \n     meet even the minimum requirements for technological \n     maturity. Section 103 would address this problem by making it \n     the responsibility of the Director of Defense Research and \n     Engineering (DDR) to periodically review and assess the \n     technological maturity of critical technologies used in \n     MDAPs. The DDR's determinations would serve as a basis for \n     determining whether a program is ready to enter the \n     acquisition process.\n       Section 104. Independent Cost Assessment. In a July 2008 \n     report, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported \n     that ``DOD's inability to allocate funding effectively to \n     programs is largely driven by the acceptance of unrealistic \n     cost estimates and a failure to balance needs based on \n     available resources.'' According to GAO, ``Development costs \n     for major acquisition programs are often underestimated at \n     program initiation--30 to 40 percent in some cases--in large \n     part because the estimates are based on limited knowledge and \n     optimistic assumptions about system requirements and critical \n     technologies.'' Section 104 would address this problem by \n     establishing a Director of Independent Cost Assessment to \n     ensure that cost estimates for major defense acquisition \n     programs are fair, reliable, and unbiased.\n       Section 105. Role of Combatant Commanders. In a February \n     2009 report, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) \n     recommended that the acquisition process be modified to allow \n     combatant commanders (COCOMs) more influence and ensure that \n     their long-term needs are met. The GAO report states: ``a \n     COCOM-focused requirements process could improve joint war-\n     fighting capabilities by ensuring that the combatant \n     commander--the customer--is provided the appropriate level of \n     input regarding the capabilities needed to execute their \n     missions rather than relying on the military services--the \n     suppliers--to drive requirements.'' Section 105 would address \n     this problem by requiring the Joint Requirements Oversight \n     Council (JROC) to seek and consider input from the \n     commanders of the combatant commands in identifying joint \n     military requirements.\n\n\n                      title 2: acquisition policy\n\n       Section 201. Trade-offs of Cost, Schedule and Performance. \n     The January 2006 report of the Defense Acquisition \n     Performance Assessment Project (DAPA) concluded that ``the \n     budget, acquisition and requirements processes [of the \n     Department of Defense] are not connected organizationally at \n     any level below the Deputy Secretary of Defense.'' As a \n     result, DOD officials often fail to consider the impact of \n     requirements decisions on the acquisition and budget \n     processes, or to make needed trade-offs between cost, \n     schedule and requirements on major defense acquisition \n     programs. Section 201 would address this problem by requiring \n     consultation between the budget, requirements and acquisition \n     stovepipes--including consultation in the joint requirements \n     process--to ensure the consideration of trade-offs between \n     cost, schedule, and performance early in the process of \n     developing major weapon systems.\n       Section 202. Preliminary Design Review (PDR). The \n     Government Accountability Office (GAO) has reported on \n     numerous occasions that a knowledge-based approach is \n     critical to the successful development of major weapon \n     systems. In January 2006, the Defense Acquisition Performance \n     Assessment Project (DAPA) endorsed this view, and recommended \n     that Milestone B decisions be delayed to occur after PDR, to \n     ensure a sufficient knowledge base to ensure the \n     technological maturity and avoid ``a long cycle of \n     instability, budget and requirements changes, costly delays \n     and repeated re-baselining.'' Section 202 would address this \n     problem by requiring the completion of a PDR and a formal \n     post-PDR assessment before a major defense acquisition \n     program receives Milestone B approval.\n       Section 203. Life-Cycle Competition. The Defense Science \n     Board Task Force on Defense Industrial Structure for \n     Transformation reported in July 2008 that consolidation in \n     the defense industry has substantially reduced innovation in \n     the defense industry and created incentives for major \n     contractors to maximize profitability on established programs \n     rather than seeking to improve performance. The Task Force \n     recommended the adoption of measures--such as competitive \n     prototyping, dual-sourcing, funding of a second source for \n     next generation technology, utilization of open architectures \n     to ensure competition for upgrades,\n\n[[Page S2368]]\n\n     periodic competitions for subsystem upgrades, licensing of \n     additional suppliers, government oversight of make-or-buy \n     decisions--to maximize competition throughout the life of a \n     program, periodic program reviews, and requirement of added \n     competition at the subcontract level. Section 203 would \n     require the Department of Defense to implement this \n     recommendation.\n       Section 204. Nunn-McCurdy Breaches. Since the beginning of \n     2006, nearly half of DOD's 95 Major Defense Acquisition \n     Programs (MDAPs) have experienced critical cost growth, as \n     defined in the Nunn-McCurdy provision, as amended. Overall, \n     these 95 MDAPs have exceeded their research and development \n     budgets by an average of 40 percent, seen their acquisition \n     costs grow by an average of 26 percent, and experienced an \n     average schedule delay of almost two years. Such cost growth \n     has become so pervasive that it may come to be viewed as an \n     expected and acceptable occurrence in the life of a weapons \n     program. Section 204 would address this problem and enhance \n     the use of Nunn-McCurdy as a management tool by requiring \n     MDAPs that experience critical cost growth: (1) be terminated \n     unless the Secretary certifies (with reasons and supporting \n     documentation) that continuing the program is essential to \n     the national security and the program can be modified to \n     proceed in a cost-effective manner; and (2) receive a new \n     Milestone Approval (and associated certification) prior to \n     the award of any new contract or contract modification \n     extending the scope of the program. In accordance with \n     section 104, a certification as to the reasonableness of \n     costs would have to be supported by an independent cost \n     estimate and a stated confidence level for that estimate.\n       Section 205. Organizational Conflicts of Interest. Defense \n     Science Board Task Force on Defense Industrial Structure for \n     Transformation reported in July 2008 that ``many of the \n     systems engineering firms which previously provided \n     independent assessment [of major defense acquisition \n     programs] have been acquired by the large prime \n     contractors.'' As a result, the Task Force reported, \n     ``different business units of the same firm can end up with \n     both the service and product side in the same program or \n     market area.'' This structural conflict of interest may \n     result in ``bias [and] impaired objectivity,'' which cannot \n     be resolved through firewalls or other traditional mitigation \n     mechanisms. Section 205 would address this problem, as \n     recommended by the Task Force, by: (1) prohibiting systems \n     engineering contractors from participating in the development \n     or construction of the major weapon systems on which they are \n     advising the Department of Defense; and (2) requiring \n     tightened oversight of organizational conflicts of interests \n     by contractors in the acquisition of major weapon systems.\n       Section 206. Acquisition Excellence. The Department of \n     Defense will need an infusion of highly skilled and capable \n     acquisition specialists to carry out the requirements of this \n     bill and address the problems in the defense acquisition \n     system. The Committee has already established an acquisition \n     workforce development fund to provide the resources needed to \n     hire and retain new workers. However, positive motivation is \n     needed as much as money. Section 206 would address this issue \n     by establishing an annual awards program--modeled on the \n     Department's successful environmental awards program--to \n     recognize individuals and teams who make significant \n     contributions to the improved cost, schedule, and performance \n     of defense acquisition programs.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, over the last few years, Senate Armed \nServices Committee Chairman Levin and I have developed a number of \ninitiatives that reform various aspects of the defense procurement \nprocess. Our hope is that, in the aggregate, those initiatives, \nincluding those that help control the proliferation of non-essential \nrequirements; have the Department of Defense move towards more fixed \nprice-type contracts while incentivizing performance; and subject major \nsystems to a more evolutionary, knowledge-based procurement process, \nwill have a beneficial effect on the process--as a system. I am under \nno delusion that a single ``silver bullet'' will remedy a fundamentally \nbroken defense acquisition system.\n  The Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act of 2009, which I am pleased \nto introduce with Chairman Levin today, is an important next step in \nefforts to reform the system.\n  Consensus has emerged that a key to defense acquisition programs' \nperforming successfully is getting things right from the start--with \nsound systems engineering, cost-estimating, and developmental testing \nearly in the program cycle. Doing so helps the DoD understand and mete \nout costly technology-and integration-risk out of programs early--\nbefore the DoD makes important go/no-go decisions on the program that \neffectively out it ``on rails''.\n  We have learned this lesson the hard way--at great cost to the \ntaxpayer. Typically, major weapons have been procured with insufficient \nsystems engineering knowledge about critical technologies. But, with \nthose weapons programs having, by a certain point, acquired often \noverwhelming political momentum, Nunn-McCurdy, basically only a \nreporting requirement, has done very little to bring costs associated \nwith those originally underappreciated risks under control.\n  We now know that when a program is predictable, that is, when \ndecision milestones are being met; estimated costs are actual costs; \nand performance to contract specifications and key performance \nparameters are achieved, the acquisition process can be relied on as \nproviding the joint warfighter with optimal capability at the most \nreasonable cost to the taxpayer.\n  The bill that I am introducing with Chairman Levin today appreciates \nthat fact--by focusing on starting programs right. It does so by \nemphasizing systems engineering; more effective upfront planning and \nmanagement of technology risk; and growing the acquisition workforce to \nmeet program objectives.\n  A particularly important feature of the bill includes a provision \nthat puts Nunn-McCurdy ``on dynamite.'' That provision requires, among \nother things, that programs currently underway, post-Milestone B, \nexperiencing ``critical'' cost growth either be terminated or enter the \nnew defense acquisition system, which the DoD recently and \nfundamentally restructured to help it manage technology and integration \nrisk. In so doing, Chairman Levin and I hope to transform Nunn-McCurdy \nfrom a mere reporting requirement into a tool that can help the DoD \nmanage out-of-control cost growth.\n  While I am pleased to be introducing this legislation with Chairman \nLevin, we certainly must, and will, do more. That having been said, the \nprimary responsibility to reform the process falls on the DoD itself. \nNo amount of legislation can substitute for a true commitment to \nacquisition reform within the Pentagon. I look forward to seeing the \nWhite House convey that commitment--through deeds--going forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 456. A bill to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \nin consultation with the Secretary of Education, to develop guidelines \nto be used on a voluntary basis to develop plans to manage the risk of \nfood allergy and anaphylaxis in schools and early childhood education \nprograms, to establish school-based food allergy management grants, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Food Allergy \nand Anaphylaxis Management Act of 2009. I want to thank Senators \nAlexander, Whitehouse, Lautenberg, and Kerry for joining me for this \nintroduction.\n  Food allergies are an increasing food safety and public health \nconcern in this country, especially among young children. I know first-\nhand just how frightening food allergies can be in a young person's \nlife. My own family has been personally touched by this troubling \ncondition and we continue to struggle with it each and every day. \nSadly, there is no cure for food allergies.\n  The number of Americans with food allergies is on the rise. From 1997 \nto 2007 the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 \npercent. Today, 3 million children in the United States have a food \nallergy. While food allergies were at one time considered relatively \ninfrequent, they now rank third among common chronic diseases in \nchildren under 18 years of age. Peanuts are among several allergenic \nfoods that can produce life-threatening allergic reactions in \nsusceptible children. Peanut allergies doubled among school-age \nchildren from 1997-2002.\n  Clearly, food allergies are of great concern for school-age children \nnationwide, and yet, there are no federal guidelines concerning the \nmanagement of life-threatening food allergies in our nation's schools.\n  I have heard from parents, teachers and school administrators that \nstudents with severe food allergies often face inconsistent food \nallergy management approaches when they change\n\n[[Page S2369]]\n\nschools. Too often, families are not aware of the food allergy policy \nat their children's school, or the policy is vastly different from the \none they knew at their previous school, and they are left wondering \nwhether their child is safe.\n  In 2006, Connecticut became the first State to enact school-based \nguidelines concerning food allergies and the prevention of life-\nthreatening incidents in schools. I am very proud of these efforts, and \nI know that the parents of children who suffer from food allergies in \nConnecticut have confidence that their children are safe throughout the \nschool day. I had the opportunity to visit with students and parents at \nWashington Elementary School in West Haven, CT, last May who shared \nwith me their schools' comprehensive plan for its students with food \nallergies.\n  Nine other States, including Massachusetts, Tennessee, Vermont, New \nJersey, Arizona, Michigan, New York, Washington, and Maryland have \nenacted statewide guidelines. But too many States across the country \nhave food allergy management guidelines that are inconsistent from one \nschool district to the next. The result is a patchwork of guidelines \nthat not only may vary from State to State, but also from school \ndistrict to school district.\n  In my view, this lack of consistency underscores the need for \nenactment of uniform, federal guidelines that school districts can \nchoose to adopt and implement. For this reason, my colleague Senator \nAlexander and I are introducing the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis \nManagement Act of 2009 today to address the growing need for uniform \nand consistent school-based food allergy management policy. I thank \nSenator Alexander for his hard work and commitment to this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, the bill we are introducing today closely mirrors \nlegislation I introduced last Congress which was cosponsored by 41 of \nmy colleagues. Last May, I, along with Senator Alexander, chaired a \nhearing in our Children and Families Subcommittee exploring the current \nstate of food allergies and the challenges parents of children with \nfood allergies face.\n  Since that hearing, Senator Alexander and I have been working with \nmembers on both sides of the aisle to address any concerns they had \nwith the legislation. As a result, the legislation we are introducing \ntoday reflects many excellent suggestions and changes offered by my \ncolleagues. It is my sincere hope that the Senate will move quickly on \nthis bipartisan legislation this year.\n  The legislation does two things. First, it directs the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of \nEducation, to develop and make available voluntary food allergy \nmanagement guidelines for preventing exposure to food allergens and \nassuring a prompt response when a student suffers a potentially fatal \nanaphylactic reaction. The guidelines developed by the Secretary are \nvoluntary, not mandatory. Under the legislation, each school district \nor early childhood education program across the country can voluntarily \nchoose to implement these guidelines. The intent of the legislation is \nnot to mandate individual school policy, but rather to provide for \nconsistency of policies relating to school-based food allergy \nmanagement by providing schools with consistent guidelines at the \nfederal level.\n  Second, the bill provides for incentive grants to school districts to \nassist them with adoption and implementation of the federal \ngovernment's allergy management guidelines in all K-12 public schools.\n  I would like to recognize the leadership of Congresswoman Nita Lowey \nwho is introducing companion legislation today in the House of \nRepresentatives. She has been a longstanding champion for children and \nfor awareness of the devastating impact of food allergies. I also wish \nto acknowledge and offer my sincere appreciation to the members of the \nFood Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network for their commitment to this \nlegislation and for raising public awareness, providing advocacy, and \nadvancing research on behalf of all individuals who suffer from food \nallergies.\n  This legislation is supported by the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis \nNetwork, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, and \nmany others.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 456\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

This \n     important piece of legislation directs the Department of \n     Health and Human Services to develop guidelines for schools \n     to prevent exposure to food allergens and assure a prompt \n     response when a child suffers a potentially fatal \n     anaphylactic reaction.\n       FAAN was established in 1991 to raise public awareness, \n     provide advocacy and education, and advance research on \n     behalf of the more than 12 million Americans affected by food \n     allergies and anaphylaxis. FAAN has nearly 30,000 members \n     worldwide, including families, dietitians, nurses, \n     physicians, and school staff as well as representatives of \n     government agencies and the food and pharmaceutical \n     industries.\n       An estimated 2 million school age children suffer from food \n     allergies, for which there is no cure. Avoiding any and all \n     products with allergy-causing ingredients is the only way to \n     prevent potentially life-threatening reactions for our \n     children. Reactions often occur at school including severe \n     anaphylaxis, which can kill within minutes unless epinephrine \n     (adrenaline) is administered. Deaths from anaphylaxis are \n     usually a result of delayed administration of epinephrine. \n     Nevertheless, there are no current, standardized guidelines \n     to help schools safely manage students with the disease.\n       The Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network applauds your \n     effort to address the seriousness of food allergies and \n     create a safe learning environment for those children who \n     deal with these issues on a daily basis. We are pleased to \n     endorse your legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Julia E. Bradsher,\n     Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      American Academy of Allergy,\n\n\n                                          Asthma & Immunology,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 19, 2009.\n     Hon. Chris Dodd,\n     Hon. Lamar Alexander,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Dodd and Alexander: I am writing on behalf of \n     the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology \n     (AAAAI) to express our strong support for your legislation, \n     the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Management Act of 2007, \n     which would make available to schools appropriate guidelines \n     for the management of students with food allergy who are at \n     risk of anaphylactic shock. The AAAAI is the largest \n     professional medical specialty organization in the United \n     States representing allergists, asthma specialists, clinical \n     immunologists, allied health professionals and others \n     dedicated to improving the treatment of allergic diseases \n     through research and education.\n       The number of schoolchildren with food allergies has \n     increased dramatically in recent years. The policy developed \n     under your bill\n\n[[Page S2371]]\n\n     would assist schools in preventing exposure to food allergens \n     and assuring a prompt response when a child suffers a \n     potentially fatal anaphylactic reaction.\n       Strict avoidance of the offending food is the only way to \n     prevent an allergic reaction as there is no cure for food \n     allergy.

Madam President, this is the first time I am \nat my new desk. As we change each new Congress, according to seniority \nyou get to select a different location. I look into this desk drawer \nand see the names of so many of the giants who have been here before. \nPerhaps those who are watching or listening to these remarks would know \nit is customary that Senators actually inscribe their names in the \ndrawers of these desks, some of which in this Chamber go all the way \nback to the beginning of the Senate. That is true certainly in this \nChamber, and I would not be surprised if some of these desks are the \nsame ones that were in the Old Senate Chamber, which is right down the \nhallway. That is a place, by the way, which used to be used by the U.S. \nSupreme Court. I believe the famous Marbury v. Madison case was argued \nthere.\n  I address the Senate for a different reason, and that is that this \nday is the beginning of the session after we have had a week's recess \nto be back in our States on the occasion of Presidents Day, which was a \nweek ago. That gives us the opportunity to get around and see the \npeople of our State. Over the course of Monday through Friday, I ended \nup having some 15 townhall meetings. I have been doing this ever since \nI was a young Congressman, having come to the U.S. Congress--goodness, \nit is hard to believe, but it is over 30 years ago. Even before that, I \ndid it as a State legislator. That goes back 37 years.\n  I hold these townhall meetings where anyone can come. Especially this \npast week, I invited local elected officials--county commissioners, \nmayors, city commissioners, the superintendents of education in each of \nthe counties, the elected school board members, the administrative \nofficers of counties, the local legislators, and the members of the \nState legislature. I wanted them to come. I wanted to hear from them \nhow they perceive what is going on economically in their communities. \nAs well, I wanted to try to answer their questions, of which they had \nmany, about the stimulus bill we had passed Friday a week ago, close to \n11 o'clock at night because of having to keep the vote open until \nSenator Brown, bless his heart, could get back here after his mother's \nfuneral. His vote was necessary because it was the 60th and we had to \nhave 60 votes of 100 Senators to pass that legislation.\n  I wanted to hear from these local officials. Naturally, they were \nglad to hear that of this $780-some billion package, over a third of \nthat was tax cuts, tax cuts to stimulate a certain kind of activity or \ntax cuts to put dollars in the hands of individuals so they would spend \nit. That is not like this so-called stimulus bill we did a year ago \nthat was sending $500 to every taxpayer. This time, it was targeted to \nmoderate and lower income folks who need the money. Indeed, it was \ntargeted to taxpayers who do not have a requirement of a Federal income \ntax to pay but who still pay a lot of taxes because they pay a payroll \ntax.\n  This time, it is different. It is $400 to an individual and $800 to \njoint filers--husband and wife. That is one of the tax cuts we are \ngiving to stimulate the economy.\n  Other tax cuts we put in--we wanted to stimulate certain activities, \nsuch as a $2,500 tax credit for moderate- and low-income families to \nuse, to send their kid to college. You say: What does that have to do \nwith stimulus? That has a lot to do with keeping our colleges and \nuniversities going. That is providing we are not eating our seed corn. \nWe want the seed corn so we can plant next year's crop. That is exactly \nwhat we are trying to do in education. The future of this country's \nability to compete on the world stage is our intellectual capital, and \nwe cannot have that unless we have an educated public.\n  There were other kinds of tax cuts. There were tax cuts to stimulate \ncertain activity in getting green energy, removing ourselves--as we \ncountry boys would say, weaning ourselves from our dependence on oil, \nparticularly foreign oil. We do that by giving an inducement through \ntax incentives to businesses and individuals to produce new kinds of \nrenewable energy instead of being so dependent, as we have been, just \non oil, and in particular foreign oil.\n  One part of the spending of this stimulus bill was to begin the \nplanning of a smart grid system. Let me tell you, in my townhall \nmeeting in Gainesville, FL--this, by the way, is the home of the \nnational champion Florida Gators--the city of Gainesville is starting \non their own a smart grid system. They are going to give a local \nbusiness or an individual homeowner the incentive to produce their own \nelectricity from renewables--in our case, solar--and they will \nguarantee in the first 2 years that any excess of that electricity \nwhich is produced by that individual in their home or that business \nthat is collecting the Sun's rays and turning them into energy--they, \nthe city of Gainesville, will guarantee them 32 cents per kilowatt. \nThen, as you get on into the third year, it gradually goes down as \neconomies of scale get in and also as the equipment to do this becomes \ncheaper. Those were some of the things that I found out, that people \nreally believed this was the kind of stimulus they wanted.\n  I can tell you I heard from the educators--the school board members, \nthe superintendents of education in each of the 67 counties, and the \nteachers who came after their school boards--because Florida has been \ncutting its support for education, and the teachers would come and they \nwould point out that the school board had announced it was going to lay \noff teachers because Florida has been cutting its support for \neducation. In one county, Marion County in the town of Ocala, they \nannounced they are laying off 522 teachers come July. In another \ncounty, Polk County, the county seat of Bartow, the superintendent, who \ncame to the meeting, said they are going to have to lay off 1,200 \nteachers come summer.\n\n[[Page S2383]]\n\n  In Florida's portion of this fiscal stimulus bill, the fiscal \nstimulation fund is going to school boards, not the State department of \neducation so it can siphon it off, but to the school boards--Florida's \nshare is $2.2 billion. If those school systems want to preserve those \nteachers' jobs with this money, they can do that. They have to be \ncareful. This is not recurring money, so they have to plan for how they \nare going to keep those teachers after this 2 years of stimulus money. \nBut that gives them the chance to do that.\n  Hopefully, the whole idea is we are going to jump-start the economy \nback to life. In doing so, with more dollars out there, jobs will be \ncreated, the economy will start to recover, homes will not be vacated \nand foreclosed on and property values will rise, and then the ad \nvalorem tax, which is the basic tax which supports education in \nFlorida, will continue to rise as well to support those teachers who \notherwise, 3 and 4 years from now, might be laid off.\n  What I brought to them was welcome news. I am surprised, I must say, \nin over some 15 townhall meetings, that I did not have a lot of \nnegative catcalls that we have been hearing emanating out of Washington \nand out of the talking heads on the television. As a matter of fact, it \nis almost like two different worlds. You turn on the TV, turn on any of \nthe cable shows, and you have these talking heads--sometimes talking \nover each other, which makes it very annoying, and it is as if this is \nthe worst thing you have ever heard of, this stimulus bill. Of the \nvotes up here, here we only got three Republican Senators, the two \nSenators from Maine--Senators Snowe and Collins--and Senator Specter \nfrom Pennsylvania. They are the only three. Down at the other end of \nthe hall in the House of Representatives, they didn't get any \nRepublican Members of Congress to vote for this. You hear this chatter \ngoing on, and it is like it is so partisan and it is so awful.\n  That is not what I heard out there. What I heard back home this past \nweek is: Our people are hurting. They are losing their jobs. They are \nlosing their homes.\n  Unfortunately, it has hit my State of Florida big time. Our \nunemployment rate is now at 8.1 percent. The national average is 7.6. \nThere are some news articles that are speculating that in Florida it is \ngoing to 10 percent unemployment. Our foreclosure rate on homes is next \nto California. We are No. 2. And California is 2\\1/2\\ times as large as \nFlorida. As a matter of fact, there are parts of Florida where the \nforeclosure rate is the highest in the Nation.\n  An example is Fort Myers, Lee County, on the southwest coast of \nFlorida. Our people are hurting, and they are scared.\n  Naturally, when the Government tries to do something, however \nimperfect it is, they are appreciative that something is trying to be \ndone. Is this the answer? Is the program the Secretary of Treasury \nannounced the answer? We do not know. But the alternative, when the \nclerk called that roll Friday a week ago, was a vote that said yea or \nnay. It seems to me it was worth the risk to say yea in order to give \nour new President a chance of him trying to turn this economy around \nwith our help.\n  Now, I could go through the rest of the specifics that are going in. \nThere is money for title I over and above the normal title I which is \nfor disadvantaged children, which has made a huge difference in our \nschool systems over the years. There is new money here for IDEA, which \nis for children with disabilities. In the old days, a half a century \nago, we did not load all these problems on the school districts. But \nnow the schools take care of a lot of these problems. Children with \ndisabilities have to have special instruction and special ed. It is \nvery expensive. So, indeed, in this stimulus bill, the Federal \nGovernment has given additional money to the local school districts in \norder to try to help them.\n  Yes, there is money for roads and bridges. If this Senator had had \nhis druthers, there would have been more money because infrastructure, \nthis Senator feels, is a place to turn over dollars and create jobs. In \nFlorida, we think that from this stimulus bill, which is a combination \nof about two-thirds of spending and one-third of tax cuts, all to \nstimulate the economy, over 200,000 jobs will be created in the next \nyear and a half.\n  Well, since the recession started, we have lost more than that. In \nFlorida, we have lost 255,000 jobs. Let's hope and pray it works. If we \nhave to tinker with it, so be it. Ultimately, we need to get it right. \nI think we have taken the first right step. I think the new President \nis trying hard. This Senator is going to try to help him. The American \npeople expect no less.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/23/senate-section/article/S2383-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
