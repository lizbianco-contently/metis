Mr. President, fixing a system so badly damaged by decades \nof mismanagement and manipulation is not an easy task. It is no secret \nthat health care is no exception.\n  We are not doing it simply to keep us busy; that is, legislate on \nhealth care. We have a bevy of other backbreaking problems that have \npiled up over the past 8 years--everything from energy, to education, \nto Wall Street abuses--only to be passed on to this Congress and the \nObama administration.\n  Nor are we doing it because the health insurance industry wants us to \ndo it; just the opposite. In fact, they are doing all they can to \nprotect their reckless policies and raging profits.\n  We are doing this legislating on health care because the American \npeople demand that we do it. Families of all backgrounds and from every \nState are counting on us to act. Last November, it was one of the \nprimary reasons they called on Democrats to correct our country's \ncourse.\n  The American people are closely watching this debate. They are \nlistening to the policies being proposed, and they can see the \nstrategies employed toward those ends. They are watching, and here is \nwhat the American people are saying in response: Nearly two-thirds of \nthem know Republicans are not working in good faith with Democrats to \nreform America's broken health insurance system.\n  They are right. While we have made every effort to create a good bill \nthat can earn the support of as many Senators as possible, Republicans \nhave made every effort to stop any bill, regardless of what is in that \nbill.\n  How do we know this? We know this because Republicans have offered no \nideas for reform. We know this because while they talk in the abstract \nabout proposals, they have yet to offer any of their own. But, most of \nall, we know this because Republicans say it themselves.\n  In August, the junior Senator from Arizona predicted that almost all \nRepublicans would oppose health insurance reform, regardless of any \nconcessions Democrats made.\n  Then the senior Senator from Oklahoma said--and I quote--\n\n\n[[Page S10500]]\n\n\n       I don't have to read it, or know what's in it. I'm going to \n     oppose it anyways.\n\n  Then I opened this morning's Roll Call newspaper--this newspaper that \ncovers Congress--and read a disturbing headline, one that confirms what \nnearly two-thirds of the American people already know and should \nconvince the rest. It reads: ``GOP Launches Strategy to Trip Up Health \nBill.''\n  If Republicans truly want to legislate, shouldn't this headline read \n``GOP Launches Strategy to Improve Health Bill''? Wouldn't we all \nbenefit from the GOP launching a strategy to strengthen the health \nbill? Wouldn't it be better for the millions who fear losing their \nhealth insurance, and for the millions who do not have any to begin \nwith, if we would open the morning newspaper and read even this: ``GOP \nLaunches Strategy to Contribute to Health Bill''? But, no, none of \nthat.\n  The truth is that they have no interest in improving or contributing \nto health reform and strengthening it or contributing to its \nimprovement in any way. Instead, Republicans have one strategy--and one \nstrategy alone--support the broken status quo.\n  Republicans want to ``trip up'' our plan to protect what works about \nthe system, fix what does not, and help the middle class get ahead. \nThat is because they do not mind the fact that insurance companies can \ndeny you coverage when you need it the most or because you have a \npreexisting condition, defined as anything from high cholesterol to hay \nfever to heart disease to diabetes.\n  Republicans want to ``trip up'' our plan to stabilize health \ninsurance for those who have it and help secure it for those who do \nnot. That is because they think it is OK for insurance companies to \nraise your rates just for getting old or because your dad had prostate \ncancer or because you are a woman.\n  Republicans want to ``trip up'' our plan to keep the insurance \nindustry honest and to protect Medicare. That is because they support a \nstatus quo that forces families fortunate enough to have health \ninsurance to pay an extra $1,000 or more every year to cover all other \nfamilies who have none.\n  Republicans want to ``trip up'' our plan to lower costs for families \nand make sure every American can afford good quality care that can \nnever be taken away. That is because they simply do not have any ideas \nfor helping the American people--even people in their own States--who \nare suffering so desperately.\n  Republicans will do everything in their power to stop reform this \ntime because for many on the other side, there will never be a good \ntime to reform health insurance.\n  That is not what our constituents sent us here to do, and that is not \nhow to legislate.\n  I spent this past weekend in Nevada and heard firsthand from people \nwho are suffering. Today we learned our State's unemployment rate rose \nagain. One example: It is not a bunch of people out of work or people \nwho do not have good jobs who are complaining about health insurance. I \ndid an event in a hotel in Reno, NV--the largest and I think probably \nthe most successful resort in northern Nevada. Of course, when I asked \nfor questions, a number of the questions dealt with health care.\n\n  As I walked out, the owner of the property walked alongside of me and \nsaid: Senator, I want you to know that other than my cost for \npersonnel--my wages for my employees--health care is the one issue that \nis so hurting my business, health insurance for my employees. I am \ngoing to keep it, but it is so difficult for me to do so.\n  Here is a man who has probably 1,500, 2,000 people who work for him. \nThink what it is like for someone who has 25 or 50 or 75 or 100 people. \nIf someone who has the buying power of a couple thousand is having \ndifficulty, think what it is like for people who do not have that \nbuying power.\n  So this past weekend in Nevada, I really did hear from people who are \nsuffering. Today, we learned that our State's unemployment rate rose \nagain--another tenth of a percent. That tells me we do not have time to \nwaste with people looking to ``trip up'' recovery. Instead, we need \nlegislators willing to work with us toward solving problems.\n  Here is an opportunity. Republicans can show they are willing to do \nmore than simply stand in the way. We are working this week to protect \nseniors' relationships with their doctors. One of the biggest fears of \nseniors is that their doctors will drop them, which is why we are \nproposing a bill to make sure doctors will continue to see their \nMedicare patients.\n  This is a very serious issue. It is not one that is made up. There \nare ads running around the country today. There is one that says: ``If \nYou Don't Pass S. 1776, Seniors Will Lose.''\n\n       Seniors count on their doctors to get the care they need to \n     stay healthy. The Medicare Physician Fairness Act (S. 1776)--\n\n  That is the legislation I am talking about--\n\n     preserves the doctor-patient relationship and protects \n     seniors' access to their doctors. AARP is fighting to ensure \n     that doctors will continue accepting patients on Medicare.\n\n  Ninety percent of AARP members agree with this. This is a real \nproblem. Because of some of the things done with Medicare legislation \nin the past, a number of doctors have decided they cannot afford to \ntake Medicare patients. This will drive another 40 percent of the \ndoctors away from Medicare. It will destroy Medicare. So it is \nimportant we work together to get something done to take care of this. \nThat is because the status quo simply will not work.\n  We are working, as I said, this week to protect seniors' \nrelationships with their doctors. One of their biggest fears is that \ntheir doctors will simply drop them, which is why we are proposing this \nbill to make sure doctors will continue to see Medicare patients.\n  Republicans have come to the Senate floor numerous times in recent \nweeks to demand that Congress protect seniors. This so-called doctors \nfix that AARP is running the ads about is an opportunity for Democrats \nand Republicans to work together to improve Americans' health. This \ntime it is seniors' health.\n  The AARP has 40 million members. Nine out of 10 of them support this \nlegislation--90 percent of them. I hope Republicans will listen to the \nvery people whom they claim to defend and support--seniors.\n  While, generally speaking, the Republican strategy is disappointing, \nto say the least, it is not entirely surprising. After all, one \nRepublican Senator--I do not know if he is speaking for the entire \nRepublican Senate--is on record hoping health insurance reform will be \nPresident Obama's ``Waterloo.'' Nor is it inconsistent with the \nobstructionist tactics that have denied and delayed so many other \nimportant efforts to address so many of our critical challenges.\n  Democrats have been consistent in our efforts to reach across the \naisle. In April of this year, just as the health care debate was \nbeginning, I wrote my counterpart, Leader McConnell, to express my \ngreat hope that Republicans would work with us in this important and \nhistoric endeavor. We have an opportunity this week to fulfill that \nrequest I made. Here is what I wrote on that occasion:\n\n       In order for this bipartisan process to take root, \n     Republicans must demonstrate a sincere interest in \n     legislating. Rather than just saying no, you must be willing \n     to offer concrete and constructive proposals.\n\n  I concluded the letter by writing:\n\n       I hope your conference will recognize that this issue is \n     too important to be manipulated for political purposes.\n\n  So it is now about a half a year later. It is clear Republicans have \nnot heeded our gesture. It is equally clear to the American people, \ntwo-thirds of whom readily recognize that Republicans have no interest \nin returning the favor--not in the least.\n  As former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole said a few days ago--and I \nquote--\n\n       Sometimes people fight you just to fight you.\n\n  That might be true, but it will not be tolerated. Congress will not \nbe sidetracked by those who devise strategies only to ``trip up'' \nprogress, rather than to contribute in good faith. This country has no \nplace for those who hope for failure.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S10501]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I don't know of a single person who \nwants to see reimbursements cut to doctors who treat Medicare patients, \nbut if Congress is going to step in and prevent it, we shouldn't do it \nby racking up more debt on the government's credit card.\n  On Friday, the Treasury Department announced that the government ran \na deficit of $1.4 trillion in the fiscal year that ended just a few \nweeks ago--a deficit about three times the size of the previous alltime \nhigh. This should have been a wake-up call but, instead, within days of \nthe sobering proof of Congress's chronic inability to live within its \nmeans, Democrats in Congress want to borrow another $\\1/4\\ trillion to \nkeep doctors from getting a pay cut. Republicans want to fix this \nproblem as well, but there are ways to pay for it. When this matter \ncomes before the Senate, Republicans will offer ways to pay for it \nwithout asking taxpayers to take on another $\\1/4\\ trillion in debt.\n  It is perfectly obvious why Democrats want to resolve this issue \noutside the larger debate over health care. They are doing it so they \ncan say their health care plan doesn't add to the deficit. It is a \ngimmick and a transparent one at that.\n  Americans are tired of gimmicks and tired of Congress putting \neverything on the national charge card. We are not teenagers. Our \nparents aren't going to pay our bill at the end of the school year. The \nAmerican people--our children and grandchildren--are the ones getting \nstuck with the bill. It is time we act as if we are aware of that.\n  Higher debt is just one aspect of the Democrats' health care plan \nthat concerns Americans. At the outset of this debate, everyone agreed \non one thing: Any reform would have to address the primary problem with \nhealth care; that is, cost. Yet every day we hear about some accounting \ngimmick that is being used to conceal the true cost of this bill, and \nnow we are hearing it will drive up premiums as well.\n  The Director of the independent, nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice, Doug Elmendorf, indicated in recent congressional testimony \nthat parts of the Finance Committee proposal would lead to higher \npremiums; in other words, that health care costs would go up, not down. \nAs a result of the Democrats' latest health care proposal, that is \nexactly what will happen. This is a proposal that is only going to get \nmore expensive as the process moves forward in closed-door discussions \nbetween a handful of Democratic lawmakers and the White House. This is \nwhat the American people have feared all along, that lawmakers would \nlose sight of the purpose of reform and end up making problems worse, \nnot better.\n  The Finance Committee bill includes a new tax on health insurance \nthat most experts, including the CBO, agree would be passed straight to \nconsumers, leading to higher premiums. One estimate suggests this new \ntax on insurance plans will be passed on to families, costing them \nnearly $500 per year in higher premiums starting next year, long before \nany of the purported benefits of reform would take effect. The Oliver \nWyman Group, an international management consulting firm, has also \nlooked at how the Finance Committee bill would impact premiums in a \nnumber of States. This is important because every State has different \ninsurance laws. In States such as Kentucky, Arizona, and Virginia, \nwhich have flexible insurance laws and generally lower premiums, the \nimpact would be dramatic.\n  Currently, the average family premium in those States is about $9,500 \na year. Under the Baucus plan, that premium is expected to rise to \nnearly $17,000. That is $7,500 more that the government is telling \nfamilies they have to spend on health insurance. That is $7,500 these \nfamilies can't use for the college fund or to plan for retirement. \nWhile the Baucus plan may subsidize some insurance plans, the subsidies \nlikely will not be enough to offset these massive new costs imposed on \nmany of these families.\n  The bottom line is this: The Finance Committee bill has now been out \nfor a few weeks. The experts are starting to estimate what it would \nmean for insurance premiums. What we have seen so far isn't good. This \nis precisely why Americans want us to debate these bills out in the \nopen. This is why they want us to take our time until the true cost is \nknown. This is why they should have ample time to look at proposed \nchanges before Congress acts.\n  We knew this proposal would raise taxes. We knew it would slash \nMedicare. Now we know it will raise health insurance premiums. \nAmericans support reform, but higher premiums, higher taxes, and \ncutting Medicare, that is not reform.\n\n\n                                Gag Rule\n\n  Mr. President, the administration made a noteworthy admission over \nthe weekend. In a late afternoon memo on Friday, the Department of \nHealth and Human Services said health plans could now communicate with \nseniors about pending legislation that affects them. By lifting its \nprior ban on communicating the impact of Democratic plans for health \ncare, the administration was admitting--admitting--the ban amounted to \na gag rule, a gag rule that has no place in a society that prizes free \nspeech and open debate. The administration's reversal is certainly \nwelcome and, frankly, not unanticipated. However, many questions remain \nabout the initial order itself and about the administration's \nwillingness to constrain the free flow of information to seniors about \ntheir health care. The administration has admitted its error, though \nits proposed solution, frankly, needs further review.\n  The fact is, what health plans were telling seniors is precisely what \nthe Congressional Budget Office also said; namely, that Democratic \nhealth care plans could cause seniors with Medicare Advantage to lose \nbenefits--the absolute truth.\n  Americans believe strongly in the importance of the first amendment. \nI am glad to see the administration has recognized the error of its \nways and rescinded this gag rule in the midst of such an important \nnational debate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/19/senate-section/article/S10501-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to speak to an issue that is very \ntimely because the United States and Russia are beginning today their \nseventh round of negotiations on the so-called START treaty. This is a \ntreaty that could limit the number of nuclear warheads and delivery \nvehicles by both countries and provide an extension of various \ncompliance and verification procedures that are currently followed by \nboth countries.\n  It is interesting to me that the Russians do not appear to be in much \nof a hurry to complete the negotiations before the treaty expires, and \nit expires on December 5 of this year. According to Assistant Secretary \nof State Richard Verma, in a letter to me and several fellow Senators, \nI quote:\n\n       Russian views with respect to the meaning of these two \n     terms--\n\n  And he is specifically talking about the definitions of ``strategic \ndelivery vehicle'' and ``associated warheads,'' both of which are \nobviously key to the treaty, in any event--\n\n       Russian views with respect to the meaning of these two \n     terms have not yet been fully explained by the Russian \n     Federation.\n\n  We are in the seventh round of negotiations, as I said. When these \ntwo fundamental terms have not yet had an\n\n[[Page S10502]]\n\nexplanation by the Russian side as to what they mean and, in effect, \nwhat they are tabling in the way of proposals, it is pretty clear we \nare not far enough down the road to see much light at the end of the \ntunnel.\n  With regard to the verification rules, which are the heart of the \nSTART treaty, he wrote:\n\n       The Russian Federation has not, as yet, elaborated \n     sufficiently on its views concerning verification for the \n     United States to judge the nature of its approach.\n\n  Again, it is interesting that this letter, which is dated October 5, \nsuggests the Russians had not yet provided to us their position on key \nprovisions of this treaty. Yet we are supposed to have the negotiations \ncompleted before the treaty expires on December 5.\n  It is increasingly clear to me, as a result of all this, there will \nnot be a treaty by December 5; certainly not one that is ratified by \nthe Senate, which is a process the Senate will require several months, \nobviously, to complete. As I said, I think it is doubtful we will even \nsee one signed by the United States and Russia by December 5.\n  It is clear to me the Russians have sensed an opportunity that they \ncan use time to their advantage. They saw an overly ambitious American \nagenda, which went far beyond extending the compliance and verification \nmeasures of the existing treaty to actual proposals to significantly \ncut the numbers of warheads and delivery vehicles. They saw this \nobviously ambitious agenda pushing up against a very short timeframe--\nin this case December 5. I think they have cleverly manipulated the \nsituation, among other things, by throwing additional subjects into the \nmix, such as missile defenses and advanced conventional modernization \nand our nonnuclear conventional strike capabilities. By throwing these \nthings into the mix, they have created a situation where it is going to \nbe impossible to conclude negotiations by December 5, at least if the \nUnited States wants to stand firm on its position that neither the \nconventional strike capability nor missile defenses should be a subject \nof these negotiations.\n  I think the Russians think they can scoop up a bunch of concessions \nfrom the United States because of this short timeframe and the fact \nthat the United States will obviously want to conclude the \nnegotiations, if they can, by December 5. I think an example of \nconcessions would be the recent decision of the United States to leave \nourselves more exposed to a long-range missile threat from Iran as a \nresult of taking out the so-called missile shield we had previously \ncommitted to the countries of Poland and the Czech Republic. I think \nthe Russians may have correctly assessed that the Obama administration \nwould be willing to make trades such as the one on European missile \ndefense in order to get nuclear force levels lower because this would \nshow progress on President Obama's agenda for a nuclear weapons-free \nworld. At the same time, the Russians are attempting to constrain the \nUnited States.\n  It is interesting they are actually developing programs, systems that \nwould be prohibited by the START treaty. One is the RS-24 multiple \nwarhead ballistic missile, which the Russians tested as recently as May \n29, 2007. That would be illegal for the Russians to deploy under START. \nSo why are they testing it? They seem very happy to negotiate for fewer \nmissiles because they would be able to add multiple warheads on the \nmissiles they have.\n  That is known as MIRVing or the multiple reentry vehicles. You just \nadd more warheads on the same missile and you can accomplish the same \nthing, as if you had more missiles with an individual warhead on each \none. It is clearly not progress, especially since the purpose of START, \namong other things, is to promote greater stability, which comes from \nreducing the number of multiple-warhead weapons.\n  If the administration had simply limited the agenda to preserving and \ncontinuing the START treaty verification measures, we probably could \nhave met the December 5 deadline and we could have preserved the treaty \nand avoided issues such as missile defense that have now been raised by \nthe Russians.\n  Although the Senate will have to participate in this ratification \nprocess--and very soon, quite possibly--we really have no idea yet how \nthe administration will deal with the expiration of START on December \n5. What options does it have in mind to deal with that expiration date? \nHow will it seek to extend the treaty? What are the legal consequences \nfor information sharing and inspections both here and in Russia? What \nare the separation-of-power issues of the various approaches having to \ndo with a treaty ratified by the Senate which expires, with the \nadministration making treaty-like commitments to continue abiding by \nthe treaty during the course of time prior to the Senate's ratification \nof the treaty? All of these are questions to which we have not gotten \nanswers. Yet time is wasting.\n  Several of my colleagues and I have asked for the answers to these \nquestions in our August 14 letter to Assistant Secretary Gottemoeller. \nThe October 5 response from Mr. Verma ignored the questions about the \nexpiration date, and we need the answers.\n  Beyond December 5, getting a new treaty ratified is not going to be \nan easy proposition. Many Members of the Senate have been clear that \nbecause the administration is seeking nuclear force reductions, it must \nconcomitantly take responsibility for the nuclear forces that will \nremain. We will have fewer of them. We need to know that they will work \nand that they are safe.\n  Of course, both of these issues are related to the nuclear posture \nreview, which isn't really due until January. But since the \nadministration rushed to its analysis to justify warhead and delivery \nvehicle reductions, it must now act quickly to assemble a comprehensive \nmodernization plan that includes warheads, the nuclear weapons complex, \nand delivery systems. That plan has to be presented to the Senate no \nlater than when they send the treaty up to the Senate, and the fiscal \nyear 2011 budget will need to be sent at roughly the same time because \nit is the first year of the effectuation of the plan they would be \npresenting. Presumably, the plan will encompass maybe, let's say, a \ndecade of nuclear weapons complex modernization, but next year's budget \nwill really be the first time we will be able to verify the \nadministration's seriousness about this modernization effort.\n  So as to ensure there is no doubt on what ``comprehensive \nmodernization plan'' means, let me refer to the definition provided by \nthe Perry-Schlesinger Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture \nof the United States. The essential elements of such a program \nidentified by the Perry-Schlesinger Commission are, first, full and \ntimely Lifetime Extension Programs for the B61 and W76 warheads \nconsistent with our military needs; second, funding for a modern \nwarhead that includes new approaches to life extension involving \nreplacement or, possibly, component reuse; third, full funding for \nstockpile surveillance work through the nuclear weapons complex as well \nas the science and engineering campaign at our National Laboratories; \nfourth, full funding for the timely replacement of the Los Alamos \nplutonium research and development and analytical chemistry facility, \nthe uranium facilities at the Oak Ridge Y-12 plant, and a modern pit \nfacility. These are the essential components the President needs to \npresent. It is the minimum that should be included.\n  I might add that this is already required as part of the fiscal 2010 \nDefense Authorization Act I presume this body will soon pass and send \nto the President's desk. If anything short of this is submitted, the \nresulting delay in consideration of the treaty will be through no fault \nof the Senate; instead, blame will be with the administration and its \nfailure to heed numerous admonitions from Senators. We needed this plan \nsubmitted at the same time as the treaty.\n  It goes without saying that the administration must also understand \nthat any limitations on U.S. missile defense or nonnuclear global \nstrike capability will also be a deal breaker in the Senate.\n  Finally, I will refer again to the issue of Russia's multiple-warhead \nRS-24. In this case, it appears the Russians have cheated--if not in \nthe letter of the START agreement, at least in its spirit--by \nconverting one of their existing missiles, the TOPOL-M, to this new \nmultiple-warhead variant.\n  However, if you look at the 2005 Section 403 Report, which is also \nknown as\n\n[[Page S10503]]\n\nthe Adherence to and Compliance With Arms Control, Nonproliferation, \nand Disarmament Agreements and Commitments report, prepared by the \nState Department's VCI Bureau, there are a litany of other outstanding \nissues regarding Russia's failure to comply with START.\n  In fact, to quote from the 2005 report:\n\n       A significant number of longstanding compliance issues that \n     have been raised in the START Treaty's Joint Compliance and \n     Inspection Commission remain unresolved.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks the portion of the 2005 report dealing \nwith Russia's noncompliance with its obligations under the 1991 \nagreement.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it is clear that the administration needs to \ntell the Senate whether this 2005 finding is still valid. In fact, I \nthink the administration owes the Senate answers to the following \nquestions:\n  When will the State Department submit the next section 403 compliance \nreport?\n  Will the Senate see it before being asked to provide advice and \nconsent on the START follow-on agreement? If not, why not?\n  Does the State Department expect the compliance issues with the 1991 \nagreement to be resolved prior to the expiration of that agreement?\n  Does the State Department expect the follow-on agreement to include a \nmechanism for swift resolution of compliance issues? Have our START \nnegotiators proposed such a mechanism? If so, can the negotiators brief \nthe Senate, either in open Senate or a closed venue, on how it would \nwork?\n  I encourage the administration to provide answers to these questions \nsoon. The longer it takes to receive answers, the more it appears there \nis something to hide. Senators will want to know why we should ratify a \nnew treaty when the administration is not enforcing provisions of the \nexisting treaty.\n  Mr. President, keeping START from expiring without replacement should \nnot have been such a difficult matter. I regret that choices made by \nthe administration have made it so. I encourage the administration to \nrespond to the inquiries I have raised today, respond to the letters, \nthe correspondence we have sent, and be able to provide to the Senate \nthe answer to the key question: Why would we be asked to ratify a new \ntreaty when we have not enforced compliance with the treaty it would \nseek to replace? All of these questions, as well as the requirement \nthat a new modernization program be submitted, at the latest, at the \nsame time the treaty is submitted, are important requirements for the \nSenate to provide its advice and consent with respect to a new START \ntreaty.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n Adherence to and Compliance With Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and \n                 Disarmament Agreements and Commitments\n\n                             III. Overview\n\n\n                 expansion of start compliance section\n\n       Section 403 of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act--the \n     legislative basis for the submission to Congress of this \n     series of Noncompliance Reports--requires that the Report \n     provide greater specificity about compliance concerns. To \n     wit, the law requires the Report to include ``a specific \n     identification, to the maximum extent practicable in an \n     unclassified form, of each and every question that exists \n     with respect to compliance by other countries with arms \n     control, nonproliferation, and disarmament agreements with \n     the United States.'' To comply with this requirement, this \n     edition of the Report has included more information than ever \n     before on, among other things, Russia's implementation of the \n     Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START).\n       To facilitate this effort, in 2003 the United States \n     conducted consultations with the Russian Government regarding \n     a number of longstanding, unresolved U.S. concerns about \n     Russian compliance with the START Treaty--some of which \n     actually date back to the first year of START implementation. \n     These included Russia preventing U.S. inspectors from \n     measuring the launch canisters of certain Intercontinental \n     Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) or verifying that certain ICBMs do \n     not contain more warheads than attributed under the Treaty. \n     The U.S. concerns also included Russia failing to provide all \n     required telemetry materials for some START-accountable \n     flight tests, failing properly to declare certain ICBM road-\n     mobile launchers accountable under the Treaty, and locating \n     some deployed SS-25 ICBM launchers outside their declared \n     restricted areas. With respect to this last issue, however, \n     it should be noted that Russia has taken steps that have \n     resolved U.S. compliance concerns.\n\n   V. Compliance by Successors to Treaties and Agreements Concluded \n                   Bilaterally With the Soviet Union\n\n\n              the strategic arms reduction treaty (start)\n\n       Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine are in compliance \n     with the START strategic offensive arms (SOA) central limits. \n     Both the United States and Russia met the START seven-year \n     reduction final ceilings of 1,600 delivery vehicles and 6,000 \n     attributed warheads by the December 4, 2001, deadline. By \n     December 2001, these four Former Soviet Union (FSU) successor \n     states had reduced their aggregate forces to 1,136 deployed \n     launchers, 5,518 deployed warheads, and 4,894 deployed \n     ballistic missile warheads, as defined by Article ll of the \n     Treaty, and all strategic weapons had been removed or \n     eliminated from the territories of Ukraine, Belarus, and \n     Kazakhstan. Additionally, START required the four FSU \n     successor states to eliminate at least 154 heavy ICBM (SS-18) \n     silo launchers by December 2001. In the original MOU, dated \n     September 1, 1990, the Soviet Union declared 308 SS-18 \n     heavy ICBM silo launchers. As of November 30, 2001, a \n     total of 158 SS-18 silo launchers had been eliminated--104 \n     in Kazakhstan and 54 in Russia--leaving a total of 150 \n     deployed heavy ICBMs.\n       Notwithstanding the overall success of START \n     implementation, a significant number of longstanding \n     compliance issues that have been raised in the START Treaty's \n     Joint Compliance and Inspection Commission (JCIC) remain \n     unresolved. The Parties continue to work through diplomatic \n     channels and in the JCIC to ensure smooth implementation of \n     the Treaty and effective resolution of compliance issues and \n     questions.\n       The United States raised six new compliance issues during \n     the period of this report. The United States considers four \n     of these to have been closed. However, several previous--\n     often long-standing--compliance issues remain unresolved. A \n     number of these issues, some of which originated as early as \n     the first year of Treaty implementation, highlight the \n     different interpretations of the Parties about how to \n     implement the complex inspection and verification provisions \n     of the START Treaty.\n\n\n                              ICBM ISSUES\n\n       Inability to Confirm during Reentry Vehicle Inspections \n     (RVOSIs) that the Number of Attributed ICBM Warheads Has Not \n     Been Exceeded. During RVOSIs of deployed Russian ICBMs, U.S. \n     inspectors have been hampered, in some cases, from \n     ascertaining whether the missile had a front section, or that \n     the front section contained no more reentry vehicles (RVs) \n     than the number of warheads attributed to a missile of the \n     declared type under the Treaty.\n       The purpose of an RVOSI, as set forth in paragraph 6 of \n     Article XI of the Treaty, is to confirm that a ballistic \n     missile contains no more RVs than the number of warheads \n     attributed to a missile of that type. The RVOSI procedures \n     are referenced in paragraph 16 of Section IX of the \n     Inspection Protocol and contained in Annex 3 to the \n     Inspection Protocol. Paragraph 11 of Annex 3 allows the \n     inspected Party to cover RVs. Inspectors have a right to view \n     these covers and to measure hard covers prior to their \n     placement on the RVs. The covers are then installed on the \n     RVs before the inspectors view the front section. Under the \n     Treaty, such covers must not hamper inspectors in \n     ascertaining that the front section contains no more RVs than \n     the number of warheads attributed to a missile of that type. \n     Russian RV covers, in some instances, are too large; \n     consequently, they fail to meet this requirement.\n       During certain RVOSIs, Russia did not demonstrate to the \n     satisfaction of the U.S. inspection team that additional \n     covered objects located on the front section, and declared by \n     Russia not to be RVs, were not RVs. Although START does not \n     differentiate between nuclear and non-nuclear RVs, Russia's \n     willingness to use radiation detection equipment (RDE) during \n     such RVOSIs to establish that the extra objects were not \n     nuclear has been useful for resolving some, but not all, U.S. \n     concerns.\n       Finding Russian RV covers, and their method of emplacement, \n     have in some cases hampered U.S. inspectors from ascertaining \n     that the front section of the missiles contains no more RVs \n     than the number of warheads attributed to a missile of that \n     type under the Treaty. Russian cooperation in the use of RDE \n     and other measures has been helpful in addressing some, but \n     not all, of the difficulties encountered by U.S. inspectors.\n       Russian Road-Mobile Launchers--``Break-in.'' Russia has \n     failed to declare certain road-mobile launchers of ICBMs when \n     they first leave their production facility, as required by \n     the Treaty. Russia has moved some of these launchers to an \n     undeclared ``break-in'' area located over 60 miles from the \n     production facility without declaring that they have left the \n     production facility and are accountable under the Treaty.\n       Pursuant to paragraph 6(b) of Article III of the Treaty, a \n     mobile launcher of ICBMs becomes subject to the Treaty \n     limitations when it first leaves a production facility.\n\n[[Page S10504]]\n\n     Not later than five days following the first exit of such a \n     newly produced non-deployed road-mobile launcher, and its \n     entry into Treaty accountability, Section I of the \n     Notification Protocol requires the Party producing the new \n     Treaty-accountable item to provide a notification of this \n     change in data. Except for transits, Parties are proscribed \n     from locating non-deployed mobile launchers outside the \n     boundaries of the START-declared facilities identified in \n     subparagraph 9(b) of Article IV of the Treaty.\n       Finding. Russia continues to violate START provisions \n     relevant to these obligations.\n       Deployed SS-25 Road-Mobile Launchers Based Outside Their \n     Designated Restricted Areas. Russia based some deployed SS-25 \n     road-mobile launchers outside their declared restricted areas \n     (RAs) at two road-mobile ICBM bases while these RAs were \n     under construction. The United States and Russia concluded a \n     temporary, interim policy arrangement regarding the conduct \n     of inspections and cooperative measures at the facilities \n     where the launchers were housed during the period of \n     construction. This arrangement permitted U.S. inspectors to \n     conduct data update inspections and RVOSIs that they had not \n     previously been able to perform, and allowed Russia to \n     cooperate fully with providing cooperative measures access \n     for the launchers that were previously unavailable. All of \n     these road-mobile ICBMs and their launchers have since been \n     transferred from their bases, and their declared RAs have \n     been eliminated as START facilities.\n       Finding. Notwithstanding the interim policy arrangement, \n     Russia's practice of locating deployed SS-25 road-mobile \n     launchers outside their declared RAs for long periods of time \n     constituted basing in a manner that violated the provisions \n     of paragraphs 1 and 9 of Article VI of the Treaty. This \n     practice has ceased and the United States considers this \n     issue closed.\n       Denial of the Right to Measure Certain Deployed ICBM Launch \n     Canisters on Mobile Launchers. U.S. inspectors have been \n     prevented from exercising the Treaty right to measure certain \n     ICBM launch canisters on mobile launchers, both deployed and \n     non-deployed, that are encountered during data update \n     inspections to confirm data regarding the type of item of \n     inspection. Russia, for instance, has prevented U.S. \n     inspectors from measuring launch canisters for SS-24 ICBMs \n     contained in rail-mobile launchers that are located within \n     the boundaries of an inspection site. Similar concerns have \n     arisen with regard to launch canisters for SS-25 and SS-27 \n     mobile ICBMs located on road-mobile launchers. With regard to \n     launch canisters for these latter types, Russia and the \n     United States have agreed upon a policy arrangement to \n     address this issue, though it has not yet been implemented \n     for the SS-27 ICBM.\n       Subparagraph 20(a) of Section VI of the Inspection Protocol \n     identifies ICBM launch canisters as one of the items of \n     inspection for data update inspections. In accordance with \n     the procedures in Annex 1 to the Inspection Protocol, \n     inspectors have the right to confirm the number and, if \n     applicable, the types of items of inspection that are \n     specified for the facility to be inspected and declared for \n     the inspection site, and the right to confirm the absence of \n     any other item of inspection at the inspection site. Pursuant \n     to paragraph 6 of Annex 1, inspectors may view and measure \n     the dimensions of a launch canister declared to contain an \n     item of inspection to confirm it is of the declared type.\n       Finding. Russia prevented U.S. inspectors from exercising \n     their Treaty right to measure launch canisters for SS-24 \n     ICBMs contained in rail-mobile launchers that are located \n     within the boundaries of an inspection site, in contravention \n     of paragraphs 1 and 6 of Annex 1 to the Inspection Protocol. \n     With regard to launch canisters for SS-25 and SS-27 ICBMs \n     located on road-mobile launchers, the Parties have agreed \n     upon a policy arrangement to address this issue, but it has \n     not yet been implemented for the SS-27 ICBM.\n\n\n                            TELEMETRY ISSUES\n\n       As part of the START verification regime, the Parties are \n     obligated to notify each other of missile flight tests and to \n     exchange telemetry tapes, tape summaries, interpretive data, \n     and acceleration profiles for each flight test of a START-\n     accountable ICBM or SLBM. The United States has raised \n     several concerns regarding Russia's failure to provide all \n     Treaty-required telemetry materials for some START-\n     accountable flight tests in violation of paragraphs 4 and 5 \n     of Article X of the Treaty, and paragraph 1 of Section I and \n     paragraphs 1 and 2 of Section II of the Telemetry Protocol.\n       Finding. Russia has in some instances failed to comply with \n     Treaty requirements regarding the provision of telemetry \n     information on missile flight testing pursuant to Article X \n     of the START Treaty and Sections I and II of the Telemetry \n     Protocol.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I believe my colleague, Senator Thune from \nSouth Dakota, will be here in a few minutes. Until he arrives, I \nthought this might be of interest. I promised my constituents I would \ntell my colleagues what they told me to tell them. I think it would be \nof interest to share some of these remarks.\n  I went to a meeting on Saturday morning that I thought was going to \nbe a rather staid affair with folks who were primarily senior citizens, \nbut not all of them were. It turned out to be a little bit reminiscent \nof some of those townhall meetings we saw on television during August \nbecause the subject most people wanted to talk about was health care. \nThey weren't happy with what they were hearing the Senate was about to \ndo. Among other things, they wanted to get it clear with me right off \nthat I would pass on their concerns about this to my colleagues. I \npromised that I would. So let me summarize what some of them had to say \nand what I think the clear consensus of the group was.\n  First of all, they have a hard time understanding how Senators would \npass a bill before we read it or even know how much it costs. I assured \nthem that the procedure we would follow in the Senate was that we would \nhave at least 72 hours after the bill had been finally written and \nafter the Congressional Budget Office had scored the bill--that is to \nsay, told us how much it would cost in all of its component parts and \nthe ways it would be paid for. The reason I can feel fairly certain \nthat will happen is because a number of colleagues on both sides of the \naisle have either written to the majority leader or made it clear to \nhim that they will not support a motion to proceed to a bill until we \nhave had an opportunity to, in effect, read it and see how much it \ncosts. That process could take some time, I told my friends. The \nCongressional Budget Office Director told the members of the Finance \nCommittee, on which I sit, that it can take 2 to 3 weeks after the bill \nis written to come up with all of these calculations.\n  You will hear many people say we need to move this process on, even \nbefore we have the numbers. But I think that given the fact that most \nof us are committed to ensuring we have the numbers and can digest them \nand share them with our constituents before we debate and amend the \nbill, I assume the process will unfold in the Senate in such a way that \nwe do know what it costs, and that means after the final CBO report is \nprovided to us.\n  The next thing they wanted me to convey was that they were very \nworried about--in fact, maybe that would be a euphemism. They were more \nthan concerned about the degree of government involvement in health \ncare once this process is over. They fail to understand why we had to \nhave what amounts to a government takeover of insurance in this country \nand dictating everything from what kind of insurance policy you have to \nhave, to how doctors and hospitals are paid, in order to solve the two \nkey problems that exist: No. 1, there are some Americans who need help \nbuying insurance; second, that the costs of health care premiums \ncontinue to go up every year, and it is especially hard for small \nbusinesses to provide coverage for employees.\n  They asked me: Why do we have to change the entire system, with the \ngovernment essentially taking it over?\n  I happen to believe we don't. I provided the two basic alternatives \nto them. One is a step-by-step approach that targets specific problems \nwe have and matches up specific solutions to the problems, on the one \nhand, which is the approach I favor; on the other hand, essentially \nchanging the insurance we all have today, creating a new insurance \nexchange, and all insurance would have to go through there. Even if you \nlike your policy, it will change, and you are not going to be able to \nkeep it.\n  Estimates are that, as a result of all of this, in an effort to cover \n18 or 20 million more people with insurance, it is going to cost us \nclose to a trillion dollars. It will raise taxes, it will raise \ninsurance premiums, and it will require deep cuts in Medicare. They \ndidn't like that. I guess that brings up the third thing.\n\n[[Page S10505]]\n\n  With regard to Medicare, they were pretty perceptive in asking me the \nfollowing basic question. One person said: One of two things is going \nto happen. Either it will be business as usual where we say we will \nmake cuts in Medicare, but the Senate and the House never have the \ncourage to do that, in which case this bill is going to cost a lot of \nmoney that is not offset by concomitant savings, or the savings are \ngoing to be made, and when they are made, it is going to deeply cut our \nbenefits under Medicare.\n  That person was right. One of those two things is true, and neither \none is a good result.\n  I remember a few years ago when we tried to reduce the growth in \nMedicare by about $10 billion. Republicans and President Bush were \nexcoriated; we were going to ruin Medicare, and our colleagues on the \nDemocratic side took great glee in the public reaction to that proposal \nto decrease the growth in Medicare by $10 billion.\n  Now we are talking about cutting Medicare by--I said $500 billion. \nThe Finance Committee money is actually $450 billion. So let's be \naccurate. If that is the way this bill comes out, $450 billion, $120 \nbillion of that is reduction of benefits under Medicare Advantage. So \nwhen people say: You would not have your benefits cut, that first $120 \nbillion is a direct cut in benefits, and in my State a lot of seniors \nhave Medicare Advantage policies.\n  The other way in which Medicare is cut--there are basically two \nthings. One is reducing the amount of money we pay doctors and \nhospitals, and that cannot help but reduce the care we get. The final \nmechanism is a Medicare Commission is being established to provide--I \nthink it is every year; maybe every 2 years, but let's say every year--\nan amount of money that will have to be cut and will automatically be \ncut from Medicare unless the Congress finds a different way to do it, \nbut Congress would still have to cut the same amount. So we either do \nit the way we want to do it or we do it the way the commission \nrecommends it. In any event, their recommendation automatically goes \ninto effect if Congress does not act.\n  I have a couple thoughts about that point. We have never been able to \neffect these cuts in the past because seniors know that it cuts deeply \ninto their care, and they have told us and we have reacted by saying: \nOK, we will not do it. We could react that way again, in which case all \nof the savings, or at least a great deal of the savings, that were \nsupposed to result and offset the costs of the bill would not be there. \nSo now the bill is no longer deficit neutral. Now it is not balanced. \nNow it does add to the deficit and to the debt. If we do allow those \ncuts to go into effect, seniors are clobbered by deep reductions in the \ncare they receive all the way from nursing homes to physicians to \nhospitals to hospice, medical devices--you name it. As I said, neither \nof these results is a good result.\n  There were several people who wanted me to convey their thoughts in \nthat regard. I happen to agree with them, so I could do that.\n  I met, after visiting with this group, with a group of spinal \nsurgeons from all over the country and, in fact, from outside this \ncountry. I saw the agenda of their meeting. I was the last speaker. For \na layman, such as you and I, Mr. President, it was daunting to read \nthrough that agenda--all of the latest techniques in using new laser \nand stints and all kinds of things that I did not understand, but it \nwas the very latest technology and techniques for treating spinal \ndiseases and conditions.\n  What they told me was--I was the last person to make a presentation--\nall of these great things we are doing for our patients we are not \ngoing to be able to do under this legislation, first of all, because it \nwill be presumed to cost too much; second, because it will take the FDA \nand the other government agencies way too long to authorize its use for \ntreating Medicare patients, for example; and, third, because the \ncomparative effectiveness research which has in the past been used by \nthese doctors to help them appreciate the best way, clinically, to \ntreat someone is now going to be used to decide what Medicare can \nafford to pay. A lot of the more leading-edge techniques and \ntechnologies are not going to be approved for that purpose.\n  Their point was that people in China and Europe are going to be \ntreated with the latest techniques more than Americans will because the \nAmerican system of health care is going to deny people such as these \nexperts the ability to do what they do.\n  One way this is being accomplished is by taking money away from \nspecialists and giving it to general practitioners. There is a \nrationale for paying general practitioners--family doctors--more money. \nThey are not making enough, and they are the first place most of us \nenter the medical world. If we have something that does not feel right, \nwe go to our doctor. It is usually a family doctor. Frequently, he can \nhelp us, but frequently he says: I think there is something about what \nyou have here that tells me I have to send you to a specialist. We go \nto the specialist then and he orders some specialized tests and he \nexamines them and he may end up having to provide some kind of very \nspecialized treatment and care that is probably going to cost more \nmoney.\n  While the family doctor needs to be paid more, we don't solve that \nproblem by taking money away from the specialists. If we have to add \nmoney to the system to ensure that we have enough doctors who can \nprovide quality care, then there is no free lunch and we have to pay \nfor what we get. We should not make it a zero-sum game and take it from \nDr. B in order to pay Dr. A. That was another strong message of these \nspecialists.\n  I also happened to meet on Friday afternoon with a group of \nphysicians in Phoenix from all different practices--from specialists to \ngeneralists, hospital physicians to others. To a person, they had this \nquestion for me. The way they asked it was, Why isn't anybody talking \nabout medical malpractice reform?\n  I said: I am talking about medical malpractice reform.\n  They said: You are not getting through.\n  I said: The problem is there are a bunch of folks on the other side \nof the aisle who don't want medical malpractice reform, and you know \nwhy. And, yes, they understood the answer why.\n  I remind friends who might not have remembered, Howard Dean, a former \nGovernor of Vermont and a former Democratic candidate for President and \na former Democratic Party chairman was very candid in a townhall \nmeeting in Northern Virginia on August 17 with Representative Moran \nwhere he told the group assembled there that the reason medical \nmalpractice reform was not in the legislation is because they did not \nwant to take on the trial lawyers.\n  That is true, but it does not make it right. Maybe somebody should \ntake on the trial lawyers because there are a lot of estimates of how \nmuch money could be saved through meaningful medical malpractice \nreform. This jackpot justice system of ours that pays trial lawyers and \nrequires physicians to pay as much as $200,000 a year in liability \ninsurance premiums--all of which, of course, have to be passed on to \nthe cost of our care, and perhaps even worse than that, practice what \nis called defensive medicine--raises the cost of our health care. \nDefensive medicine is having all kinds of tests performed and maybe \nputting someone in the hospital an extra day or two all in order to \nprotect from a liability claim that their doctor did not do everything \nhe could to take care of this poor patient and, as a result, the \npatient got sicker and something bad happened.\n  There are a lot of estimates. First, one estimate is from a study \nthat says 10 cents on every dollar spent on health care is paid in \ninsurance premiums by physicians. Obviously, some of that will still \nhave to be paid with medical malpractice reform, but it could be \nreduced as has been the experience in the State of Arizona and the \nState of Texas, which is the reason Senator Cornyn from Texas and I \nhave introduced legislation that will provide modest reforms to the \ntort system by putting some modest caps on noneconomic damages awards \nand providing that expert witnesses who testify have to be really \nexpert witnesses in the area of the alleged malpractice.\n  These two things have saved enormous amounts of money. In Arizona, we \ndon't even have caps on damages, but the Requirement that expert \nwitnesses really be expert has ended up saving millions of dollars and \nreducing the malpractice premiums for physicians in the State of \nArizona.\n\n[[Page S10506]]\n\n  This is a reform we could accomplish on a bipartisan basis that not \nonly would not cost anything, it would actually reap financial \nbenefits. The Congressional Budget Office says just the savings to the \nU.S. Government--because we provide care under Medicaid, Medicare, and \nto our veterans--would save $54 billion. There are a lot of estimates \nthat are higher than that. There is one estimate that is over $100 \nbillion a year.\n  The Director of CBO acknowledged to people of the Finance Committee \nwhen we asked that $54 billion savings would actually be approximately \ndoubled if we take into account the private sector as well. In other \nwords, not only the Federal Government would save that much money, \nwhich pays about half of all health care dollars in the United States, \nthe private sector, which pays the other half, could save a like amount \nof money.\n  These constituents wanted to know why doesn't anybody ever talk about \nit. I had to tell them we are talking about it. It is just that nobody \nis listening.\n  That kind of brings up the last point I want to pass on. After \nmeeting with these three different groups in Phoenix and talking with \npeople elsewhere I went over the weekend, it is pretty clear to me \npeople are becoming very frustrated with their government, and this is \nnot good. They don't think their government is listening to them. We \nare elected to be their representatives, to bring their ideas to \nWashington. Since they can't all study up on the issues as thoroughly \nas we are supposed to do, they trust us to not just to do what they \nwant, not what they say, but to use our best judgment. But they do want \nus to listen to what they are saying and translate that into action.\n  What I hear them saying and what public opinion polls verify is they \nare very worried about the breadth and the depth of this proposed \nhealth care reform. They say it costs too much money; it is going to \nget us in debt; it will raise taxes which are going to be passed \nthrough to them; it is going to raise insurance premiums; and it is \ngoing to involve a massive government intrusion into what is primarily \na private matter between them and their physician, with their insurance \ncompany added into the mix. They see this along the same lines as the \ngovernment takeover of banks and insurance companies and car companies \nand everything else, and they don't like it.\n  One of the reasons they don't like it is because they see their own \nhealth care being delayed or denied as a result. They appreciate the \nfact that if the government gets so involved that it can begin to tell \ninsurance companies what they can pay for and tell doctors what they \ncan do for patients, that the next thing that will happen is their care \nwill be delayed and denied and ultimately rationed.\n  I read a chapter in a book by our former colleague, former majority \nleader of the Senate, Dr. Bill Frist, a renowned heart surgeon. I \ntalked with former Senator Frist about it last week. He actually served \nfor about a year in England under their health system. He makes the \npoint in his book that there are some good things about their health \nsystem. He said the bad thing is that if someone has a serious \ncondition, unless they are at the top of the list, they run the risk of \nnever having their serious condition dealt with.\n  He gave an example of a list of 100 patients who needed heart \nsurgery. He said they would do two a day and gradually work down the \nlist. He said what he found was that after a few weeks, peoples' names \nwere being taken off the list. They didn't need the surgery anymore \nbecause they had died. He said that would never happen in America. He \nsaid if we have 100 people who need heart surgery in America, we would \nfigure out a way to get that heart surgery for them right away, and we \nwouldn't do two a day until we ran out of time and they ran out of \nlife. He said that is really the difference in a system in which we are \ncontrolled by the amount of money the government chooses to put into \nthe system every day versus the kind of system we have that takes care \nof people and worries about the cost later. That is why it is possible \nfor us to say that even people without insurance get cared for. No one \nin this country should die because they don't have insurance because we \nwill take care of them.\n  Obviously, having insurance makes the delivery of care easier, more \ntimely, and much more cost-effective, which is why at the end of the \nday we want to see that everybody is insured.\n  The bottom line is that we do not need to throw out the baby with the \nbathwater, get rid of the system we have that currently takes care of \nmost people very well in order to insure that last group of folks who \ndon't have insurance. We can provide a voucher or subsidy to them and \nget them coverage.\n  The other thing we have to do is help to bring down the costs. \nRepublicans have offered numerous solutions on how to do that without \nhaving the government take over the system. I mentioned one: Medical \nmalpractice reform. It does not cost a dime, it will save billions of \ndollars, and it is good policy besides. So why don't we do it? Because \nthere is a vested special interest that does not want it done. It will \ntake money out of their pockets. That is wrong.\n  My question to all of my colleagues is, When are we going to stand up \nto the special interests? Everybody likes to whack at the insurance \ncompanies. How about taking a good hard look at the trial lawyers? And, \nby the way, while we are talking about insurance companies, Republicans \noffered several ideas on how to add more competition for the insurance \ncompanies so in those situations where they have it good, if we provide \nfor certain reforms that we have offered, such as association health \nplans, small business plans, more flexible HSAs, interstate sales of \ninsurance, all these things would provide more competition for the \ninsurance companies and force them to lower their rates. This would \nmake health care more affordable because it would help small businesses \nin providing health care for their employees.\n\n  All these things came up during these meetings. As I said, I promised \nmy constituents I would be sure to pass their ideas on to my \ncolleagues, and I make these comments in that spirit, hoping that we \nwill listen to our constituents not just in Arizona but in South Dakota \nand everywhere else around the country. And as a result of listening to \na bunch of pretty commonsense folks, perhaps we will make wiser \ndecisions here than we otherwise would have.\n  I see my colleague from South Dakota is here. He had some very \nerudite comments to make on one of the television shows on Sunday, and \nI am happy to yield the floor for Senator Thune.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding the \nfloor, and I appreciate listening to his observations about the current \nstate of the health care debate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak for \nup to 20 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, as my friend from Arizona noted, there are \nmany things about the current debate that I think raise questions with \nthe American people. He was discussing what he had heard back in his \nState of Arizona regarding the current debate that is before the \nCongress and the concerns people have, the anxiety, the frustration, \nand, frankly, the fear that I think a lot of Americans have about what \nhappens and what the ultimate result may be. For instance, will this \nhealth care reform effort lead to higher costs for them? Will it lead \nto questions about whether they will be able to retain that \nfundamental, essential relationship between the patient and the doctor?\n  Those are, I think, very valid questions. Frankly, we don't have \nanswers to them because, one, we don't have a bill. We haven't seen a \nbill. That bill is being written, we are told, in the majority leader's \noffice. There will be a handful of people in that room. There will not \nbe input from our side, let alone from many Democrats in the Senate. It \nis going to be basically cranked out and at some point we will have a \nbill that will be put on the floor before the entire Senate. Having \nsaid that, it is interesting to me that this week we are going to have \na vote in the Senate on an issue which, frankly, is very much a part of \nthe debate over\n\n[[Page S10507]]\n\nhealth care reform and yet that vote is being separated out. I think \nthere is a reason for that, which I will come back to in a moment.\n  I think it is important and telling that the first vote on health \ncare reform here in the Senate is going to be to add a quarter of a \ntrillion dollars to the Federal debt. That is right, $250 billion--or \n$247 billion, to be precise--is going to be added to the Federal debt \nbecause what the majority leader has decided to do is to bring \nlegislation to the floor this week that would address the physician \nreimbursement issue. We all believe that needs to be addressed. There \nis no one on our side of the aisle who doesn't believe we need to \naddress the challenge that we will face in January of this coming year. \nPhysicians across this country, if we don't take steps, are going to be \nsubjected to a 21\\1/2\\ percent pay cut. That is not something anybody I \nknow of in this Chamber is willing to abide.\n  But we have a fundamental difference about whether that ought to be \naddressed in a way that is paid for, that actually doesn't borrow $250 \nbillion from future generations. The reason I say it should have been \nin the health care reform bill, but wasn't, is because it is a part of \nthat debate. In fact, the House of Representatives included the \nphysician reimbursement issue in their version of health care reform \nand put it out of balance, but at least they were honest. They dealt \nwith it in the context of health care reform, because it is fundamental \nto addressing the health care issues we have in this country. The \nreason I think it was left out of the Finance Committee bill, the \nBaucus bill, is because they knew if they put that in the bill, it \nwould put their bill out of balance, and we had the big proclamation \nthat had come out about how this is deficit neutral, that it is going \nto add $81 billion in surplus, that it is actually going to save money \nin the long run.\n  Obviously, if you back out $250 billion, you can make your books \nbalance in the near term. But what you are doing is adding a quarter of \na trillion dollars to the debt, which this year was $1.4 trillion--\nthree times what we have ever seen here in the last 40 years or so. The \nlast time we have seen debt of this magnitude in terms of a percentage \nof our gross domestic product was right after World War II. But the \ndebt this year is three times what we have seen in recent history--at \nleast in this last decade.\n  I think the first point I would make is that the first vote out of \nthe gate on health care reform should not be to add a quarter of a \ntrillion dollars to the Federal debt and to pile this burden on future \ngenerations of Americans. In fact, there is a bumper sticker going \naround right now, which I think is perhaps pretty descriptive of what \nis happening in Washington, and it says something to the effect: \n``Don't tell those people out in Washington, DC what comes after a \ntrillion dollars.'' I think the American people are sitting out there \nwondering, when we talk about billions and billions and billions, and \nnow we are talking trillions and trillions and trillions, what comes \nafter that? And yet we continue to spend and borrow as if there is no \ntomorrow. I think the American people are picking up on that, and \nobviously they want to see a government that lives within its means \njust as they have to every single day in their personal lives, in their \nbusinesses, and most people who have to live within balanced budgets.\n  It is a lesson I think Washington could learn. It is essential that \nwe don't continue to pile this burden of debt on future generations of \nAmericans. The deficit last year was $1.4 trillion. It is estimated if \nwe stay on the current trajectory that we will double the Federal debt \nin 5 years, triple it in 10 years, and at the end of the 10-year \nperiod, the average part that each household in this country will own \nof that entire Federal debt obligation is $188,000. So if you are a \nfamily in America today or say you are a young couple who has just \ngotten married, and looking at your life ahead of you and planning for \nyour future, you are going to get a wedding gift from the Federal \nGovernment--a big old IOU for $188,000. That will be everyone's share \nof the Federal debt.\n  What we do here with the first vote out of the gate on health care \nreform is add a quarter of a trillion dollars to that Federal debt. A \nquarter of a trillion dollars used to be a lot of money in this town. \nWhen you start talking about $1.4 trillion deficits, maybe it doesn't \nseem like that anymore. I think that is why the American people are \nasking, and probably fairly so, what comes after a trillion dollars. \nWhen you add a quarter of a trillion dollars to the debt, the total \ninterest payment on that amount over the 10-year period, if you can \nbelieve this, is $136 billion. So we are adding $136 billion in \nadditional interest payments that we are going to have to make over the \ncourse of the next 10 years by borrowing an additional quarter of a \ntrillion dollars to address the physician reimbursement issue.\n  I say all that because I think it bears on the bigger question of \nhealth care reform and the fact that right now we have competing bills: \nOne in the House, called the tricommittee bill, if you will, which does \nspend, over a 10-year period, about $2.4 trillion; the Senate HELP \nCommittee bill, which over a 10-year period spends $2.2 trillion; and \nthe Senate Finance Committee bill, which over a 10-year time period \nspends $1.8 trillion--until now. When we add in this $250 billion for \nphysician reimbursements, that now pushes the number on that particular \nbill up to about $2 trillion as well.\n  So what we have is a whole new expansion, a whole bunch of new \nspending on health care by the taxpayers in this country. Obviously, it \nhas to be paid for somehow. Most of it is paid for by cuts to Medicare \nreimbursements that providers in this country would receive, paid for \nin the form of higher taxes that would be borne by small businesses, by \nindividuals, and would ultimately lead to the final outcome of this big \ndebate, which is higher premiums. The whole purpose of this was to \nreduce the cost of health care for people in this country by reducing \nand driving down what they paid for health insurance. But as has been \npointed out, I think over and over now in response to questions posed \nby members of the Senate Finance Committee in answers from the CBO \nDirector, these tax increases--roughly dollar for dollar--will be \npassed on in the form of higher taxes. In fact, some of the taxes in \nthe House bill hit squarely at small businesses and hit squarely at \nindividuals. The CBO and the Joint Tax Committee, which looked at the \nFinance Committee bill, concluded that 90 percent--87 percent, I should \nsay, as far as the Joint Tax Committee and 89 percent was the CBO \nestimate--of the tax burden would fall on taxpayers--on wage earners--\nmaking less than $250,000 a year. In fact, the Joint Tax Committee went \nso far as to say a little over 50 percent of that tax burden would fall \non wage earners making less than $100,000 a year.\n\n  So the tax burden is going to be borne by people who were promised \nthey wouldn't pay higher taxes in the health care reform proposals, and \nit was stated by the President and others that we wouldn't tax people \nwho make less than $250,000 a year. That is clearly not the case. There \nis a 5.4 percent surcharge on high-income earners in the House bill \nwhich would be borne largely by small businesses, many of whom file, \nbecause of the way they are organized, on their individual tax returns. \nSo you are going to have higher taxes on small businesses, higher taxes \non middle-class Americans, and this explosion and expansion of Federal \nGovernment here in Washington to the tune of $2 trillion.\n  You would hope then that you would see that would have some positive \nimpact on health insurance premiums. The reality is, as I said earlier, \nit does not. I think as the debate broadens and we become engaged on \nhealth care reform, the American people are going to come to that \nconclusion, which is why I think they are very concerned about what is \nhappening here in Washington.\n  The other point I will make is that one of the objectives of health \ncare reform--in fact, to me, health care reform ought to be about \ndriving health care costs down, not increasing them, which is what all \nthese bills do--was that it was designed to cover people who aren't \ncurrently covered, to provide access to more Americans. What we are \nseeing now with all these various bills is there are lots of people who \nget left out. Under what they call the House bill--the tricommittee \nbill--17 million Americans still would not have\n\n[[Page S10508]]\n\nhealth insurance. Under the Senate HELP Committee bill, that number is \nmuch higher. It is 34 million who would still not be covered. But there \nis an assumption there, although it wasn't included in the bill, that \nMedicaid would be expanded. That would cover more people. So that \nnumber may be overstated. But the Senate Finance Committee assumes 25 \nmillion people will be without health insurance.\n  So you will have higher taxes, a tremendous amount of higher \nspending--up to about $2 trillion under any of these bills--and an \nexpansion of government here in Washington, DC, cuts to Medicare \nreimbursements--to seniors--across this country, and all for what? \nHigher premiums for most Americans, for people who currently have \ninsurance, to hopefully cover some Americans. When you are spending $2 \ntrillion, there ought to be some advantage to that, but clearly a lot \nof Americans are still going to be without health insurance when this \nis all said and done.\n  I am concerned. I think a lot of our colleagues here in the Senate--\nand not just on our side of the aisle, but I think a number on the \nother side too--have expressed concerns about starting the debate a \nquarter of a trillion dollars in the hole by putting a bill on the \nfloor that is going to spend a quarter of a trillion dollars--$250 \nbillion--over the next 10 years that is not paid for. That puts any \nbill that is considered later completely out of balance, and it is a \ngimmick that is designed to allow the President and the Democratic \nmajority to say our health care reform bill is deficit neutral. Well, \nsure, if you take the $250 billion and back it out, it is easy to say \nit is deficit neutral, when in fact now it is going to be $200 billion. \nThey have about an $80 billion overage on the bill in the Finance \nCommittee, but it is still going to be $200 billion out of balance when \nyou do this, again, to be financed with more debt and more borrowing, \nwhich is exactly what I think we want to avoid, and particularly when \nyou are running deficits as far the eye can see.\n  This last year, about 43 cents out of every dollar that was spent \nhere at the Federal level--in Washington, DC--was borrowed. There isn't \nanyplace in America where you can function like that and still be in \nbusiness. If you are a person doing that in your personal household \nfinances, you would be forced into bankruptcy. If you were a small \nbusiness, you would be forced into bankruptcy. Frankly, were it not for \nthe fact that other countries around the world are financing America's \ndebt, we would be in bankruptcy. Because you can't borrow 43 cents of \neverything you spend, as we are doing here in Washington, DC. In fact, \nto put it in perspective--and a lot of Americans understand this--if \nyou are a family with an annual income of $62,000, it would be the \nequivalent of spending $108,000. That is what we are doing here in \nWashington, DC. Of all the money we spend in a given year, 43 percent \nof that is borrowed. We cannot continue to sustain that.\n\n  I hope that before this bill comes to the floor, we can reach an \nagreement about amendments that might be offered. I would say our side, \nthe Republican side, has amendments it would like to offer to this bill \nthat would help pay for it, help reduce the amount or perhaps entirely \nreduce the amount that would be borrowed in order to finance the \nphysician reimbursement fix, on which we all agree. As I said, there is \nnot anybody on this side who does not agree that needs to be done. In \nfact, Senator Cornyn offered an amendment to the bill that would \nprovide a 2-year fix, a 2-year solution to the problem for physician \nreimbursement. It was voted down. It was defeated, that amendment, in \nthe Senate Finance Committee.\n  We are looking. We are proactive. We have to address this issue. This \nissue was created by the Balanced Budget Act back in 1987. I was a \nMember of the House of Representatives at the time. I voted for that \nbalanced budget agreement, but it included what was called a \nsustainable growth rate formula by which physicians are reimbursed. As \nI said earlier, in January of this year, based upon that formula, \nphysicians would receive a 21.5-percent reduction in their fees, in \ntheir reimbursements.\n  Everybody here--I should not say everybody. I can't speak for \neverybody. But I think most Senators on both sides of the aisle \nacknowledge that issue has to be addressed. We need to fix that, but we \nhave to do it in a way that is fiscally responsible. We want an \nopportunity to offer amendments that would allow us to do that.\n  As of last week, that request was being rejected. There was going to \nbe a cloture vote today, which I understand now has been vitiated, \nwhich means perhaps the leaders are working together on an agreement \nthat would allow Senators on both sides to offer amendments to this \nlegislation that would help pay for it.\n  I think it is telling that there are Democrats who are uncomfortable \nwith the idea of adding $\\1/4\\ trillion to the Federal debt with the \nvery first vote we will cast on health care in the Senate Chamber.\n  I hope we can reach an agreement. I hope the leaders will be able to \ndo that and this will be an open process, that we debate, and there \nwill not be any mad rush to try to cut off debate. Rather, Senators on \nour side would have an opportunity to fix the issue that is going to \nput a lot of physicians in a very uncomfortable position if we do not \naddress it but do it in a way that also is fair to the American \ntaxpayer and make sure we, as a nation, are honoring the responsibility \nwe have, not just to fix this issue for today but to provide a better \nand brighter and more secure future for future generations of \nAmericans. It is a future which, I would add, is very much in jeopardy \nand in peril if we continue to spend and borrow and tax at the rate \nthat is contemplated in the health care reform bill but, more \nimportant, with the very first vote on that health care proposal, which \nis to add $250 billion to the Federal debt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/19/senate-section/article/S10508-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10508-S10511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to talk about health care in three \nways, three different subjects but all vitally important to making sure \nwe get the job done in the next couple weeks. As many Americans know, \nin the Senate right now, we have the HELP Committee bill that passed in \nJuly and the recent passage of the Finance Committee bill coming \ntogether in a merger process which is days away from completion or \ncertainly in the near future. As that process unfolds, there are parts \nof our bill, meaning the HELP Committee bill, that I hope remain intact \nor at least, in large measure, are left as part of the final Senate \nbill.\n  One part is on the issue of children's health insurance. We had an \nimportant debate about this program, which was authorized in 2009, so \nthat within the next several years, within the next 4 years, maybe by \nthe end of 4 years, we will have as many as 14 million children across \nAmerica covered by that program, a tremendous advancement from where we \nwere even 10 years ago. It has shown results in a lot of places. It is \na well-tested program.\n  One of the more recent debates, within the Finance Committee, was \nwhether children in CHIP, whether that program itself would be stand-\nalone--as I believe and as I am glad the Finance Committee agreed with \nme and with others--or whether it would be folded into the exchange. \nThey didn't do that in the Finance Committee. I am glad they did not.\n  In this instance, we have a program which started in States such as \nPennsylvania back in the early 1990s and then became a national program \nin the mid-1990s, about 1997. What we have seen in Pennsylvania are \ntremendous results. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a one-page survey by the Pennsylvania Insurance Department from \n2008 about uninsured numbers, ages zero to 18 and then 19 to 64.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S10509]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS19OC09.001\n\n\n\n[[Page S10510]]\n\n  Mr. CASEY. What this chart shows is when we compare individuals who \nhappen to be zero to 18 in age versus 19 to 64, we find that in \nPennsylvania, across the 67 counties, we have an uninsured rate of 5 \npercent among children. So ages zero to 18, it is 5 percent uninsured. \nIt is still too high--we want to bring that down to zero--but much \nlower than it had been. But among the age category 19 to 64, meaning \neveryone above the age of 18 prior to the time they have an opportunity \nto receive Medicare, 12 percent are uninsured in Pennsylvania. I doubt \nthat is much different across the country.\n  One of the lessons from that is that when we take concerted action to \nfocus, whether it is public resources or private resources but of a \nstrategy for health care, we can bring the numbers down dramatically. \nSo children's health insurance in Pennsylvania is in much better shape \nthan it was 10 or 15 and certainly 20 or 25 years ago. But we haven't, \nas a country, begun to focus on that age category 19 to 64. If it is 12 \npercent in Pennsylvania, it is probably similar across the country \nbecause there has been no strategy for people in that age category \ncomprising our workforce.\n  We have to bear that in mind. When we have one category with an \nuninsured rate of 5 percent versus another that is more than double \nthat at 12 percent, we have to continue to focus strategies in the \ndebate on that age category. In this process of coming to a bill, I \nbelieve there are several policies and several strategies that will get \nus to the point where the rate for ages 19 to 64 will come down as \nwell. As many Americans know, the Affordable Health Choices Act, the \nbill from the HELP Committee, has as its goal and is premised upon the \nidea of covering as many as 97 percent of the American people. We \nfinally have a strategy for every age group in addition to what we have \ntried to do for children and what we have done to help older citizens, \nover more than 40 years now, over the age of 65 or 65 and up.\n  One of the parts of the HELP Committee bill which does not get a lot \nof attention is a part of the bill which is set forth in sections 3201 \nto 3210. It starts on about page 228 of the HELP Committee bill. I know \nthese bills are big, well more than 800 pages, but this section on the \nCommunity Living Assistance Services and Supports Act, the so-called \nCLASS Act, is a breakthrough--I think to be understated--because what \nit does is provide individual Americans who have functional limitations \nto be able to continue working but also to provide some of the help \nthat goes into providing them the wherewithal to continue working.\n  Here is what the fundamental purpose is. I am reading from the \nsummary: The fundamental purpose of the bill ``is to establish a \nnational voluntary''--voluntary--``insurance program for purchasing \ncommunity living assistance services and supports in order to provide \nindividuals with functional limitations with tools that will allow them \nto maintain their personal and financial independence''--probably the \nmost important word in that paragraph--``and live in the community \nthrough a new financing strategy for community living assistance \nservices and supports,'' and ``establish[ing] an infrastructure that \nwill help address the Nation's community living assistance services and \nsupports needs, and alleviate burdens on family caregivers.''\n  What we have now, unfortunately, in many places is two or three major \nproblems. The individuals themselves are not able to work sometimes; \nthey have an inability to work because of limitations, and they are not \nable to pay for the kind of care they need. That is the main problem.\n  The second problem is, in many families, caregivers try to make up \nfor that. If the family member with limitations cannot pay for \nservices, family members provide the kind of services they would hope \nto get from some other person or entity.\n  What we are doing here is relieving a burden on individuals so they \ncan be fully functional and independent because of the support and help \nthey get, such as someone coming into their home in the morning to help \nthem get off to work and to be able to meet them at the end of the day \nand help them with so-called activities of family living, things we all \ntake for granted in our daily lives: everything from feeding and \nbathing and other fundamental things that all of us have to do every \nday. With a little bit of help from someone, many Americans can lead a \nlife of employment, a life of dignity, and a life of contribution to \nour economy.\n  It also gives some real help to family members. So we will talk more \nabout the details of how this works. I should mention the person who \nwas the driving force on this legislation--and he and his staff worked \non this for years--was the late Senator Kennedy. He spent many years \ndeveloping this program, developing the CLASS Act, and making sure it \nwas part of our bill. That is why we wanted to make sure it was part of \nthe Affordable Health Choices Act, and it should be part of the final \nhealth care legislation we enact here in the Senate. If we are going to \ndo the right thing, it will be in the bill. I think most people here \nwant to do the right thing as it relates to people with functional \nlimitations who can contribute more to their workplace and contribute \nmore to our economy.\n  Senator Kennedy's work was focused not just on providing a program to \ngive people that opportunity, his focus was also: How can we do it in a \nway that is fiscally responsible? Well, this program provides not just \na lot of help for people with limitations and their families, but it \nalso does not cost the Federal Government in the process because people \nwill be paying in overtime and then have the opportunity to use those \nresources when they need them.\n  Let me finally move to another area in the remaining time I have. In \naddition to the importance of preserving the Children's Health \nInsurance Program the way it is right now--which I think was a great \nadvancement in the Finance Committee--in addition to enacting \nlegislation which will have the CLASS Act as part of it, the third \nthing I am going to mention today is an issue that has received a lot \nof attention, but sometimes we do not highlight some of the elements \nthat are very important to the American people. I speak of the so-\ncalled public option, which in our Senate health care bill, the HELP \nCommittee bill, is entitled the ``Community Health Insurance Option.''\n  One of the most important parts of the bill--in fact, I think the \nfirst word in the section is the word ``voluntary.'' When I was going \nacross Pennsylvania talking to people about our health care bill--and \nour bill passed in July, so when I was on the road in August, we had a \nchance to talk about a bill, not just a concept but a bill we had \nalready passed out of committee--some people who were opposed to the \npublic option would ask a question or make a statement, and often they \nwould say to me: Well, I don't want to be forced into some government \nprogram and lose my ability to choose or lose some of the rights I have \nnow.\n  I would point to the Community Health Insurance Option section of the \nbill and say: The first word is ``voluntary.'' There is no requirement \nhere. I think that mythology kind of got ahead of the truth. It is \nvoluntary; that is, voluntary as it relates to an individual but also \nvoluntary as it relates to a provider.\n  Second, as to the benefit package, as we wrote it in our bill, in the \nHELP Committee, it would meet the so-called gateway. In our bill we \ncall it a ``gateway.'' In the other bills, they call it an \n``exchange.'' But it meets the gateway standard by offering coverage \nthat has an essential benefit package, including ambulatory patient \nservices, emergency services, hospitalization, maternity and newborn \ncare, mental health and substance abuse services, prescription drugs, \nrehabilitative services and devices, preventive and wellness services, \nand pediatric services. States can offer additional benefits beyond \nthat essential benefit package with any cost of such additional \nbenefits being assumed by the State. So that is what the public option \nin our bill, the Community Health Insurance Option, would offer as a \nbenefit package.\n  The premium rates will be set by the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices at an amount sufficient to cover expected local costs--local \ncosts. So you are going to have a lot of impact and relevance as to \nwhat is happening in the local community. And also--this is very \nimportant--the Community Health Insurance Option has to meet\n\n[[Page S10511]]\n\nsolvency standards. It cannot just operate and not worry about \nstandards that involve solvency. If there are States that have higher \nlevels or higher requirements as to solvency, the public option would \nhave to meet that.\n  The reimbursement rates will be negotiated by the Secretary and shall \nnot be higher than the average of all local--local--gateway \nreimbursement rates.\n  I mentioned the importance of solvency as a requirement.\n  Startup funds will be provided by the Treasury to cover costs of \ninitial operations and cover payments for the first 90 days of the \nplan's operation. But then that public entity, which is State based, \nwould have to pay the money back over time. I think that is critically \nimportant to point out.\n  Finally, State-based advisory councils will provide recommendations \nto the Secretary on operations and policies regarding the Community \nHealth Insurance Option, to take advantage of local innovative efforts \nand meet local concerns. So this is not some entity that is going to \noperate in Washington. It is an entity that will have not just public \ninput and local input and local relevance but actually will take \nadvantage of local innovative efforts that we see all across the \ncountry. I know in Pennsylvania there are hospitals or hospital systems \nor communities that do things a different way and are very successful, \nand we have to be giving them the opportunity to have that kind of \nflexibility.\n  I believe it is the right thing to do to have as part of the final \nbill a public option. I believe our bill we passed out of committee is \nthe right way to do it. Others might have another version of it. But I \nbelieve the Community Health Insurance Option is a voluntary, focused \nway to make sure we are injecting real competition and thereby lowering \ncosts but also enhancing choice.\n  One thing we do not want to do at the end of this road is limit \nchoices people have. A lot of people will stay with their private \ninsurance policy or their private plan. They will want to stay there. \nBut others may say: I am in such a predicament or I am in such a cost \nsituation that I need to choose a public option.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President--I will wrap up with this--I believe this \ndebate has been critically important to the American people, even the \ndebates that get a little heated. It is very important we get this \nright. It is very important we have spent the time we have spent over \nthese many weeks and months. But we are reaching the point now where we \nare down to weeks, thank goodness, not months.\n  I believe we can get this right, we can put in place strategies to \ngive people peace of mind, so when they go to work in the morning, they \ndo not have to worry, as they do, about health care--the cost of it, \nthe burden of it, being denied coverage because of a preexisting \ncondition or having a child denied coverage because of that or a loved \none. I believe we can also begin to wrestle the costs to the ground and \nnot have them spiraling upward, as they have been doing for 10 or 15 or \nmore years. I also believe we can enhance choice and quality.\n  Even with all the debates we are having, all the disagreements we \nsometimes have here in Washington, there is a lot of consensus about \nthe need to pass a bill, about the need to enhance prevention efforts \nand quality efforts. I believe we can get there. But we will continue \nto highlight some major aspects of the bill, and we are going to \ncontinue to fight hard for these fundamental priorities of health \ninsurance reform.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, after a lot of serious debate and \ndiscussion, we apparently are about to come to the point where we have \nour first vote on health care reform.\n  What is it the Democrats--those on the other side--propose we do? Add \none-quarter of a trillion dollars to the national debt. I thought this \ndebate was supposed to be about reducing costs--reducing costs to the \ngovernment and reducing costs to individuals across this country who \ncannot afford to pay for health care insurance. And then, as we find \nways to reduce the costs of what we are doing, we can begin to expand \nhealth care coverage to the Americans who do not have insurance. But it \nis as big a problem--or bigger--today that those who do have health \ncare insurance--and that is about 250 million of us out of 300 \nmillion--that many Americans cannot afford their health care.\n  So our focus is, I thought, on cost. How do we reduce costs to the \ngovernment and costs to the American people? What we see is that the \nvery first vote on health care reform will be on a proposal to increase \nthe debt by $247 billion over 10 years in order to pay for Medicare \ndoctors reimbursements. This is not the insurance companies talking. \nThis is not the Republicans talking. This is not one news commentator \ntalking. This is the proposal by the Democratic side, that the first \nvote will be to increase the debt by a quarter of a trillion dollars.\n  I wish to talk for a few minutes about this bill as we see it. Here \nwe are supposed to be having legislation to reduce the costs to the \ngovernment, and we apparently are going to, as the first step in the \nwrong direction, add a quarter of a trillion dollars to the government. \nThe second thing we are trying to do is to reduce your costs--the costs \nthat each of us pays for our health care insurance. The outlines of the \nbill we see coming through the Congress would actually increase \npremiums.\n  I would ask the American people and ask my colleagues: If our goal is \nto reduce costs--and we are adding to the debt and increasing premiums \ninstead of reducing premiums and reducing the debt--why are we doing \nthis?\n  Let me start first with adding a quarter of a trillion dollars to the \ndebt. Here is what the proposal would be. You will remember a few days \nago there was a great deal of congratulations when the Finance \nCommittee finished a lot of hard work, and they said: This is a \ndeficit-neutral bill. It doesn't add anything to the debt. That is what \nthe Congressional Budget Office said based on a series of assumptions. \nThat is something to be proud of because the President himself has said \nhe won't sign a piece of legislation that adds one dime to the debt, \nand then he added to that, ``and I mean it,'' like a parent who wanted \nto make sure he was being heard by unruly Members of Congress.\n\n  I am glad he said that. I heard him say it earlier in the year when \nhe had a summit on the condition of the Federal budget. Democrats and \nRepublicans--we all went down to the White House. People came in and \nsaid: If we don't do something about the increasing debt in our \ncountry, our children and grandchildren aren't going to have a country. \nThat was not overstating it. Everyone at the President's summit agreed \nthat the principal cause of runaway debt in America is health care. It \nis Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Just these past few days--here is the weekend newspaper in Tennessee. \nThis is the Nashville Tennessean on Saturday: ``Deficit leaps to $1.4 \ntrillion.'' I think most Americans--I know at least most Tennesseans--\nare deeply concerned about this. But lest you think a Republican \nSenator is exaggerating the problem, let me just read a few paragraphs \nfrom the Associated Press story:\n\n       Deficit leaps to $1.4 trillion. Economists warn of crisis \n     if U.S. fails to act.\n\n  This is an Associated Press story.\n\n       What is $1.42 trillion? It's the federal budget deficit for \n     2009, more than three times the most red ink ever amassed in \n     a single year.\n       It's more than the total national debt for the first 200 \n     years of the Republic, more than the entire economy of India, \n     almost as much as Canada's, and more than $4,700 for every \n     man, woman and child in the United States.\n\n  Yet the first proposal, the first vote on health care is going to be \nto add to that debt.\n  The Associated Press article continues:\n\n\n[[Page S10512]]\n\n\n       As a percentage of U.S. economic output, it is the biggest \n     deficit since World War II. And, some economists warn, unless \n     the government makes hard decisions to cut spending or raise \n     taxes, it could be the seeds of another economic crisis.\n\n  Yet the first vote on the health care reform bill will be to add a \nquarter of a trillion dollars over the next 10 years to the national \ndebt.\n  Quote:\n\n       ``The rudderless U.S. fiscal policy is the biggest long-\n     term risk to the U.S. economy,'' said Kenneth Rogoff, a \n     Harvard professor and former chief economist for the \n     International Monetary Fund.\n\n  Quote:\n\n       ``As we accumulate more and more debt, we leave ourselves \n     very vulnerable.''\n\n  Yet the first vote that is proposed on the health care reform bill is \nto add a quarter of a trillion dollars to the national debt. This seems \nunbelievable.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record following my \nremarks the article by the Associated Press from the National \nTennessean of last Saturday.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the issue at hand is something with \nwhich we are all very familiar. It is called the doctors reimbursement \nproblem. When the 40 million seniors on Medicare go to see a doctor, \nthe doctor is paid at a rate set by the government. That rate is only \nabout 80 percent of what the doctor would be paid if the doctor was \nseeing a person with private health care insurance.\n  There is a complicated formula in the law that says those doctor \npayments will go down over the next several years--by as much as 25 \npercent over the next 2 years. The Congressional Budget Office has \nestimated that over the next 10 years, just to pay physicians the same \nthey are being paid today, which I don't think very many physicians \nwould be happy with, will cost $247 billion more than is accounted for \nin the Baucus bill that came out of the Finance Committee. So they just \nassumed it wouldn't be paid to physicians and the doctors would be, in \neffect, paying for the health care bill.\n  Well, suddenly some people on the other side of the aisle said: Oh, \nwe can't do that, so we will just separate it from the health care \ndebate. Actually, I think they have done us all a favor because they \nhave made it the first vote on the health care reform bill. So we will \nhave a chance to vote up or down on whether we want to add a quarter of \na trillion dollars to the national debt. My experience in life is that \nmost people remember their first impression, and if their first \nimpression of voting on the health care reform bill is that the \nCongress starts off by just brazenly adding a quarter of a trillion \ndollars to the national debt at a time when the deficit has just leaped \nto $1.4 trillion in 1 year, then I think the American people will have \na pretty good idea of what we are about here.\n  I think the President doesn't--I can't imagine him wanting this, \nbased upon his saying, ``I will not sign health care reform that adds \neven one dime to our deficit.'' And this is part of health care reform, \nmake no mistake about that. This is part of the bill. It is part of the \nproblem. We are looking at health care over the next 10 years. That is \nthe way our budget cycles work. Everyone is scoring it or estimating \nits costs based upon what it costs over the next 10 years. To pay \ndoctors 10 years from now what they are being paid today--which I doubt \nmany doctors would be very happy with--will cost $247 billion.\n  So instead of saying, let's find ways to cut other programs or raise \ntaxes, we say, let's add a quarter of a trillion dollars to the debt. \nAdding a quarter of a trillion dollars to the national debt as the \nfirst step in the health care reform debate is the first step in the \nwrong direction. Of course we need to fix the problem of doctors \nreimbursement. It needs to be a part of what we do this year in health \ncare reform. But just as with other parts of health care reform, we \ndon't add to the debt to do that. At least that is what the President \nhas said. At least that is what Republicans have said. And at least \nthat is what the American people are saying at a time when the debt \ngoes up and up and up.\n  The next problem is that not only is the cost to the government going \nup and our first vote on health care reform about to be to add to the \ndebt, the outlines of the bill we are seeing increases premiums.\n  Over the weekend, the President said: Well, it is those mean old \ninsurance companies trying to mislead you.\n  You don't have to be an insurance company to understand that the \npremiums are likely to go up. In the first place, the Finance Committee \nreduced the penalty you pay if you don't buy insurance to a level that \nwill cause a lot of people not to buy insurance--at least that is the \nestimate of many--and if younger people especially don't buy insurance, \nthe pool of people who do buy insurance gets smaller and the people in \nthat pool find their premiums going up.\n  No. 2, the bill says--the outlines of the bill; of course we don't \nreally have a bill. We will have a bill within the next several weeks, \nI imagine, or maybe several days. The bill says it is going to make it \nmore expensive for my sons--one who is 30 and one is 40--to buy \ninsurance and closer to what it costs for me. Right now across the \ncountry, I might pay eight times as much for my insurance as younger \npeople do, but under this law it is going to say: We don't like that \nbig gap between younger people and older people, so it might have to be \ntwo to one or three to one. Basically, it raises the cost of insurance \nfor young people as a way of reducing it for older people. That means \nthe premiums of younger people will go up, and it also means they may \nelect to get out of the system, make the pool smaller, and as a result \nof that, all premiums would go up.\n  No. 3, there is a provision in the law that says you must buy in many \ncases a government-approved health care insurance. Many people choose a \nhigh-deductible insurance where you only buy insurance for the big \nproblems you know you can't afford and you pay less for your monthly \npremiums that way. A government-approved insurance policy might make it \nnot as easy for you to do that. One estimate in Tennessee is that the \ncost for one of these high deductible plans would go from $50 a month \nto $400 a month--a big increase for those who buy high-deductible \ninsurance policies. That is the third way your premium might go up.\n  Then the fourth way and final way, in addition to this concept we see \ncoming from the Finance Committee that your premiums might go up, is \nthere are $955 billion in new taxes. They say that is if we are taking \na 10-year period after the program is fully implemented. They say: \nWell, those are taxes on other people. But they are taxes on your \ninsurance company, taxes on the person you buy a medical device from, \ntaxes on other people in the health care industry. What do you suppose \ncompanies do in any area that get additional taxes? For the most part, \nthey pass those taxes on to you.\n\n  So there have been a number of independent observers who have said \nthat because the individual mandate has been weakened, because young \npeople are going to have to pay more for their insurance as compared to \nolder people, because the government-approved policy is not going to \nallow so many high-deductible policies that many Americans like, and \nbecause nearly $1 trillion in taxes is eventually going to be over 10 \nyears passed on to people who buy insurance, for all of those reasons, \npremiums are likely to go up.\n  So we are about to begin the debate on this floor on health care \nreform. It is one we need. What Republicans believe--and I see my \nfriend from Delaware who I gather wishes to speak, and I will wind up \nso he can. But here is what we should do. We need health care reform, \nbut health care reform is first and foremost about reducing costs, \nfirst to the government and next to individuals. To re-earn the trust \nof the American people on this score, we should start step by step with \nspecific proposals that reduce costs; for example, allowing small \nbusinesses to pool their resources and offer insurance to their \nemployees. Our own committees have estimated that this could add \nmillions of people to the insured rolls. Second, reduce junk lawsuits \nthat drive up costs. We disagree about how much it drives up the cost \nof insurance, but we don't disagree that it does. Third, allow people \nto buy insurance across State lines. That would create more \ncompetition. Fourth, create more\n\n[[Page S10513]]\n\nhealth insurance exchanges so people can shop and find more different \nkinds of policies. Fifth, most all of us agree we need to encourage \nmore health information technology and make health care simpler in that \nway. Perhaps we could even agree to change the tax incentives so that \nthey don't all go to one group of people and are not going to lower and \nmiddle-income people.\n  There are four or five or six or seven ideas we could go step by step \nwith to reduce costs. If we did that, we would be moving in the right \ndirection. It is the wrong direction to start the health care debate \nwith a vote that adds a quarter of a trillion dollars to the national \ndebt at a time when we just added $1.4 trillion to the national debt in \nthe past year. Of course we need to fix the doctors reimbursement, but \nit needs to be paid for by--it can't be added to the debt.\n  Whatever steps we take ought not just reduce the cost to the \ngovernment; they need to reduce the costs to Americans, all of us who \nhave health care insurance. Let's find ways to go step by step to \nreduce costs to the government and to reduce costs to premium holders \nand not start off by adding a quarter of a trillion dollars to the \nnational debt.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                         [From the Tennessean]\n\n                     Deficit Leaps to $1.4 Trillion\n\n                         (By Martin Crutsinger)\n\n       Washington.--What is $1.42 trillion? It's the federal \n     budget deficit for 2009, more than three times the most red \n     ink ever amassed in a single year.\n       It's more than the total national debt for the first 200 \n     years of the republic, more than the entire economy of India, \n     almost as much as Canada's, and more than $4,700 for every \n     man, woman and child in the United States.\n       As a percentage of U.S. economic output, it's the biggest \n     deficit since World War II.\n       And, some economists warn, unless the government makes hard \n     decisions to cut spending or raise taxes, it could be the \n     seeds of another economic crisis.\n       Treasury figures released Friday showed that the government \n     spent $46.6 billion more in September than it took in, a \n     month that normally records a surplus. That boosted the \n     shortfall for the full fiscal year ending Sept. 30 to $1.42 \n     trillion. The previous year's deficit was $459 billion.\n       ``The rudderless U.S. fiscal policy is the biggest long-\n     term risk to the U.S. economy,'' says Kenneth Rogoff, a \n     Harvard professor and former chief economist for the \n     International Monetary Fund. ``As we accumulate more and more \n     debt, we leave ourselves very vulnerable.''\n       Forecasts of more red ink mean the federal government is \n     heading toward spending 15 percent of its money by 2019 just \n     to pay interest on the debt, up from 5 percent this fiscal \n     year.\n       President Barack Obama has pledged to reduce the deficit \n     once the Great Recession ends and the unemployment rate \n     starts falling, but economists worry that the government \n     lacks the will to make the hard political choices to get \n     control of the imbalances.\n       Friday's report showed that the government paid $190 \n     billion in interest over the last 12 months on Treasury \n     securities sold to finance the federal debt. Experts say this \n     tab could quadruple in a decade as the size of the \n     government's total debt rises to $17.1 trillion by 2019.\n       Without significant budget cuts, that would crowd out \n     government spending in such areas as transportation, law \n     enforcement and education. Already, interest on the debt is \n     the third-largest category of government spending, after the \n     government's popular entitlement programs, including Social \n     Security and Medicare, and the military.\n       As the biggest borrower in the world, the government has \n     been the prime beneficiary of today's record low interest \n     rates. The new budget report showed that interest payments \n     fell by $62 billion this year even as the debt was soaring. \n     Yields on three-month Treasury bills, sold every week by the \n     Treasury to raise fresh cash to pay for maturing government \n     debt, are now at 0.065 percent while six-month bills have \n     fallen to 0.150 percent, the lowest ever in a half-century of \n     selling these bills on a weekly basis.\n       The risk is that any significant increase in the rates at \n     Treasury auctions could send the government's interest \n     expenses soaring. That could happen several ways--higher \n     inflation could push the Federal Reserve to increase the \n     short-term interest rates it controls, or the dollar could \n     slump in value, or a combination of both.\n\n\n                      Spending likely to increase\n\n       The Congressional Budget Office projects that the nation's \n     debt held by investors both at home and abroad will increase \n     by $9.1 trillion over the next decade, pushing the total to \n     $17.1 trillion under Obama's spending plans.\n       The biggest factor behind this increase is the anticipated \n     surge in government spending when the baby boomers retire and \n     start receiving Social Security and Medicare benefits. Also \n     contributing will be Obama's plans to extend the Bush tax \n     cuts for everyone except the wealthy.\n       The $1.42 trillion deficit for 2009--which was less than \n     the $1.75 trillion that Obama had projected in February--\n     includes the cost of the government's financial sector \n     bailout and the economic stimulus program passed in February. \n     Individual and corporate income taxes dwindled as a result of \n     the recession. Coupled with the impact of the Bush tax cuts \n     earlier in the decade, tax revenues fell 16.6 percent, the \n     biggest decline since 1932.\n       Immense as it was, many economists say the 2009 deficit was \n     necessary to fight the financial crisis. But analysts worry \n     about the long-term trajectory.\n       The administration estimates that government debt will \n     reach 76.5 percent of gross domestic product--the value of \n     all goods and services produced in the United States--in \n     2019. It stood at 41 percent of GDP last year. The record was \n     113 percent of GDP in 1945.\n       Much of that debt is in foreign hands. China holds the \n     most--more than $800 billion. In all, investors--domestic and \n     foreign--hold close to $8 trillion in what is called publicly \n     held debt. There is an additional $4.4 trillion in government \n     debt that is not held by investors but owed by the government \n     to itself in the Social Security and other trust funds.\n\n\n                         Inflation is a threat\n\n       The CBO's 10-year deficit projections already have raised \n     alarms among big investors such as the Chinese. If those \n     investors started dumping their holdings, or even buying \n     fewer U.S. Treasurys, the dollar's value could drop. The \n     government would have to start paying higher interest rates \n     to try to attract investors and bolster the dollar.\n       A lower dollar would cause prices of imported goods to \n     rise. Inflation would surge. And higher interest rates would \n     force consumers and companies to pay more to borrow to buy a \n     house or a car or expand their business.\n       Most economists say we have time before any crisis hits. In \n     part, that's because the recession has erased worries about \n     inflation for now. In its effort to stimulate the economy, \n     the Fed cut a key interest rate to a record low last December \n     and is expected to keep it there possibly through all of next \n     year. Demand for loans by businesses and consumers is so weak \n     that low rates are not seen as a recipe for inflation.\n       Robert Reischauer, a former head of CBO, said that in an \n     optimum scenario, Congress will tackle the deficits next \n     year. A package of tax increases and spending cuts could be \n     phased in starting in 2013 and gradually grow over the next \n     decade.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

CARFINE\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise once again to recognize the \nservice of one of America's great Federal employees. I feel fortunate \nto have a chance to stand here each week and share so many inspiring \nstories. Since the spring, I have recognized the contribution of public \nservants from a number of Departments, including Defense, Labor, \nAgriculture, and Justice, as well as Agencies such as NASA and CIA. \nToday, I will be speaking about an outstanding employee from the \nDepartment of the Treasury.\n  This is a time of great challenge to our economy, our markets, even \nthe power of our currency. But the men and women of the Treasury and \nits various agencies and offices are working tirelessly on recovery and \nsecuring our prosperity. The impact they make through their daily work \ncan be felt from coast to coast. Public servants at the Treasury \nDepartment serve on the front lines of job creation, public investment, \nand the management of tax income. They carry on the tradition of \nAlexander Hamilton, our first Treasury Secretary, who believed the \nhealth and prosperity of our Nation depended on the strong management \nand oversight of public funds. He laid the foundations of America's \nfinancial system, which the employees in the Treasury Department \nreinforce each day.\n  Kenneth Carfine has been serving the American people and the Treasury \nDepartment for 35 years.\n  A graduate of the University of Baltimore, Kenneth joined the \nTreasury Department's Financial Management Service in 1973, the same \nyear I came to the Senate to work for then-Senator Biden. During his \ntime there, Kenneth\n\n[[Page S10514]]\n\nworked in banking, cash management, payments, check claims, and \ngovernment-wide accounting.\n  In recent years, he has worked under the Fiscal Assistant Secretary, \nserving as an adviser to senior department officials. His intellect and \ndiligence have been critical as the Treasury addresses economic \nrecovery.\n  Earlier this year, Kenneth helped direct the Treasury's \nimplementation of its responsibilities under the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act. He led the development of two new departmental \nprograms aimed at spurring economic growth. One of them helps renovate \naffordable housing for struggling families, and the other funds \nrenewable energy initiatives.\n  Kenneth has also earned respect as a leader in cash-and-debt \nmanagement infrastructure. Americans who use a national debit card to \nreceive their Social Security benefits have him to thank for leading \nthe implementation of this program.\n  His hand has helped shape how the Treasury deals with debt financing, \ntrust fund administration, cash management, and a range of services.\n  Kenneth Carfine and all of the hard-working employees of the Treasury \nDepartment are leading the way toward economic recovery and sound \nfiscal management of the taxpayer's money. I hope my colleagues will \njoin me in thanking them all for their service to our Nation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley).

Madam President, I have spoken many times on this \nfloor about the urgency of the need to reform our broken health care \nsystem, to expand access to insurance, to improve below average \nresults, and to bring down costs. In a speech to the joint session of \nCongress, the President eloquently described the challenge of this \nmoment:\n\n       I am not the first President to take up this cause, but I \n     am determined to be the last. It has now been nearly a \n     century since Theodore Roosevelt first called for health care \n     reform. And ever since, nearly every President and Congress, \n     whether Democrat or Republican, has attempted to meet this \n     challenge--in some way. . . . Our collective failure to meet \n     this challenge--year after year, decade after decade--has led \n     us to the breaking point.\n\n  We are at the breaking point for Nancy from Barrington, RI, a single \nmother and accomplished music teacher who lost her full-time job and \ncurrently teaches part time at a local university. Nancy has paid the \nfull cost of health insurance out of pocket so her two children would \nnot go without coverage. But now they have graduated from college, they \nare no longer eligible to be on her insurance policy, and they work at \njobs that don't provide health care benefits. So Nancy is now thinking \nabout selling her home, their childhood home, to prevent her family \nfrom going without health insurance. Nancy writes:\n\n       Between the three of us, we are desperate for a workable \n     solution to our health insurance needs. For the first time in \n     my life I feel utterly disenfranchised by my own society.\n\n  We are at the breaking point, not just for Nancy but for so many \nRhode Islanders who have shared with me their stories--stories of loss, \nstories of sorrow, stories of frustration, stories of personal and \nfamily disasters, in a treacherous health care system that offers all \nthe care you need until you need it.\n\n  We are also at the breaking point nationally. Our country's economic \nfuture may well depend on the reforms and investments we now craft to \ncontrol costs and wring savings from the system.\n  One measure of the potential savings is the recent report of \nPresident Obama's Council on Economic Advisers, comparing the share of \nAmerica's gross domestic product spent on health care to the share \nspent by our industrialized international competitors, and evaluating \nthe wide variation in health care expenses region to region within the \nUnited States.\n  The report estimates annual excess health care expenditures of about \n5 percent of GDP. That translates to over $700 billion a year in excess \ncost. They are not alone. The New England Health Care Institute reports \nthat as much as $850 billion in excess costs every year ``can be \neliminated without reducing the quality of care.'' That is $850 \nbillion.\n  Former Treasury Secretary O'Neill, the Treasury Secretary in the Bush \nadministration, has written recently that the excess cost in our health \ncare system is $1 trillion a year. The Lewin Group, a consulting firm \nthat is well regarded on health care issues, has estimated that excess \ncost exceeds $1 trillion per year. So is it $700 billion a year? Is it \n$850 billion a year? Is it $1 trillion a year? Whatever it is, it is a \nsavings target worth an enormous executive and legislative effort, \nparticularly when the evidence is that achieving these savings will \nactually improve health care for the American people.\n  Where will these savings come from? Well, the savings await us in \nquality of care. For instance, the Keystone Project in Michigan reduced \ninfections, respiratory complications, and other medical errors in some \nof Michigan's intensive care units between March 2004 and June 2005, a \nlittle over a year. The project saved 1,578 lives, 8,120 days that \npatients otherwise would have spent in the hospital but did not have to \nbecause they did not get the infections or the complications and, as a \nresult, over 165 million health care dollars, just in Michigan, just in \nintensive care units, just in 1 year, and not all of the intensive care \nunits.\n  In my home State, the Rhode Island Quality Institute has taken this \nmodel statewide with every hospital participating. We are already \nseeing hospital-acquired infections and costs declining. There is a \nsimilar opportunity in disease prevention. The Trust for America's \nHealth found that investing $10 per person per year in programs that \nincrease physical activity, improve nutrition, and prevent tobacco use \ncould save the country more than $16 billion annually within 5 years.\n  Out of that $16 billion in savings, Medicare would save more than $5 \nbillion, Medicaid would save more than $1.9 billion, and private payers \nwould save more than $9 billion. So that is quality of care and \nprevention.\n  A third area for significant efficiencies and savings is the \ninsurance industry's contentious, inefficient billing and approval \nprocess. The battle over approvals for treatment and claims for payment \ncreates a colossal burden on our health care system, causing perhaps 10 \nto 15 percent of the insurance industry's expenditures because the \nhospitals and the doctors and the providers have to fight back. That 10 \nto 15 percent of the insurance companies' expenditures casts a cost \nshadow over the provider community which is probably bigger than the \ninsurance industry spends, because they are less efficient at fighting \nback than the insurance company is at tormenting them.\n  It all adds no health care value. None. It is pure administrative \ncosts and cost shifting. Rhode Island providers have told me over and \nover that half of their personnel are absorbed in this battle and not \nproviding health care. They are at the doctor's office, they work \nthere, but they are not providing health care. They are busy fighting \nwith the insurance company.\n  Even the insurance industry estimates that $30 billion per year could \nbe saved through simplifications of the process. That relates to a \nfourth area, the overall inefficiency and waste that plagues the \nprivate insurance market.\n  While administrative costs for Medicare run about 3 to 5 percent, \noverhead for private insurers is an astounding 20 to 27 percent. A \nCommonwealth Fund report indicates that private insurer administrative \ncosts have more than doubled in the past 6 years. From 2000 to 2006, \nthey increased 109 percent.\n  The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that Americans spend roughly\n\n[[Page S10515]]\n\n$128 billion annually--$128 billion annually--on excess administrative \noverhead in the private health insurance market.\n  A fifth savings area is investments in our infrastructure of health \ninformation technology; secure electronic health records, for instance, \nelectronic coordination between your doctor and your specialist and \nyour pharmacy and your hospital and your laboratory. These investments \npromise big savings as well, $162 billion per year, according to one \nRAND study, and possibly twice that.\n  Finally, reform of how we pay for health care will yield enormous \ndividends. At the moment we mostly pay on a piecework basis. The more \nyou do, the more you are paid. No surprise that we do a lot and pay a \nlot. Since the best care, the best quality care is so often less \nintrusive but better designed and better coordinated, this payment \nreform presents another win-win opportunity: better health care and \nlower cost, hand in hand.\n  There is a problem, though. For many of these reforms, CBO cannot \nfully score the savings they would yield, and thus their importance has \nbeen minimized in our debate. CBO can only estimate health care costs \nand savings that have historic precedent. For example, on the cost side \nwe have the experience of Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. So CBO can estimate how much it will cost to expand the \ncoverage to needy families, as we importantly do in this bill.\n  On the savings side, however, CBO's capability is limited because \nthere is not a lot of information to forecast from. CBO's Director has \nbeen refreshingly candid about this. In a recent letter to Senator \nConrad, he wrote the following:\n\n     . . . changes in government policy have the potential to \n     yield large reductions in both federal health expenditures \n     and federal health care spending without harming health. \n     Moreover, many experts agree on some general directions in \n     which the government's health policies should move, \n     typically involving changes in the information and \n     incentives that doctors and patients have when making \n     decisions about health care . . . Yet, many of the \n     specific changes that might ultimately prove most \n     important cannot be foreseen today and could be developed \n     only over time through experimentation and learning.\n\n  So to summarize: Large reductions in costs are possible. The general \ndirection in which to move to achieve them is agreed. But \nexperimentation and learning are necessary to get there.\n  Even with those analytical limitations, CBO has recognized some cost \nsavings created by several innovative reforms in the Finance \nCommittee's bill. For example, CBO forecasts that an independent \nnonpartisan commission of experts with authority to determine provider \npayment rates under Medicare will save the Treasury $22 billion over a \n10-year period.\n  It also credits Medicare payment reforms that seek to prevent \nhospital readmissions with $2.1 billion in savings; incentives that \nencourage physicians to group together in cost savings organizations \nwith $4.9 billion in savings, and payment reforms aimed at preventing \nhealth care-acquired infections with $1.5 billion in savings.\n  But as you have seen, in comparison to the numbers I talked about \nearlier, those are trivial projections, chump change against the excess \ncost of our health care system. Americans owe the Congressional Budget \nOffice a particular debt of gratitude for how incredibly hard they have \nworked these past weeks and months. CBO performs a valuable service.\n  But its professional discipline requires it to score legislation \nbasing its calculations on what it can chronicle has happened in the \npast. And we have not yet been where we need to go in health care \nreform. Moreover, getting there will require leadership, creativity, \nand perseverance in executive administration, with constant adjustments \nand improvements along the way to achieve our goal.\n  Those factors of executive administration are beyond the capability \nof CBO to predict. The distinguished Presiding Officer was the Governor \nof the State of New Hampshire. She knows well, having served as \nGovernor, what a difference executive administration can make in areas \nwhere there is intelligent and sustained focus. Well, CBO cannot \npredict whether intelligent and sustained focus will occur, so they \ncannot predict the answer to that question.\n  Let me mention one further reform now that we are on the subject of \nexecutive administration, a final reform that can bring leadership and \ncreativity toward achieving all of these goals in quality, in \nprevention, in payment reform, and in information technology. That is \nthe reform that can bring leadership and creativity to pulling all of \nthose reforms together, a public health insurance option, a government-\nrun publicly handled plan that can provide affordable coverage in a \nmarket where premiums have increased 128 percent in 8 years.\n  A public option can bring vigorous competition to a market so \nmonopolistic it would make Andrew Carnegie blush, will force private \nplans to minimize bloated administrative costs which have increased, as \nI said, 109 percent over those 6 years. The public option can pass \nalong savings to consumers in the form of reduced premiums, and can end \nthe wasteful practice of fighting with doctors and patients over \nreimbursement.\n  The public option is our best chance for executive implementation of \nthe delivery system innovations and reforms I have described. Skillful \nexecutive administration will be required just as for every other \nelement of reform. But public plans across the country, driven not by \nprivate motives but by the public good, set new standards of quality \nand efficiency in a market that has lost its way.\n  The point of this reform must be to turn around a health care system \nthat is now spiraling out of control. We spend 18 percent of our GDP on \nhealth care. The next highest spending nation in the world is \nSwitzerland at 11 percent. Even if our success is limited to shaving a \nfew percentage points off our national expenditure on health care, that \nsuccess will be worth hundreds of billions of dollars a year. Yes, \nthere will need to be an initial investment in health care reform, but \nthe potential savings are multiples larger.\n  CBO's inability to score these savings does not mean they aren't real \nand achievable. Given the looming threat to America's fiscal security \nthat is now presented by our health care costs, these savings are not \nonly real and achievable, they are essential. They are necessary. We \nare bound to achieving them, and we must not fail. For that reason, I \ncall on the Obama administration to begin defining a health care \nsavings target from delivery system reform--from health information \ninfrastructure, from quality improvements, from illness prevention, \nfrom more transparency and less bureaucracy, from reform of what we pay \nfor in health care and, ideally, all implemented rapidly and fairly by \npublic plans around the country. They need to set a target.\n  If the administration does not set a savings target, there is no way \nthe vast apparatus of the Federal Government will wheel adequately \ntoward achieving this goal. If we fail to achieve those savings, all \nour dreams--our dreams of universal coverage, our dreams of \naffordability, our dreams of a public option--will crumble like castles \nbuilt on sand.\n  Let's take the most conservative number from President Obama's own \nWhite House, $700 billion a year in annual excess cost. Let's assume \nthe best we can do is to eliminate less than one-third of that excess \ncost--not all of it, not even half of it, less than one-third. Let's \nassume it takes a few years to meet that goal; let's say 4 years. That \nwould still permit reform savings of $200 billion a year by 2014. By \nthen, our annual health care expenditures will have climbed well over \n$3 trillion. So that $200 billion annual savings would be only one-\nfifteenth, about 7 percent, of the cost, then, of our bloated health \ncare system, a system now costing twice as much as other developed \nnations' health care systems that cover everyone. That goal, 7 percent \noff a system that costs twice as much as in other nations, does not \nseem unreasonable.\n  I will ask the administration: What is your annual savings target out \nof that $700 billion to $1 trillion a year in excess cost? What is it, \nand when will you achieve it? Soon you will have a bill out of this \nCongress that gives you the tools to achieve these savings.\n\n[[Page S10516]]\n\nWhen you have that bill, I will ask for a number and a date.\n  I will urge the administration: Be bold. President Kennedy did not \nknow how to get to the Moon when he promised that we would, but he knew \nwe had the talent and the technology to do it, if we had the \nPresident's commitment behind it. Sure enough, it happened.\n  I would also remind the administration of this: We have to achieve \nthese savings anyway. This is not an extra political hurdle the \nadministration would have to clear. This is the bar we must clear if \nour Nation is to return to fiscal health and if our dreams of universal \ncoverage and affordability and good public health and a humane, \nefficient health care system are all to be realized. Again, if we don't \nclear that bar, all those dreams crumble in our hands like dust.\n  Let's step forward now and make a commitment to some hard, firm \nmeasure of savings out of our bloated and inefficient delivery system.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n15 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, pretty much daily over the last couple of \nmonths when the Senate has been in session, I have come to the floor to \nshare letters I have received from people in Findlay, OH--where I was \ntoday--Toledo, Sandusky, Mansfield, Lebanon, all over the State. These \nare letters from people who want to tell me why we need health care \nreform. These are letters mostly from people I have not met, people who \nknow we need to change some things in this country.\n  What is interesting is that one of the common themes that run through \nthese letters--in letter after letter after letter--is that people \nthought they had pretty good health insurance. They were satisfied with \ntheir health insurance. If you asked them a year or two ago: Do you \nhave good health insurance, they would have probably said yes. But then \nthey found they had a child who was diagnosed with a preexisting \ncondition, so they were denied insurance, or they got sick and they \nwent above the annual or lifetime cap on costs they did not even know \nwas in their insurance policy, so the insurance company then rescinded \nthem--is the term they use--there was a rescission to eliminate or take \naway their policy, or they were discriminated against for other \nreasons, or in many cases they lost their job and lost their insurance.\n  In case after case, these are people who are mostly middle class, \npeople playing by the rules, paying their taxes, raising their kids, \nkeeping their communities prosperous, and they typically have lost much \nof what they had.\n  I want to share some of these letters with my colleagues, \nparticularly colleagues who are not so certain, colleagues who still \ndefend the health insurance system and think we do not need significant \nchange, so that they would maybe understand some of these problems a \nlittle better.\n  The first letter is from Wilkins from Youngstown, which is in \nnortheast Ohio. He writes:\n\n       I'm an unemployed former steel worker from Youngstown. I've \n     been struggling to afford my premiums for COBRA while on \n     unemployment and looking for a job.\n\n  COBRA is a bit of a cruel hoax. It is a good program for people who \ncan afford it. But COBRA is for when you lose your job that you can \nkeep your insurance if you pay what you are already paying, plus you \npay the employer's side of the insurance. That is almost impossible to \ndo for most people who lose their job for a very long period of time. \nThey are only eligible for COBRA for up to 18 months anyway. He writes:\n\n       Due to a pre-existing condition of high blood pressure, I \n     had no choice but to continue my coverage under COBRA.\n\n  If he had a break in his health care, if he canceled his health \ninsurance and tried to get other less expensive insurance, he would \nhave been denied coverage because of his preexisting condition. He \nwrites:\n\n       I'm 59 years old and have been working temporary jobs just \n     to get by, but none offers health insurance. I barely make \n     enough to afford my blood pressure medication.\n       I've depleted my savings while watching my unemployment \n     insurance run out.\n\n  That is something else that this Chamber must consider. I just saw \nSenator Shaheen from New Hampshire a moment ago. She has helped lead \nthe fight on extending unemployment benefits for people whose insurance \nhas run out, something, unfortunately, day after day we have tried to \ndo here, and a Republican Senator has stood up and objected and we have \nnot been able to push that through yet. Unemployment insurance makes so \nmuch sense with so many people--from Dayton to Springfield to \nChillicothe to Zanesville--who cannot find a job and have seen their \nunemployment insurance run out.\n  Wilkins writes:\n\n       I'm sick of high insurance premiums. I worked for 38 years \n     and now I have no health care coverage.\n       They threw me away like an old shoe. It's me today and it \n     could be anyone tomorrow.\n       I may not have three years to live until I receive Medicare \n     if I can't afford my medicine.\n       I need health reform now. It just can't wait.\n\n  One of the other themes that runs through these letters is that \npeople who are in their late fifties or early sixties and do not have \ninsurance are just praying--praying--they can get enough help and stay \nwell enough, stay healthy enough so they can make it until they are 65 \nand they can get Medicare.\n  What does that say? Wilkins from Youngstown worked for 38 years. He \nlost his job because of what has happened in the steel industry. He \ncannot afford COBRA. He cannot afford his blood pressure medicine. He \nis working part-time jobs just to try to get by. He is praying he can \nget to 65 so he can get health insurance under Medicare--a program that \nlooks a lot like the public option would look if we pass that \nlegislation in the next couple of months.\n  Robin from Cuyahoga County, in the Cleveland area, writes:\n\n       My son just graduated from college and his coverage under \n     his Dad's employer is coming to an end.\n       While he has found an entry level job, he is not currently \n     a full-time employee and does not have health insurance.\n       He is incredibly healthy, but when he was in high school he \n     was diagnosed with a heart condition, which could require \n     surgery as he ages, but not for decades [his doctor \n     believes].\n       As my son was searching for insurance, he was honest about \n     this condition. Each company he called denied him.\n       So now, a 22-year-old with no history of any illness--\n\n  A young man, 4 or 5 years older than the pages who sit in front of \nus--\n\n     but who at some point in the future might need medical \n     support, can't get health insurance.\n       Instead of creating a system that provides him incentives \n     and proactive monitoring of his condition--\n\n  To keep him as healthy as we can--\n\n     we have a system that drives him away, doesn't encourage \n     preventive measures, and ends up costing everyone more. I \n     encourage you to take every action possible to put an end \n     to health insurance companies denying coverage for \n     preexisting conditions. We need a system that puts an \n     emphasis on preventive care.\n\n  Robin is right about her son. Under our health care bill, as the \nPresiding Officer from Alaska understands, anyone who chooses to can \nstay on his mother's or father's health insurance until reaching the \nage of 26. So her son would have 4 more years on their health care plan \nunder our bill that we are going to debate on this floor in the next \nfew weeks. Robin's son would be able to keep his insurance until he was \nable, down the line, to get a better job with insurance. Obviously, \nunder our bill, he is going to have access to insurance anyway. But one \nof the things to help young people as they go into the workforce--maybe \nthey are living at home, just moved out of the house, finishing college \nor coming home from the military, but so many young people lose \ninsurance because they are working at often low-paying jobs that don't \nprovide insurance for their employees.\n  Beatrice from Summit County, the Akron area, writes:\n\n       As a recent retiree due to economic downsizing, I am left \n     to purchase an expensive insurance plan. But I am not sure \n     how\n\n[[Page S10517]]\n\n     much longer I will be able to pay for the premiums. I only \n     recently got a temporary contractor job that can end at any \n     time.\n       After 37 years of employment with the same company, it is \n     sad to think that after all those years, I am unable to \n     afford to pay my insurance premiums and unable to collect my \n     Social Security since I retired early.\n       As my anxiety and stress increase, additional health \n     problems have surfaced. I am not old enough to qualify for \n     Medicare and unable to afford private insurance or COBRA.\n       I'm asking for your help in supporting health reform that \n     benefits all Americans.\n\n  Beatrice is another example. She has worked for a company--as did \nWilkins from Youngstown, who worked for some 30-plus years, 38 years. \nBeatrice from the Akron area has worked at the same place for 37 years. \nBoth lost their jobs. Both can't afford COBRA. Both can't get \ninsurance. Both are seeing their health compromised.\n  If you have worked someplace for 30 years and you are in your 50s and \nyou are hoping you can stay alive and stay more or less healthy until \nyou are 65, think of the stress that comes with that; the stress of \ntrying to find insurance; the stress of fighting with insurance \ncompanies if you do have a preexisting condition or they put a cap on \ntheir coverage and what that does to people's health care. No place in \nthe world, no developed, wealthy nation such as ours puts their \ncitizens through these constant battles with insurance companies, these \nunending fights when insurance companies do all they can to take \ncoverage away from people who thought they had coverage.\n  I spoke to the Fendlay Rotary today in a community in northwest Ohio \nwhich experienced terrible flooding a couple of years ago and I am \nworking with them to help with the Army Corps of Engineers to get a \nflood mitigation project put together so these floods don't continue to \nhappen on the Blanchard River. We were talking about the insurance \nindustry.\n  I don't dislike the insurance industry. I think they do what they \nhave to do because they compete with one another and each does these \nsame business practices. But understand, first, they don't want to \ncover you if you are not healthy. They would rather not write an \ninsurance policy if you are not healthy, so they hire all kinds of \npeople to make sure they don't take you if you have a preexisting \ncondition or if they think you are going to be an expensive risk. That \nis on the one hand. Then on the other hand, if you have already been \ninsured by this company, if you already have insurance, they have a \nwhole battery of employees who are there to try to deny coverage. I \nread the other day that close to 30 percent of claims are initially \ndenied by insurance companies--30 percent. So the insurance industry \nspends all this money to keep people out who are sick, whom they don't \nwant to insure, to find out if there is any preexisting condition or \nother reasons not to insure them; and then they hire a whole battery of \npeople to try to deny payment, to deny claims if you have an expensive \nclaim against the insurance company.\n  Again, no other country in the world does that. A lot of countries \nrely on private insurance, but they are private not-for-profit \ninsurance companies. They are not companies that try to exclude you \nfrom getting coverage, and then if you have coverage and you get really \nsick, try to cut you off so you don't get your costs paid for, you \ndon't get your claims paid for. It is simply a business model that \nworks for the insurance industry, but it sure doesn't work for the \nAmerican public. It doesn't work for people who thought they had decent \ninsurance.\n  The last letter I will read comes from James. James writes:\n\n       I've paid all of my life for health insurance and now I \n     can't afford it because I'm unemployed. Because I had no \n     insurance, I've had to go to the emergency room, which cost \n     me over $1,300. I've worked and had health care all my life \n     and now I'm told it could cost me $100 up front to even be \n     seen by a doctor. We need a health care system that works for \n     all of us.\n\n  One story, one letter after another. I know when the Presiding \nOfficer is in Fairbanks or Anchorage or anywhere around Alaska, he is \nhearing the same thing from people, through letters and individual \nconversations from so many people who thought they had good insurance, \nonly to find out they don't when they get sick; people who are just \nhanging on until they can get a good government plan, Medicare, when \nthey turn 65; people who have worked hard all of their lives and played \nby the rules and feel like a discarded old shoe, as the gentleman from \nYoungstown wrote.\n  I think about what our health care plan will do and how we are going \nto change the system and make it work for these four people in Ohio and \nfor hundreds of millions of people around the country, where anyone who \nis satisfied with their health insurance under our plan will be able to \nkeep it, and at the same time we are going to build consumer \nprotections around those plans. We are going to ban certain practices, \nincluding no more preexisting condition exclusions, no more \ndiscrimination based on disability and gender and geography and age and \nrace or anything else. No more saying to women, You can't get coverage \nbecause you were a victim of domestic violence and that is a \npreexisting condition. Believe it or not, insurance companies do that \nsometimes. No more saying to a woman who had a C-section, Sorry, you \ncan't get insurance, that is a preexisting condition because the next \nbaby will have to be a C-Section again and that is too expensive for \nus.\n  The second thing the bill will do with consumer protections built \naround it is it will assist small business, giving incentives to small \nbusinesses to cover employees.\n  Third, this legislation will provide insurance for people who don't \nhave coverage or who are dissatisfied with their coverage.\n  Fourth, this legislation will provide a public option so that anyone \nwho chooses can go into the public plan, not necessarily go to CIGNA or \nAetna or United or Medical Mutual in my State, or one of the private \ninsurance companies. That means when people have the public option, it \nwill keep the insurance industry honest because they won't get away \nwith gaming the system because they have a competitor such as the \npublic option that will compete directly with them. It will mean the \npublic option will help to drive prices down because it will make \nprivate insurance more affordable, more efficient. Private insurance \ncompanies will no longer be able, because of the competition, to pay \n$24 million CEO salaries such as Aetna does and so many other private \ninsurance companies do. It will mean that people have more choice in \nsouthwest Ohio.\n  In the Cincinnati-Dayton area, there are two insurance companies that \nprovide 85 percent of the insurance and that is simply not competitive. \nThat is why these monopolistic practices that insurance companies \nengage in so often run counter to the public interests. That is why the \npublic option is so important: to get people choice, to discipline the \ninsurance companies, to bring in competition, to keep prices down, and \nit will matter as we move forward.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the time on the Senate floor. This \nlegislation will be debated over the next couple of weeks. We know that \n70 percent or two-thirds of the American public want a public option. \nWe know a poll by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation says more than 70 \npercent of doctors want a public option. We know an overwhelming number \nof Democrats of both the Senate and House, 90 percent, support a public \noption. As I said, almost two-thirds of the public, through consistent \npolling for the last month, and month after month after month, shows \nthat two-thirds of the public support the public option. It makes \nsense. It makes a good health care bill that much better. It makes the \nsystem work that much better for people who have insurance now and \npeople who don't have insurance, but especially all of us who worry so \nmuch about the health care costs in this country and how they have \nspiraled out of control.\n  I thank the President and yield the floor and suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the coming weeks, the Senate will consider \nS. 908, the Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions Act. Passing this bill \nshould not be difficult 76 Members of this body are registered as \ncosponsors--but it is vital that we do.\n  I support strong sanctions to build pressure on Iran to end its \nillegal nuclear weapons program, which, in light of the recent \ndisclosure of the Qom uranium enrichment facility, may be far more \nadvanced than we realize.\n  However, China and Russia continue to thwart meaningful action in the \nUnited Nations Security Council. As Bob Robb, a columnist for the \nArizona Republic notes, both nations have commercial ties to the \nIranian regime and are unlikely to abandon their interests and assist \nthe United States in building pressure on the Iran.\n  Mr. Robb also emphasizes that U.S. efforts to halt Iran's nuclear \nprogram have taken on a new urgency after the President cancelled the \ndeployments of the ground-based interceptors to Poland and the Czech \nRepublic.\n  Had the President managed to get support from Russia for more \nsanctions on Iran in exchange for sacrificing missile defense, things \nmight look different. However, as shown by Secretary Clinton's recent \nvisit to Moscow, Russia's position has not changed, and the U.S. has \nnothing to show for breaking its strategic commitments with two \nimportant allies.\n  Time is not on the administration's side. Every day the Iranians \nstockpile more uranium and get closer to having long-range missiles \ncapable of delivering the world's most dangerous weapons against our \nallies, our deployed forces, and our homeland. The time to act is now.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the op-ed by Mr. Robb be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Iran a Test of Obama's New Diplomacy\n\n                            (By Robert Robb)\n\n       Iran is providing a premature and very high-risk test of \n     President Barack Obama's new approach to American diplomacy.\n       Simplified, the thesis of the new Obama approach is that if \n     the United States plays nicer with others, others will play \n     nicer with us and be more willing to help do tough things.\n       I've never held out much hope for the Obama approach. I \n     believe that nations generally act in their self-interest \n     without regard to sentiments about other countries.\n       On the other hand, the Bush administration's blustery \n     approach only made the rest of the world more hostile and \n     resentful, which wasn't in our self-interest. So, it was \n     worth giving the Obama approach a whirl.\n       The Obama approach, however, was intended to generate good \n     will over time. The United States would cooperate more on \n     international issues such as climate change and in \n     international organizations such as the U.N. We would engage \n     in direct diplomacy with troublesome regimes such as in Iran, \n     North Korea, Syria, Venezuela and Cuba, all of which Obama \n     said would receive presidential meetings in his first year in \n     office.\n       After showing good will and willingness to engage in direct \n     diplomacy, the rest of the world would be more willing to \n     support the United States if tougher efforts to rein in \n     dangerous rogue behavior nevertheless proved necessary, went \n     the theory.\n       Iran has spoiled and short-circuited the rollout of the new \n     Obama diplomacy. The disputed Iranian election made it \n     difficult to engage in direct diplomacy with the current \n     government without appearing to give the back of the hand to \n     those risking their lives to protest its illegitimacy. \n     Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stepped up his attacks \n     on Israel's right to exist. And Iran remains unflinching and \n     deceitful about its rapidly-developing nuclear program.\n       So, the Obama administration is going to have to test its \n     new diplomatic approach before laying all the prerequisites \n     by trying to organize strong sanctions against Iran. It \n     increased the stakes for such diplomacy greatly by abandoning \n     the missile defense complex in Poland at least in part, it \n     seems clear, to induce greater cooperation on Iran by Russia.\n       Sanctions would have to be crippling to have any hope of \n     forcing Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions. Only the \n     equivalent of a non-military embargo on gasoline imports is \n     thought to have sufficient effect to possibly get the job \n     done.\n       To be effective, a ban on Iranian gasoline imports would \n     require extraordinary international cooperation. Western \n     powers might adopt them, and indeed Western suppliers have \n     already been cutting ties to Iran. But gasoline is \n     transportable and tradable, so masking its origins is \n     difficult but doable.\n       The national interest calculations would suggest that \n     Russia and China are unlikely to go along with potentially \n     effective sanctions against Iran, officially or unofficially. \n     Iran is a client of Russia's on nuclear technology and \n     military apparatus. China is a client for Iranian oil, which \n     provides 15 percent of China's crude supplies.\n       They also have the interest Robert Kagan has cited that all \n     autocratic regimes have in thwarting efforts to pressure and \n     delegitimize other autocratic regimes.\n       The need to very quickly cobble together an effective \n     sanctions regimen against Iran is an unfair test of Obama's \n     new approach. But it's the test that has to be taken.\n       If the effort to impose effective sanctions fails, as it is \n     likely to do, the Russian gambit will prove very costly.\n       If sanctions fail and Israel doesn't act, the world may \n     have to live with an Iran capable of producing a nuclear \n     weapon. In that world, the Poland missile defense complex \n     would have been very valuable.\n       The Obama administration said that it was abandoning the \n     Poland complex designed to shoot down long-range missiles \n     because the intelligence suggested Iran has slowed down the \n     development of its long-range capability. It's hard to credit \n     that. Iran has successfully tested a two-stage rocket and put \n     a satellite in space.\n       Theater missile defense, which the Obama administration \n     says it will emphasize more, is important. But in a world \n     with a nuclear-capable Iran, so is the European missile \n     defense against long-range threats the Obama administration \n     just abandoned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/19/senate-section/article/S10518-3", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10518-S10519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS-\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   TRIBUTE TO LOUISIANA WWII VETERANS\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am proud to honor a group of 92 \nWorld War II veterans from all over Louisiana who travelled to \nWashington, DC, on October 10 to visit the various memorials and \nmonuments that recognize the sacrifices of our Nation's invaluable \nservicemembers.\n  Louisiana HonorAir, a group based in Lafayette, LA, sponsored this \ntrip to the Nation's Capital. The organization is honoring surviving \nWorld War II Louisiana veterans by giving them an opportunity to see \nthe memorials dedicated to their service. The veterans visited the \nWorld War II, Korea, Vietnam, and Iwo Jima Memorials. They also \ntraveled to Arlington National Cemetery.\n  This was the second of three flights Louisiana HonorAir made to \nWashington, DC, this fall. It is the 19th flight to depart from \nLouisiana, which has sent more HonorAir flights than any other State to \nthe Nation's Capital.\n  World War II was one of America's greatest triumphs but was also a \nconflict rife with individual sacrifice and tragedy. More than 60 \nmillion people worldwide were killed, including 40 million civilians, \nand more than 400,000 American servicemembers were slain during the \nlong war. The ultimate victory over enemies in the Pacific and in \nEurope is a testament to the valor of American soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and\n\n[[Page S10519]]\n\nmarines. The years 1941 to 1945 also witnessed an unprecedented \nmobilization of domestic industry, which supplied our military on two \ndistant fronts.\n  In Louisiana, there remain today about 30,000 living WWII veterans, \nand each one has a heroic tale of achieving the noble victory of \nfreedom over tyranny. This group had 36 veterans who served in the U.S. \nArmy, 14 in the Army Air Corps, 34 in the Navy, 4 in the Marine Corps, \none in the Merchant Marines, one in the Coast Guard, and 2 were a part \nof Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Services, WAVES.\n  Our heroes, many of them from South Louisiana, trekked the world for \ntheir country. They fought in Germany, Holland, France, Italy, Africa, \nGuam, Bougainville, Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima, Okinawa, the Philippines, \nNew Guinea, Japan, and Saipan. Their journeys included the invasions of \nNorth Africa, Sicily, and Normandy.\n  One of our Army Air Corps was held as a prisoner of war after his \naircraft was shot down over Germany. Three other Army veterans fought \nbravely in the Battle of the Bulge, all three receiving a Purple Heart \nand one receiving three Bronze stars for his service.\n  One Navy veteran earned 10 medals for his service in the Pacific. An \nArmy Air Corps veteran served in 20 combat missions in Europe between \n1942 and 1955. Another Navy veteran was present for the surrender at \nTokyo Bay in 1945.\n  One Navy veteran was serving in Pearl Harbor during the infamous \nJapanese attack in 1941. Eight veterans received Purple Hearts and five \nof them were held as prisoners of war.\n  I am also proud to acknowledge that of the 92 veterans who visited \nWashington this past weekend, 2 were women who served our country with \nhonor and distinction during World War II.\n  I ask the Senate to join me in honoring these 92 veterans, all \nLouisiana heroes, who visited Washington, and Louisiana HonorAir for \nmaking these trips a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/19/senate-section/article/S10519-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRANSMITTING NOTIFICATION OF THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY \n   WITH RESPECT TO THE EMERGENCY DECLARED PERTAINING TO SIGNIFICANT \nNARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS CENTERED IN COLOMBIA TO CONTINUE IN EFFECT BEYOND \n   OCTOBER 21, 2009, AS RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE ON \n                        OCTOBER 16, 2009--PM 33\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States which was referred to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the \nFederal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that the \nemergency declared with respect to significant narcotics traffickers \ncentered in Colombia is to continue in effect beyond October 21, 2009.\n  The circumstances that led to the declaration on October 21, 1995, of \na national emergency have not been resolved. The actions of significant \nnarcotics traffickers centered in Colombia continue to pose an unusual \nand extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and \neconomy of the United States and to cause an extreme level of violence, \ncorruption, and harm in the United States and abroad. For these \nreasons, I have determined that it is necessary to maintain economic \npressure on significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia by \nblocking their property and interests in property that are in the \nUnited States or within the possession or control of United States \npersons and by depriving them of access to the U.S. market and \nfinancial system.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, October 16, 2009.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/19/senate-section/article/S10519-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REPORT RELATIVE TO THE HAITIAN HEMISPHERIC OPPORTUNITY THROUGH \n  PARTNERSHIP ENCOURAGEMENT ACT OF 2008 (HOPE II) (P.L. 110-246) THAT \n   AMENDED THE CARIBBEAN BASIN ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT (CBERA) MAKING \nCERTAIN ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS FROM HAITI ELIGIBLE FOR PREFERENTIAL TARIFF \nTREATMENT AFTER OCTOBER 18, 2009, AS RECEIVED DURING THE ADJOURNMENT OF \n                 THE SENATE ON OCTOBER 16, 2009--PM 34\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of The United States which was referred to the \nCommittee on Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  The Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement \nAct of 2008 (HOPE II) (the ``Act'') (Public Law 110-246), amended the \nCaribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) to make certain \nadditional products from Haiti eligible for preferential tariff \ntreatment.

A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act, to establish fair \nand transparent practices elated to the marketing and provision of \noverdraft coverage programs at depository insitutions, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Fairness and \nAccountability in Receiving Overdraft Coverage Act, The FAIR Overdraft \nCoverage Act. The FAIR Overdraft Coverage Act will rein in abusive \nfees, give customers greater choice, and bring\n\n[[Page S10522]]\n\ngreater transparency to overdraft coverage programs.\n  For too long, some in the financial services industry have gotten \nrich by taking advantage of consumers.\n  Earlier this year, in a 90-5 vote, this body passed legislation to \ncrack down on credit card companies who were charging excessive fees \nand indiscriminately raising customers' rates. Those practices were \nwrong, and I was proud to lead the charge to put a stop to them.\n  Today, I hope to rally my colleagues' support to curtail another \nabusive practice: overdraft fees.\n  Let me be clear, people have a responsibility to spend within their \nmeans.\n  However, too often, banks take advantage of their customers under the \nguise of providing the ``service'' of overdraft protection, a service \nthat the customer may not want and may not even know has been applied \nto his or her account.\n  The Financial Times recently reported that banks stand to collect a \nrecord $38.5 billion in overdraft fees this year.\n  According to the Center for Responsible Lending, nearly $1 billion of \nthat will come from young adults.\n  Another $4.5 billion will come from senior citizens like Mario \nLivieri of Branford, Connecticut. Mario is a 75-year-old retired \nhomebuilder who accidentally overdrew his account by approximately $2, \nand was charged $35 by his bank. The bank took several days to notify \nhim that the account was overdrawn, and in the meantime, he made three \nadditional minor purchases for which he was charged three additional \n$35 fees--a total of $140.\n  When Mario protested, the bank waived one of the four $35 charges. \nThey told him there was nothing more he could do to fight the fees, \nbecause this practice was perfectly legal. Mario Livieri is no longer a \ncustomer at that bank, and this prevalent practice should no longer be \nperfectly legal.\n\n  Slow-walking notifications to consumers when their accounts are \noverdrawn is just one way in which banks try to run up the score on \noverdraft fees. Sometimes, they even re-arrange the order in which they \nprocess your purchases, charging you for a later, larger purchase first \nand then they charge you repeated overdraft fees for earlier, smaller \npurchases.\n  Worst of all, so-called ``overdraft protection'' is often added to \ncustomers'' accounts without their permission, or even their knowledge. \nCustomers who don't know that this feature is attached to their \naccounts think their purchases will just be denied if they don't have \nsufficient money in their accounts. Instead, their depository \ninstitutions will let these purchases go through and charge a $35 flat \nfee for each purchase that overdrafts the account--no matter how small \nthe purchase. And there generally is no limit on the number of fees \nthat a customer can be charged in a single day.\n  That is just wrong. Families in my State of Connecticut and across \nthe country are already struggling to make ends meet--and these unfair \nand excessive charges are making it even harder. Over the past few \nweeks, I've worked with consumer groups and listened to folks like \nMario who have been the victims of these abusive practices. Those \ndiscussions resulted in the bill I present to you today.\n  Here is how the bill works.\n  First and foremost, no consumer should be enrolled in a program like \nthis without their knowledge. My bill will establish an opt-in rule for \noverdraft protection for ATM and debit transactions so that customers \nwill have to consent before they can be charged an overdraft coverage \nfee. You will recall that the credit card bill we passed earlier this \nyear had a similar approach to over-the-limit fees.\n  If you do choose to opt into an overdraft coverage program, the bill \nwill limit the number of overdraft fees banks can charge you--one per \nmonth, and no more than six per year. And that fee will be required to \nbe proportional to the cost of processing the overdraft--no more $40 \ncharges for $2 cups of coffee.\n  My legislation will also put a stop to the practice of manipulating \nthe order in which transactions are posted, and require banks to warn \ncustomers if they are about to overdraw their account, giving them a \nchance to cancel the transaction.\n  Finally, it will require banks to notify customers promptly when \nthey've overdrawn an account--through a means the customer chooses, \nfrom e- mail to text message to letter--so that they can quickly \nrestore their balance and avoid unnecessary fees.\n  Abusive overdraft policies are unfair, and the banks know it. After \nit came out in the press that I was working on this legislation, a few \nof the big banks took steps towards responsible reform.\n  We will see whether these few are truly committed to reform. \nAmerica's consumers deserve better--and this legislation will make sure \nthey won't continue to be victims of greedy banks looking to line their \npockets at the expense of hard-working families.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and Senators Harry Reid, Charles \nSchumer, Jack Reed, Sherrod Brown, Carl Levin, Jeff Merkley, and Robert \nMenendez in support of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous Consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1799\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fairness and Accountability \n     in Receiving Overdraft Coverage Act of 2009'' or the ``FAIR \n     Overdraft Coverage Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       Section 102 of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(c) Fairness and Accountability in Overdraft Coverage.--\n       ``(1) Findings.--The Congress also finds that--\n       ``(A) overdraft coverage is a form of short-term credit \n     that depository institutions provide for consumer transaction \n     accounts. Historically, depository institutions covered \n     overdrafts for a fee on an ad hoc basis;\n       ``(B) with the growth in specially designed software \n     programs and in consumer use of debit cards, overdraft \n     coverage for a fee has become more prevalent;\n       ``(C) most depository institutions do not notify consumers \n     when adding this feature to their transaction accounts, and \n     some do not permit consumers to eliminate this feature from \n     such accounts;\n       ``(D) most depository institutions collect a high flat fee, \n     including for small dollar transactions, each time the \n     institution covers an overdraft, in some cases impose \n     multiple overdraft coverage fees within a single day, and \n     many charge additional fees for each day during which the \n     account remains overdrawn; and\n       ``(E) such abusive and misleading practices in connection \n     with overdraft coverage fees have deprived consumers of \n     meaningful choices about their accounts and placed \n     significant financial burdens on low- and moderate-income \n     consumers.\n       ``(2) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this title to protect \n     consumers by limiting abusive and misleading overdraft \n     coverage fees and practices, and by providing meaningful \n     disclosures and consumer choice in connection with overdraft \n     coverage fees.''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 314\n\n       Whereas the well-being of the United States requires that \n     the young people of this Nation become an involved, caring \n     citizenry of good character;\n       Whereas the character education of children has become more \n     urgent, as violence by and against youth increasingly \n     threatens the physical and psychological well-being of the \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas more than ever, children need strong and \n     constructive guidance from their families and their \n     communities, including schools, youth organizations, \n     religious institutions, and civic groups;\n       Whereas the character of a nation is only as strong as the \n     character of its individual citizens;\n       Whereas the public good is advanced when young people are \n     taught the importance of good character and the positive \n     effects that good character can have in personal \n     relationships, in school, and in the workplace;\n       Whereas scholars and educators agree that people do not \n     automatically develop good character and that, therefore, \n     conscientious efforts must be made by institutions and \n     individuals that influence youth to help young people develop \n     the essential traits and characteristics that comprise good \n     character;\n       Whereas although character development is, first and \n     foremost, an obligation of families, the efforts of faith \n     communities, schools, and youth, civic, and human service \n     organizations also play an important role in fostering and \n     promoting good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages students, teachers, parents, \n     youth, and community leaders to recognize the importance of \n     character education in preparing young people to play a role \n     in determining the future of the United States;\n       Whereas effective character education is based on core \n     ethical values, which form the foundation of democratic \n     society;\n       Whereas examples of character are trustworthiness, respect, \n     responsibility, fairness, caring, citizenship, and honesty;\n       Whereas elements of character transcend cultural, \n     religious, and socioeconomic differences;\n       Whereas the character and conduct of our youth reflect the \n     character and conduct of society, and, therefore, every adult \n     has the responsibility to teach and model ethical values and \n     every social institution has the responsibility to promote \n     the development of good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages individuals and organizations, \n     especially those that have an interest in the education and \n     training of the young people of the United States, to adopt \n     the elements of character as intrinsic to the well-being of \n     individuals, communities, and society;\n       Whereas many schools in the United States recognize the \n     need, and have taken steps, to integrate the values of their \n     communities into their teaching activities; and\n       Whereas the establishment of ``National Character Counts \n     Week'', during which individuals, families, schools, youth \n     organizations, religious institutions, civic groups, and \n     other organizations focus on character education, is of great \n     benefit to the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning October 18, 2009, as \n     ``National Character Counts Week''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States and \n     interested groups--\n       (A) to embrace the elements of character identified by \n     local schools and communities, such as trustworthiness, \n     respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship; \n     and\n       (B) to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, \n     programs, and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/19/senate-section/article/S10524-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2692.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calender No. 182, S. 1793.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1793) to amend title XXVI of the Public Health \n     Service Act to revise and extend the program for providing \n     life-saving care for those with HIV/AIDS.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today marks an important milestone in our \nongoing national effort to combat HIV and AIDS. Twenty-eight years ago, \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued its first warning \nabout the disease we now know as AIDS. Today, we are approving the \nfourth extension of the Ryan White CARE Act, comprehensive legislation \nfirst enacted\n\n[[Page S10525]]\n\nin 1990 for the prevention and treatment of HIV and AIDS.\n  In those early days, the Nation failed on all levels to fully \nrecognize the dangers posed by this disease. Its victims suffered in \nsilence and stigma. Shamefully, those who had the power to help did \nnothing.\n  Then, belatedly, in the mid 1990s, a young boy's courage opened the \nNation's eyes to the tragedy of AIDS. A disease that had seemed distant \nwas suddenly a potential threat to any of us. We realized that it is a \ndeadly virus that does not discriminate based on color, religion, \npolitical affiliation, or income status. I have no doubt that Ryan \nWhite would be proud of the bipartisan effort that, after months of \nnegotiation and compromise, has produced the bill before us today.\n  In 1987, bipartisan legislation was first introduced calling for a \ncomprehensive national strategy focusing on education, prevention, and \nresearch to halt the spread of AIDS. We summoned government, the public \nhealth community, and the media all to do their part raise public \nawareness and combat the AIDS epidemic across America.\n  Yet, today, more than two decades later, the battle continues. We \nmourn the more than 500,000 Americans who have been lost to the AIDS \nvirus. However, we take heart from the fact that AIDS is no longer a \ndeath sentence. Through testing and treatment, people are living long, \nfull, productive lives with HIV. We are identifying victims earlier in \nthe progression of the disease, and keeping them healthier longer.\n  However, we still have a long way to go. Many who live with HIV and \nAIDS do not have insurance to pay for costly treatments. As a result, \nheavy demands are placed on community-based organizations, as well as \non State and local governments. For most of these citizens, the Ryan \nWhite CARE Act continues to provide the only means to obtain the care \nand treatment they need.\n  The Ryan White CARE Act began as an emergency response to the HIV/\nAIDS crisis in urban America, but today it has been broadened into a \nnational strategy to provide care and support for people living with \nHIV and AIDS anywhere in America.\n  This bill builds on a consensus among States, cities, community-based \norganizations, hospitals and health providers, and persons living with \nHIV and AIDS their families and advocates: It maintains access to life-\nsaving medications, quality health care, and support services for \npersons living with HIV and AIDS who have come to depend on publicly \nfunded systems, it extends this system of quality care to persons with \nHIV and AIDS who have faced long waiting lists for medications and \nsevere limits on their access to specialty health care; it bolsters \ngovernmental and community-based institutions charged with providing \nthis care, all of whom face growing case loads and the greater \nchallenges of an evolving population of persons with HIV/AIDS; it \nbalances the needs of high-prevalence cities and States with those \nfacing rapidly growing epidemics; it assures those who have been \nrelying on their local system of care that it will continue to be there \nfor them; and it reassures persons seeking tests for HIV that \ncomprehensive care and support will be available.\n  At its best, the United States has the finest HIV/AIDS care system, \ntruly the gold standard for the rest of the world to emulate. Our goal \nin this legislation is to make the U.S. HIV/AIDS care system also the \nfairest in the world, with equal access for all, high quality \nstandards, and guaranteed continuity of care--regardless of \ngeographical location.\n  This bill is a great example of the good and important things we can \naccomplish in this body when we work together with bipartisanship, \ngoodwill, and a spirit of compromise. This is also complex legislation, \nand all our committee staff members, Democratic and Republican alike, \ndeserve great credit for their expertise, and for their diligence in \nbringing us to this day. I want to recognize Connie Garner and Jenelle \nKrishnamoorthy from my staff, Hayden Rhudy from Senator Enzi's staff, \nTamar Magarik Haro from Senator Dodd's staff, and Evan Feinberg from \nSenator Coburn's staff for their dedication and hard work on this \nlegislation.\n  To say the least, this legislation is extremely important to \nAmericans living with HIV and AIDS. For them, it is a lifeline. It \noffers hope for an active, productive, dignified life. This legislation \nshows America at its very best: compassionate, generous, extending a \nhand up to those in great need. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues \nfor coming together to support this important, bipartisan bill.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this is the Ryan White HIV Act, which is \nparticularly important legislation. I join millions of people in the \ncountry in supporting it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a Harkin amendment, which is at the \ndesk, be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read the third time \nand passed; that the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, with \nno intervening action or debate, and that any statements related to the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 314, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 314) designating the week beginning \n     October 18, 2009, as ``National Character Counts Week.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today Senator Grassley and I have submitted \na resolution designating the third week of October as National \nCharacter Counts Week. In the past, my good friend Senator Domenici and \nI worked together on the issue of character education, and I am pleased \nto be joined by my colleague Senator Grassley in continuing to \ndesignate a special week to this cause. I hope that with this \nresolution we may highlight the importance of character building \nactivities in schools not only this week but all year long.\n  Since 1994, when the Partnerships in Character Education Pilot \nProject was first established, I have worked to commemorate National \nCharacter Counts Week. Character Counts was founded on a simple notion: \nour core ethical values aren't just important to us as individuals--\nthey form the very foundation of democratic society. We know that in \norder to face our challenges as communities and as a Nation, we need \nour children to be both well-educated and trained--and that begins with \ninstilling character in our children.\n  Trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and \ncitizenship--these are the six pillars of character. Character \neducation provides\n\n[[Page S10531]]\n\nstudents a context within which to learn those values and integrate \nthem into our daily lives. Indeed, if we view education simply as the \nimparting of knowledge to our children, then we not only miss an \nopportunity, but as also jeopardize our future. Children want \ndirection--to be taught right from wrong. Young people yearn for \nconsistent adult involvement, and when they get it, we know they are \nless inclined to use illegal drugs, to vandalize or commit suicide. The \nAmerican public wants character education in our schools, too. Studies \nshow that approximately 90 percent of Americans support schools \nteaching character education.\n  Character education programs work. Currently, there are character \neducation programs across all 50 States in rural, urban and suburban \nareas at every grade level. Schools across the country that have \nadopted strong character education programs report better student \nperformance, fewer discipline problems, and increased student \ninvolvement within the community.\n  This renewed focus on character sends a wonderful message to \nAmericans and will help reinvigorate our efforts to get communities and \nschools involved. With this resolution, it is my hope that even more \ncommunities will make character education a part of every child's life. \nI hope that my colleagues will support this important effort.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and that any \nstatements relating to the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 314) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 314\n\n       Whereas the well-being of the United States requires that \n     the young people of this Nation become an involved, caring \n     citizenry of good character;\n       Whereas the character education of children has become more \n     urgent, as violence by and against youth increasingly \n     threatens the physical and psychological well-being of the \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas more than ever, children need strong and \n     constructive guidance from their families and their \n     communities, including schools, youth organizations, \n     religious institutions, and civic groups;\n       Whereas the character of a nation is only as strong as the \n     character of its individual citizens;\n       Whereas the public good is advanced when young people are \n     taught the importance of good character and the positive \n     effects that good character can have in personal \n     relationships, in school, and in the workplace;\n       Whereas scholars and educators agree that people do not \n     automatically develop good character and that, therefore, \n     conscientious efforts must be made by institutions and \n     individuals that influence youth to help young people develop \n     the essential traits and characteristics that comprise good \n     character;\n       Whereas although character development is, first and \n     foremost, an obligation of families, the efforts of faith \n     communities, schools, and youth, civic, and human service \n     organizations also play an important role in fostering and \n     promoting good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages students, teachers, parents, \n     youth, and community leaders to recognize the importance of \n     character education in preparing young people to play a role \n     in determining the future of the United States;\n       Whereas effective character education is based on core \n     ethical values, which form the foundation of democratic \n     society;\n       Whereas examples of character are trustworthiness, respect, \n     responsibility, fairness, caring, citizenship, and honesty;\n       Whereas elements of character transcend cultural, \n     religious, and socioeconomic differences;\n       Whereas the character and conduct of our youth reflect the \n     character and conduct of society, and, therefore, every adult \n     has the responsibility to teach and model ethical values and \n     every social institution has the responsibility to promote \n     the development of good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages individuals and organizations, \n     especially those that have an interest in the education and \n     training of the young people of the United States, to adopt \n     the elements of character as intrinsic to the well-being of \n     individuals, communities, and society;\n       Whereas many schools in the United States recognize the \n     need, and have taken steps, to integrate the values of their \n     communities into their teaching activities; and\n       Whereas the establishment of ``National Character Counts \n     Week'', during which individuals, families, schools, youth \n     organizations, religious institutions, civic groups, and \n     other organizations focus on character education, is of great \n     benefit to the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning October 18, 2009, as \n     ``National Character Counts Week''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States and \n     interested groups--\n       (A) to embrace the elements of character identified by \n     local schools and communities, such as trustworthiness, \n     respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship; \n     and\n       (B) to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, \n     programs, and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/19/senate-section/article/S10531-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, OCTOBER 20, 2009\n\n  Mr. BROWN.
