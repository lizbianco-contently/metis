Mr. President, the American people wake up every morning \nworrying about real problems. They go to bed every night with real \nconcerns. They worry about the agonizing sacrifices they have to make \nso they can afford to stay healthy, and their fear is sincere.\n  Our response and responsibility to the American people should be \nequally grounded in reality. That reality is that our health care \nsystem is in serious distress. I believe serious problems\n\n[[Page S8642]]\n\ndeserve serious efforts by serious legislators to develop serious \nsolutions.\n  Unfortunately, much of what we have seen from the other side is \nsimply one radical distraction after the next. For months, Republicans \nhave perpetuated a pollster- and consultant-created myth that our plan \nand our goal is to have the government run your health care. It is not. \nLet me repeat: It is not. In fact, one of our core principles is that \nif you like the health care you have, you can keep it. But the other \nside simply won't let the facts get in the way of a good story.\n  A Republican Congressman recently claimed that our plan to improve \nhealth care would ``put seniors in a position of being put to death by \ntheir government.''\n  A Republican Senator made a similar statement to mislead his \nconstituents. He actually accused Democrats of proposing a plan that \nwould kill Americans. It is hard to imagine that. Rather than having a \nserious and real debate about a serious and real crisis, some Senators \nand Congressmen want the American people to believe their colleagues \nare proposing a plan to kill them.\n  These distortions and distractions are revolting, and they are not \nlimited to health care.\n  An artificial controversy is getting far too much attention lately--\none that ignores the undeniable and proven fact that President Obama \nwas born in the United States of America. Last week, one of the \nRepublican leaders in the House of Representatives continued to give \nthis false and misleading claim credence. Let's be clear: It is a phony \nissue that does not deserve even a minute of our attention on the floor \nof the Senate. It is absurd, irresponsible, and baseless, and the false \nclaims have long ago been refuted.\n  The American people have every right to expect we will solve real \nproblems before creating fake problems. They should know that rather \nthan helping them get ahead, some of our colleagues would rather spew \nludicrous conspiracy theories.\n  The other side hasn't stopped at fake arguments and fake issues. We \nalso have seen them resort to fake letters. Some Members of Congress \nhave recently received forged letters purporting to be from the NAACP. \nOthers have received a similar letter signed by a fake name with a fake \njob title purporting to be from a local Hispanic group. The bogus \nletters have been tracked back to employees of a Republican lobbying \nfirm. This behavior is sick, it is shameful, it is dishonest, and it is \nundemocratic.\n  When we passed the economic recovery plan this winter, some opposed \nit. They didn't believe we needed an aggressive plan in response to a \ngrave crisis that now is putting people back to work, ensuring middle-\nclass families can get ahead, and investing in our future. But \nobjecting to that legislation is their right. As we start to see \na return on our investment, many of those who tried to block this bill \nhave since sought credit for the good it is doing. Others who opposed \nthe plan outright--those who wish we weren't investing in their States \nand districts--now complain they wish to see us invest more quickly. \nWell, you can't have it both ways. It is yet another embarrassing \nexample of misinformation and misrepresentation upon which some on the \nother side tend to rely.\n\n  I cannot blame people for wondering why, with an issue as important \nas health care now before us, bipartisan consensus sometimes seems so \nelusive. So I say to them: This extreme brand of strategy and the \nextreme tactics that come with it are what we have to contend with.\n  First, Rush Limbaugh happily admitted he wants our President to fail. \nThen a Republican Senator openly admitted he wants to block the health \ninsurance reform for millions as a way to ``break the President.'' \nAnother Republican Senator admitted that at least half of the other \nside's opposition to reform is purely political. And an influential \ncommentator advised Republicans to avoid consensus at all costs and \ninstead ``go for the kill.''\n  These partisan tactics have consequences. These consequences will be \nevident at any kitchen table, in every family budget, and every \nAmerican's peace of mind.\n  And they are watching. A poll released last week found that a \nmajority of Americans credit President Obama with putting partisanship \naside and trying to work with congressional Republicans to get this \ndone for the good of the country. Republicans, they found, weren't \nreturning the favor.\n  Others may be focused on delaying and denying health insurance \nreform, but we will make sure we don't let that happen. We already have \nseen what happens when we do nothing. The costs of sitting this one out \nare far too high and not acting is not an option.\n  The American people appreciate those Republicans who have come to the \nnegotiating table in good faith. I am sorry to say that there simply \naren't enough of them. At this stage, out of 100 Senators, we have 3 \nRepublicans who are willing to work with us on health care. I am very \nhappy to have them, but I wish we had more.\n  Rather than having a serious and real debate about a serious and real \ncrisis, some would prefer to deploy tactics to scare the American \npeople. But what scares the American people is that under the status \nquo, they live just one illness, one accident, or one pink slip away \nfrom losing everything.\n  This is no time to let partisanship get the best of us. This is no \ntime to obsess over fake controversies or oppose ideas simply because \nthey were proposed by people who sit on the other side of this Chamber. \nThis is no time to instill unfounded fears and incite the hope that our \nNation's leaders fail. This is the time to get serious about making it \neasier for American citizens to afford to live a healthy life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/03/senate-section/article/S8642-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, my colleague mentioned the passing of a \nvery dear friend. I wish to take a moment this afternoon to also \nacknowledge the passing of Lu Young.\n  This is a sad day for us in Alaska as we come to grips with the very \nsudden passing of Congressman Young's wife. They have been a team for \nsome 46 years. She died this weekend at their home in Great Falls, VA. \nShe was only 67 years old.\n  Lu Young was an Athabascan Indian from the village of Fort Yukon. \nFort Yukon, you may have seen on Senator Begich's map, is in the \ninterior part of the State. It sits 7 miles above the Arctic Circle on \nthe north bank of the Yukon River. It is about 145 air miles north from \nFairbanks.\n  Congressman Young met Lu in Fort Yukon. This is back in the days when \nhe was a tugboat captain operating a barge, carrying products and \nsupplies up and down the river. Don taught in the wintertime at the BIA \nschools. Lu was the bookkeeper there in the village. They met, they \nmarried, and had 46 years of honest wedded bliss.\n  I have to tell you, it is not often one can look at a couple after 46 \nyears of marriage and still see the love and the gleam and the warmth \nbetween two individuals, one for another. Every day we saw that. If Lu \nwasn't with Don, Don was talking about Lu.\n  He used to joke when he was in his campaigns: ``You get two for the \nprice of one.'' He wasn't kidding. Don was in his office every day, and \nLu was also in the office every day over at the Rayburn Building. She \nwould greet Alaskans as they would come in. She would make sure they \nwere comfortable or if she thought they were taking too much of Don's \ntime, she would tell them that too. She would take people over to the \nrestaurant for lunch. She welcomed Alaskans as part of their family.\n  We have a very close and intimate relationship with those we \nrepresent in Alaska. As my new colleague is recognizing, we are a long \nway from home, so we kind of band together. We are part of an extended \nfamily.\n  Lu was a constant in Don Young's office. She ensured that Alaskans \nwho traveled to Washington, DC, would know that the Congressman for all \nAlaska was going to take care of you. She was also reminding Don every \nday: Don't forget where you come from. Anyone who has ever been to \nDon's office knows it looks and feels very much like Alaska. Lu made \nsure that was never going to change.\n  Today the people of Alaska are not thinking of Lu's contributions to \nDon's political career. They are reflecting on the truly remarkable \nlove between the two of them. In a statement this morning, Congressman \nYoung summed it up. He said: ``Lu was my everything, and I am \nheartbroken.'' That loss breaks the golden hearts of all Alaskans as we \nremember our own experiences with Congressman Young's partner, his best \nfriend, and his heart.\n  Congressman Young has lost the love of his life, and Alaskans have \nlost a great friend. Regardless of political persuasion, all of Alaska \ngrieves with Congressman Young, his daughters, Joni and Dawn, and their \nhusbands, 14 grandchildren, and an extended family of lifelong friends \nthroughout the great land.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, of course, all of us extend our \nsympathies to Congressman Young and his family. The remarks of the \nSenators from Alaska spoke for all of us.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, a few minutes ago, I was waiting to \ngive a television interview with MSNBC. The White House press \nsecretary, Robert Gibbs, was on. He said a most astonishing thing. He \nwas there, obviously, for the purpose of an impromptu press conference \nto correct what I thought was a truthful impression left yesterday by \ntwo members of the Obama administration. Both Mr. Summers and Mr. \nGeithner yesterday did not rule out the possibility of a middle-income \ntax increase. That was widely reported all over the country today. \nApparently, they were taken to the woodshed this morning, and Mr. Gibbs \nwas sent out to say: Oh, no, we are not going to raise taxes on middle \nincome Americans.\n  But that is misleading, at best, to the American people. Most people \nknow that. An article in the New York Times on August 1, was titled: \n``Obama's Pledge to Tax Only the Rich Can't Pay for Everything, \nAnalysts Say.''\n  Among those quoted is Leonard Burman, ``a veteran of the Clinton \nadministration Treasury and director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy \nCenter.''\n  ``This idea,'' he says, ``that everything new that government \nprovides ought to be paid for by the top 5 percent, that's a basically \nunstable way of governing.''\n  I am sure the Senator from Arizona remembers Isabel Sawhill's \ndistinguished service. She had some comments on tax increases as well. \n``There is no way we can pay for health care and the rest of the Obama \nagenda, plus get our long-term deficits under control, simply by \nraising taxes on the wealthy,'' said Isabel V. Sawhill, a former \nClinton administration budget official. ``The middle class is going to \nhave to contribute as well.''\n  I wonder if the Senator from Arizona, who is a veteran member of the \nFinance Committee, is surprised to see, first, the two top finance \npeople for the Obama administration say we are not going to rule out a \nmiddle-class tax increase, and then all of a sudden today, the Obama \nadministration says no, nope, we are going to rule that out again. What \nis going on?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, I had the same \nimpression yesterday when I saw Mr. Geithner and Mr. Summers on \ntelevision. They, frankly, were recognizing the reality of the \nsituation. I did not think that much of it because the truth is, the \npeople my colleague has quoted are absolutely right. You cannot do all \nthe things the President wants to do without raising taxes, and \ninevitably that will be on the middle class.\n  To put in the Record what both Treasury Secretary Geithner and Mr. \nSummers said--this is as reported by George Stephanopoulous, ``This \nWeek'' host for ABC. He said:\n\n       To get the economy back on track, will President Obama have \n     to break his pledge not to raise taxes on 95 percent of \n     Americans? In a ``This Week'' exclusive, Treasury Secretary \n     Tim Geithner told me, ``We're going to have to do what's \n     necessary.'' Then Stephanopoulous continues:\n       When I gave him several opportunities to rule out a middle-\n     class tax hike, he wouldn't do it. ``We have to bring these \n     deficits down very dramatically,'' Geithner told me. ``And \n     that's going to require some very hard choices.''\n\n  Of course it is. Secretary Geithner is right. It is pretty hard to \ndeny.\n  Then the National Economic Council Director, Lawrence Summers, was \nasked by Bob Schieffer on CBS if taxes could be raised for middle-\nincome Americans. Summers said:\n\n       There is a lot that can happen over time. It is never a \n     good idea to absolutely rule out things no matter what.\n\n  Then he said that what the President has been completely clear on is \nhe is\n\n[[Page S8644]]\n\nnot going to pursue any of these priorities--not health care--in ways \nthat are primarily burdening middle-class families. That is something \nthat is not going to happen.\n  There seems to be a subtle switch here to, first of all, never say \nnever and, secondly, say the tax burden is not going to primarily fall \non middle-class Americans.\n  I say to my colleague, when you look at some of the provisions that \nare in the House of Representatives bill on health care, in the Senate \nHELP Committee on health care, and some of the things that are being \nconsidered by the Finance Committee, in all three situations, you do \nhave taxes on working American families, middle-class families.\n  I think that what the Secretary and Mr. Summers said Sunday is \nactually more true than what the press secretary tried to make it out \nto be. It is simply the recognition of a reality--that you can't pay \nfor all of this and not impose taxes on middle Americans.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator. His point is \na valid one. It is not a matter or are they going to propose middle-\nincome tax increases. In the health care plans, we already see that \nhappening. For example, in the proposed payroll tax or jobs tax on \nemployers to pay for the proposed health care plan coming out of the \nHouse of Representatives, there is a very large tax. It could be up to \n8 percent of payroll. Quoting from the Wall Street Journal editorial of \nJuly 30:\n\n       So who bears the burden of this tax? The economic research \n     is close to unanimous that a payroll tax is tax on labor and \n     is thus shouldered mostly if not entirely by workers.\n\n  This is a middle-income tax increase already proposed. Then there is \nanother issue that bothers me, especially as a former Governor. Our \ncurrent Governor of Tennessee called it the ``mother of all unfunded \nmandates.'' If we add, as is proposed by both bills, another 20 million \npeople to Medicaid--which is for low-income people, and the States help \npay for that--that is more than 300,000 new people for Tennessee.\n  The estimates we have gotten from Tennessee's department of Medicaid, \nTennCare, is that would cost enough money to equal the amount raised by \na 5-percent new State income tax. If we actually pay doctors a \nsufficient amount to cause them to see these people who are dumped into \nMedicaid, then Tennessee would need a total of a 10-percent new State \nincome tax. That is another middle-income tax increase.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would just ask my colleague also if he is \naware that there are some other proposals in these various Democratic \nbills. One is that all individuals would be required to buy medical \ninsurance. There would be a penalty if they refused to do so that would \ngo directly to their income tax. I believe the latest proposal I saw \nwas 2.5 percent of your income tax. There would be a penalty imposed if \nyou didn't buy insurance.\n  Now, what happens to, let's say a young man or woman who has just \ngraduated from college, who are no longer on their parents' insurance \npolicy and they are now going to be required to go into a risk pool \nalong with everybody else? Or let's say they have been paying a modest \namount for their insurance through their college, perhaps. What is \nlikely to happen when they are thrown into the pool of other Americans, \nall of whom are required to purchase insurance? Will their premiums go \ndown, or what is the estimate of what will happen to the premiums of \nthese young people?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senator makes a good point. If you are young and \nin America and you are forced into the health plan that is passing the \nHouse, your costs are going to go up, and that is a mandate or a tax \nthat absolutely will go up. So the Senator is exactly right.\n  For every young person in America who is in this plan, their health \ncare costs are, by definition, going to go up. Their health care costs \nare going to go up to help pay for older Americans whose benefits, I \nmight add, are going to go down because half of the health care plan is \ngoing to be paid for by Medicare cuts. These Medicare cuts will not \nmake Medicare solvent, but grandma's Medicare benefits are going to be \ncut to help pay for this new health program.\n  Whether it is a benefit cut or a tax increase, there are a lot of \nmiddle-income Americans who are already looking at a very big change in \ntheir economic circumstances.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I know we just have a couple of minutes left. \nThere are several other examples--one that is being considered by the \nFinance Committee, I know. It is to amend the provision of the Tax Code \nby which if you itemize your deductions and you have medical expenses \nthat exceed 7\\1/2\\ percent of your adjusted gross income, you would get \nto deduct that from your income tax.\n  There are two different proposals pending in the Finance Committee. \nIn both cases, there would be a new tax imposed. The problem is, \naccording to the Joint Committee on Taxation, replacing the existing \ndeduction with the new provision would increase taxes by $48 billion \nover 10 years. Who does it hit? Fifty-two percent of the taxpayers who \nclaim the deduction earn under $50,000 a year. These are not the \nwealthy Americans the President was speaking of. Forty percent of the \ntaxpayers who claimed the deduction are over the age of 65.\n  I guarantee you in Arizona we are going to look at that provision \nbecause a lot of our folks are over 65 and they rely upon the income-\ntax code to ensure if they have a catastrophic expense in any given \nyear that they have the ability to deduct a portion of that.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. As the Senator knows, we have heard about limited \ntaxes before. We actually have a millionaire tax on the books, passed \nin 1969, 40 years ago, where 155 high-income Americans were avoiding \npaying Federal income tax. There was the cry: So let's tax them. And so \nwe did.\n  Well, today that is called the alternative minimum tax. Every year we \nhave to change it because this year it was going to affect 28 million \nAmericans. People who are making $46,000 or $47,000 as individuals or \n$70,000 filing jointly were suddenly affected by the millionaires tax. \nSo beware of the millionaires tax because it soon catches us all.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for his time. I see \nSenator McCain, and I yield the remainder of my time to him. But before \ndoing so, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include the August \n1 New York Times article and the July 30 editorial from the Wall Street \nJournal, to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 30, 2009]\n\n                          The Pelosi Jobs Tax\n\n       Even many Democrats are revolting against Speaker Nancy \n     Pelosi's 5.4% income surtax to finance ObamaCare, but another \n     tax in her House bill isn't getting enough attention. To wit, \n     the up to 10-percentage point payroll tax increase on workers \n     and businesses that don't provide health insurance. This \n     should put to rest the illusion that no one making more than \n     $250,000 in income will pay higher taxes.\n       To understand why, consider how the Pelosi jobs tax works. \n     Under the House bill, firms with employee payroll of above \n     $250,000 without a company health plan would pay a tax \n     starting at 2% of wages per employee. That rate would quickly \n     rise to 8% on firms with total payroll of $400,000 or more. A \n     tax credit would help very small businesses adjust to the new \n     costs, but even a firm with a handful of workers is likely to \n     be subject to this payroll levy. As we went to press, Blue \n     Dogs were taking credit for pushing those payroll amounts up \n     to $500,000 and $750,000, but those are still small \n     employers.\n       So who bears the burden of this tax? The economic research \n     is close to unanimous that a payroll tax is a tax on labor \n     and is thus shouldered mostly if not entirely by workers. \n     Employers merely collect the tax and then pass along its \n     costs in lower wages or benefits. This is the view of the \n     Democratic-controlled Congressional Budget Office, which \n     advised on July 13: ``If employers who did not offer health \n     insurance were required to pay a fee, employee's wages and \n     other forms of compensation would generally decline by the \n     amount of that fee from what they otherwise would have \n     been.''\n       To put this in actual dollars, a worker earning, say, \n     $70,000 a year could lose some $5,600 in take home pay to \n     cover the costs of ObamaCare. And, by the way; this is in \n     addition to the 2.5% tax that the individual worker would \n     have to pay on gross income, if he doesn't buy the high-\n     priced health insurance that the government will mandate. In \n     sum, that's a near 10-percentage point tax on wages and \n     salaries on top of the 15% that already hits workers to \n     finance Medicare and Social Security.\n       Even Democrats are aware that his tax would come out of the \n     wallets of the very workers they pretend to be helping, so \n     they inserted a provision on page 147 of the bill prohibiting \n     firms from cutting salaries to pay the tax. Thus they figure \n     they can decree that wages cannot fall even, as costs\n\n[[Page S8645]]\n\n     rise. Of course, all this means is that businesses would lay \n     off some workers, or hire fewer new ones, or pay lower \n     starting salaries or other benefits to the workers they do \n     hire.\n       Cornell economists Richard Burkhauser and Kosali Simon \n     predicted in a 2007 National Bureau of Economic Research \n     study that a payroll tax increase of about this magnitude \n     plus the recent minimum wage increase will translate into \n     hundreds of thousands of lost jobs for those with low wages. \n     Pay or play schemes, says Mr. Burkauser, ``wind up hurting \n     the very low-wage workers they are supposed to help.'' The \n     CBO agrees, arguing that play or pay policies ``could reduce \n     the hiring of low-wage workers, whose wages could not fall by \n     the full cost of health insurance or a substantial play-or-\n     pay fee if they were close to the minimum wage.''\n       To make matters worse, many workers and firms would have to \n     pay the Pelosi tax even if the employer already provides \n     health insurance. That's because the House bill requires \n     firms to pay at least 72.5% of health-insurance premiums for \n     individual workers and 65% for families in order to avoid the \n     tax. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey in 2008 found that \n     about three in five small businesses fail to meet the Pelosi \n     test and will have to pay the tax. In these instances, the \n     businesses will have every incentive simply to drop their \n     coverage.\n       A new study by Sageworks, Inc., a financial consulting \n     firm, runs the numbers on the income statements of actual \n     companies. It looks at three types of firms with at least $5 \n     million in sales: a retailer, a construction company and a \n     small manufacturer. The companies each have total payroll of \n     between $750,000 and $1 million a year. Assuming the firms \n     absorb the cost of the payroll tax, their net profits fall by \n     one-third on average. That is on top of the 45% income tax \n     and surtax that many small business owners would pay as part \n     of the House tax scheme, so the total reduction in some small \n     business profits would climb to nearly 80%. These lower \n     after-tax profits would mean fewer jobs.\n       To put it another way, the workers who will gain health \n     insurance from ObamaCare will pay the steepest price for it \n     in either a shrinking pay check, or no job at all.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Aug. 1, 2009]\n\nObama's Pledge To Tax Only the Rich Can't Pay for Everything, Analysts \n                                  Say\n\n                           (By Jackie Calmes)\n\n       Washington.--Behind Democrats' struggle to pay the $1 \n     trillion 10-year cost of President Obama's promise to \n     overhaul the health care system is their collision with \n     another of his well-known pledges: that 95 percent of \n     Americans ``will not see their taxes increase by a single \n     dime'' during his term.\n       This will not be the last time that the president runs into \n     a conflict between his audacious agenda and his pay-as-you-go \n     guarantee, when only 5 percent of taxpayers are being asked \n     to chip in. Critics from conservative to liberal warn that \n     Mr. Obama has tied his and Congress's hands on a range of \n     issues, including tax reform and the need to reduce deficits \n     topping $1 trillion a year.\n       ``You can only go to the same well so many times,'' said \n     Bruce Bartlett, a Treasury official in the Reagan \n     administration.\n       In the budget, Mr. Obama and Congress have already agreed \n     to let the Bush tax cuts for the most affluent expire after \n     2010, as scheduled, but to extend them for everyone else. The \n     top rates, now 33 percent and 35 percent, will revert to \n     Clinton-era levels of 36 percent and 39.6 percent.\n       The critics do not have a beef with the government's taking \n     more from the wealthiest Americans, especially given the \n     growing income gap between the rich and everyone else. They \n     object to doing so for health care over other pressing needs.\n       ``I want to tax the rich to reduce the deficit,'' said \n     Robert D. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional \n     Budget Office who heads the Urban Institute, a center-left \n     research group. Similarly, Mr. Bartlett, a conservative \n     analyst who often chastises Republicans for their antitax \n     absolutism, supports overhauling the tax code to raise \n     revenues.\n       As these analysts recognize, taxing the rich has its limits \n     both economically and politically, such that members of \n     Congress are not likely to tap that well again and again.\n       Polls show strong majorities supporting higher taxes on \n     those earning more than $250,000 a year, Mr. Obama's target \n     group. Yet some Congressional Democrats are fearful of \n     Republicans' attacks that ``soak the rich'' tax increases \n     will douse small-business owners, too, even if the number of \n     those affected is far less than Republicans suggest.\n       Also, higher rates like those in the House health care \n     legislation could lead to tax avoidance schemes, reducing the \n     government's collections and warping business decisions, \n     analysts say.\n       The House measure calls for surtaxes ranging from 1 percent \n     on annual income of $280,000 to 5.4 percent on income of $1 \n     million and more. The millionaires' surtax would push the top \n     tax rate to 45 percent, the highest since the 1986 tax code \n     overhaul lowered all rates in return for jettisoning a raft \n     of tax breaks for businesses and individuals.\n       But the effective top rate would be higher still, counting \n     the 2.9 percent Medicare payroll tax and state and local \n     income taxes. In the highest-tax states of Oregon, Hawaii, \n     New Jersey, New York and California, it would be 57 percent, \n     according to the conservative Heritage Foundation.\n       In the health debate, Democrats emphasize that they are not \n     just raising taxes on the rich, but cutting spending, too, \n     mostly for Medicare payments to doctors, hospitals and \n     insurance companies.\n       Also, the Democrats say, at least they are trying to pay \n     for the health care initiative, rather than letting the \n     deficit balloon as the Republicans, along with President \n     George W. Bush, did when they created the Medicare \n     prescription drug benefit in 2003. That program will add a \n     projected $803 billion to the national debt in the decade \n     through 2019, according to the White House budget office.\n       ``They charged theirs on the government's credit card,'' \n     Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, said of the \n     Republicans.\n       Even so, Mr. Obama's vow to tax only the rich is a \n     variation ``of Bush's policy that nobody has to pay for \n     anything,'' said Leonard Burman, a veteran of the Clinton \n     administration Treasury and director of the nonpartisan Tax \n     Policy Center.\n       ``Democrats are more worried about the deficits,'' Mr. \n     Burman added, but ``they put the burden on a tiny fraction of \n     the population that they figure doesn't vote for them \n     anyway.''\n       Mr. Burman and others recall that in the creation of Social \n     Security and Medicare, Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and \n     Lyndon B. Johnson insisted that beneficiaries contribute \n     through payroll taxes, both to finance the programs and to \n     give all Americans a vested interest. The same philosophy \n     should apply to seeking universal health coverage, they say.\n       This idea that everything new that government provides \n     ought to be paid for by the top 5 percent, that's a basically \n     unstable way of governing,'' Mr. Burman said.\n       Mr. Obama recently dismissed concerns that taxing the rich \n     to pay for health care would foreclose that option when he \n     and Congress turn to deficit reduction. ``Health care reform \n     is fiscal reform,'' he said.\n       ``If we don't do anything on health care inflation, then we \n     might as well close up shop when it comes to dealing with our \n     long-term debt and deficit problems, because that's the \n     driver of it--Medicare and Medicaid,'' Mr. Obama said.\n       But his no-new-tax admonition for most Americans even now \n     complicates the behind-the-scenes work of the panel he \n     established to recommend ways to simplify the tax code and \n     raise more revenue.\n       The panel, which is led by Paul A. Volcker, a former \n     chairman of the Federal Reserve, is to report by Dec. 4. \n     Overhauling the code, as in 1986, generally creates winners \n     and losers across the board; leaving 95 percent of taxpayers \n     unscathed will not be easy.\n       That has already proved true in the health care \n     deliberations. Proposals to raise about $50 billion over 10 \n     years by taxing sugared drinks foundered partly because the \n     levy would hit nearly everyone.\n       And when Congressional leaders opposed Mr. Obama's chief \n     idea for raising revenues--limiting affluent taxpayers' \n     deductions--his campaign vow against taxing the middle class \n     made finding an acceptable alternative difficult.\n       While the president endorsed House Democrats' surtax idea, \n     saying it ``meets my principle that it's not being shouldered \n     by families who are already having a tough time,'' he could \n     not embrace a bipartisan Senate proposal to tax employer-\n     provided health benefits above a certain amount. He had \n     criticized a similar idea as a middle-class tax during his \n     presidential campaign.\n       Yet taxing at least the most generous employer-provided \n     plans above a threshold amount would meet two elusive goals \n     for Mr. Obama: It would raise a lot of money and, economists \n     say, cut overall health spending by making consumers more \n     cost-conscious.\n       Administration officials recently began promoting a \n     fallback. Rather than tax individuals, it would single out \n     insurance companies that sell ``Cadillac'' plans. David \n     Axelrod, a White House strategist, has described the proposal \n     in populist terms, saying it would hit ``the $40,000 policies \n     that the head of Goldman Sachs has'' and ``not impact on the \n     middle class.''\n       That position, analysts predict, cannot hold over time.\n       ``There is no way we can pay for health care and the rest \n     of the Obama agenda, plus get our long-term deficits under \n     control, simply by raising taxes on the wealthy,'' said \n     Isabel V. Sawhill, a former Clinton administration budget \n     official. ``The middle class is going to have to contribute \n     as well.''\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/03/senate-section/article/S8645-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8645-S8647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SOTOMAYOR NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is with great respect for Judge \nSotomayor's qualifications that I come to the floor today to discuss \nher nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. There is no doubt that Judge \nSotomayor has the professional background and qualifications that one \nhopes for in a Supreme Court nominee. As we all know, she is a former \nprosecutor, served as an attorney in private practice, and spent 12 \nyears as an appellate court judge. She is an immensely qualified \ncandidate. And, obviously, Judge Sotomayor's life story is inspiring \nand compelling.\n\n[[Page S8646]]\n\n  As a child of Puerto Rican parents who did not speak English upon \ntheir arrival in New York, Judge Sotomayor took it upon herself to \nlearn English and became an outstanding student. She graduated cum \nlaude from Princeton University and later from Yale Law School. Judge \nSotomayor herself stated that she is ``an ordinary person who has been \nblessed with extraordinary opportunities and experiences.''\n  However, an excellent resume and an inspiring life story are not \nenough to qualify one for a lifetime of service on the Supreme Court. \nThose who suggest otherwise need to be reminded of Miguel Estrada. Mr. \nEstrada also was a supremely qualified candidate, and he, too, has an \nincredible life story. Miguel Estrada actually emigrated to the United \nStates from Honduras as a teenager, understanding very little English. \nYet he managed to graduate from Columbia University and Harvard Law \nSchool magna cum laude before serving his country as a prosecutor and a \nlawyer at the Department of Justice. Later, he found success as a \nlawyer in private practice. However, Miguel Estrada, in spite of his \nqualifications and remarkable background, in spite of the fact that \nmillions of Latinos would have taken great pride in his confirmation, \nwas filibustered by the Democrats seven times--most recently in 2003--\nbecause many Democrats disagreed with Mr. Estrada's judicial \nphilosophy. This was the first filibuster ever to be successfully used \nagainst a court of appeals nominee.\n  I supported Mr. Estrada's nomination to the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals, not because of his inspiring life story or impeccable \nqualifications but because his judicial philosophy was one of \nrestraint. He was explicit in his writings and responses to the Senate \nJudiciary Committee that he would not seek to legislate from the bench.\n  In 1987, I had my first opportunity to provide ``advice and consent'' \non a Supreme Court nominee. At that time, I stated that the \nqualifications I believed were essential for evaluating a nominee for \nthe bench included integrity, character, legal competence and ability, \nexperience, and philosophy and judicial temperament.\n  When I spoke of philosophy and judicial temperament, it is \nspecifically how one seeks to interpret the law while serving on the \nbench. I believe a judge should seek to uphold all actions of Congress \nand State legislatures, unless they clearly violate a specific section \nof the Constitution, and refrain from interpreting the law in a manner \nthat creates law. While I believe Judge Sotomayor has many of these \nqualifications I outlined in 1987, I do not believe she shares my \nbelief in judicial restraint.\n  When the Senate was considering Judge Sotomayor's nomination to the \nSecond Circuit in 1998, I reviewed her decisions and her academic \nwritings. Her writings demonstrated that she does not subscribe to the \nphilosophy that Federal judges should respect the limited nature of the \njudicial power under our Constitution. Judges who stray beyond their \nconstitutional role believe judges somehow have a greater insight into \nthe meaning of the broad principles of our Constitution than \nrepresentatives who are elected by the people. These activist judges \nassume the Judiciary is a superlegislature of moral philosophers.\n  I know of no more profoundly antidemocratic attitude than that \nexpressed by those who want judges to discover and enforce the ever-\nchanging boundaries of a so-called ``living constitution.'' It \ndemonstrates a lack of respect for the popular will that is at \nfundamental odds of our republican system of government. Regardless of \none's success in academics and government service, an individual who \ndoes not appreciate the commonsense limitations on judicial power in \nour democratic system of government ultimately lacks a key \nqualification for a lifetime appointment to the bench.\n  Although she attempted to walk back from her long public record of \njudicial activism during her confirmation hearings, Judge Sotomayor \ncannot change her record. In a 1996 article in the Suffolk University \nLaw Review, she stated:\n\n       A given judge (or judges) may develop a novel approach to a \n     specific set of facts or legal framework that pushes the law \n     in a new direction.\n\n  This is exactly the view I disagree with. As a district court judge, \nher decisions too often strayed beyond legal norms. Several times this \nresulted in her decisions being overturned by the Second Circuit. She \nwas reversed due to her reliance on foreign law rather than U.S. law. \nShe was reversed because the Second Circuit found she exceeded her \njurisdiction in deciding a case involving a State law claim. She was \nreversed for trying to impose a settlement in a dispute between \nbusinesses, and she was reversed for unnecessarily limiting the \nintellectual property rights of free-lance authors.\n  These are but a few examples that led me to vote against her \nnomination to the Second Circuit in 1998 because of her troubling \nrecord of being an activist judge who strayed beyond the rule of law. \nFor this reason, I closely followed her confirmation hearing last \nmonth. During the hearing, she clearly stated, ``As a judge, I don't \nmake law.''\n  While I applaud this statement, it does not reflect her record. As an \nappellate court judge, Judge Sotomayor has been overturned by the \nSupreme Court six times. In several of the reversals of Judge \nSotomayor's Second Circuit opinions, the Supreme Court strongly \ncriticized her decision and reasoning. In a seventh case, the Supreme \nCourt vacated the ruling, noting that in her written opinion for the \nmajority of the Second Circuit, Judge Sotomayor had ignored two prior \nSupreme Court decisions.\n  While I do not believe reversal by the Supreme Court is a \ndisqualifying factor for being considered for the Federal bench, I do \nbelieve such cases must be studied in reviewing a nominee's record. \nMost recently, in 2008, the Supreme Court noted in an opinion \noverturning Judge Sotomayor that her decision ``flies in the face of \nthe statutory language'' and chided the Second Circuit for extending a \nremedy that the court had ``consistently and repeatedly recognized for \nthree decades forecloses such an extension here.''\n  Unfortunately, it appears from this case--Malesko v. Correctional \nServices Corp.--that Judge Sotomayor does not seek ``fidelity to the \nlaw'' as she pledged at her confirmation hearing. As legislators, we \nmust enact laws. The courts must apply the law faithfully. The job of a \njudge is not to make law or ignore the law.\n  Further, in Lopez Torres v. N.Y. State Board of Education, the \nSupreme Court overturned Judge Sotomayor's decision that a State law \nallowing for the political parties to nominate State judges through a \njudicial district convention was unconstitutional because it did not \ngive people, in her view, ``a fair shot.'' In overturning her decision, \nthe Supreme Court took aim at her views on providing a ``fair shot'' to \nall interested persons, stating:\n\n       It is hardly a manageable constitutional question for \n     judges--especially for judges in our legal system, where \n     traditional electoral practice gives no hint of even the \n     existence, much less the content, of a constitutional \n     requirement for a ``fair shot'' at party nomination.\n\n  In her most recent and well-known reversal by the Supreme Court, the \nCourt unanimously rejected Judge Sotomayor's reasoning and held that \nwhite firefighters who had passed a race neutral exam were eligible for \npromotion. Ricci v. DeStefano raised the bar considerably on overt \ndiscrimination against one racial group simply to undo the \nunintentionally racially skewed results of otherwise fair and objective \nemployment procedures. Again, this case proves that Judge Sotomayor \ndoes not faithfully apply the law we legislators enact.\n  Again and again, Judge Sotomayor seeks to amend the law to fit the \ncircumstances of the case, thereby substituting herself in the role of \na legislator. Our Constitution is very clear in its delineation and \ndisbursement of power. It solely tasks the Congress with creating law. \nIt also clearly defines the appropriate role of the courts to ``extend \nto all Cases in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the \nLaws of the United States, and Treaties.'' To protect the equal, but \nseparate roles of all three branches of government, I cannot support \nactivist judges that seek to legislate from the bench. I have not \nsupported such nominees in the past, and I cannot support such a \nnominee to the highest court in the land.\n  When the people of Arizona sent me to Washington, I took an oath. I \nswore to uphold the Constitution. For millions of Americans, it is \nclear what the\n\n[[Page S8647]]\n\nConstitution means. The Constitution protects an individual's right to \nkeep and bear arms to protect himself, his home, and his family. The \nConstitution protects our right to protest our government, speak freely \nand practice our religious beliefs.\n  The American people will be watching this week when the Senate votes \non Judge Sotomayor's nomination. She is a judge who has foresworn \njudicial activism in her confirmation hearings, but who has a long \nrecord of it prior to 2009. And should she engage in activist decisions \nthat overturn the considered constitutional judgments of millions of \nAmericans, if she uses her lifetime appointment on the bench as a perch \nto remake law in her own image of justice, I expect that Americans will \nhold us Senators accountable.\n  Judicial activism demonstrates a lack of respect for the popular will \nthat is at fundamental odds with our republican system of government. \nAnd, as I stated earlier, regardless of one's success in academics and \nin government service, an individual who does not appreciate the common \nsense limitations on judicial power in our democratic system of \ngovernment ultimately lacks a key qualification for a lifetime \nappointment to the bench. For this reason, and no other, I am unable to \nsupport Judge Sotomayor's nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, before I address the matter I came to \nthe Senate floor to address today, I congratulate the Senator from \nArizona for his thoughtful description of the process by which he has \nmade a decision on the extraordinarily important issue we will have \nbefore the Senate later this week; that is, the confirmation of Judge \nSotomayor for the Supreme Court.

Mr. President, over the past 2 months, I have come to \nthe floor time and again to talk about one of the most important issues \nwe face as a Nation: and that is the need for commonsense health care \nreforms which address the serious problems that all Americans see in \nthe system as it is. I have done this in the context of a larger debate \nabout a proposed reform that, in my view, could actually make our \ncurrent problems worse. And I have had solid support for that view from \na number of well-respected sources.\n  First and foremost is the independent Congressional Budget Office, \nwhich has refuted several estimates by the administration about the \neffect its health care proposals would have on the economy in general \nand health care costs in particular.\n  The Director of the CBO has said the Democrat proposals we have seen \nwould not reverse the upward trend of health care costs and would \nsignificantly increase the government's share of those costs. The CBO \nsays these proposals would add hundreds of billions of dollars to the \nnational debt. It says that one section of one of the proposals would \ncause 10 million people to lose their current health plans. And it says \na so-called Independent Medicare Advisory Council designed to cut costs \nprobably wouldn't.\n  These findings have helped clarify the debate over health care--and \nthey have added to a growing perception that, though the administration \nis trying very hard, economic estimates are not the administration's \nstrong suit.\n  First there was the stimulus. In trying to account for rising \nunemployment after a stimulus bill that was meant to arrest it, the \nadministration said it misread the economy. It also said the stimulus \nwould ``create or save'' between 3 and 4 million jobs, though now it \nsays it can't measure how many jobs are created or saved. Meanwhile we \nhave lost 2 million of them since the stimulus was passed.\n  Last week we saw the administration's tendency to miss the mark on \neconomic estimates again with the so-called cash for clunkers program.\n  We were told this program would last for several months. As it turned \nout, it ran out of money in a week, prompting the House to rush a $2 \nbillion dollar extension before anybody even had time to figure out \nwhat happened with the first billion.\n  There is a pattern here, a pattern that amounts to an argument--and a \nvery strong argument at that: when the administration comes bearing \nestimates, it is not a bad idea to look for a second opinion. All the \nmore so if they say they are in a hurry.\n  Americans are telling us that health care is too important to rush. \nThey are saying it is too important to base our decisions on this issue \nsolely on the estimates that we are getting from the same people who \nbrought us the stimulus and cash for clunkers.\n  The American people want to know what they are getting into when it \ncomes to changing health care in this country. And while I have no \ndoubt the administration is trying, Americans need some assurance that \nthe estimates they are getting are accurate. And if recent experience \nis any guide, they have reason to be as skeptical as the car dealer who \nsaid this to a reporter last week:\n\n       If they can't administer a program like this, I'd be a \n     little concerned about my health insurance.\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S8648]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1910 to Amendment No. 1908.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To strike a setaside for certain grants authorized under the \n                       Rural Electrification Act)\n\n       On page 49, strike line 7 and all that follows through \n     ``U.S.C. 918a):'' on line 12.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I intend to have three amendments \nconsidered. I discussed with the majority leader and the Republican \nleader how we would proceed. So at this time, after I make a brief \nremark about amendment No. 1910, I will be calling up amendment No. \n1912 and amendment No. 2030, both of which are at the desk.\n  Amendment No. 1910 eliminates, as suggested and recommended strongly \nby the President of the United States, the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture's High Energy Cost Grant Program. This is a $17.5 million \nsubsidy designed to pay for energy generation systems in rural areas. \nThis program was proposed for termination by the administration because \nit is duplicative of existing programs, including USDA's own Rural \nUtilities Service Loan Program.\n  Under the fiscal year 2010 budget, the Rural Utilities Service \nProgram would provide $6.6 billion in electric loans at no cost to the \ntaxpayers. In comparison, providing $17.5 million in grants, as opposed \nto a loan, actually costs the taxpayer $17.5 million. Moreover, \nSenators should know there is $20 million in unobligated high energy \ncost grants still available from the previous year.\n  This is the submission to Congress, the budget of the U.S. Government \nfor fiscal year 2010, by the Office of Management and Budget. Guess \nwhat. In there is a page that is titled ``Termination: High Energy Cost \nGrant, Department of Agriculture.'' It goes on to say:\n\n       The administration proposes to eliminate the High Energy \n     Cost Grants program because it is duplicative of and less \n     effective than the Rural Utilities Service's electric loan \n     program.\n\n  Those are not my words, those are the words of the Director of the \nOffice of Management and Budget, who, at the direction of the President \nof the United States, prepared this document of certain programs that \nshould be eliminated.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       The 2010 budget proposes elimination of the duplicative \n     High Energy Cost Grants program in favor of electric loans, \n     which are more cost effective from the standpoint of the \n     taxpayer. Using loans to provide support is less expensive \n     than using grants because loans provide more support . . . \n     with fewer appropriated dollars. For example, the 2010 budget \n     provides for $6.6 billion in electric loans at no cost to the \n     taxpayer. In comparison, providing $18 million in grants \n     costs the taxpayers $18 million. In addition, the funds for \n     High Energy Cost Grants have not been obligated in a timely \n     manner and $20 million in balances from previous year funding \n     are still available.\n\n  In other words, this amendment eliminates a duplicative, unnecessary \nprogram, according to the Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget, and at the President's request, he has sent over one of the \nprograms they want eliminated. So somehow it ends up back in the \nappropriations bill.\n  It seems to me it is a pretty clear-cut case again that at some point \nwe have to try to make some kinds of cost savings. I admit, as we are \nthrowing around billions and trillions of dollars, as we do here \nlately, $17.5 million is probably not much money given the kind of \nbehavior the Congress and the administration have been up to lately. I \nwould still argue, though, to millions of Americans, including those in \nmy home State of Arizona, $17.5 million--in the view of the \nadministration and a clear argument, it is not a complicated issue--\nshould be eliminated.\n  I hope we will be able to vote on this amendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1912 to Amendment No. 1908\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 1912 which is at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1912 to amendment No. 1908.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                amendment no. 1912 to amendment no. 1908\n\n(Purpose: To strike a provision relating to certain watershed and flood \n                         prevention operations)\n\n       On page 31, strike line 20 and all that follows through \n     page 32, line 10.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. This amendment eliminates the U.S. Watershed and Flood \nPrevention Operations Program, also known as the Small Watersheds \nProgram.\n  This program is a textbook example of how reckless earmarks can \ndevastate a government program. Like the previous four Presidents' \nbudgets, the administration proposes to terminate this account because \nCongress has earmarked virtually all of this program in recent years, \nmeaning that the agency is unable to prioritize projects on any merit-\nbased criteria such as cost effectiveness.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, the Small Watersheds \nProgram was 97 percent earmarked in fiscal year 2009, which severely \nmarginalized the USDA's ability to evaluate and prioritize projects. \nEarmarks may partly be to blame for the findings of a 2003 Office of \nManagement and Budget study that showed this program has a lower \neconomic return than any other Federal flood prevention program, \nincluding those in the Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency.\n  The onslaught of earmarks over the years has almost certainly \ncontributed to the current backlog of about 300 unfunded authorized \nsmall watershed projects totaling $1.2 billion. As it was originally \nintended, the Small Watersheds Program may be a worthwhile program. I \nam sure we will hear a vigorous defense of this program. But by \ninundating it with so-called congressionally designated projects, the \nprogram is challenged to function properly to the point where the \nadministration would rather see it gone.\n  Note this. Our friends on the Appropriations Committee have not given \nup on plundering it yet. This bill provides $24.3 million for this \nprogram, including $16.5 million in earmarks for projects such as $2 \nmillion for the Pocasset River in Rhode Island, which is not \nauthorized; $1.5 million for Dunloup Creek in West Virginia, which is \nnot authorized; and $1 million for the DuPage County Watershed in \nIllinois, which is not authorized, to name a few.\n  I refer back again to the Office of Management and Budget publication \nentitled ``Terminations, Reductions and Savings,'' where the \nadministration proposes to terminate watershed and flood prevention \noperation programs. Congress has earmarked virtually all of this \nprogram in recent years, meaning that agencies are unable to prioritize \nprojects on any merit-based criteria such as cost effectiveness.\n  So, again, these first two amendments, the President of the United \nStates, the Office of Management and Budget, most any casual observer \nwould argue need to be eliminated.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2030 to Amendment No. 1908\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 2030, which is at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2030 to amendment No. 1908.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2030\n\n             (Purpose: To prohibit funding for an earmark)\n\n       On page 85, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n       Sec. 7__.  None of the funds made available under this Act \n     may be used for the Iowa Vitality Center, Iowa State \n     University.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. This amendment is very simple. It prohibits funding of \nthe $250,0000 earmark for the Iowa Vitality Center at Iowa State \nUniversity.\n  This earmark is a textbook example of how difficult it is to stop \nfunding for\n\n[[Page S8649]]\n\nan earmark once it starts. According to the Web site of the earmark \nsponsor, since fiscal year 2001, the Iowa Vitality Center has received \n$2,579,000. For what? What is so vital about the Iowa Vitality Center \nthat it has required over $2.5 million of scarce taxpayer funds?\n  Well, according to their own Web site, the purpose of the Iowa \nCommunity Vitality Center is to serve as a catalyst in fostering \ncollaborative public-private partnerships among nonmetro community \ninterests to stimulate vitality and address barriers to growth.\n  I am not making that up. I am not making it up. That is what the Web \nsite says. Let me repeat. We spent $2.5 million. The purpose of the \nIowa Community Vitality Center is to serve as a catalyst in fostering \ncollaborative public-private partnerships among nonmetro community \ninterests to stimulate vitality and address barriers to growth.\n  Is there anyone who has a clue as to what that means? I wanted to be \nclear. I am not questioning the merits of this program, but I am \nquestioning the process. Why was this funding earmarked? If the \nVitality Center is such a critical national priority at this time, why \nwasn't the funding authorized since 2001 or requested by the President \nin his budget submission?\n  The funding for the Vitality Center is often justified as helping \ncommunities ``plan strategically'' and as ``representing diverse \ninterest across the state.'' However, the sponsors of the earmark \nneglect to explain why 10 years of strategic planning have been \ninsufficient to accomplish this center's stated purpose.\n  Our current economic situation and our vital national security \ninterest concerns require, now more than ever, that we prioritize our \nFederal spending. We need to prove to the American people that we are \nserious about changing the way we do business and we should start with \nending the practice of earmarking. We need to put our national \npriorities first and eliminate unnecessary wasteful earmarks such as \nthe Iowa Vitality Center.\n  The Agriculture appropriations bill for the year 2010 spends about \n$123 billion in direct and mandatory spending, an amount that is \napproximately $234 million above the administration's budget request. \nWe debate this legislation in the shadow of the fiscal year 2009 \nomnibus bill, the omnibus bill which doled out $108 billion for U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture programs, as well as the infamous economic \nstimulus package which provided another $26.5 billion in agricultural \nspending. So 2009 is certainly a good year to be a U.S. Department of \nAgriculture program office.\n  I acknowledge that many of the programs funded by this are valid for \nproviding important services to the agricultural community at large. I \ncommend the members of the Senate Appropriations Committee for \nreporting this bill in a timely manner. I agree we should ensure that \nour farmers stay out of the red and that some Federal involvement is \nnecessary to assist low-income families under the nutrition programs.\n  Unfortunately, Congress once again has conformed to the practice of \ndiverting precious taxpayer dollars into an array of special interest \nprojects which have not been authorized or requested, and in the case \nof two of these, they have been requested to be terminated by the \nadministration.\n  The committee report accompanying this bill contains 296 \ncongressionally directed spending items, a fancy new term for \n``earmarks,'' totaling over $220 million. None of these projects was \nrequested by the administration. Many of them were not authorized or \ncompetitively bid in any way. No hearings were held to judge whether \nthese were national priorities worthy of scarce taxpayer dollars. They \nare in this bill for one reason and one reason only--because of the \nprerogatives of a select few Members of the Senate to serve their own \ninterests over those of the American taxpayer.\n  Let's take a look at some of the earmarks. Let's take a look at some \nof the earmarks that are in this bill and its accompanying reports. \nThere is $250,000 for gypsy moth research in New Jersey. Don't gypsy \nmoths travel all over the country? Why just New Jersey? Over the past \n10 years, the taxpayer has funded $42.8 million worth of gypsy moth \nresearch.\n  There is $500,000 for the hemlock woolly adelgid at the University of \nTennessee. This is an aphid-like insect. That is a lot of money for \nthat bug.\n  There is $235,000 for noxious weed management in Nevada. I think a \nbetter term for this one is obnoxious. Over the past 10 years, over \n$15.4 million has been earmarked for Nevada noxious weed management.\n  There is $200,000 for cotton research at Texas Tech University. \nCongress subsidizes the industry, the cotton industry, to the tune of \n$3 billion a year.\n  There is $300,000 for floriculture at the University of Hawaii. \nNearly $3.5 million has been earmarked for floriculture in the past 10 \nyears.\n  There is $165,000 for the Maple Research Center at the University of \nVermont. According to the center's director, Tim Perkins, Maple syrup \nscience is a nose-and-mouth science. The technical term is \norganoleptic, which means you put it in your mouth and taste it, says \nPerkins. We get people who know the flavor of maple syrup, and off-\nflavors, and they try each one. Laboratory tests using gas \nchromatography provide a breakdown of the many compounds in the syrup, \nwhich supplements the tastebud approach. Since 1998, the University of \nVermont Proctor Maple Research Center has received over $2.1 million in \nearmarks.\n  There is $75,000 for farm safety education for children in Iowa. Who \nbetter than a bureaucrat in Washington to teach a farmer's children to \nbe safe. The 10-year total for earmarks for Iowa farm safety \neducation--over $4.2 million.\n  There is $300,000 for shrimp aquaculture research at the University \nof Southern Mississippi Thad Cochran Marine Agricultural Center. Over \nthe past 10 years, we have earmarked over $30.4 million on shrimp \naquaculture research.\n  There is $1 million for potato research at Oregon State University. \nWe have earmarked, over the past 10 years, $7.1 million for potato \nresearch.\n  There is $600,000 which is gobbled down by the National Wild Turkey \nFederation for projects in Nebraska, Georgia, Mississippi, and South \nCarolina. Since fiscal year 2004, the National Wild Turkey Federation \nhas received over $1.7 million in earmarks.\n  There is $265,000 for minimizing blackbird damage to sunflowers in \nNorth and South Dakota. This is an earmark ``regular'' for the \nAgriculture appropriations bill. Evidently the South Dakota sunflowers \nhave a rather serious Alfred Hitchcock ``Birds'' problem. According to \nthe USDA, blackbird management in North and South Dakota has received \nover $1.2 million over the past 5 years.\n  There is $200,000 for Washington State University to study goatgrass. \nSince 2003, $767,000 has been earmarked for goatgrass research.\n  There is $372,000 for the University of Pennsylvania to study dairy \nfarm profitability. If you are relying on a federally mandated study to \nmake your dairy farm profitable, you might want to find a new business \nplan, because nearly $3.8 million has been earmarked for dairy farm \nprofitability over the last 10 years.\n  There is $288,000 for the Iowa Soybean Association. Since 2002, over \n$3.3 million has been earmarked for the Iowa Soybean Association. There \nis $1 million for Mormon cricket control in Nevada; the 10-year total \nfor Mormon cricket control, nearly $13.7 million. There is $260,000 for \nwine grape research at Washington State University. According to \nWashington State University's own Web site, the wine industry generates \n$3 billion in their State, so we are going to pour another $260,000 \ninto it. There is $350,000 for the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture \nto support the ``specialty meats industry.'' Specialty meats industry? \nSince 2004, the Wisconsin specialty meats industry has received over \n$12.7 million in earmarks. There is $340,000 for the Center for Beef \nExcellence in Pennsylvania. According to their own press release, the \ncenter was established by the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture \njust last year. At least we can agree that a $340,000 handout from \nCongress is quite a good start. Over $1 million has been earmarked to \nthe Center for Beef Excellence since 2005. There is $450,000 for the \nUniversity of Northern\n\n[[Page S8650]]\n\nIowa to study agriculture-based lubricants. They have received over $3 \nmillion in the last 10 years.\n  It is not surprising that the largest earmark in this bill goes to \nHawaii. The Aloha State bags $5 million to continue construction of an \nAgricultural Research Service center to study agricultural practices in \nthe Pacific. As my colleagues might know, ARS construction is one of \nthe most heavily earmarked accounts in government, so much so that the \nPresident's budget actually proposed zeroing out Agricultural Research \nService center construction for fiscal year 2010 because ``Congress \nroutinely earmarks small amounts of funding for [these projects] \nlocated throughout the nation. The result of scattering funding in this \nmanner is that . . . few, if any, of the projects are able to reach the \ncritical threshold of funding that would allow construction to begin. \nFunding construction over such a long time significantly increases the \namount of money needed to fully complete these projects as well as \npostponing their completion for many years.''\n  So here we have a program that is earmarked so severely that it \ndelays and drives up the cost of approved construction projects. Not \nonly are we defiantly funding this Hawaiian facility, the bill provides \na total of $47 million for a list of 15 of these facilities ranging \nfrom $4 million for a fruit lab in West Virginia to $2 million for an \nanimal waste research facility in Kentucky.\n  Another amendment I have filed proposes striking the $50.7 million \ncontained in this bill for USDA's Resource Conservation and Development \nProgram, known as RC The RC Program was created in 1962 to promote \nresource conservation through community-based conservation leadership \ncouncils. The RC councils have helped to leverage local funding for \nefforts such as soil mapping or erosion control for rural areas. The \nadministration supports terminating this program because, in their own \nwords:\n\n       After 47 years, the goal of the RC program has been \n     accomplished. These councils have developed sufficiently \n     strong state and local ties . . . and are now able to secure \n     funding for their continued operation without Federal \n     assistance. The program has been in operation for decades and \n     these councils have a proven track record of success, showing \n     that they have outlived the need for Federal funding.\n\n  A half-century-old program proposed for termination by this \nadministration, yet retained by appropriators for its spoils.\n  I could go on for a long time.\n  This bill funds several other government programs that were proposed \nfor termination in the President's budget. I filed amendments to strike \nthese programs as well as zero out the ARS construction account. If \nsuccessfully adopted, these amendments would save taxpayers over $144.5 \nmillion. As I have said throughout my comments, some of these programs \nmay have merit and may be helpful to the designated communities. But \nconsidering our current budgetary crisis, it is inappropriate to \ninclude them in this year's agricultural spending bill, especially when \nthey have been identified for termination or reduction.\n  I hope my colleagues will agree that we have higher spending \npriorities that are directly related to the purposes of this \nAgriculture bill. This bill is intended to address farmers, women, \nchildren, and rural communities with the greatest need and should not \nbe used as a vehicle for piggybacking pet projects to get the support \nof special interest constituents.\n  It is no surprise that many of these earmarks are not included for \npractical purposes. I know many of my colleagues have spoken about the \neconomic struggles of America's hard-working farmers and low-income \nfamilies. The farmers and struggling families I know are tired of \nwatching their hard-earned money go down the drain. I intend to fight \nevery single unnecessary, unrequested, unauthorized earmark in this and \nevery other appropriations bill.\n  I filed 313 amendments to this bill. The bulk of those amendments \nseek to strike the 296 earmarks, now humorously called \n``congressionally directed spending items,'' in the committee report on \nthis bill. I have now offered only three of these amendments. Let me \nassure my colleagues I have no problem with offering, debating, and \nvoting on each and every one of the amendments I have filed. The time \nhas come to end this practice.\n  This first amendment, which we may vote on today, I want to \nemphasize, eliminates, as recommended by the President and the Office \nof Management and Budget, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's High \nEnergy Cost Grants Program, a $17.5 million subsidy designed to pay for \nenergy generation systems in rural areas. It was proposed for \ntermination by the administration because it is duplicative of existing \nprograms. Under the fiscal year 2010 budget, the rural utility service \nprogram would provide $6.6 billion in electric loans at no cost to the \ntaxpayers. Senators should know there is $20 million in unobligated \nhigh energy cost grants still available from last year.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on my amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, the Senate began work on the Agriculture \nappropriations bill last Thursday. Senator Brownback and I were here \nthen to consider amendments Senators might wish to offer. We were back \non the bill Friday, and we were again prepared to consider amendments. \nIt is my hope we can complete action on the bill today. The filing \ndeadline for first-degree amendments was 3:30, and a cloture vote is \nscheduled for 5:30. Once we finish this bill, the Senate still has \nimportant work to do this week before the start of the August recess. I \nhope any Senator who has an amendment to offer will come to the floor \nin the next few hours to see if we can dispose of all remaining issues \nand make it possible to go to final passage as early as this evening.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2233 to Amendment No. 1908\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment and call \nup the following amendment which is at the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration: Kohl amendment No. 2233.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

It would be my hope we can move through this bill as fast as \npossible so that we can get to the debate on Judge Sotomayor and have \nas much time as possible to deal with that. I urge colleagues to start \nworking with us on these issues. By unanimous consent, the cloture vote \nhas been scheduled for 5:30 today. There are things we need to get \nresolved; they should be taken care of now.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2229, as Modified\n\n  Mr. BROWN. I send a modification to my amendment No. 2229 to the desk \nand ask unanimous consent that it be accepted as modified.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the amendment is \nso modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 85, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n       Sec. 7__. (a) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs may \n     establish within the Food and Drug Administration a review \n     group which shall recommend to the Commissioner of Food and \n     Drugs appropriate preclinical, trial design, and regulatory \n     paradigms and optimal solutions for the prevention, \n     diagnosis, and treatment of rare diseases: Provided, That the \n     Commissioner of Food and Drugs shall appoint 8 individuals \n     employed by the Food and Drug Administration to serve on the \n     review group: Provided further, That members of the review \n     group shall have specific expertise relating to the \n     development of articles for use in the prevention, diagnosis, \n     or treatment of rare diseases, including specific expertise \n     in developing or carrying out clinical trials.\n       (b) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs may establish within \n     the Food and Drug Administration a review group which shall \n     recommend to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs appropriate \n     preclinical, trial design, and regulatory paradigms and \n     optimal solutions for the prevention, diagnosis, and \n     treatment of neglected diseases of the developing world: \n     Provided, That the Commissioner of Food and Drugs shall \n     appoint 8 individuals employed by the Food and Drug \n     Administration to serve on the review group: Provided \n     further, That members of the review group shall have specific \n     expertise relating to the development of articles for use in \n     the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of neglected diseases \n     of the developing world, including specific expertise in \n     developing or carrying out clinical trials: Provided further, \n     That for the purposes of this section the term ``neglected \n     disease of the developing world'' means a tropical disease, \n     as defined in section 524(a)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, \n     and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360n(a)(3)).\n       (c) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs shall--\n       (1) submit, not later than 1 year after the date of the \n     establishment of review groups under subsections (a) and (b), \n     a report to Congress that describes both the findings and \n     recommendations made by the review groups under subsections \n     (a) and (b);\n       (2) issue, not later than 180 days after submission of the \n     report to Congress under paragraph (1), guidance based on \n     such recommendations for articles for use in the prevention, \n     diagnosis, and treatment of rare diseases and for such uses \n     in neglected diseases of the developing world; and\n       (3) develop, not later than 180 days after submission of \n     the report to Congress under paragraph (1), internal review \n     standards based on such recommendations for articles for use \n     in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of rare diseases \n     and for such uses in neglected diseases of the developing \n     world.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. This is an amendment that has been cleared by both \nsides. It is on neglected and rare diseases. Senator Brown has asked to \nbe a cosponsor. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside and that this be considered the pending amendment and that it \nbe passed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. If there is no further debate on the amendment, the question \nis on agreeing to amendment No. 2229, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2229), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. What we are trying to do is to work through the \namendments to the degree we can. We certainly want to. I ask our \ncolleagues to bring those to the floor as soon as they possibly can.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Sotomayor Nomination\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to rise in support of \nJudge Sonia Sotomayor's nomination to be an Associate Justice of the \nSupreme Court of the United States. Judge Sotomayor's background \ndemonstrates that she is an extremely well-qualified, mainstream judge \nwho has the utmost respect for precedent and believes in fidelity to \nthe law.\n  I have always said I do not believe in a litmus test for judicial \nnominees, and I will look at the nominee's record as a whole. Judge \nSotomayor's record, in its entirety, is nothing short of impressive. \nWith 17 years on the Federal bench, she has more Federal judicial \nexperience than any Supreme Court nominee in 100 years.\n  Judge Sotomayor has a compelling, ``pull yourself up by your \nbootstraps'' personal story. She was raised by a single mom who \nemphasized education as she struggled to support her family while \nworking as a nurse. With her mother's strong work ethic and focus on \neducation deeply ingrained in her, Judge Sotomayor went on to graduate \nsumma cum laude from Princeton University, and she received her law \ndegree from Yale Law School, where she was editor of the Yale Law \nJournal.\n  She then became a prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney's \noffice, where she was tough on criminals and gained valuable \nperspective for her later career as a judge. She also became active in \nmany areas of her community, showing her desire to serve others and \npromote justice in society. Having served as a volunteer for many \nefforts in my hometown of Greensboro, North Carolina, I know how \nserving others can enhance one's understanding and appreciation of the \nworld.\n  After her time as a prosecutor, Judge Sotomayor went into practice as \na commercial litigator, where she dealt with business and finance law--\nan area of importance to my State of North Carolina. In 1991, upon the \nrecommendation of then-Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, she \nwas nominated by President George H.W. Bush to serve as a Federal judge \nfor the Southern District Court of New York, and in 1992 she was \nunanimously confirmed for that position by the Senate.\n  While serving as a district court judge, she was known for her \ntoughness, fairness, and dedication to the law--characteristics of a \nstrong judge. Because of her outstanding record on the district court \nlevel, Judge Sotomayor was nominated, in 1997, by President William \nJefferson Clinton, to serve as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Second Circuit. In 1998, the Senate confirmed her by a wide margin.\n  Among the Senators voting for her confirmation was former North \nCarolina Senator Jesse Helms. I would like to think that Senator Helms \nsaw in Judge Sotomayor the same qualities President Obama saw: fairness \nof mind, supreme intellect, and an unsurpassed devotion to the law and \nto our system of government.\n  Some opponents have repeatedly brought up a few select comments made \nby Judge Sotomayor to suggest that she will not be impartial. However, \nJudge Sotomayor has made it clear she does not let her background \ninfluence her interpretation of the law. Her statements to the \nJudiciary Committee and her 17-year record on the bench confirm this.\n  As Judge Sotomayor has said:\n\n       My record shows that at no point or time have I ever \n     permitted my personal views or sympathies to influence an \n     outcome of a case. In every case where I have identified a \n     sympathy, I have articulated it and explained to the litigant \n     why the law requires a different result.\n\n  Judge Sotomayor has also said that as much as her experiences \ninfluence her perspective, they have also taught\n\n[[Page S8652]]\n\nher to be aware of other people's perspectives. In 2001, she said:\n\n       I am reminded each day that I render decisions that affect \n     people concretely and that I owe them constant and complete \n     vigilance in checking my assumptions, presumptions and \n     perspectives and ensuring that to the extent that my limited \n     abilities and capabilities permit me, that I reevaluate them \n     and change as circumstances and cases before me require.\n\n  As Judge Sotomayor said in her confirmation hearing, her underlying \njudicial philosophy is ``fidelity to the law.'' In an independent \nstudy, Supreme Court expert Tom Goldstein looked at 97 race-related \ncases in which Judge Sotomayor participated while on the Second \nCircuit. He found that she and the rest of her panel ``rejected \ndiscrimination claims roughly 80 times and agreed with them 10 times.'' \nThe circuit rejected discrimination claims by a margin of 8 to 1. \nGoldstein wrote: ``Of the 10 cases favoring claims of discrimination, 9 \nwere unanimous'' and ``of those 9, in 7, the unanimous panel included \nat least one Republican-appointed judge.''\n  ``Given that record,'' Goldstein concluded, ``it seems absurd to say \nthat Judge Sotomayor allows race to infect her decisionmaking.''\n  Judge Sotomayor has also demonstrated she does not legislate from the \nbench, and she gives deference to Congress in clarifying the intent of \nlaws. In her dissent to the majority's opinion in Hayden v. Pataki, \nJudge Sotomayor wrote:\n\n       The duty of a judge is to follow the law, not to question \n     its plain terms. I do not believe that Congress wishes us to \n     disregard the plain language of any statute or to invent \n     exceptions to the statutes it has created.\n\n  She also said:\n\n       I trust that Congress would prefer to make any needed \n     changes itself, rather than have courts do so for it.\n\n  Additionally, a comprehensive study of Judge Sotomayor's criminal \nappellate decisions by the majority staff of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee found, as an appellate judge, Sotomayor sat with Republican-\nappointed judges on more than 400 criminal cases. In those cases, she \nagreed with all Republican-appointed judges 97 percent of the time; and \nshe agreed with at least one Republican-appointed judge 99 percent of \nthe time.\n  Judge Sotomayor's sensible attitude toward following the law and her \nability to objectively evaluate all angles of her cases has resulted in \nhigh ratings and endorsements by numerous organizations.\n  The American Bar Association unanimously found Sotomayor to be ``well \nqualified,'' which is the highest rating the ABA gives to judicial \nnominees. The Congressional Research Service conducted an analysis of \nher opinions and concluded:\n\n       As a group, the opinions belie easy categorization along \n     any ideological spectrum. . . . Perhaps the most consistent \n     characteristic of Judge Sotomayor's approach as an appellate \n     judge has been an adherence to the doctrine of stare decisis, \n     i.e., the upholding of past judicial precedents.\n\n  Judge Sotomayor has an impressive list of law enforcement \nendorsements and supporters, including the International Association of \nChiefs of Police; the National Association of Police Organizations; the \nNational District Attorneys Association; the Fraternal Order of Police; \nthe National Latino Peace Officers Association; the Federal Law \nEnforcement Officers Association; the Federal Hispanic Law Enforcement \nOfficers Association; the National Organization of Black Law \nEnforcement Executives; and the National Sheriffs' Association.\n  Judge Sotomayor has also been endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, which stated:\n\n       The Chamber evaluated Judge Sotomayor's record from the \n     standpoint of legal scholarship, judicial temperament, and an \n     understanding of business and economic issues. Based on the \n     Chamber's evaluation of her judicial record, Judge Sotomayor \n     is well-qualified to serve as an Associate Justice of the \n     U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n  The nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice reviewed all of Judge \nSotomayor's constitutional law decisions and said:\n\n       Based on this exhaustive review, the conclusion is \n     unmistakable: in constitutional cases, Judge Sotomayor is \n     solidly in the mainstream of the Second Circuit.\n\n  Judge Sotomayor's former law clerks wrote a letter endorsing her \nnomination, in which they said:\n\n       As former law clerks to Judge Sotomayor, each of us can \n     attest to her intellectual prowess, extraordinary work ethic, \n     and commitment to the rule of law. Working for Judge \n     Sotomayor is an awe-inspiring experience. We each had the \n     privilege of working closely with her as she confronted, and \n     resolved, incredibly complex and intellectually demanding \n     legal challenges. Judge Sotomayor approaches each case with \n     an open mind and arrives at her decision only after carefully \n     considering all of the pertinent facts and applicable rules \n     of law.\n\n  The law clerks said they agree with many of Judge Sotomayor's other \ncolleagues, who ``respect her intellectual dynamism, collegiality, and \nbalanced, fair jurisprudence.''\n  I would like to thank and congratulate the members of the Judiciary \nCommittee for holding an extraordinarily civil and open Supreme Court \nnomination process. I commend President Obama for selecting a woman, a \nHispanic, and, above all, an extremely well-qualified nominee. I am \nthrilled to have the opportunity to be a part of this historic moment, \nand if she is confirmed, I believe she will serve our country well.\n  Based on my conversations with the nominee, her statements in her \nconfirmation hearings, and my review of her record, I intend to support \nher confirmation when it is voted upon later this week, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in congratulating \nSenator Leahy and Senator Sessions for their work on the Sotomayor \nnomination. The process was fair to both sides, and, most importantly, \nfair to the nominee.\n  I am pleased to rise in support of Judge Sotomayor, an individual \nwhose life story is an inspiration to millions of Americans. A child of \nimmigrants with modest means, Judge Sotomayor has risen by dint of \nexemplary academic accomplishment and hard work to the cusp of \nconfirmation to our Nation's highest Court.\n  But Judge Sotomayor is much more than just a story of accomplishment. \nShe has shown herself to be a judge truly worthy of elevation to the \nSupreme Court. Both on the bench and before this committee, Judge \nSotomayor has proved she has the necessary character, competence, and \nintegrity to serve on the Supreme Court. Her distinguished 17-year \nrecord on the bench demonstrates a commitment to fair and impartial \napplication of the law and respect for the values which make up our \nConstitution.\n  At her hearing, Judge Sotomayor assured us she will listen with an \nopen mind to all sides of an argument and that she will be mindful of \nthe very real impact her decisions will have on each and every \nAmerican. She pledged fidelity to the Constitution and to the Court's \nprecedent, as well as a responsibility to cautiously review precedent \nwhen justice requires.\n  As we conclude the Senate's action on Judge Sotomayor's nomination \nthis week, I believe we need to reflect upon the role that confirmation \nhearings play in the Senate's duty to advise and consent. While I have \nno reservations about my support for Judge Sotomayor, I share the \nconcerns expressed by many Americans, legal commentators, and others on \nthe Judiciary Committee about our committee's ability to have candid \nand substantive conversations with nominees about the issues Americans \ncare about.\n  We all know the confirmation process is crucial. It is the public's \nonly opportunity to learn about a nominee before he or she serves for \nlife on the highest Court in our land. But, for many years now, we have \nseen a familiar pattern from nominees--Democratic and Republican \nalike--who have learned the path of least resistance is to limit their \nresponses and cautiously cloak them in generalities.\n  Understandably, nominees do not want to risk their confirmation by \nsaying anything that might provoke potential opponents. We cannot ask \nnominees to disclose how they would vote on cases that might come \nbefore them. But it is reasonable for us to ask them to speak more \nopenly about past Supreme Court decisions and how they would decide \ncases that are close calls--what reasoning they would use and what \nfactors they would consider.\n  The concerns I raise do not reflect any personal criticism about \nJudge\n\n[[Page S8653]]\n\nSotomayor. I think she responded to our committee's questions with \ngreat intellect and sincerity and that she has rightly earned \nbipartisan praise.\n  However, going forward, I hope together we can explore ways to \nachieve the greater candor that the confirmation process demands and \ndeserves. For example, we could convene a bipartisan group of Judiciary \nCommittee members, members of the bar, constitutional scholars, and \nperhaps even members of the media who have experience following the \nCourt and our hearings to help us determine what specific questions we \ncan and should expect substantive answers about. If we can do this, \nthen the committee's unique opportunity to engage nominees in the great \nlegal questions facing our Nation will more effectively serve the \nSenate as we fulfill our constitutional duty.\n  In the meantime, I commend President Obama for nominating Judge \nSotomayor--a woman of great ability who has demonstrated an enduring \ncommitment to public service and to the law. I look forward to her \ntenure on the Court.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2241 to Amendment No. 1908\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so that I may call up amendment No. 2241.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Johanns], for himself and \n     Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, proposes an amendment numbered 2241 \n     to amendment No. 1908.\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide funding for the tuberculosis program of the Animal \n                  and Plant Health Inspection Service)\n\n       On page 19, line 9, before the period, insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That of the amount available \n     under this heading, at least $17,764,000 shall be used for \n     the tuberculosis program (including at least $3,000,000 for \n     tuberculosis indemnity and depopulation)''.\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss my amendment to \nincrease funding for USDA's tuberculosis program by $2 million.\n  In early June, TB was discovered in a beef cattle herd in Rock \nCounty, NE. As many of my colleagues know, this is a disease that can \nspread very quickly among cattle. It is also transmissible to humans.\n  This is not just a Nebraska issue or a Midwest issue. As I speak, \nCalifornia, Michigan, Minnesota, and New Mexico are battling the \neffects of TB. Other States, including Colorado, South Dakota, and \nTexas have had TB scares as well. Although, thankfully, up to this \npoint they have not seen any change in their TB status. This problem \ncould impact the beef industry nationwide, and it is critical that we \ndo everything we can to eliminate it immediately when it is discovered.\n  In Nebraska, thankfully, only two animals in the entire herd tested \npositive for the disease, and they were put down to prevent further \nspread. Since that time, Nebraska State officials have worked side by \nside with USDA officials to test the infected herd, as well as several \nneighboring herds, which is the process. Based on the latest reports \nfrom home, 8,900 cattle have been tested to date, and all have, \nthankfully, tested negative for TB. That is great news.\n  I commend the efforts of the veterinarians and the government \nofficials on the ground in Nebraska. I thank those officials for their \nefforts. They have been aggressively dealing with this issue every day \nsince the initial discovery. I wish to thank the USDA specifically for \nproviding significant expertise and personnel to assist with the \nongoing testing. The Department's assistance has been sound and it has \nbeen steady. We greatly appreciate it, but the work is not yet done. \nThe testing is not quite complete. Hopefully, the results will keep \ncoming back negative, but, regardless, we are going to remain vigilant.\n  We must make sure the USDA has the resources on hand to respond in \nthe event that further cases of TB are discovered. That could be \nanywhere in this country. TB can have a crippling impact on a State's \nbeef industry. It can negatively impact the ability of State producers \nto shift cattle State to State, and, of course, potentially it can have \nan impact on export markets.\n  Ranchers cannot afford to have their State lose its TB-free status. \nAnytime a disease such as TB is discovered in a herd, it is absolutely \ncritical the infected herd be depopulated immediately. I say that from \nmy experience as a former Secretary of Agriculture. Depopulation is \noftentimes essential. Doing so significantly decreases the likelihood \nof the spread of the disease. It also reassures the rest of the beef \nindustry that we will always respond decisively to combat the spread of \nthe animal disease.\n  We need to send a strong signal to our producers that they will have \nour support if they come forward when they discover the herd has a \nproblem. If depopulation indemnity funds are not available, a producer \nliterally may hesitate to disclose the information. Then the problem \nfesters and it festers and it spreads. We simply cannot take that kind \nof risk. Consumer confidence and producer trust are far too important.\n  It is imperative that we make sure USDA has the funding and the tools \non hand to deal with existing TB problems and to take swift action in \nthe event of future TB discoveries. That is why I am offering this \namendment--to make sure the resources are there.\n  At this point I ask unanimous consent that a letter supporting my \namendment from the National Cattlemen's Beef Association be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              National Cattlemen's\n\n\n                                             Beef Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 3, 2009.\n     Hon. Mike Johanns,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Johanns: I am writing today in support of your \n     amendment to the Fiscal Year 2010 Agriculture Appropriations \n     bill that increases United States Department of Agriculture \n     (USDA) funding for bovine tuberculosis (TB) indemnity and \n     depopulation. Bovine TB is a contagious animal disease that \n     the cattle industry and Federal government have been working \n     to eradicate for close to 100 years. In order to eventually \n     eradicate this disease, infected herds must be depopulated \n     quickly and the fanner or rancher must be compensated in a \n     fair and equitable way for the value of lost cattle. Your \n     amendment will go far in helping with this effort.\n       The work done by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection \n     Service (APHIS), the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS), \n     and state and industry partners, has been critical in \n     containing and managing this disease. FSIS maintains a robust \n     TB surveillance program at harvesting facilities to ensure \n     that no cattle with TB enter the food supply. This \n     illustrates the effectiveness of the food safety measures \n     utilized in the beef industry. In recent years, APHIS has \n     intensified their TB surveillance and has indicated that the \n     disease has nearly been eradicated. We also know that \n     wildlife play a critical part in the transmission of the \n     disease, and industry is working with both Federal and state \n     governments to address this.\n       In our combined effort for eventual eradication, the \n     national tuberculosis eradication program has successfully \n     reduced the incidence of the disease in U.S. cattle. There \n     continues, however, to be a low incidence of TB as evidenced \n     by the handful of newly identified infected herds over the \n     past several years. These additional cases are in part due to \n     intentional intensified surveillance activities, and the \n     infected animals, along with their herd mates, are then \n     quarantined in order to control the disease and minimize its \n     impact on cattle movement and markets. This has proven to be \n     the most effective method to protect our domestic cattle herd \n     since the national program began in 1917.\n       We support USDA's efforts to eradicate this disease, but \n     historically we have not seen enough funding to adequately \n     compensate farmers and ranchers for cattle that had to be \n     depopulated. It is evident with the limitations of current \n     technology, the wildlife vector, and the complicated nature \n     of TB, that the current amount of Federal funding is not \n     adequate. More funding and research is needed to provide \n     better answers and solutions. Until those solutions are \n     found, we need timely and adequate funding to depopulate any \n     current beef herds and compensate cattle producers for their \n     losses. Since TB is a concern across the country, this \n     amendment will help to provide that needed compensation and \n     allow the TB eradication program to be successful.\n       We urge the Senate to vote YES on your amendment during \n     floor consideration of this bill. Thank you for your \n     leadership and support of U.S. cattle producers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Gary Voogt,\n                                                        President.\n\n\n[[Page S8654]]\n\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Finally, I urge my colleagues to support this very \nimportant amendment to make the resources available to the USDA, and I \nurge my colleagues, if they have any questions, to get in touch with \nus. This is a very important issue.\n  With that, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, the Senator's amendment would increase the \namount in this bill from $15.7 million to $17.7 million. The amendment \nwould require at least $3 million to compensate producers for losses. \nThe Secretary currently has access to the Commodity Credit Corporation \nto compensate producers, and we hope the Secretary will use those funds \nas needed.\n  Since this amendment would reduce other animal and plant health \nactivities, I must oppose it at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Guantanamo Bay\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, the reason I ask that on this bill--\nand I do urge my colleagues to come forward to speak on the Agriculture \nappropriations bill. We have already cleared some amendments, and we \nneed to move forward.\n  Something happened yesterday that affected my State directly, and \nthat was the statement by the administration--or leak from the \nadministration--that they are considering moving Guantanamo Bay \ndetainees to my State, associated with Fort Leavenworth. This has riled \nup everybody. I was just there this morning, and we had 100 people who \ncame out after very short notice. It is virtually unanimous in their \nopinions--not everybody but close to everybody is opposed to this idea \nfor a multiple set of reasons.\n  Moving the Guantanamo Bay detainees to Fort Leavenworth and the Fort \nLeavenworth area would not work, to start off with, and will \nsignificantly hurt the core educational and international mission of \nthe fort. On top of that it is totally unnecessary. I hope the \nadministration will start to rethink this idea of moving the Guantanamo \nBay detainees. I think it is a bad idea that we replicate the facility \nwe already have at Guantanamo Bay somewhere in the United States \nbecause we already have a facility to hold the detainees. We already \nhave a facility to try the detainees. It is all set up. I was there. I \nled a congressional delegation a couple of months ago. They are being \nhumanely treated, and if they are not, and if there are credible \nreports that they are not, then let's work on fixing Guantanamo Bay \nrather than moving the detainees to the United States.\n  If there are problems, let's fix them rather than just say we are \ngoing to change the name of the place and we are going to move the \ndetainees from Guantanamo Bay to Leavenworth. We are not going to \nchange the opinion of the world of the United States one iota by \nsubstituting the name ``Leavenworth'' for the name ``Guantanamo Bay,'' \ncreating a replica of what we already have at Guantanamo Bay, only \nsomewhere else. It would cost hundreds of millions of dollars we don't \nhave when we already have an $11 trillion debt, and it is growing at a \nrate of nearly $2 trillion a year. So why would we spend hundreds of \nmillions of dollars doing something that is not going to change world \nopinion, replicating a facility that we already have, that slows the \nprocess? This doesn't make any sense.\n  On top of that, what is being considered at Leavenworth would not \nwork. The fort at Leavenworth--if I could just talk to my colleagues \nabout this, and I hope they will look at the factual setting. Fort \nLeavenworth is one of the smallest Army bases we have around the world. \nIt is 8 square miles. It butts up in and is a part of an urban area of \nKansas City. It has on its border a river and a train that goes through \nabout every 25 minutes. It is not the secure facility one would need to \nhave for these detainees. We don't have any setbacks like we have in a \nnumber of other facilities, and it has one of the highest population \ndensities per square mile or square foot of any of our military bases \nbecause it houses the Command and General Staff College of the \nmilitary.\n  If I could just point out that facility to my colleagues--and I hope \nsome of them come and attend and address the Command and General Staff \nCollege. We get students from around the world on a regular basis at \nthat facility. Generally, some 90 countries at any one point in time \nhave students at the Command and General Staff College. Of these 90 \ncountries that send students for their Army training for their \nmilitary, half of those students will become general flag officers \nbefore their career is done. A number of them will become civilian \nleaders in their own country as well. So you get the cream of the crop \nfrom around the world. They come here. They also meet with our future \nmilitary leaders, and this is the training center they have. It is the \nCommand and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth.\n  The primary mission of Fort Leavenworth is that training as well as \nthat relationship and integration between our U.S. Army forces and \nforces of militaries, Army forces from around the world, which is \ncritically important when you go into places such as Pakistan or \nAfghanistan or you are working with the Jordanians or the Egyptians, \njust to name a few. They send leaders from all of those countries, \nfuture flag officers to Fort Leavenworth to be trained. We have already \nheard in canvassing students from Jordan, Egypt, and Pakistan that they \nwill pull their students from Fort Leavenworth if the detainees are \nmoved there. They don't want to have their military leaders, their \nfuture military leaders at the same place that the detainees are being \nheld in the United States, and they have already stated that to us.\n  So we are going to hurt the core mission of Fort Leavenworth in a \nfacility that doesn't have setbacks to safely handle this for no gain. \nI would point out that I spoke with the commanding general at Fort \nLeavenworth yesterday. I called him after I heard about this report on \nMS-NBC. That was how I got the news of it. My wife was on the Internet, \nand she was on MSNBC's Web site and she sees that they are thinking \nabout moving the Gitmo detainees to either Leavenworth or Michigan. \nThat didn't set very well with me, that that is how I learned about \nthis to start off with.\n  As I started calling around, I called the commanding general, and he \nsaid he learned about it pretty late as well and has difficulties, \nalthough he is a military man. He will salute and take orders and do \nwhat he is directed to do, but he is not--he needs to be asked and \nbrought in to testify about what his opinion would be about this issue. \nI talked to the Governor in Kansas last night. The Governor, a \nDemocratic Governor, has issued a statement previously opposed to this \nmove taking place to Fort Leavenworth. The Congresswoman from the area \nwas there this morning opposed to this move. The mayor of Leavenworth \nwas there opposed to this move.\n  We have voted in this body virtually unanimously--close to a \nunanimous vote--that you have to work with local officials before the \nGitmo detainees can be moved anywhere into the United States. Well, the \nlocal officials are uniformly opposed to this at Leavenworth, and we \nwake up and it is in the morning paper and nobody has been consulted \nabout it.\n  I wish to say the detainees in my estimation deserve appropriate \nhumane treatment. They deserve to be treated under our international \nobligations. If they are not getting that, then that needs to be \nchanged, and it needs to be changed at Guantanamo Bay. I hope we would \nhave international investigations to tell us what is not being met that \nwe are required to do, that is not being done. I have not seen any \ncredible international reports that say there are things we are not \ndoing that we should do at Guantanamo Bay. There is a gray category \nthat is involved where you have enemy combatants who don't represent a \nforeign country, and that is a big part of our problem. There is also a \nvery tough area, and that is--I saw this when I was at Guantanamo Bay--\na number of the detainees are continuing the fight\n\n[[Page S8655]]\n\ntoday. While in prison, at Gitmo, they continue the fight. So whoever \ngets these or takes these detainees is going to have to be prepared to \nhave the continuation of the war on terrorism happening near them and \nhappening in the prison facility. That is not everybody, but some of \nthem continue to fight in prison. That is going to be a difficult \nsituation for whoever is to handle it.\n  On top of that, our folks at Leavenworth--we have prisoners in there, \nand the town is proud of their ability to handle various prisoners. \nTheir concern is not keeping the detainees in, because you can staff up \nfor that, but it is keeping out people who seek to get in or make a \nstatement in that area. Plus, they would have to scale up their \nfacilities.\n  We have a medium-security Bureau of Prisons facility. It is not \nmaximum security. We have a dominated medium-security disciplinary \nbarracks there, and we have space for 25 maximum-security prisoners--\nonly 25. You would have to move out all of the current military \npersonnel convicted in military courts who are held in the disciplinary \nbarracks. We are not situated to handle this. It would cost a huge \namount of money, and it would not be safe to do it at Leavenworth. It \nis a bad idea for us to do that there.\n  I ask the President to come to Leavenworth. He was invited by the \nmayor this morning. He can look at the facility and examine it himself. \nThe Attorney General can come and examine the facility, look at it, and \nsee what estimation they come up with after examining and looking at \nthe facility. I understand they are looking at some sort of hybrid \nfacility. We don't have the situation to be able to house it in Kansas.\n  On top of that, I ask the President to really listen to the American \npeople. The American people don't want these detainees moved to the \nUnited States. They don't want to hurry up artificial timelines set for \nmoving the detainees to the United States, and they feel the President \nshould be listening to them and not to European leaders or somebody \naround the world who doesn't like the Guantanamo Bay facility and \nthinks it has a bad name. Listen to the American people on this issue.\n  I ask that the President come and talk to the Members of Congress who \nmay be impacted by this and ask our opinions and look at what is taking \nplace. This is being rushed. It is on an artificial time deadline. It \ndoesn't need to happen. It is replicating a facility we have, at a cost \nof hundreds of millions of dollars, and it will slow the process down. \nIt is a bad idea chasing a bad idea with an artificial time limit. I \nask that the President not do that.\n  My colleague and I from Kansas will fight every step of the way to \nkeep this facility from being moved to Kansas. We are representing our \nconstituents, who don't want these detainees moved to Kansas. We are \ngoing to fight it every step of the way.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I received a Statement of Administration \nPolicy from the Executive Office of the President relating to the \nAgriculture appropriations bill. I will read from that document at this \ntime:\n\n       The administration strongly supports Senate passage of H.R. \n     2997, with the Committee-reported text of S. 1406, making \n     appropriations for Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and \n     Drug Administration, and Related Agencies programs for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2010.\n       A strong, vibrant rural America is central to the Nation's \n     future. The bill, as reported by the Committee, makes \n     important investments in infrastructure so economic progress \n     does not bypass rural communities. The legislation also \n     provides the resources necessary to keep food and medicines \n     safe and reliable. It provides critical support for farmers \n     to continue the Nation's leading role in feeding the world. \n     In addition, this legislation addresses chronic problems \n     facing Americans, including poverty, nutrition, and housing.\n       Moreover, the legislation responds to the President's call \n     for investments in programs that work while ending programs \n     that do not. This legislation gives priority to merit-based \n     funding in critical infrastructure programs. The \n     Administration urges the Congress to continue to apply high \n     standards to funding decisions so taxpayer money is spent \n     efficiently and effectively.\n\n  Madam President, I am grateful that the executive branch has \nrecognized the good work done to craft this bill in a way that meets \nthe serious requirements of our country. Again, I thank the ranking \nmember, Senator Brownback, for his help. This is a good bill, and I \nurge all Senators to support its passage.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business for 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Sotomayor Nomination\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I rise today to talk about \nJudge Sotomayor's experience, and I also want to talk about empathy.\n  In the period since President Obama nominated Sotomayor, some of her \nopponents have done their best to give empathy a bad name. I think that \nis a shame. It would be sad for us to confirm Sonia Sotomayor but allow \nher empathy to be discredited as a human emotion and a judicial asset.\n  During his confirmation hearings, Clarence Thomas said:\n\n       What I bring to this Court, I believe, is an understanding \n     and the ability to stand in the shoes of other people across \n     a broad spectrum of this country.\n\n  Justice Thomas's description of empathy captures one thing Sotomayor \nwould bring to this Court: a diversity of experience and the ability to \nstand in the shoes of other people.\n  During her opening statement before the Judiciary Committee, Judge \nSotomayor talked about her experience as a prosecutor in New York for \nlegendary district attorney Bob Morgenthau. She said:\n\n       I saw children exploited and abused. I felt the pain and \n     suffering of families torn apart by the needless deaths of \n     loved ones. I saw and learned the tough job law enforcement \n     has in protecting the public.\n\n  According to those who knew and worked with her, Judge Sotomayor was \nan excellent prosecutor. She knew the law, she studied the facts, and \nshe did the hard work to keep people safe from crime. In this difficult \njob, she benefited from her empathy. Judge Sotomayor felt the pain and \nsuffering of families destroyed by crime. She felt the difficulties law \nenforcement officers face, and she understood that her job was not just \nabout enforcing the law, it was about ending the suffering crime \nbrings.\n  During her testimony, Judge Sotomayor talked about the ``Tarzan'' \ncase, a famous burglary and murder case she prosecuted. A quarter \ncentury later, she still feels deeply the impact of that crime. I was \nstruck by her description of how the murder of a son devastated the \nlives of his mother and grandmother, how one act of violence produced \nripples that destroyed a family and weakened a community, and how the \nfamily and the community demanded justice.\n  When I served as a Federal prosecutor, I learned that empathy is \nevery bit as important as legal knowledge and good judgment. A \nprosecutor who reads the facts of a crime and cannot empathize with \nthose involved is not just a strange person, he or she is likely to be \nan ineffective lawyer. A proper respect for the law demands a \nrecognition that individuals involved in a legal dispute are not \nabstractions; they are sons, daughters, sisters, and brothers, men and \nwomen who deserve justice. Empathy allows us to recognize that, and \nthat is essential to the practice of law. It is also an essential \nquality for judges.\n  Some Members of this body have suggested that empathy is inconsistent \nwith impartial judgment. I disagree. Judges must, first and foremost, \napply law to facts. But this process is not a mechanical calculation; \nit requires attention to the human impact of legal decisions. Legal \nreasoning that ignores\n\n[[Page S8656]]\n\nthe human dimension risks inhuman outcomes to human problems. Law \nwithout empathy produces decisions such as Dred Scott and Plessy v. \nFerguson. It gives you reasoned arguments and unreasonable results.\n\n  When the Supreme Court ruled in Dred Scott, its members were applying \nthe law to the facts as they saw them. One fact they took for granted \nwas that Dred Scott was so different as to be unworthy of legal \nprotections. The Taney Court could not put themselves in Scott's shoes, \nand the result was such a rebuke to the values of this Nation that it \nhelped drive us to civil war.\n  When the Court wrote in Plessy that ``the enforced separation of the \ntwo races [does not stamp] the colored race with a badge of \ninferiority,'' they were not misinterpreting the law. They just could \nnot feel the sting of segregation. Or to put it another way, they \nfailed to show empathy, and generations of Black citizens paid the \nprice.\n  Of course, a judge with empathy must also determine with whom to \nempathize. One of my colleagues has argued that empathy for somebody is \nalways discrimination against somebody else. Again, I disagree. I \nbelieve that justice is not a zero-sum game. Equal justice for \nminorities does not mean less justice for others. A judge who feels \ncompassion for those who face the legacy of codified bigotry is not \nless able to sympathize with a White firefighter who has been denied a \npromotion. The law respects the humanity of every individual. Judges \ncan and should do the same.\n  Judge Sotomayor has explained that her experience has helped her to \n``understand, respect and respond to the concerns and arguments of all \nlitigants who appear before me.'' All litigants.\n  As a prosecutor, Judge Sotomayor sympathized with the victims of \ncrime. But she could also look at a defendant and see a fellow human \nbeing--somebody who deserves fairness, if not freedom. As a judge, she \nhas ruled for civil rights claimants, and she has ruled against them. \nShe has ruled for prosecutors and for defendants. Her compassion has \nnot led her to come down on one side or the other. It has helped her to \nbe both wise and fair--to treat every individual with the respect he or \nshe deserves.\n  President Obama has nominated a Supreme Court Justice with a wealth \nof both personal and professional experience. Her experience has given \nher the intelligence to understand the law and the wisdom to apply it.\n  But it has also given her something more. Judge Sotomayor has seen \nhousing projects and Ivy League dorms. She has defended those whom \nsociety ignores and prosecuted those who ignore society's rules. At the \ntrial and appellate level, she has seen the human drama of American law \nplay out in countless ways.\n  This experience has given her compassion for the diverse experiences \nthat make up the American experiment. She understands in a deep and \npersonal way that we all deserve equal justice under law. I can think \nof no more important qualification for a Supreme Court Justice.\n  She has earned her right to serve on the Nation's highest Court. I \nlook forward to supporting her confirmation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 2253, as Modified, to Amendment No. 1908\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, we are attempting to work through \nsome amendments. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside so I may call up amendment No. 2253 on behalf of Senator \nChambliss, and the amendment be modified with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback], for Mr. Chambliss, \n     for himself and Mr. Harkin, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2253, as modified, to amendment No. 1908.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require a report on the status of the reorganization of \n  the Foreign Agricultural Service and future plans to modify office \n                              structures)\n\n       On page 85, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n       Sec. 7__.  Not later than 60 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Foreign \n     Agricultural Service shall submit to Congress a report that \n     describes the status of the reorganization of the Foreign \n     Agricultural Service and any future plans of the \n     Administrator to modify office structures to meet existing, \n     emerging, and new priorities.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, it is my understanding this amendment \nhas been cleared on both sides, so I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment, as modified, be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment No. 2253, as \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 2253), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Clean Energy Jobs\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, as I rise today, the world \nis engaged in a high-stakes competition. The country that wins this \ncompetition will not only produce jobs today, it will dominate the \nindustries of the future. The competition is the race to create clean \nenergy jobs. I want America to win, and the Congress will play a key \nrole in deciding whether we do.\n  But before I talk about the decision we have to make, I want to be \nclear about a decision that America does not have to make. We don't \nhave to decide whether clean energy will be the industry of the future. \nIt will. The clean energy industry is primed to produce millions of \njobs in the coming years. The question is whether these jobs will be in \nAmerica. We have to answer this question now.\n  If we put our minds to it, Americans can produce the clean energy \ntechnologies that will power the future. The country that invented the \nlight bulb, the automobile, and the Internet is not going to finish \nlast when it comes to developing new ideas. But we need policies that \npromote innovation. Right now, we are falling behind.\n  Progressive policies have given other countries a lead. With a \npopulation roughly one-quarter as large as America's, Germany has more \nthan twice as many workers developing wind energy and solar \nphotovoltaic technologies. By 2020, more Germans will be producing \nclean energy than are producing German cars. Spain has almost five \ntimes as many workers in the solar thermal industry as the United \nStates. China has more than 300 times as many. Do we want to lose this \nrace to Germany, to Spain, to China?\n  Some have argued that America cannot lead on climate change; that we \nneed to wait for countries such as China and India to act first. This \nwould be incredibly shortsighted. If America solves its energy problems \nfirst, every country on Earth will be begging for the technologies we \ndevelop. If we don't, we will be begging for technologies developed \nelsewhere.\n  Americans always prosper by being one step ahead. We mass produced \nthe car, and American manufacturing built the middle class. We sparked \nthe IT revolution, and our high-tech industry still gives us high-\npaying jobs. Today, being one step ahead means developing\n\n[[Page S8657]]\n\nthe clean energy technologies of the future before anybody else does. \nWaiting for China to address its emissions problems before we address \nours is like waiting for an opponent to finish the race before we start \nto lace up our shoes.\n  China is not waiting for America to act. It has already implemented \nstrong policies to promote clean energy. Chinese fuel efficiency \neconomy standards are higher today than ours will be in 2020. They have \nalready set a 15-percent renewable energy standard for 2020, and their \ngovernment recently said they could reach 20 percent. In 2009, China \nbecame the world's largest clean energy investor. It plans to spend \nnearly half a trillion dollars over 10 years to ensure clean energy \njobs come to China.\n  China's policies have already begun to pay off. It is now the leading \nmanufacturer of wind turbines and it has 65 percent of the world's \nsolar thermal water heating market. China even beats us in industries \nwe created. America invented solar photovoltaics, but China now \ndominates that market, while America comes in tenth.\n  I am not content to let other countries keep beating us at our own \ngame. It is time to act. The clean energy bill currently being \ndeveloped in Congress is the kind of action we need. It is a distinctly \nAmerican solution to this global problem because it relies on private \nmarkets and private businesses, and that is why it provides real change \nwith minimal cost.\n  Of course, some people will claim this plan breaks the bank. \nDefenders of the status quo never run out of excuses to do nothing. \nThey have made huge profits polluting our air, and clean energy is a \nthreat to them. The same people who denied the science of global \nwarming will tell you that a clean energy solution is too expensive. \nThey were wrong about the science then, and they are wrong about the \neconomics now.\n  In 1990, polluters told America we could not afford the Clean Air \nAct, a bipartisan bill signed by a Republican President. History has \nshown that the act actually cost one-fortieth of what they said it \nwould. The best independent estimate about this bill comes from the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, and they say it will cost \nAmericans less than 50 cents per day, and the CBO numbers likely \noverestimate costs. To keep their analysis simple, they ignore the \nimpact of increased efficiency. When you factor in efficiency, New \nMexicans will probably end up ahead about $4 per month on their energy \nbills, and low-income New Mexicans will save even more. The most \nexpensive energy policy America can pursue is the status quo.\n  In 2006, I introduced a clean energy bill similar to the bill we are \nconsidering now. The month I introduced it, gas prices were at about \n$2.25 per gallon. Critics claimed clean energy would drive up prices \nand Congress never acted. By 2008, the price of gas had nearly doubled \nto a high of $4.11.\n  Much of the money America spends on gas flows right out of this \ncountry. Today, the United States is importing nearly 70 percent of its \noil. We sent roughly $4,280 per U.S. family out of the country in 2008 \nto pay for oil, and too much of that money goes to individuals who \nfinance terrorism and regimes that don't like Americans.\n  Some will say the solution is increased oil production, and I support \nincreased production. My home State of New Mexico is one of 10 that \nproduces more oil than it consumes, and I am proud that we help meet \nAmerica's energy needs. But increased production alone is not enough. \nAmerica has only 3 percent of the world's oil reserves. More than 66 \npercent of those reserves--those that are left--are in Russia, Iran, \nand six other countries in the Middle East. The more we depend only on \nfossil fuels, the more American money will flow to these countries.\n  When it comes to energy, we have to do it all and we have to do it \nnow. Since comprehensive clean energy legislation was first introduced \nin 2003, we have sent trillions of dollars abroad every year to pay for \noil--in fact, $700 billion a year. We cannot afford 6 more years of \ndelay.\n  But the status quo doesn't just threaten our economy and our \nsecurity; it threatens the basis of our way of life. Scientists predict \nthat global warming could give my home State of New Mexico the same \nclimate as the Sonoran Desert in Chihuahua, Mexico. If that happens, \nfarmers who have worked the land for generations will be forced out of \nbusiness. Forest fires will become more common and more dangerous. Our \ncommunities will face a bleak economic future. For the children of my \nState and our country, we cannot afford to stay on this path.\n  Fortunately, America has what it takes to change course. Even without \nprogressive policies on the national level, New Mexico has begun to \ncreate massive numbers of clean energy jobs. Between 1998 and 2007, \nclean energy jobs grew 25 times faster than other jobs. We call these \nthe jobs of the future. Increasingly, they are also the jobs of today.\n  There are too many success stories to tell, but I want to mention \none. Three weeks ago, a company called Schott Solar opened its second \nrenewable technologies plant in Albuquerque, NM. The plant currently \nemploys 300 people, and it comes 2 months after the company opened a \nplant that will eventually employ 1,500. Schott decided to locate these \nplants in New Mexico after our State passed a series of clean energy \nincentives.\n  What I like most about this story is that Schott is a German company. \nIt looked at New Mexico's policies and decided to invest German money \nin creating American jobs. For years, while American policymakers \nfailed to act, American investors sent our capital to Germany. New \nMexico's forward-looking policies are helping to reverse the flow. What \nthat tells me is that with the right policies, America can lead the \nworld in this crucial industry. We can stop creating jobs in Saudi \nArabia and start creating them in Socorro, NM. We can stop letting \nChina develop our technologies and sell them back to us.\n  We can win the clean energy revolution the same way we won the high-\ntech revolution--by getting there first--or we can wait and watch the \nworld pass us by. I think the choice is clear. I hope my colleagues do \nas well, and I hope they will join me in supporting the Senate's clean \nenergy legislation when it comes to the floor.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1910\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I would like to take a few minutes \nthis afternoon to speak to an amendment to the agriculture bill that \nhas been introduced. This is amendment No. 1910. It has to do with the \nhigh energy cost grants. This is a program within the rural utility \nservice.\n  I would like to lay out for my colleagues a bit about this program. \nThe high energy cost grants are available for improving and providing \nenergy generation, transmission, and distribution facilities that serve \ncommunities with average home energy costs that exceed 275 percent of \nthe national average. So 275 percent of the national average--you have \nto see your home energy costs exceed this level in order to make \nyourself available to this High Energy Cost Grant Program.\n  These grant funds can be used for on-grid and off-grid renewable \nenergy projects, energy efficiency, and energy conservation projects \nserving these eligible communities.\n  Some have suggested this is somehow an Alaska aid program. It \ncertainly does help in my State, but it has provided aid to utilities \nin more than a dozen States, including Alabama, Arizona, California, \nFlorida, Hawaii, Idaho, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, New \nMexico, New York, and Washington. In addition to these States, \napplications have been submitted by other eligible communities in more \nthan eight States. This is in Colorado, Minnesota, Montana, North \nDakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Wyoming, and also out in \nPuerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa.\n  In addition, these are community-driven projects. They reflect the \nlocal priorities for addressing energy challenges. Some of the projects \nthat are\n\n[[Page S8658]]\n\ncurrently underway with these high energy cost grants are replacing \nfailing transmission and distribution lines that serve communities in \nmy State and in Arizona, Idaho, Maine, and Nevada.\n  As we think about how we are going to move our energy, particularly \nour renewable energy sources, we have to do more within our \ntransmission systems. This program allows us to replace our older or \nfailing transmission and distribution lines.\n  Some of the other projects extend electric distribution lines to \nconnect homes in rural communities in States such as Alaska, Arizona, \nCalifornia, and Washington, including some homes on Indian \nreservations.\n  The other projects replace old inefficient diesel generators in many \nof the remote Alaska villages with more efficient, less polluting \nunits, with heat recovery systems. These funds from the high energy \ncost grants go toward constructing community-owned renewable energy \nprojects, including wind and solar, small hydroelectric and biomass \nsystems. Again, the States where you see these projects are Alaska, \nArizona, Hawaii, Maine, New Mexico, New York, Washington, to the \nMarshall Islands.\n  The last area of the program provides cost savings, energy \nefficiency, and weatherization upgrades for rural homes and community \nfacilities in Alabama, Alaska, Florida Hawaii, Kentucky, and \nMassachusetts.\n  I go through this list of where these projects are to ensure that \nMembers know we are not just talking about a benefit to a State such as \nAlaska, where our energy costs are enormously high, but States such as \nAlabama, where they might not be facing the cold winters but they are \ncertainly facing the hot summers and how they, too, can be more energy \nefficient; how they, too, can benefit from programs that help to reduce \nthe high energy costs they face in their State.\n  This program has been one of the smartest things Congress has done \nsince the passage of the rural electrification programs back in the \n1930s. It has provided assistance to run modern power lines on Indian \nreservations, helped to propel economic activity where it is needed \nmost in this country. It has provided aid to towns off the interstate \ntransmission grid and a number of towns in the West that are isolated \nand not so connected to that grid, thus more subject to the blackouts \nand brownouts.\n  This program also motivated many States to step up their individual \nefforts to increase funding for these programs. In my home State of \nAlaska, despite the very dramatic decrease in revenues, we are \ninvesting tremendous resources toward energy solutions. In the State's \nfiscal year 2010 capital and operating budgets, they include $25.5 \nmillion for Alaska energy authority projects; $25 million for renewable \nenergy; $38 million for power cost equalization; and $26.4 million for \nheating assistance. That is a total of about $115 million in funding \nthat is coming from the State to help, alongside funding for the high \nenergy cost grants.\n  If funding sources continue to be eliminated or reduced, the Nation's \nefforts to address the high cost of energy by increasing energy \nefficiencies and renewable resource development are going to be \nseverely hindered. This is at a time when we can least afford to do \nthis.\n  This program has helped with installation of renewable energy \nsystems, whether it be solar or wind or hydro, biomass or geothermal \nprojects. These are generally financed through guaranteed loans. This \nis exactly in keeping with existing congressional intent and the intent \nof this administration to expand renewable energy and to reduce carbon \nemissions and greenhouse gas emissions and their potential climate \nimpacts. It has done so economically. The program has a 4-percent cap \non planning and administrative expenses. I wish all Federal programs \ndid this.\n  The program has an excellent track record. According to the \nCongressional Research Service, it has such a low default rate on its \nloans that the guarantee program has a zero subsidy cost; loans being \nsecured by the borrower's electric system and assets.\n  Earlier on the floor it was argued that this program is somehow \nduplicative of other existing programs, but it is not. The existing \nUSDA Rural Utilities Service Loan and Grant Program cannot make loans \nto school districts or to Indian reservations, such as the Navajo \nprojects that have been made in Arizona or to off-grid utilities. The \nprogram can only make loans for electricity programs, not for renewable \nenergy projects to tie into grids.\n  This is exceptionally important, the fact that the programs currently \ncan only make those loans to electricity programs and not the renewable \nenergy projects.\n  The program was authorized, the High Energy Cost Grant Program was \nauthorized by Congress back in the 2000 Rural Electrification Act, \nsimply because it covered a gap in existing programs that desperately \nneeded to be filled.\n  This amendment might not only kill this program in the future, but it \nalso might pull the rug out from under the projects that have expended \nfunds and which have started and which are waiting for the Federal \nfunds to be delivered.\n  This program actually lowers Federal unemployment and economic \nassistance costs over time because helping to reduce our energy costs \nis one of the best things we can be doing in government to support \nsustainable economic development in a State or in the region.\n  I certainly support the need for fiscal responsibility--absolutely, \nespecially given the size of our deficit. Cutting the High Energy Cost \nGrants Program is likely to not only lessen economic activity in rural \nareas but also worsen our overall economy and unemployment across the \nNation. There is no reason to delete the continuation of funding that \nis proposed for this program.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment when the time \ncomes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL.

There will now be 4 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the McCain amendment No. 1910.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, this amendment eliminates the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture's High Energy Cost Grant Program which is a \n$17.5 million subsidy that is designed to pay for energy generation \nsystems in rural areas.\n  The 2010 budget from the President of the United States and the \nOffice of Management and Budget have recommended a number of programs \nbe eliminated. Concerning this High Energy Cost Grant Program, it says:\n\n       The administration proposes to eliminate the High Energy \n     Cost Grant Program because it is duplicative of and less \n     effective than the Rural Utility Services Electric Loan \n     Program.\n\n  This recommendation by the administration to eliminate this program \nis because it is both duplicative and unnecessary and there is a $6.6 \nbillion program in electric loans at no cost to the taxpayer.\n  I recommend we agree with the President of the United States and \neliminate this unnecessary $17.5 million subsidy.\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I stand in opposition to this \namendment. The funds contained within this High Cost Energy Program are \ndesigned to improve energy generation, transmission, and distribution. \nThese are designed to do exactly what we are working so hard in this \nbody to do: to improve our energy generation, our transmission \nfacilities, our distribution facilities, and we are doing this through \na program where the qualifications in order to comply are you have to \nserve communities in which the average residential home energy costs \nare 275 percent of the national average.\n  There are 14 States across the country that have projects that focus \non these very high energy areas. We are trying to reduce our energy \ncosts for renewables and through the standard energy mechanisms but, \nquite honestly, when your energy costs are 275 percent above the \nnational average, it is pretty darn tough.\n  So these are funds made available to communities in the State of \nAlaska, but also communities in Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, \nIdaho, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Mexico, Washington, \nand the Marshall Islands, and it allows them to have energy at a more \naffordable cost.\n\n[[Page S8662]]\n\n  I urge defeat of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, this bill includes the programs the \namendment would strike. The Senator from Alaska has spoken eloquently \nand I believe correctly. So I do oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, in the ongoing debate on health care \nreform, it has become clearer and clearer that this is a competition of \ntwo very different philosophies of government. On the one hand, there \nare those who think government ought to be the primary sponsor of \nalmost everything, including our American health care system. These \npersons basically hope and fervently believe things would be better in \nthis country if only the Federal Government took control of more \naspects of our society.\n  The other approach is one that I have advocated. It is the philosophy \nheld by those of us who look at history and realize that government \ndoesn't run things very well. We believe government can and should set \nstandards, establish goals, and create incentives for the right \nbehavior, but we do not believe the Federal Government should run \nhealth care or, for that matter, is capable of running the American \nhealth care system.\n  The debate so far this year has been very instructive for this \nCongress and for the taxpayers. Here are some things we have already \nlearned as a result of the very thorough process we have gone through.\n  First, we know instead of saving money for our economy, as we were \npromised during the 2008 campaign, health care spending will actually \ngo up under the Democrats' proposal. This is true both short term and \nin the long run.\n  Second, we have been informed by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice that both the House and Senate bills would add to the Federal \ndeficit.\n  Third, according to a CBO letter, dated July 17, ``millions of \nAmericans would lose their private health care coverage if these plans \nare enacted, and millions more would be forced into a government \nplan.'' That is not me talking, it is the nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office.\n  Fourth, small businesses and other job creators will pay higher \ntaxes, including specifically $163 billion in penalties and $543 \nbillion in other taxes if the Democrats' plans are enacted.\n  Fifth, the provisions of these risky schemes could reduce job \ncreation. Again quoting the nonpartisan CBO:\n\n       The play or pay provision could reduce the hiring of low-\n     wage workers.\n\n  One has to wonder, if you are a job applicant out there in our \neconomy looking to earn a living, applying for a job, would you rather \nsee a Federal takeover of the health care system or would you rather \nhave a job? I think most American job seekers, given that choice, would \nsay: I want a job. Don't reduce my chances of getting that job.\n  Then we learned just a few days ago that the Medicaid provisions of \nthese proposals could amount to a massive cost shift to the States. The \noutcry against this has been loud and it has been bipartisan.\n  Here is what two-term Democratic Tennessee Governor Phil Bredesen had \nto say recently. He called the proposal ``the mother of all unfunded \nmandates.'' Governor Bredesen went on to say:\n\n       Medicaid is a poor vehicle for expanding coverage. It is a \n     45-year-old system originally designed for women and \n     children. It's not health care reform to dump more money into \n     Medicaid.\n\n  The words of Democratic Governor Phil Bredesen of Tennessee.\n  And Governor Bredesen is not an isolated example. At the National \nGovernors Association meeting in Biloxi, Gov. Brian Schweitzer, a \nDemocrat, said the legislation currently making its way through \nCongress would unfairly burden States. Here is some good advice from \nGovernor Schweitzer:\n\n       What we need Congress to do is cost control.\n\n  Cost control is something that would actually help in health care \nreform. I appreciate Governor Schweitzer calling for it. I am grateful \nto Governor Schweitzer for his honest assessment.\n  In fact, the American people owe a debt of gratitude to Democratic \nand Republican Governors for speaking the truth. These Governors may \nhave saved us from a catastrophe by speaking out and telling us what \nthe consequences are, as States struggle to meet their current \nobligations. Indeed, there is a great deal of bipartisanship emerging \non the issue of health care reform, and that bipartisanship is coming \nin the form of alarm--alarm about what the bill proposes to do to State \nbudgets, to small businesses, to job creation, and to choice in health \ncare.\n  We are also learning that when it comes to the discussion of the so-\ncalled public plan or public option, there is a great amount of bait \nand switch lurking about. Bait and switch is basically a form of fraud \nor trickery that, unfortunately, goes on in our economy. It is such a \nproblem that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission has issued guidelines \nwarning the public about this practice.\n  Here is a direct quote from 16 CFR part 238 entitled ``Guides Against \nBait Advertising.'' The FTC says this:\n\n       Bait advertising is an alluring but insincere offer to sell \n     a product or service which the advertiser in truth does not \n     intend or want to sell. Its purpose is to switch consumers \n     from buying the advertised merchandise in order to sell \n     something else. . . .\n\n  One thing is advertised and the other is attempted to be sold. I \nthink this is exactly what is going on in the debate over the public \noption. We are being offered the promise of genuine competition between \nthe public plan and private insurance plans when, in fact, the purpose \nis to switch Americans to a European-style, single-payer plan down the \nroad.\n  By now, it is abundantly clear that citizens of the United States do \nnot want to risk putting our country on a path toward a single-payer \nplan such as the ones in Canada or Great Britain.\n\n[[Page S8663]]\n\nAmericans do not want a single-payer system. The leadership of both \nparties, House and Senate, understands this fact. The American public \ndoes not want a wholesale government takeover of one-sixth of our \neconomy. We do not want waiting lists such as in Canada. We do not want \nrationing such as in the United Kingdom.\n  Realizing where public opinion is on this pivotal issue, the \nadvocates of these congressional Democratic plans have gone to great \nlengths to assure people they do not want a single-payer option either. \nThese reassurances have come from as high as the White House itself. \nJust last week in North Carolina, President Obama said:\n\n       Nobody is talking about some government takeover of health \n     care. . . .These folks need to stop scaring everybody.\n\n  I wish that were true. But with due respect to our Chief Executive, \nthere is a reason people are frightened. They are paying attention, and \nthey see that sponsors of this legislation are, in fact, advocating a \ngovernment takeover.\n  I found it interesting that just 1 day after the President's remarks, \nI turned on the news to see one of the most senior Democratic chairmen \nin the House of Representatives seem to contradict the President. Here \nis the exact quote from this leading Member of the House on the \nconsequences of a public option. He said:\n\n       I think if we get a good public option, it could lead to a \n     single payer and that is the best way to reach single payer.\n\n  I wonder what the Federal Trade Commission would say about that type \nof advertisement. To me, it says: Let's lure people into going along \nwith a public plan when we know it will eventually lead to a single \npayer down the road. I don't want to take that risk.\n  Another leading House advocate of the public option had this to say \nabout a path to a single-payer system:\n\n       This is a fight about strategy about getting there----\n\n  Meaning the single-payer option----\n\n     and I believe we will.\n\n  I think most folks would call this a classic legislative bait and \nswitch.\n  I recently ran across a blog from Dr. Michael Swickard of New Mexico, \ncautioning about this very tactic. Here is what Dr. Swickard said:\n\n       Given the track record of our government in bait and \n     switch, all of the promises of national health care are just \n     that--promises to be broken. Maybe there will be a few years \n     before the full impact of the bait and switch is felt by \n     citizens. But given the past actions of our government when \n     implementing programs, our future is clear.\n\n  I hope we can avoid that future for our country, but the writer's \npoint is this: It may take a while, but the pattern is there. The \nfuture he fears includes a single-payer takeover that very few \nAmericans would vote for today.\n  I say to my colleagues, there is much to be said about the ill \neffects of the health care proposals being put forward by the House and \nSenate committees. But among the most troublesome aspects of this so-\ncalled reform is the enactment of a public plan which will inevitably \nlead to a single-payer system Americans don't want and don't need.\n  Don't take my word for it on the cost, on the loss of choice, and on \nthe effect on small business job creators. Just read the words of the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. On the issue of massive, \nunsustainable cost shifting to State governments, don't take my word \nfor it. Listen to the experienced Democratic Governors pleading with us \nnot to go down this road. And when it comes to whether the goal of this \nwhole exercise is to move us to a European single-payer plan, it is no \nlonger necessary to heed the warnings of the political conservatives. \nWhen you listen closely, the leading advocates of the House and Senate \nlegislation, in their unguarded moments, are willing to admit that a \nsingle-payer government takeover is their ultimate dream. I hope we do \nnot go down that road.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield to my colleague from Vermont.\n\n\n          Amendments Nos. 2276 and 2271 to Amendment No. 1908\n\n  Mr. SANDERS.

Madam President, the Senate is considering the fiscal \nyear 2010 appropriations bill for the Department of Agriculture, rural \ndevelopment, the Food and Drug Administration, and related agencies. I \nthank our two managers, Senators Kohl and Brownback, for their hard \nwork on this measure.\n  The bill was reported by the Appropriations Committee more than 3 \nweeks ago on a bipartisan basis with all members voting in support of \nthe measure.\n  As my colleagues are aware, as the new chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee this year one of my goals was to increase transparency and \naccountability in the appropriations process. In many respects I have \nfollowed the lead of former Chairman Senator Byrd in this regard. To \nthis end, the Agriculture bill and report have been available on the \nInternet and in printed form for several weeks. All Members have had \nample time to review the material in this bill.\n  As the Senate considers this measure it will find a bill that will \nmeet our Nation's critical requirements to support agriculture and \nrelated programs which are vital to our economy and, frankly, our \nNation's livelihood.\n  Our Nation has been blessed with a wealth of natural resources which \nallows us to be the world's leader in agriculture. This bill offered by \nSenators Kohl and Brownback will help to ensure that we maintain that \nposition.\n  There is a total funding of $123.9 billion included in this bill, of \nwhich $23.05 billion is for discretionary programs, the same as the \n302(b) allocation. While this represents an 11-percent increase in \nfunding when compared with fiscal year 2009, not including supplemental \nspending, my colleagues should recognize that for too long funding for \nour Agriculture and Rural Development Subcommittee has been severely \nconstrained.\n  Even with this level of funding, the subcommittee has had to find \nsavings in farm programs to live within this allocation.\n  I very much thank our two managers for their work in preparing this \nbill. The Committee on Appropriations has offered its unanimous \nsupport. I believe the full Senate should do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/03/senate-section/article/S8663-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Madam President, I thank my colleagues this evening. I am \ngoing to momentarily turn to my colleagues from Iowa, Ohio, Vermont, \nand Rhode Island--all of whom participated with us nearly 3 weeks ago \nin the markup of our bill, the Affordable Health Choices Act, which \ntook up an inordinate amount of time, longer than I think any markup \ncertainly in the history of our committee, maybe the longest in the \nhistory of this body. We actually spent about 56 hours, 23 sessions, \nand 13 days on this bill. We considered just shy of 300 amendments, of\n\n[[Page S8664]]\n\nwhich 161 amendments were offered by our colleagues from the minority \nand contributed significantly and substantively to the outcome of that \nbill. They did not support the bill in the end, unfortunately, but any \ndefinition of ``bipartisan'' would have to include whether or not their \nideas were incorporated in any significant degree in this bill, and \nthey were. I am appreciative of their efforts.\n  I am particularly grateful to Senators Harkin, Murray, Whitehouse, \nand Brown for their contributions, along with others on the committee: \nSenator Sanders, who is here; Senator Mikulski played such an important \nrole; Senator Casey, Senator Merkley, Senator Bingaman, Senator Reed, \nSenator Hagan--all of whom contributed to the outcome of that \nlegislation.\n  We thought it might be worthwhile this evening to talk about exactly \nwhat is in this bill. We will be adjourning in a few days. We will be \ngone for a month. Unfortunately, during that month, nothing will happen \non this bill. But I think it is an important month to educate our \nconstituents and people across this country as to what is in this bill, \nwhat we are trying to accomplish with our reform efforts.\n  Senator Harkin led the effort on prevention in our committee. The \nSenator was asked by our chairman, Ted Kennedy--who, as we all know, is \nstruggling with his own illness, a brain tumor. We pray and hope he \nwill be back to work with us and to chair his committee. But the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa, along with Senators Mikulski, \nBingaman, and Murray, worked on various ideas. Prevention was the \nmatter in which Senator Harkin became an expert. He developed very \nsound ideas in our legislation to promote the improvement of prevention \nideas as part of our health care reform efforts. Senator Mikulski \nworked on quality. Senator Bingaman worked on coverage. Senator Murray \nworked on workforce issues, which are all so critically important. \nSenator Harkin brought to the committee his more than three decades' \nlong commitment to prevention and wellness. He is no newcomer to this \nissue. In a minute, I am going to ask him, if he would, to go into \ndetail about the prevention aspects of this bill and what is included.\n  People ought to know what we have done. I am so sick and tired of \nhearing about socialized medicine, government takeover--nothing but \nabsolute falsehoods about what is in this legislation and what we are \npromoting.\n  I say at the outset, if you like what you have, you get to keep it, \nchoose your doctor, hospital, choose the insurance program you have. \nWhat people don't have is a sense of stability and certainty that they \nare going to have the coverage they deserve if a crisis hits them in \nhealth care and that they will get the care they need. That is what \npeople are uncertain about today. So many millions of our fellow \ncitizens worry every night that the coverage they have and the coverage \nthey would like to have is unavailable to them because the costs are \nrising almost on an hourly basis, and they worry about their families.\n  Before I turn to my colleague from Iowa and my other colleagues, as \nwell, to share some thoughts with us, I made an announcement last \nFriday which has become quite well known--the fact that I have been \ndiagnosed with prostate cancer. It is in the very early stages. I am \nconfident the outcomes are going to be great and all is going to work \nout well. I have known about this since June when I was diagnosed with \nit and did what I could to learn all about prostate cancer and what \ntreatments and options will be available to me.\n  The point I want to make is this: When I discovered in June that I \nhad prostate cancer, I didn't lose a moment's sleep over whether I had \nthe coverage to pay for it. I didn't lose a moment's sleep as to \nwhether I have quality care. I am a Member of Congress. I have a great \nhealth care plan. I have great coverage. I never lost a moment's sleep \nover whether or not I would be able to access that coverage.\n  What bothers me is it should not just be me or Members like me in \nthis body. If every Member in this body had to go through what millions \nof Americans do every day, and that is wonder whether the quality is \ngoing to be there, the care is going to be there, maybe they would \nworry. But that is not the case. Our efforts over these days have been \nto try to bring, at long last, that sense of stability and certainty to \nour fellow citizens that we have in this body and that the other body \nhas and that thousands and thousands of Federal employees and others \nwho have good health care coverage have.\n\n  I am confident everything is going to be fine. That is not the point \nof bringing this up. The reason I bring it up is because too many of \nour fellow citizens lack the kind of security and stability that those \nof us who are here have. I hear my colleagues--some of them--say: Well, \nwe ought to wait a while longer. We can't afford to do this.\n  We can't afford not to do this. The cost to the average American is \nrising by the hour.\n  I had one insurance company in my State of Connecticut, a few weeks \nago, announce a 32-percent increase in premiums. They announced it \nright in the middle of this debate, to jack up those prices. Of course, \nit goes on all across the country. We have working families who are \nlosing their jobs, losing their homes, and we find that 62 percent of \npeople who are in bankruptcy are there because of a health care crisis. \nWe find 50 percent of the foreclosures that are occurring are occurring \nbecause of a health care crisis.\n  So my interest in raising this is to bring home the point that we \nhave an obligation, it seems to me, in this body, to address this \nissue; to do it carefully, do it well but to get the job done. We have \na President committed to that. Our leadership is committed to it. The \nmembers of our committee who have worked so hard are committed to it. \nAll we are missing is some folks willing to come to the table and help \nus resolve these matters in a way that will allow us to have some votes \nand decide whether to go forward with accessible, affordable, quality \nhealth care.\n  No one is talking about socialized medicine or talking about big \ngovernment-run plans. They use those words over and over and over \nagain. You ought to be suspicious when they have nothing else to say \nabout health care but scare tactics and fear. That is what they have \ndone day after day in this debate, and it is a disservice to the \nAmerican people to suggest that after 70 years, with millions of our \nfellow citizens uninsured or underinsured tonight, the only answer they \nhave to our health care problems is to wait longer, do nothing, and be \nscared.\n  What is more, if they were more serious about some of these issues, \nwe might be engaged in more of a significant debate. As I said, that is \nnot true for the 47 million without health insurance, the 30 million \nunderinsured in our Nation or the 14,000 in America who lost their \nhealth insurance today. Every day we wait, another 14,000 people lose \nhealth coverage. Since we marked up our bill--and we finished marking \nup our bill in that committee back 3 weeks ago this Wednesday--266,000 \npeople in the United States, more than a quarter of a million people, \nhave lost their health insurance. That is what has happened in less \nthan 3 weeks.\n  My hope would be that while we are going to debate this issue at home \nover the month of August, we would come back with a renewed sense of \ncommitment to getting this job done. But tonight, my colleagues and I \nwould like to spend a few minutes talking about what is in our bill, \nwhat we tried to do with this, how we tried to increase access, \nquality, as well as affordability.\n  I have heard my distinguished colleague from Iowa say on so many \noccasions--and I am confident he will probably say it tonight--we don't \nhave a health care system, we have a sick care system. I think he \ncoined the phrase in talking about it. I have heard him say it so many \nyears in this body, talking about what we need to do to develop sound \nhealth care programs. So I wish to thank my colleague and ask if he \nwould share with us his thoughts on this.\n  Is it not the case that chronic disease accounts for about 75 percent \nof our health care costs, and these are preventable diseases in our \ncountry, such as diabetes and heart disease, among other things? I \nwonder if my colleague from Iowa could take a moment or two to talk \nabout the cost savings achievable through increased prevention, not to \nmention what it means to individuals. It can lead to a longer life and \na\n\n[[Page S8665]]\n\nbetter quality of life. I thank him for his thoughts on the subject \nmatter.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank our chairman, the leader on this issue. Would the \nSenator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I yield to my colleague from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. First, I say to Senator Dodd, I heard all this talk about \nsocialized medicine. Socialized medicine. These are scare tactics. \nThere are a lot of scare tactics going on.\n  I was in my State over the weekend, and people were talking about \neuthanasia in the bill. We hear all this crazy stuff going on out \nthere, and I got to thinking about this. There is a lot of money on the \ntable. We spend $2.3 trillion a year, if I am not mistaken. There is a \nlot of money, and a lot of people have a vested interest in not \nchanging the system because they are making a lot of money. Obviously, \nwhat they are trying to do is scare people.\n  People elected us--and I think elected President Obama--to make some \nchanges in the way we do things, but there are a lot of vested \ninterests out there that don't want to change. There are a lot of scare \ntactics going on out there. They are unduly scaring people and \nobviously by people who don't want to change the system. They want the \nstatus quo.\n  The other thing I might say, as to all this talk about socialized \nmedicine, historically, when President Harry Truman first proposed a \nkind of national health insurance program, that is the issue that was \nraised in 1951, I think it was. I could be off a year. Maybe 1950 or \n1951 it was raised, when he was proposing this. The origins go back to \nan individual whose name I forget right now, but he was an advertising \nexecutive hired by the AMA at that time to stop Harry Truman's program. \nSo he came up and he coined this whole phrase ``socialized medicine.'' \nIt was picked up by then-Senator Robert Taft, and he kept harping on \nthe Truman program was socialized medicine. Well, that was in 1949-\n1950, I think it was, and here we are, all these many years later, and \nwe hear the same arguments coming up again. It wasn't socialized \nmedicine then and it is not socialized medicine now.\n  What we are trying to get is a system that is stable, that people can \nrely on, that they know is going to be there for them and that is \naffordable and gives them a quality health program--as my colleague, \nSenator Dodd, said--as we have. What we are trying to get for the \nAmerican people is the same kind of system all Federal employees have. \nWe are on the same system as your local postal employee in a small town \nin Connecticut or a small town in Iowa or somebody who works for the \nFarm Service Agency in the Federal Government. We are all on the same \nplan. We have a lot of choices, don't we? Every year, I think we get \n20-some plans to pick from. We sort of have an exchange out there, \nwhere every year, if we don't like what we have, we can go to something \nelse. Why shouldn't the rest of the American people have that kind of \naccess?\n  I spoke with a small businessman in Iowa last week. He has 12 \nemployees and spends 15 percent of his gross revenue on health care. He \nhas 12 employees, and one of his employees had a kidney transplant. \nAnother came down with cancer. In 2 years, his insurance premiums went \nup 100 percent. In 2 years. He has a $5,000 deductible, and he said he \nneeds some work done. He wanted to go in for a colonoscopy because he \nturned 50, but a colonoscopy costs $3,000. Well, that is out of pocket \nbecause he has a $5,000 deductible.\n  I am trying to get to my point of prevention. Because we know if he \nhas a colonoscopy and something happens, they can stop it. It is one of \nthe most preventable forms of cancer, this colon cancer, but it is one \nof the most deadly if you don't get it in time. So I asked Art: Why \ndon't you get a different plan? He said: I can't. We only have one in \nrural Iowa I can go to.\n  What we are trying to do is get more plans for people out there in \nsmall towns in Iowa, in Connecticut, and everywhere else so they do not \nhave to be stuck with one plan; they can shop around and get other \nplans.\n  He asked me if he could get on the public option plan that we have in \nour bill. I said: Sure. Small businesses such as you? Absolutely. That \nmeans he can get in a pool with everybody else around the country and \nreduce his costs. I just remembered that, and I remembered him talking \nabout trying to get a colonoscopy. This kind of gets to the nexus of \nwhat I wanted to talk about, briefly, which is the focus on keeping \npeople healthy.\n\n  President Obama said very clearly, when he addressed a joint session \nof Congress earlier this year, that we have to make a major investment \nin prevention and wellness because that is the only way we are going to \nkeep people healthy and reduce medical costs. Well, President Obama \ngets it. He understands we have to make a major new investment. That is \nwhat we have done in our bill--our Affordable Health Choices Act--which \nSenator Dodd so greatly led through our committee. We make a major \ninvestment in prevention and keeping people healthy.\n  My colleague is right. I started out saying we have a sick care \nsystem instead of health care. I started saying that in 1992; that we \nhave a sick care system, not a health care system. If you get sick, you \nget care, one way or the other. But there is not much there to try to \nkeep you healthy in the first place and to focus on prevention. Again, \nour bill has a very strong prevention provision in there.\n  Some ideas on what we have tried to do. The real health reform starts \nwith prevention, it does. If we don't do prevention and wellness, you \ncan jiggle the payment system all you want and you are not going to \nsave a dime, unless we start focusing on keeping people healthy in the \nfirst place. Is there support for that out there? Sure. The American \npeople get it. They understand this. They were asked: Should we invest \nmore or not invest more in prevention and wellness? Well, you can see \nthat 76 percent of the American people said we had to invest somewhat \nor strongly; invest more, 53 percent; invest somewhat, 76 percent; not \ninvest any more, 10 to 16 percent.\n  The American people get it. They get it. You can talk to anyone you \nwant about health care and ask them: Would you rather just have \nsomething that takes care of you when you get sick or would you rather \nhave more focus on keeping you healthy? I will tell you the response \nwill be: I want to stay healthy. People want to stay healthy. But in a \nlot of cases, they don't know how. There are not the support systems \nthere to do that.\n  Again, on saving some money; a lot of times we hear that: Oh, this \nwon't save money, and the CBO--Congressional Budget Office--doesn't \nscore it. But we asked voters. The poll question was: Will prevention \nand wellness save us money? Seventy-seven percent said yes. Yes, it \nwill save us money. Again, the American people get it, that we have to \nfocus more on prevention and health.\n  We have some problems with CBO. That is the Congressional Budget \nOffice, for those who don't understand the jargon around here. The \nCongressional Budget Office doesn't score us very well. Score means \nthey do not give us much savings when we invest in prevention and \nwellness. Well, I have gone over that with the Congressional Budget \nOffice, and the problem is they do not give a savings because they do \nnot give savings on what they call secondary savings. Secondary savings \nis what prevention provides. It saves you money from going to the \nhospital or getting sick. But they do not give us a good score for that \non savings. But do we have data on that? Do we know if it saves money? \nSure, we do.\n  This is from the Trust for America's Health. They did a big survey of \ncommunity-based interventions and for $10 per person, in 1 to 2 years, \nthey save $2.8 billion; 5 years, $16.5 billion; 10 years, $18.5 \nbillion. That is just $10 per person, and that is just community \nprograms. So we address the whole gamut. We address the community-based \nprograms and the clinical-based programs.\n  For example, what we do in our bill is we set up an investment fund \nto do a number of different things. Let me give one example. We are \ngoing to train health professionals in how to work with prediabetic \nindividuals, people who have tested high, who look like they are \nprediabetic. We will train them to work with them to manage their \ncondition, to get them on the proper diet, to manage them as they go \nalong. What is so important about that? Well, what is important about\n\n[[Page S8666]]\n\nthat is that right now, for example in Medicare, Medicare will pay \n$30,000 to amputate your foot if you have diabetes. They will not \nreimburse one cent for nutrition counseling before so you don't get \ndiabetes. But they will pay for nutrition counseling after you get \ndiabetes. That doesn't make any sense.\n  Right now, the cost of diabetes in our society is $174 billion a \nyear. That is $174 billion a year on diabetes. Well, it doesn't take a \ngenius to figure out that if we can get hold of people who test \nprediabetic and get them on a well-managed program so they do not come \ndown with diabetes, we will save money. But the Congressional Budget \nOffice doesn't score that as any savings.\n  So at the clinical level we will do that. We will reimburse, for \nexample. There will be a reimbursement for cancer screenings, for \nsmoking cessation, nutrition counseling, colorectal screening. There \nwill be reimbursements for that, and you will not have to pay any \ndeductibles or copays. So for my friend who is now facing $3,000 for a \ncolorectal screening, this will not cost him anything. No copays, no \ndeductibles, and the insurance company has to reimburse for that.\n  Again, if we catch these things early, it is just like mammogram \nscreening. We know if we get breast cancer early, it is curable. Again, \nlet me say something that is public. The mayor of Cedar Rapids is a \nwoman. I was in Iowa this weekend, and it was announced she has breast \ncancer. She went in today for a small surgery, and she will be back to \nwork tomorrow because they got it early.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield at this point, again, because I \nam exhibit A. I had an annual physical this year. At my annual \nphysical, my PSA score spiked--shot up. That was a signal to the \ndoctors that maybe something more serious was happening.\n  They decided a biopsy was appropriate. A biopsy showed I had cancer. \nBut I had the annual physical, which my health care plan pays for. If \nyou don't have a health care plan, that physical can be very expensive, \nso people don't get their annual physical. Prostate cancer is the \nslowest growing form of cancer, it is the easiest to manage. If you \nhave to have cancer, it is the best one to have. If you have to have \none, that is the best one--if you catch it early. A number of our \ncolleagues have had prostate cancer. But the important thing, as my \ncolleague pointed out, is to have an annual physical, get the \nscreening, and detect it early. I will be able to deal with this, and I \nam told I will have a very healthy life for many more years to come.\n  If I had gone years without detecting this and it migrated or \nmetastasized into my lymph nodes or bones, I could be in serious \ntrouble. Spark Matsunaga, our former colleague from Hawaii, died of \nprostate cancer. John Kerry, our colleague, his dad died of prostate \ncancer. Thirty thousand people a year die of prostate cancer, because \nthey never caught it. That is what screening does. That is why what you \nare saying has such value.\n  (Mr. MERKLEY assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate the Senator saying that, and that is why we \nhave to have more focus on this prevention and getting people in for \nearly screenings. If you get it early, you are cured. We know that. So \nwe want to remove any of the obstacles people have going in and getting \nscreening.\n  Again, the Congressional Budget Office says they cannot figure out \nthe savings. I said: Why don't you go look at Pitney Bowes. It is a big \ncompany, 200-some thousand employees, scattered all over the United \nStates--\n  Mr. DODD. Headquartered in Connecticut.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I didn't know that. Pitney Bowes, and their CEO, Mike \nCritelli, went on a big program of wellness and prevention for all \ntheir employees. I think they called it Health Care University or \nsomething such as that. Here is what they found.\n  They found, through their wellness and prevention program, they \nreduced their number of hospitalizations for all their people by 38 \npercent--38 percent. Think of the savings. They reduced their \ndisability payments and claims by 50 percent, just through their \nwellness and prevention programs.\n  Again, this will save us money. It will make people healthier. Not \nonly that, I say to my friend, just the productivity level--people will \nwork harder, they will work better when they are healthy and they are \nwell.\n  One other thing I wish to mention. We have a fund in the prevention \ntitle of the bill that will increase over the years to a significant \namount of money. People say: What are you going to use that money for?\n  Right now at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for \ncardiovascular disease prevention and heart disease prevention, the \ncurrent funding is $50 million for all States. That is barely enough to \neven print a pamphlet to get information out to people--$50 million for \ncardiovascular disease. Yet angioplasties alone and bypasses, we spend \nover $90 billion a year--just on those two items. But if they are \ncaught early and if there are prevention programs out there, we can cut \nthose down.\n  You mentioned diabetes. Right now diabetes costs us $174 billion a \nyear--for diabetes. So the current funding is $62 million a year for \ndiabetes prevention and control in the entire United States.\n  Arthritis, the current funding is $13 million. For nutrition, \nphysical activity and obesity, right now $42 million is all we spend \nthrough the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention--$42 million a \nyear.\n  You get my point. My point is, we are not focusing enough on \nprevention and wellness. That is what this bill does.\n  I thank our chairman, I thank Senator Dodd for his great leadership. \nThat is what people have to understand. In our bill, we have defined \nwhat we want to do on prevention and wellness. Frankly, I think we had \ngood support on both sides of the aisle for that. I think the American \npeople support putting more emphasis on keeping people healthy.\n  Andrew Weil, Dr. Andrew Weil has come out with a new book, ``Why Our \nHealth Matters.'' One of the things Andrew Weil pointed out to me a \nwhile ago--he said the natural state of the human body is to be \nhealthy. It is in our DNA. Our body wants to be healthy. Yet everything \nwe do lends itself to be unhealthy. We have to do things to make it \neasier to be healthy and harder to be unhealthy. Right now we do the \nopposite. It is easy to be unhealthy and hard to be healthy--especially \nafter you find you have to make all these copays and deductibles. There \nis not much out there if you are prediabetic. Where do you go to get \nthe kind of counseling and help you need so you don't get diabetes? I \nsuppose if you have a lot of money you can probably do it, but for the \naverage person, they have no idea where to go.\n  The last thing I might mention, I say to Senator Dodd, also in our \nappropriations we have, and we hope we get some more in other bills, \nbut: workplace wellness programs, to buttress what Pitney Bowes and \nSafeway and others have done in that area.\n  For this bill, it is key to reducing costs and changing the structure \nof health care in America. I am grateful for my colleague's leadership \nin pulling this together and making sure in this bill we have a very \nstrong investment in prevention and wellness.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague, Mr. President. Before I turn to \nSenator Brown and Senator Whitehouse--and there are a lot of things to \ntalk about in the work Senator Harkin and the committee did on \nprevention--one of the great successes in this bill is a matter he \nworked out with our friend and colleague from New Hampshire, Judd \nGregg. You mentioned Pitney Bowes and Safeway. The Presiding Officer \nis, of course, a member of our committee as well and will recall this \nconversation. But the amendment we worked out will allow for companies \nto reduce by as much as 50 percent the premium costs of employees who \ndecide to take personal responsibility for improving their health care: \ngetting involved in smoking cessation programs; those who can lose \nweight will go on programs to take that poundage off.\n  I will never forget Steve Burd, the CEO of Safeway, telling us that \nfor every pound a person who could lose weight loses in a year, it is a \n$50 savings in premium costs--for every 1 pound. Think about what that \ncan mean in terms of not only a healthier employee but also bringing \ndown that cost of health care, not to mention, of course, that person \nis less likely to contract diabetes or related problems.\n\n[[Page S8667]]\n\n  You get a cost savings, you get a healthier person, you get a more \nproductive worker. That language exists in this bill because of what \nTom Harkin did with Judd Gregg on a bipartisan basis to make this a \nbetter and stronger bill. I commend the Senator and thank him for it.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I see our colleagues from Ohio and Rhode \nIsland are here.\n  Mr. BROWN. I yield to Senator Whitehouse.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask my distinguished colleague from Iowa a question \nabout prevention because it strikes me, if you are a community health \ncenter and you want to invest in a health prevention strategy that will \nhelp the community you serve have healthier lives and therefore lower \nthe costs to the system for everyone--you put out the money for that \nprogram if you are the community health center, you have to staff it, \nyou take all the risks, you do all the work, and yet the benefit of \nwhat you have done doesn't come back to you. It goes to private \ninsurers, it goes to the Federal Government, it goes to patients and \nbetter health. But it makes it a very unfortunate business proposition \nfor anybody who is doing this on their own, which suggests this is an \nimportant place for the Federal Government to invest because the \nmarket, by itself, will not take care of this because you invest and \nyou don't get it back. You invest and it goes to the insurance company. \nYou invest and it goes to Medicare.\n  I know Senator Brown wishes to make some statement. I wish to make \nthat point because Senator Harkin's work has been so important on this, \nand I think that is an important thread.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my colleague. I think that is a very good point.\n  Mr. BROWN. I appreciate the leadership of Chairman Dodd and Senator \nHarkin on the whole bill. Senator Harkin has led the way on prevention. \nSenator Whitehouse and I worked together on writing the public option \nwhich provides a choice--not any government mandates, not as the other \nside would like to create, this fear in the public that it is going to \nlead to single payer.\n  Also, I thank the Presiding Officer for his work on tobacco and other \nissues on the HELP Committee too.\n  I listened as we began this evening. Before Senator Dodd spoke, we \nheard from a colleague, a Republican colleague from the South, from \nMississippi, I believe. We heard over and over all these scare tactics, \nall the kinds of words they use about single payer, about government \ntakeover, about socialized medicine. It just serves to scare the \npublic, to confuse the public.\n  What they have done especially is trying to scare senior citizens \ninto thinking we are going to do something to their Medicare, require \nthem to come in and not just have a living will but have a plan on how \nthey are going to die. Some of the things they are saying are \nabsolutely amazing.\n  I wish to kind of cut through that for a moment because I know we \ntend to use words--we talk about exclusivity and single payer and the \ngateway and the exchange, all these words we use around here. I wish to \ncut through that. I wish to share tonight, as I have every night we \nhave been in session for the last week or so, some letters I have \ngotten from people in Ohio. I know the Presiding Officer gets these \nfrom Portland, OR, and Eugene and Senator Dodd gets these from West \nHartford and New London and New Haven and I know Senator Whitehouse and \nSenator Harkin get letters such as these from their States. But this is \nthe reason we are doing this health care bill. This is the reason we \nhave worked hard, doing our jobs, as we should, to pass legislation \nthat will protect what works in our health care system and fix what is \nbroken.\n  We know many people want to keep their health care plans that they \nhave. If they are satisfied and want to keep them, we want to help them \nkeep them, but we want to build some consumer protections so they \ncannot be denied care when they call their insurer when they need a \nhealth care treatment; so they can't be discriminated against; they \ncan't have a community rating system gamed. That is what people have \nseen. So if you have your own health insurance and are happy with it, \nwe want you to keep that, but we want some consumer protections around \nit.\n  This bill is full of assistance for small business that works so very \nhard to help people, small businesses that want to insure their \nemployees but often cannot afford it. This bill will work so well to \nencourage and assist people who want health insurance to get that \nhealth insurance.\n  Let me stop talking, except to read a few of these letters I have \nreceived in the last few days.\n  Jon, from Franklin County--central Ohio, Columbus area--writes:\n\n       I am a self-employed 28-year-old with Type I diabetes. \n     After being denied coverage by many health insurance \n     companies, the only plan I could find charged outrageous \n     monthly premiums.\n       After having a policy for 5 months, the insurance company \n     increased my monthly premium by another $100.\n       It is vital I have health insurance. I was diagnosed with \n     Type I diabetes at age 12, and I have taken very good care of \n     my health with diet and exercise.\n\n  As Senator Harkin talks about.\n\n       I didn't ask for this disease but ask you to vote for \n     reform--especially the public insurance option.\n       We need realistic premiums and choices without penalties.\n\n  That is what the public option does. If you don't have health \ninsurance or you have inadequate insurance or insurance you are \ndissatisfied with, you can go into what is called this exchange. You \nhave a choice, a menu of options. You can go with Aetna or with an Ohio \nmedical mutual fund, mutual company, or you can go with the public \noption. Nobody forces you to do anything, but providing you a wide \nrange of options will give you much better insurance than you might now \nhave if you are dissatisfied.\n  Thomas from Knox County, a Navy veteran--that is about 25 miles from \nwhere I grew up, in Mansfield:\n\n       I would like to urge you to support health care reform that \n     includes a public insurance option. While private insurance \n     is adequate in many cases--\n\n  Thomas, the Navy veteran, writes--\n\n     there are far too many instances where private insurance is \n     denied or is inadequate to meet the needs of the insured.\n       A neighbor of mine, a retired minister, was forced to sell \n     his home and move in with his son after battling cancer and \n     having tremendous debt as a result. And he was insured.\n\n  We know how often that has happened. As Chairman Dodd has pointed \nout, people who so often have declared bankruptcy because of their \nillness often had insurance, but their insurance had lifetime caps. One \nof our consumer protections we are building into the health care system \nwith this bill is no more lifetime caps so people can get the insurance \nthey thought they had, can get the coverage they thought they had.\n  Why we would allow, in this country, that a retired minister has to \nsell his house and has to move in with his son because the insurance he \nhad when he got seriously ill would not cover his illness?\n  What does that say about our failures in the past in enacting health \nreform?\n  Thomas from Knox County, a Navy veteran, says:\n\n       Please do not vote for any plan that would only fatten the \n     wallets of the insurance and drug industry without \n     significantly fixing the problem for the average American \n     citizen.\n\n  What Thomas is talking about is what has happened in this body and \nwhat happened in the other body, where I was a Member, 5 years ago when \nthe Bush administration pushed through a Medicare plan that betrayed \nthe middle class. It was a plan that the drug companies wrote, the \ninsurance companies wrote. It was a Medicare plan that simply did not \nwork for the middle class. It worked very well to fatten the wallets, \nas Thomas said, of the drug and insurance companies.\n  Let me share a couple more.\n  Lia from Miami County writes:\n\n       Recently our daughter graduated with her masters degree and \n     was ready to join the workforce. Last summer between \n     semesters she had major back surgery. We are so proud that \n     along with her recovery, she managed to carry her full \n     curriculum with great grades. But she developed complications \n     and subsequently endured three surgeries and 2 weeks in the \n     hospital.\n       Her student health insurance expires at the end of July. \n     During her recovery, she was not able to search for a job and \n     has been denied from multiple insurance carriers due to her \n     preexisting conditions. We are now faced with additional \n     medical expenses and no insurance coverage.\n\n[[Page S8668]]\n\n       I fully understand the need for healthcare reform to assist \n     those who are facing the same issues that we are with our \n     daughter. Please stand up for those in Ohio and other states \n     that are doing their best to create a better life. Please \n     support healthcare insurance reform with a public and a \n     private option.\n\n  She understands we want both. A public option will, frankly, make \nprivate insurance companies more honest. Private options help make the \npublic option work better too. It will make it more flexible, and it \nwill make it respond better to market conditions. Having them compete \nwith each other will work for Lia from Miami County, from Piqua, or \nTroy, that area of the State north of Dayton.\n  The last letter I would like to share is from Mary from Cuyahoga, \nfrom the Cleveland area:\n\n       Please, please, please, do whatever you can to get the \n     healthcare reform bill through Congress this year, and stop \n     the insanity we are experiencing now. My husband and I are \n     retired. He has had diabetes for the past 28 years. Thank God \n     for Medicare. But he is part of the doughnut hole generation.\n\n  What that means is, again, what happened 5 years ago when the Bush \nadministration pushed their partial privatization of Medicare through \nthe House and through the Senate, the bill that was written by the drug \ncompanies for the drug companies, the bill that was written by the \ninsurance companies for the insurance companies, it simply did not \nprovide senior citizens who had high drug expenses with their drug \nbenefits. There was something called a doughnut hole where people \nsimply lost the coverage for which they were paying.\n\n       My husband has now reached the limit of the payments that \n     Medicare will make on his medications. Now he has to spend \n     thousands of dollars out of his pocket to stay healthy. Why \n     would you pay for only a half year of his medications? What \n     is he supposed to do the rest of the year? Hope for the best?\n       My husband had taken charge of his health through better \n     diet and exercise. Yes, we need to take responsibility for \n     our health, especially a disease such as diabetes, but we \n     need healthcare that will help when all of our efforts fall \n     short and illnesses take over. Please vote for healthcare \n     reform.\n\n  All of us get letters like this every day. Thousands of these letters \nare sent to the Capitol every single day from people who are \nstruggling. Most of these letters, I have found, come from people who \nhave had health insurance, they have lost it because of a preexisting \ncondition, they have seen it fall far short of what they were promised \nbecause they had a very expensive illness, or they have sometimes seen \ntheir health insurance go away because they have lost their job.\n  In every one of these cases I have read tonight, in every letter I \nhave read, the dozen or so, couple dozen letters I have read here on \nthe floor of the Senate, in every single one of these cases the \nlegislation that those of us--Senator Whitehouse and Senators Harkin \nand Dodd and the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Oregon, Mr. \nMerkley--the legislation we wrote will take care of this. It will \nprotect what works in our system. It will fix what is broken. It will \ngive people who already have their insurance and are satisfied with it \nmore consumer protection so they can keep their insurance they are \nsatisfied with. It will give those who do not have insurance an \nopportunity to buy decent health insurance, with a public option, if \nthey so choose, or to go to a private insurance career.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague and thank him for making that \ncontribution on so many points, particularly on the public option. As \nour colleague from Ohio has pointed out, and some may find it somewhat \nalarming--but the whole idea of competition is about as basic in \nAmerica as any I can think of. The idea that people can have choices \nout there is something we cherish in this country.\n  In fact, what exists today in so many case is the lack of choice. I \nlistened to my colleague from Iowa talk about western Iowa, rural Iowa, \nwhere you only get one or two choices. In the State of Virginia, almost \n70 percent of all insurance is written by two companies in the entire \nState--two companies in the entire State of Virginia. That is not \nuntrue in most places. I cannot speak specifically State by State, but \nit is not uncommon that in many areas the choices are very limited. So \ntoday, for most Americans, the ability to shop for the best health care \nplan that serves their needs and the needs of their families is very \nlimited.\n  What is being discussed here is not a subsidized plan, not taxpayer \nsubsidized in any way, but a plan that would offer an option, a safety \nnet in many cases, probably for some kind of illness that can afflict \nsomeone, which most people worry most about that could ruin them \nfinancially. It is a pretty straightforward kind of a plan that would \nprovide some basic coverage, at a competitive price, a nonprofit \noperation that would take the element of profit out. I know that may be \nintimidating to people, to have someone out there competing with an \nidea. If it is not a good plan and people don't like it, they will not \ngo to it, in which case it will not work very well. If it is a well-\ndrafted plan that does what many would like it to do, it might just \nhave the effect of bringing down the cost in a competitive environment.\n  I mean, under a capitalistic system, competition is what contributes \nto price fairness. If one company controls the whole game, or two do, \nyou get a predictable result--price fixing--and you pay an awful price \nas a consumer, whether you are buying shoes or automobiles or any other \nproduct or service.\n  So the idea of injecting a level of competition--I find it somewhat \nironic that our Republican friends are frightened of this idea. I \ntraditionally think that all of us embrace the free enterprise system \nas providing the best results for our country throughout 200 years of \nhistory. Why in the 21st century should that be any different from the \n20th or the 19th century, where competition helped produce the \ngreatness of this country?\n  I appreciate the Senator from Ohio today raising the point about the \nvalue of injecting some competition. We all know ultimately that could \nhave the desired effect of bringing down those costs and making \ninsurance or health care coverage more affordable. At some point, I \nhope someone might explain to me why competition is a bad idea. I \nthough quite the contrary, and it is almost un-American to suggest that \nwe ought to make this a noncompetitive environment, that everything \nelse ought to be competitive but not health care. It seems to me that \nquite the opposite ought to be the case.\n  I see my colleague from Rhode Island here, who made a significant \ncontribution in crafting the public option and the very public option \nthat was praised by the so-called Blue Dogs in the House, the more \nconservative Democrats in the House who were reluctant to be supportive \nof that specific health care package. But to their great credit, they \ntook a good look at what we had created in our bill on the public \noption, and they were so impressed by the work done by our committee--\nspecifically, our colleagues from North Carolina, Senator Hagan, \nSenator Brown from Ohio, and Senator Whitehouse from Rhode Island, who \nwere the principal authors of this provision in our bill--that the \nHouse Blue Dogs insisted that this language be incorporated in part of \ntheir health care effort in the House. I thank my colleagues from Rhode \nIsland and Ohio and Senator Kay Hagan from North Carolina for their \nwork in this regard.\n  Possibly my colleague from Rhode Island would like to talk about that \nor some other aspect of this bill.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I would be delighted to talk about that. But the \nfirst thing I would like to do is react to a point the distinguished \nchairman has just made regarding how ironic it is that some of our \nfriends on the other side are so opposed to increasing competition in \nthe insurance industry. One of the things that is particularly ironic \nis that a great number of our colleagues on the other side go home to \ntheir home States to a health insurance system that already is a public \noption for their business community, their workers' compensation \nsystem.\n  The two places you get health care are from the general health \ninsurance marketplace and from the workers' compensation marketplace. \nYou can get workers' compensation coverage, and it will cover small \nworkplace injuries, it will cover catastrophic workplace injuries, it \nwill cover temporary conditions, and it will cover lifetime chronic \nconditions. It has all of the elements of health insurance coverage and \nthe need for it.\n\n[[Page S8669]]\n\n  Well, when our colleague from Wyoming, the distinguished ranking \nmember of the HELP Committee, goes home to Wyoming, he goes home to a \nsingle-payer public option for workers' compensation health insurance. \nSo it can hardly by anathema to have a choice public option.\n  The distinguished gentleman, Senator McCain, who was the Republican \ncandidate for President, goes home to Arizona to a competitive public \nplan providing workers' compensation health insurance in his home \nState.\n  The Republican leader himself, Senator McConnell, goes home to \nKentucky, to a State where there is a public plan that delivers health \ninsurance, a competitive public plan. And I suspect his employers like \nit and the people are comfortable with it.\n  Our colleague, Kay Bailey Hutchison, is shortly to go home to Texas \nto run for Governor. When she does, she will go home to a State that \nhas a competitive public plan that delivers health care through the \nworker's compensation system.\n  Our distinguished friends in Utah, Senator Bennett and Senator Hatch, \nwho have done so much work on health insurance issues over the years, \ngo home to Utah, where their business community has a competitive \npublic plan for delivering health insurance.\n  So, in addition to the irony of being against competition, their \nbusiness communities, I believe, are highly favorable to a public plan \nthat competes in the market to deliver health insurance that the \nbusiness community funds, the workers' compensation health insurance \nmarket. So I guess ironies abound here.\n  I would also like to compliment Senator Brown for keeping it real \nhere on the Senate floor and reading those letters and reminding us \nthat when push comes to shove around here, it is not the nametags and \nthe labels that matter, it is not ``socialized medicine,'' it is not \n``government takeover,'' it is people who have real problems.\n  I was struck by a letter that was brought to my attention today. I do \nnot know exactly what day it came in, but I saw it today. A working \ncouple with a son, sort of the ideal American family, doing nothing \nwrong, doing everything right, playing by the rules, working hard. The \nson becomes grievously ill, has a very grave illness. Over the years, \nhis condition worsens, and ultimately his disease takes his life. They \nwere insured through this whole period, but the insurance was not \nenough. There were copays, there were limits, there was cost sharing. \nAs a result of all of this, they are deeply in debt. They had to take \ntime off work and spend time caring for him, and so they have had \nemployment issues.\n  Now, this is, again, sort of the ideal American family. They are both \nworking hard. They have a son whom they love. They are doing everything \nright, and they are playing by the rules. And because he got sick and \nbecause our health insurance system is such a nightmare for a family in \nthat situation, they have lost their son, they have lost their savings, \nand they are about to lose their home. They are about to be put out of \nthe house that has all of the memories of their son.\n  You know, there are people for whom this is very real, and we have to \nkeep our eye on that ball and not on all of the smoke and all of the \nfear mongering that is happening around here. A lot of that smoke and \nfear mongering is happening around our public plan.\n  Well, it is not that complicated. It is competitive. It is fair. It \nhas no special subsidies for people who are in that plan versus in \ncompeting private plans. It has no special advantage. And it honors \nPresident Obama's programs and the promise of all of the Presidential \ncandidates that if you like the plan you have, you get to keep it. You \nare not forced out of anything.\n  So if it has no special advantages, if it has no special subsidies, \nwhy do we support a public option? Why is it better? Well, I would say \nthat there are three reasons we can have some confidence that a public \noption will make a difference for the kind of people Senator Brown was \ntalking about, the family I was talking about, people who suffer \nthrough our existing health care system.\n  The first is, a public plan does not need to take profit out of the \nsystem.\n  In 2007, in Rhode Island, one of our insurers, United Health Care, \nasked permission to remove $37 million as its profit in that year from \nRhode Island back to its home headquarters. My State isn't as big as \nOhio. It is not as big as Iowa or Connecticut. It is a small State. It \nhas a million people. In one year to take $37 million out of that \nState, when they only had a 16-percent market share, think of that. A \n16-percent market share in a State of a million people is about 160,000 \nfolks they cover, assuming that everybody had coverage; $37 million out \nof those 160,000 people in 1 year gone for profits.\n  Stop doing that. Stop paying exorbitant salaries such as United \nHealth Care's chief executive who got $124 million in salary. That is a \nlot of money that could go back into other things in health care. That \ncould help families either get better coverage or pay lower premiums. \nSo there is one thing--no profit, no excess cost.\n  The second is, you could have better dealings between insurers and \nproviders and hospitals than we have right now. Fifteen percent of our \nhealth care costs from the insurance side goes to overhead and \nadministration. Most of that goes to denying claims and making life \ndifficult for providers, doctors, and hospitals, when they submit their \nbills. There is a war, a claims war going on right now between the \ninsurance industry and doctors and hospitals. And 15 percent of what we \npay for health care gets burned up on the insurance company side of \nthat war. The insurance companies are bigger and smarter, and they set \nthe rules. So you can bet that the doctors' side of responding to that \ncosts more than 15 percent.\n  In fact, the Lewin Group has estimated that 36 percent of a \nprovider's overhead cost goes to fighting with the insurance industry. \nEverybody in this place has had the experience or somebody they know or \nlove has had the experience of trying to get a claim paid, having it be \ndenied, submitting a bill, having it be denied, having to wait for \ntreatment that you need while your doctor tries to get prior \nauthorization from the insurance company that says: No, we need more \npapers. All of that is expensive. None of it provides any health care \nvalue, zero. It is all administrative overhead and nonsense.\n  In some cases it is big. I was at the Cranston, RI community health \ncenter. It is not a big organization. Rhode Island is not a big State. \nCranston is not our capital city, not our biggest town. Its community \nhealth center does not have an enormous budget. They spend $300,000 \nevery year on the consultants who help them try to negotiate this \npayment claims war they are stuck in--$300,000 a year. On top of that, \n50 percent of their personnel time, half of their personnel time, goes \nto fighting with insurance companies. So you take a little place such \nas the Cranston community health center and you can tell them: Half of \nyour personnel costs can go away or can be devoted to prevention, as \nthe Senator from Iowa has suggested, instead of fighting with the \ninsurance industry. That is an improved model. That is something the \npublic option can pursue.\n  You don't have to fight the providers that way, and the amount of \nwaste that is burned up on all of that warfare for no health care value \nwhatsoever is an opportunity for this public option to achieve.\n  The third area is to more broadly change the busines model. There is \na failed private insurance business model right now. It is pretty \nsimple to summarize. No. 1, if they think you are going to get sick, \nthey deny you insurance. You don't even get in the door. No. 2, if they \nmake a terrible mistake and let you in the door and then you have the \ntemerity to get sick, they look for a way to deny coverage. They go \nthrough the form and look for a mistake you might have made so they can \nthrow it out. They find something that might have been a preexisting \ncondition. They look for a loophole. If they are stuck, if they can't \nfind a loophole, then they deny payment. They tell you that the \ncoverage you need isn't what you need or they refuse to honor the \ndoctor's bill when it comes through the door. But a business model for \nan entire industry of denying insurance to the people who they think \nwill get sick and then denying coverage to the people who actually do \nget sick and, when they can't dodge their coverage responsibilities, \ndenying payment to doctors or hospitals or trying\n\n[[Page S8670]]\n\nto have some person who is not even a doctor second-guess the coverage \nthat your doctor tells you you need, that is a terrible business model. \nIt has caused immense pain across the country, and it has been a \ndisaster. There is a better business model. A public option can pursue \nit.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield on that point, those very fact \nsituations the Senator describes would be totally prohibited under the \nbill we marked up in our committee nearly 3 weeks ago. Every one of \nthose fact situations would be prohibited under the legislation we sent \nto the body for its consideration.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Yes, it would. And it is an important piece of this \nlegislation that has received far too little attention so far in the \ndebate. It has caused an immense amount of personal pain, human \nanguish, and suffering that our health care system causes.\n  The distinguished Senator from Ohio, Senator Brown, and I wrote an \narticle about this. We wrote: Your health insurer should be your \nadvocate, not your adversary. The community health insurance option \nwill invest in prevention so that when you are healthy, you stay that \nway. It will invest in care management coordination, if you have a \nchronic condition, and it will fight for you, not with you, to get you \nthe best possible care with the least possible hassle.\n  That is what this is all about. The new business model can look in \nthese areas: Quality improvement. We know that improvement in the \nquality of care in this country can save dollars. But as we were saying \nearlier in our colloquy, it doesn't save money for the person investing \nin the quality. It saves it for the system. A public option will have \nthe public purpose necessary to pursue those quality improvements that \nwill drive down cost.\n  Health information infrastructure. We have the worst health \ninformation infrastructure in this country of any industry. The only \nindustry that has worse information infrastructure is the mining \nindustry. It is pathetic. But the same principle applies. The doctor \ninvesting in that equipment on their desk puts out all the money, takes \nall the risk, absorbs all the hassle, and the savings go to the \ninsurance companies. So we are underinvested. A public option can make \nthose investments in our electronic health record infrastructure.\n  Prevention strategies. I won't dwell on that because the Senator from \nIowa has done such a good job already. Same principle: A public option \ncan pursue the public purpose of protecting public health through \nprevention in a way that insurers never will because they don't have \nthe financial interest at stake. Finally, you can develop new models of \npayment to make all those happen, because the way we pay for it now is \npiecework. Procedure by procedure, the more you do, the more you get \npaid. Not the healthier your patients are, the more you get paid; the \nmore you do, the more you get paid.\n  There is enormous hope for the whole system. In fact, it may be the \nonly hope for our whole system is to change that business model to a \nmodel that works on quality improvement, prevention, investment, \npayment reform, and electronic health record infrastructure for \neverybody. A public option will lead us in that way.\n  Perhaps you can trust the private insurance industry to do this, \nalthough they never have so far. But perhaps now suddenly something \nwill change and you can trust them to start doing this for the first \ntime, when they never did before. But I don't think it is a wise bet to \nput all of our eggs in that one basket. Give us a public option and let \nthem compete. I think they can help transform this world.\n  The last thing I will say it is cost control. We have heard a lot \nabout cost control on this subject. There is no better way to have cost \ncontrol than to get a public option out there doing all these things--\nstripping the excess profit out of the system, lowering the \nadministrative costs, ending the warfare with providers that provides \nno value, and working to a business model founded on \nquality, prevention, electronic infrastructure, and clearer payment \nsignals. That is where we need to go. The public option takes us there.\n\n  Nobody cares more about this than the distinguished chairman and \nparticularly the people he has heard from in Connecticut. I would \nrevert back to the chairman to discuss the personal aspects of this on \nthe part of the people he serves.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. There will be many more opportunities \nfor us to go over this, but I want to make some points that are \nimportant and are part of the legislation that came out of our \ncommittee and that are now available for colleagues and others to \nconsider.\n  Under our legislation, you can never discriminate again for a \npreexisting condition. So when someone comes in and says, I am sorry \nbut that condition precludes you from getting coverage, under our \nlegislation, drafted and approved by our committee, that would not \nhappen. Never again can a preexisting condition be used to deprive \ncoverage.\n  No exorbitant out-of-pocket expenses, deductibles, or copays. \nInsurance companies will have to abide by yearly caps on how much they \ncan charge for out-of-pocket expenses. There will be minimal or no cost \nsharing for preventive care. The insurance industry would fully cover \nregular checkups and tests that help prevent illness such as mammograms \nor eye and foot exams for diabetes, the kind of thing Senator Harkin \ntalked about. It doesn't make sense to pay $30,000 to amputate your leg \ninstead of paying for the coverage to determine if you are susceptible \nto the illness.\n  No dropping coverage for the seriously ill. Companies would be \nprohibited from dropping or watering down insurance coverage for those \nwho become seriously ill. No gender discrimination. There has been a \nproblem of tremendous discrimination in the cost of coverage based on \ngender. Under our legislation, insurance companies would be prohibited \nfrom charging you more because of your gender. No annual or lifetime \ncaps on coverage. Again, you have coverage. You have never had to use \nit. All of a sudden you get that crisis in your family, and then you \nstart reading the fine print and discover all you get are two hospital \nvisits or three doctor visits. You have a serious problem on your \nhands. That coverage you have been paying for month after month, year \nafter year, all of a sudden might as well not exist at all. Under our \nbill, the industry would be prevented from placing annual and lifetime \ncaps on coverage that you receive.\n  Extended coverage for young adults: Children would continue to be \neligible for family coverage, not stopping at age 21 but up to 26. That \nis a huge gap, 21 to 26. Then we have young adult plans that would \nallow another option. Young people often think they will live forever \nand never have any problems. We are trying to help out this age group \nthat too often slips through the cracks. This group often doesn't think \ncoverage is that important and, as a result, suffers when they are \nfaced with illnesses or accidents.\n  Lastly, guaranteed insurance renewal is the point I wanted to raise--\nwhen you discover all of a sudden that you are no longer covered. Under \nour legislation, the industry would be required to renew any policy as \nlong as the policyholder pays premiums in full. The companies wouldn't \nbe allowed to refuse renewal because someone became sick. Every one of \nthese provisions is now written into our legislation. Our bill \nabsolutely makes major reforms that will make a difference on behalf of \nthe citizenry who are counting on a program that would not deprive them \nof the coverage they deserve.\n  I see our colleague from Oregon is here. I want to say that Ron Wyden \nhas been a tremendous advocate of health care reform for so long. He \nhas written a bill that has attracted a lot of bipartisan support. He \nand I have had long conversations about some of his ideas. I have asked \nhim to take a look at what we have done as well. I am confident we will \nend up with health care reform. And I want to thank Ron Wyden for his \nenergy and passion about this issue and the very creative ideas he has \nbrought to the table.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wanted to come tonight as a member of the \nFinance Committee and particularly highlight the extraordinary \ncontributions that those on the HELP Committee have made in the \nprevention area. This is going to be a landmark bill. This is going to \nbe an absolute turning point in American history\n\n[[Page S8671]]\n\nwhen we finally say that instead of spending loads of money on various \nhealth care services, we will start keeping people healthy. You look, \nfor example, at the Medicare Program. Medicare Part A will pay \nthousands and thousands of dollars on senior citizens' hospital bills. \nAnd then Medicare Part B, the outpatient portion, can't do anything to \nreward somebody for staying healthy. Along comes Senator Harkin, who \nhas consulted very extensively with the private sector, worked on a \nbipartisan effort. Senator Enzi and Senator Gregg were very \ninvolved. And you found the sweet spot. Prevention.\n\n  What you all were able to do in the preventive area is to show that \nyou could give very dramatic incentives to reward people for staying \nhealthy, lowering their cholesterol, lowering their blood pressure, \npicking up on some of the good work that is being done in the private \nsector but not getting into where one could, in effect, be said to be \ndiscriminating against an individual who would have a lot of health \nproblems and would have difficulty just with an incentive-based system.\n  That is a very thoughtful approach, in my view, to moving this \ncountry forward. I hope we will be able to pick up on it in the Senate \nFinance Committee. There is a lot of bipartisan support for it. I came \nto the floor tonight to particularly highlight that.\n  There is time, perhaps, for one other thought. I was struck--as we \ntalk about the lack of choice in this country--the distinguished \nPresiding Officer and I woke up this morning to our statewide \nnewspaper, the Oregonian, which described, in great detail, our health \ninsurance as Members of Congress. Senator Harkin and I have talked \nabout this, Chairman Dodd as well. It described how Senator Merkley and \nI have access to 23 health care packages, which, by the way, understand \nthe HELP lesson. They cannot discriminate against you if you have a \npreexisting condition. You go into a big group so you can play hardball \nwith the insurance companies.\n  What is striking about this--and Senate Merkley and I heard about \nthis on the front page of our newspaper--is most of the country thinks \nthis is some kind of ``Cadillac,'' gold-plated operation. But, as the \nnewspaper pointed out today, that is what somebody who works for the \nForest Service gets in central Oregon, that is what somebody who is a \njanitor, for example, the paper said, gets at the Bureau of Engraving.\n  I very much look forward to working with all of you on the HELP \nCommittee, as Chairman Dodd and I have talked about, to make sure \neverybody can have a wide array of choices, have a lot of clout to take \non the insurance companies, get reduced administrative costs, which is \nwhat you get with the big groups, and, by the way, have a financial \nincentive to choose one of these Harkin-type packages that reward \nprevention.\n  One of the things that is troubling about this debate is if we do not \nget the choice issue right, a lot of Americans are not going to be able \nto choose those kinds of packages. I think, under the Senator's \nleadership, we will be able to do it.\n  The last point I would make is--and I thank the Senator for all the \ntime--I think working together over the next few months we can close \nthe sale with folks who have insurance. This is going to be the key to \ngetting health reform passed.\n  Mr. President, 150 million-plus people say: Not only do I want to \nmake sure I am not worse off, I want to be better off. Well, we want to \nmake sure they are going to be able to choose a package such as Senator \nHarkin has been able to advance in the HELP Committee, where they get \nrewarded for prevention. We want to make sure they can choose a package \nwhere they can get lower premiums. We want to make sure everybody can \nkeep what they have, but if they do not like what they have they can go \nsomewhere else, which is what we can do as Members of Congress.\n  So I think tonight's program, particularly focusing on prevention and \nthe incentives you all have laid out--and as Senator Whitehouse has \ntalked about, changing this insurance model, which in many respects is \ninhumane to reward all this cherry-picking and, in effect, sending the \nsick people over to government programs more fragile than they are--you \nall have done some very good work, particularly in prevention and \nmaking sure the consumer gets a fair shake with the insurance industry.\n  Working together, particularly by adding choices, we are going to be \nable, over the next few months, to show we can close the sale with \nthose who have insurance in this country and come back in the fall and \nwin bipartisan support to go where this country has not been able to go \nfor 60 years; that is, quality, affordable coverage for all Americans.\n  We have already made it clear that in any legislative effort we are a \npart of, we will mandate good health for the Dodd household because we \nare all thinking about you, and we want you to know how much affection \nwe have for you and how much support both personally and professionally \nwe have for you from all of us in the Senate.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Senator for giving me all this time.\n  (Mr. WHITEHOUSE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank my friend from Oregon, \nwith whom I have had numerous conversations, going back over years, on \nthe whole wellness ethic and how we can kind of get this big ship of \nhealth care moving in a different direction. Senator Wyden has been one \nof the great leaders in this area, and I have consulted with him often \non this issue. I look forward to his work on the Finance Committee.\n  Of course, on workplace wellness, we have to make sure small \nbusinesses are able to help their employees in wellness programs. We \nknow from other businesses and what they have done--some larger \nbusinesses but some smaller ones that have done good workplace wellness \nprograms--it pays off immensely in savings but also in productivity. Of \ncourse, that is something the CBO does not look at--increased \nproductivity. They do not look at that.\n  But I say to Senator Wyden, he is absolutely right. What we have \ndone, what we anticipate will be coming now from the Finance Committee, \nand in putting these together, we will have a whole new--what is that \nfancy word called Paradigm--a new paradigm in health care in this \ncountry, where people will have a lot of choices. They will be able to \nshop. They will not be like my friend Art in Storm Lake, IA, who only \nhas one place to go with a $5,000 deductible.\n  Now we will be able to take a lot of these small businesses and they \nwill be able to go on these exchanges and they can be in a pool with a \nlot of other people all over the country. We know a principle of \ninsurance--I say to Senator Wyden, he knows this very well--one of the \nbasic principles of insurance is: The more people in the pool, the \ncheaper it is for everybody.\n  So we set up the bigger pools with our small businesses, my farmers \nand farm families to get into bigger pools, and not just these small \npools that cost them so much money. But the idea behind it, of course, \nthe one big paradigm, is to start focusing on wellness and health \npromotion, keeping people healthy. We have to put more incentives in \nthere for people.\n  You talk to anyone. Go out and talk to anyone and ask them would they \nlike to be healthier or would they like to be sick. That answer is \neasy. They want to be healthy. What kind of help do you get? When you \ngo to your doctor, when you talk to your doctor and stuff, do they tell \nyou how to be healthy? Well, I do not know. I do not think so. When is \nthe last time you went to a doctor and walked out without getting a \nprescription? So the doctor gave you a prescription. Go get a drug. We \nhave to change this. In our bill, we do.\n  Again, part of our prevention package is to focus on medical schools \nand how we get more people in general practices and family practices \nand residencies in prevention and wellness so they begin to understand \nhow they can start working with people to keep them healthy.\n  So this is a way we are going to try to shift this so the person can \nsay: Yes, I want to be healthy. And do you know what, I went to my \nhealth care practitioner--maybe a doctor, maybe a nurse\n\n[[Page S8672]]\n\npractitioner, maybe a physician's assistant, and it could be a host of \ndifferent people; it could be a chiropractor--and, do you know what, \nthey spent a lot of time with me, and they gave me a program to follow \nto stay healthy. And guess what. They check up on me and they find out: \nAre you following your program? Come in. You come in here in 6 months. \nI am giving you this program to show you how to stay healthy. And they \ncall me up after a month. Someone in the office called me up, asking: \nAre you doing this? In 6 months, I have to come back in to make sure I \nam doing it.\n  No one has ever done that before. But in our bill, you see--in our \nbill--they will be able to get reimbursed for that. They will be able \nto get reimbursed for keeping someone healthy and not just taking care \nof you when you are sick.\n  I wish to thank my friend from Oregon. He has been a great leader in \nthis area for so many years. I look forward to working with the Senator \nto get us over that finish line sometime this year.\n  I thank Senator Dodd again for all his great leadership. I say to the \nPresiding Officer, the Senator from Rhode Island--talking about the \npublic option, to digress for 1 second away from prevention--here is \none of the reasons we need a public option: From 2003 to 2007, the \ncombined profits of the five largest health insurance companies went up \n170 percent. Their profits went up 170 percent. The CEO compensation \nfor the top seven health insurance companies right now: $14.2 million a \nyear.\n  Well, that is why we need a public option out there, to kind of put \nsome brakes on that, to give some competition out there so these health \ninsurance companies know they have to be a little bit more stringent on \nmaybe what they pay their CEOs, and maybe the profits will not be so \nhigh because they will have a public option out there that will act as \na check both on their profits but also a check on the quality of care \nthey provide. That is why the public option is so vital and necessary.\n  Well, again, I say thank you to Senator Dodd for having us here \ntonight, and I thank him again for his great leadership on this health \ncare bill.\n  I say to my friend from Oregon, we are going to get it done. We are \ngoing to make this a wellness society, not a sick society.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank our colleague from Iowa, and I \nthank, again, Ron Wyden for his contributions.\n  I wish to reintroduce a constituent of mine, Kevin Galvin. I spent \nthe morning with Kevin today. He is a true American hero, in many ways. \nHe did not want to become an American hero.\n  Kevin employs, I think, 13 people. He has a small business in \nHartford, CT. He started out in a hardware business about 27 years ago \nand changed his business model to meet the needs and times of our \ncountry. He was never able to provide health insurance for his people, \nand it bothered him deeply because he did not have enough business, and \nhealth care coverage, even years ago, was more expensive than he could \nafford.\n  Students sometimes ask: Can one person make a difference? This \nperson--I suppose the legislative leaders in my State would acknowledge \nthis as well--this one person, on his own, over 2 years, organized \n19,000 small businesses in my small State to lobby my State legislature \nabout doing something at long last to make a difference for small \nbusinesses on health care. They achieved it about a week ago, in no \nsmall measure because one guy, who employs about 13 people, got fed up.\n\n  The average small business pays 18 percent more for health care than \nlarger businesses and gets a lot less coverage than others do as well \nfor the very reason Senator Harkin pointed out: pooling, the idea of \nbeing able to work together, get together. They can hardly lift up \ntheir heads. In a small business, you are struggling every day to \nsurvive.\n  Seventy-five percent of our employers employ fewer than 25 people in \nour country. The majority of people in our Nation get a job in a small \nbusiness. Yet they work so hard every day trying to keep that business \nafloat, particularly in times such as these.\n  It bothered Kevin Galvin so much, that employees of his, in some \ncases, had to leave him. They did not want to leave but had to because \ntheir spouse lost their job, which is what they were relying on for \nhealth insurance. He told us about one fellow today, who I think was \nwith him 20-some-odd years, who had to go off and find a job that paid \n30 percent less in income but because they had a health care plan. He \nleft the job he loved to take a 30-percent pay cut so his family could \nhave health care.\n  A young man whom we talked to today, an employee, a Hispanic \nAmerican, in Hartford, CT, is raising a family on his own and has a \nchild with a severe disability and his parents have Alzheimer's and \nthere is no coverage under this guy's plan, Kevin Galvin's plan, in his \nworkplace. But they are doing everything. Kevin does whatever he can to \nhelp that family out because he loves that young man who has worked \nwith him. He cares about him. But he cannot afford to do it forever. He \ncannot survive as a businessperson that way.\n  So we need to pay attention. Our bill does. We talked about \nprevention. But one of the things I am most proud of in our bill is \nproviding those credits to small businesses so they can afford \ncoverage, giving them the option of going to those alternative plans \nout there that may suit their needs the best, which they do not have \ntoday, allowing them to come together, so they have an opportunity to \ndrive down those costs when they bargain together for the best cost for \ntheir employees, as the Senator from Rhode Island pointed out.\n  But I wished to point out Kevin Galvin. Today we met in his shop in \nHartford, CT. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen \nSebelius, was there. The new Administrator for the Small Business \nAdministration, Karen Mills, was there. Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro was \nthere. The speaker of the State house was there. The president of the \nState senate was there. The head of the small business community was \nthere. They were there to say thank you to Kevin Galvin for what he had \ndone.\n  If one person like that can make a difference, we ought to listen to \nthem. When the Kevin Galvins of this country--he is a small business \nguy with 13 employees, struggling every day. He decided he was going to \ndo something about it, and we ought to listen to him. He made a \ndifference in my State. But if we listen to him, we can make a \ndifference with small businesspeople all across this country. If we \nwill take the language we wrote in our bill that can make a difference \nwith small business--13 million people in this country who work for \nsmall business every day don't have health insurance. Of that 47 \nmillion, 13 million--being able to make a difference in their lives, \ngiving them the kind of coverage, the accessibility and the \naffordability to health care, can make a huge difference.\n\n  One thing we don't mention enough: This week is the 44th birthday of \nMedicare--this week. It is a great program. It took the poorest sector \nof our society out of poverty, the elderly. It also did something else. \nHow many of us in our generation were able to do other things and make \ninvestments in other things because in 1965, this Congress, the men and \nwomen sitting in this Chamber--mostly men in those days--passed \nMedicare? All of a sudden, that financial burden children had to look \nat--the cost of pharmaceutical drugs their parents needed, going to the \ndoctor with their parents--all of a sudden, a lot of it got taken care \nof. It was a financial benefit to their children.\n  I don't know if there are any economic models that look around and \nsay: How much did that program not only benefit the elderly who got \nMedicare, but how did it benefit their children who were then able to \nmake investments in their own children's education and in that better \nhome and that better neighborhood, buying that second car? How much did \nour economy actually grow and improve because we invested in Medicare? \nWe always talk about what it did for those who receive Medicare, but \nhow about those who didn't receive Medicare but had removed from them--\nor at least partially removed--the burden of those costs they would \notherwise pay?\n  How many people today, because of the uncertainty about their health \ninsurance, are not making the kinds of investments in other things \nbecause\n\n[[Page S8673]]\n\nthey are trying to protect themselves against that crisis that could \nbefall them? We don't talk about that.\n  All I hear about is how expensive this is. It is going to be \nexpensive, but if we don't do something about it, it will be lot more \nexpensive--expensive to our economy, expensive to individuals, and \nexpensive to our Nation.\n  So when we talk about these issues, it isn't just those who benefit \nas a result of having access; it also is the relief, it is the sense of \ncomfort, that sense of confidence that, Lord forbid, something happens \nto me and my family, I am protected against catastrophic ruin--\ncatastrophic ruin that can happen. I don't think we talk about that \nenough here. One of the reasons is because none of us here--none of us \nhere--have to worry for one single second about that. None of us are \ngoing to be economically ruined as Members of the U.S. Congress if a \nhealth care crisis befalls us. Not one of us. Yet the millions of \npeople we represent worry about it every single day.\n  That is at the heart of all of this, to be able to establish a system \nin our country which protects our Nation--the greatest, the wealthiest \nNation in the history of mankind--from the absolute and very \npredictable knowledge that you have either been sick, you are sick, or \nyou are going to get sick. I guarantee you, if you are a human being \nliving in this country, that is going to happen to you. To what extent \ndoes that occasion, that event put you and your family in financial \nruin? It happens to millions in this country. So that as much as \nanything else ought to motivate us to get back here and do the job.\n  I see my colleague from Oregon is here, Senator Merkley of our \ncommittee, who has done a great job as well.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator very much for his \npresentation and leadership on health care.\n  The Senator was just talking about Medicare, and when our HELP \nCommittee was meeting, I heard a very interesting statistic; that is, \nwhile Americans spend 17 to 18 percent of our GDP on health care--more \nthan any other country on the planet--our health outcomes overall are \nsignificantly less than several dozen other nations in the world. That \nis part of the puzzle we are addressing. But then I heard another piece \nof the puzzle; that is, for American citizens who are 65, their health \nprospects are among the best in the world. The question was posed \nbefore the committee: What is the difference? The difference is very \nsimple, as the Senator from Connecticut has so described, and that was \nthe creation of the Medicare Program. All of our citizens 65 and older \nhave health care. If we can take it and make it a nation where all of \nour citizens 65 and under have health care, wouldn't it make a \ntremendous difference?\n  Mr. DODD. My colleague is absolutely correct. This is the point. \nPeople probably know, but the younger generation may not realize it. \nPrior to 1965, the poorest population of our country were our elderly. \nIt was a great tragedy--the generation that grew up and then \ncontributed so much. The 20th century--of course, by 1965, those were \nthe veterans of World War I. They were the people who had lived through \nthe Depression and held us together as a nation time after time, and \nhere they were reaching their retirement years, and, as we all know, \nwhen health care problems become pretty routine.\n  A generation that came before us sitting in this very Chamber decided \nwe could do better than that, and so crafted Medicare. The leadership \nagain began with President Kennedy and culminated with the work of \nLyndon Baines Johnson putting a package together with Hubert Humphrey \nand others, putting together that Medicare Program and taking a \nsubstantial portion of our population and giving them the assurance and \nthe confidence that as they grow older and face health care problems, \nthe Nation would be there to back them up and to say thank you as a \ngesture of gratitude for the contribution they made.\n  Also, there was a note of selfishness in that it relieved that \nyounger generation from the burden of financially caring for parents \nbeyond their economic means, in many cases. So it freed up their \nchildren to provide for that generation's grandchildren. In so many \nways we have benefited from that.\n  So while we talk about the recipients of Medicare--and that is \nextremely worthwhile--we all benefited from that. It was a great \neconomic relief to an entire Nation, not just the recipients of \nMedicare's assistance and support.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, if I could carry on a second point \nrelated to the Senator's comments, and that is simply as you address \nsmall business and Kevin Galvin, your constituent, to help organize \nsmall business, whereas we did a tremendous job in regard to our \nseniors 65 and older, we haven't done such a good job for our small \nbusinesses.\n  I know that over the past many years, small business owners have been \ncoming to me and saying: Jeff, we just can't afford these double-digit \nincreases we are getting every year in health care premiums, and we are \nhaving to shift some of the cost to our employees. We are having to \nconsider shutting down our insurance program completely. We as small \nbusinesses can't get the same good deal the large businesses are able \nto get. Can't you do something about that?\n  I think with the bill the Senator from Connecticut has steered \nthrough committee, he has done such great work in laying out a plan \nthat will help our small businesses in several different ways.\n  First is to create a pool where they will have the negotiating power \nof hundreds of thousands of individuals rather than having to go as a \nsmall business of 5 or so or 25 employees to the health care market, \nbecause when you go by yourself with 5 or 10 or 25 employees, it is \nlike leading a lamb to slaughter. Now they will be able to go to the \nhealth care marketplace where they will be able to be a part of a \nlarger pool and negotiate a much better deal.\n  The second is, they will have so many options when they get to that \nhealth care marketplace, whereas now there may be only one company that \nwill hear them out and give them a possible plan, and then they will \nhave many more to choose from.\n\n  So I think those pieces are a tremendous improvement to what I think \nhas been a long neglected part of the health care puzzle.\n  Mr. DODD. Again, I thank my colleague for mentioning that. He is \nabsolutely correct. As I mentioned earlier, the average small business \npays a lot more for insurance than larger businesses do, and they get \nfar less coverage than others do as well. That is why we provide new \ncredits in this bill: $2,000 per employee, family coverage; $1,500 for \ncouples; and $1,000 for individuals. That may not satisfy all of their \nhealth care costs, but it is a major break and an assistance to small \nbusinesses and guys such as Kevin Galvin who would like to be able to \nbuy that coverage for his employees out of loyalty to their family.\n  One thing about small business is it becomes a family. Everybody \nknows everybody. You know about what their kids are doing. You know \nwhat is going on in their homes. There is a far greater deal of \nflexibility in trying to meet the needs because it is a family in so \nmany ways. So being able to jump in and help them provide, as Kevin has \ntried to do with his own employees over the years, we open up the \ninsurance gateway to all small businesses to give affordable insurance \noptions to employers.\n  This gives small businesses the same bargaining leverage as I \nmentioned earlier, protection from hiking up rates on small businesses, \nwatering down coverage, or denying coverage altogether just because one \nworker gets really sick--and you heard cases of that. I think Senator \nHarkin talked about that small business where one employee contracted a \nvery serious illness and the industry then jacked up the premiums for \neveryone, thus making it impossible for other employees to get \ncoverage. Our bill, as our colleague from Oregon, Senator Merkley, \nmentioned, bans that case.\n  We exempt businesses from having to pay any penalty if you employ 25 \nor fewer employees, and that is a great asset. Again, 75 percent of all \nemployers employ 25 or fewer in our country. We don't count seasonal \nworkers. Our colleague Senator Kay Hagan offered that amendment in our \ncommittee to exclude seasonal workers toward the\n\n[[Page S8674]]\n\ntotal size of a small business, which is important in small \nagricultural communities where seasonal workers become absolutely \ncritical. But if you start adding them all up, it would drive that \nsmall business into a larger number category. I assume in Oregon that \ncould be a major problem, I know in the agricultural sector of your \nState, and it helps self-employed workers by allowing them to purchase \nhealth insurance through the gateways.\n  So a lot of businesses are single employers. They employ themselves. \nThat could be tremendously costly, and by pooling, it makes it possible \nfor those people to drive down those costs.\n  So a major part of our bill, as Senator Merkley has pointed out, is \nfocused on small business--again, the great engine of our economic \nsuccess in this country, and we pay a lot of attention to their needs \nin this bill.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. There is just one last point I wish to make, but I am \nhappy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend from Oregon.\n  Mr. President, I can't thank Senator Dodd enough for getting the \ninformation out on what our bill does. A lot of people don't know that \nwe have a very comprehensive bill. This one dealing with small \nbusinesses is so important.\n  Now, it is true we excepted businesses that employ fewer than 25, as \nwe should. However, I just told the story about my friend in Iowa who \nemploys 12 people, and they buy health insurance but they only have one \nplan, and this would give them more.\n  I believe that with the bill we have and setting up these exchanges \nand letting different insurance companies come on the exchange, and \nwith a public option there are a lot of small businesses out there that \nwould like to cover their employees; they just simply can't afford it \nor the deductible is so high that it is not even worth it. Now I \nbelieve they will be able to take, with our bill, after it is fully \nimplemented--it takes about 3 years to phase in, if I am not mistaken--\nthere will be a lot of small businesses out there that employ 10 or 15 \npeople that now will be able to get an insurance policy for their \npeople that will be a heck of a lot more reasonable than what they can \nget now, and they will be able to shop for that.\n  So even though we have exempted them, I think a lot of small \nbusinesses want to cover their employees. They live in the same \ncommunity; they go to the same church; they know one another, and they \nwant to buy some health coverage for their employees. They can't now, \nbut I believe under the bill we have through our committee, once we get \nit fully implemented, we will have that public option out there, we \nwill have the exchange with all of the insurance programs out there, \nand they will be able to now shop around and find one that can fit \ntheir needs. So we will have a lot more support for small businesses \nthat way.\n  Mr. DODD. Absolutely.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank the Senator very much.\n  The distinguished chair, Senator Dodd, mentioned earlier that this \nbill is not just for the uninsured; this is for the insured because we \nhave a broken health care system for the insured. My colleague from \nOregon made this point, that we need to close the deal for insurance in \nthis country.\n  I can tell you that folks with insurance have been telling us lots of \nstories about the challenges they face under our current broken status \nquo health care system. The first is that right now, their insurance is \nlargely tied to their job, so if they should lose their job, it is a \nhuge calamity--not just because they lost their job but also because \nthey lost their insurance. It is a double whammy. This bill would \nchange that for our families who currently have insurance.\n\n  Second, our families who currently have insurance, their costs are \nbeing driven up, in part because they are covering the costs of the \nemergency room treatment for those who don't have insurance. In the \nlast couple of years, we have had more and more people without \ninsurance transferring more costs in the emergency room and, therefore, \nmore costs to the insurer. Therefore, more companies--particularly \nsmall ones--are saying we cannot afford health insurance anymore.\n  This is a downward cycle, a death cycle in insurance that we break \nwith this bill--helping out those who have insurance by taking away the \nburden of paying for the emergency room for those who don't.\n  A third factor is that other pieces are driving up health care more \nthan 10 percent a year of health care premiums. That means health care \nis going to double every 7 years. That is unsustainable in this country \nfor those of us who are fortunate enough to have insurance.\n  Then, also, citizens have been recognizing that they would like to \nhave portability--to be able to take the insurance they have and, \nshould they change jobs--as Americans do, on average, every 3 years--be \nable to have the same insurance plan, the same set of choices, the same \ndoctors, the same doctor for themselves and their spouse and their \nchildren. That portability becomes an inherent feature of the bill, \nhelping those who have insurance.\n  The list goes on. Those who currently have insurance sometimes get it \nat a very poor deal. As the chairman pointed out, it is 18 percent more \nfor an individual than a small business. Now they will be able to be \npart of a larger pool and get a much better deal.\n  Finally, many of those who currently have insurance don't have \nexisting conditions covered. If they have a bad back or a heart \ncondition or cancer or diabetes, and they cannot have that fundamental \nhealth care issue covered by their insurance, then they don't have any \nform of health care insurance that matters for the issue they are \nwrestling with.\n  So in so many ways, the plan the committee has put together \nprofoundly improves on our broken health care system for those who have \ninsurance today in America.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. There is so much to talk about, and \nthere are so many pieces of this. I was listening to Secretary Sebelius \ntoday, and I am sure all of us have mentioned this in our own States, \nand we hear colleagues talk about this ``tax'' being imposed as a \nresult of this bill. There is no tax being imposed by this bill. \nHowever, there is a tax that exists today, which is $1,100 for the \naverage family, and that is the amount the average family pays in \nhealth care premiums every year to cover the uncompensated care--that \nis, for those of the 47 million who show up in emergency rooms for \nhealth care. We take care of them.\n  If you show up in a hospital, just walk in, and you have a problem, \nthere is not a hospital in America that doesn't take you into that \nemergency room. They don't throw you out on the streets and say: I am \nsorry, you don't have any money, so you are going to have to suffer.\n  Communities all across the country do this job every day. We need to \nunderstand that, of course, it is not free. That care costs. It is the \nmost expensive health care in the country that occurs in an emergency \nroom. The cost of that, on average, is $1,100 per family in the United \nStates. If that is not a tax, I don't know what is. You are not getting \nanything for it. You are helping to pick up the cost of the people who \ndon't have coverage who are showing up--usually in a critical state, \nbecause they have waited until such a point that it is catastrophic, \nand they haven't had any prevention, as Senator Harkin talked about \nearlier, and they waited forever.\n  Now it has come down to a crisis, and they show up in the emergency \nroom with the child at 1 or 2 in the morning. It is not just filled \nwith car accidents and violence. People walk in every night because \nthey have a child or a spouse who needs care. They are reaching out in \ndesperation, and that is expensive health care. We are paying a tax of \n$1,100, and the average family pays that.\n  Mr. WYDEN. If the chairman would yield on that point, the reason I \nwanted to speak at this point is, in fact, today there is an \nentrepreneurship tax in America. What it means is, if you have a health \ncare problem and you work in a small business and you have a good idea \nand you would like to go out and set up your own small business, you \nare not going to be able to do it because you have a preexisting \nillness. You are locked into your job. What your insurance reforms do \nin the HELP legislation, and what I think a lot of Senators want to do, \nis lift that entrepreneurship tax.\n  This is very appropriate that you talk about taxes because that is \nwhat\n\n[[Page S8675]]\n\nthis always comes down to. Your insurance reforms specifically, as a \nresult of making sure that person who has a good idea--perhaps that \ngentleman's business the Senator just described--they are going to be \nable to do what makes America great, which is use their ingenuity and \ntalent because when they go to their next job, they are not going to \nface insurance discrimination.\n  I appreciate the Senator bringing up the entrepreneurship tax. I am \nlooking forward to working with the chairman over the next few weeks. I \nthink there is additional work we can do on the exchanges. The Senator \nfrom Oregon, Mr. Merkley, my colleague who is doing such a good job, \ntalked about some of those options. I think we can get additional \npeople more bargaining power, and in effect build on the good work done \nin the HELP Committee.\n  Thanks for all the time tonight. You have done a first-rate job on \nprevention. Again, I appreciate lifting that entrepreneurship tax. That \nis why I wanted to take a minute to point that out.\n  I look forward to working specifically with my colleagues on the HELP \nCommittee. Let's expand those exchanges because that makes the system \nwork for us and Members of Congress.\n  I checked the other day. My pool--put on the front page of our \npaper--is 1 million people. That is a lot of folks to spread costs and \nrisk among. Senator Harkin and I have talked about it. It is not \npossible to replicate that exactly, for a variety of reasons. We can \nget close. We can get pretty close because we can build on the good \nwork Senators have done in the HELP Committee, expand the exchanges, \nand give more people choices and more opportunities to lower their \npremiums and, in my view, close the sale with the insured people over \nthe next few months.\n  I thank the Chairman for all the time.\n  (Mr. MERKLEY assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Oregon, a great advocate. We \nappreciate his involvement this evening with us. As a member of the \nFinance Committee, it will be critically important that we come \ntogether.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I wanted to follow up on Senator Merkley's discussion \nof the different ways in which somebody who is watching this, and who \nis insured, can look forward to some benefit from all of this. A simple \none would be to think, in your own experience, how often you have gone \ninto your doctor's office and maybe been referred to a specialist or \nyou brought a family member in and you had to take a clipboard and fill \nout on paper for the umpteenth time your personal health insurance, \nyour billing information, your Social Security information, and \nwhatever it is they want. You have to fill it out over and over again. \nThat is the experience many people have with our health care system.\n  Compare that to going online at--pick one--say, Amazon. You log into \nAmazon and they say: Welcome, Sheldon Whitehouse. Good to have you \nback. Here are all the books you bought in the last year or so. Based \non that, we think here are more books you might like. Choose something \nyou would like, and your billing information is here.\n  Put those experiences side by side and show where our bill can take \nthe American health care consumer, and what that means for quality of \ncare, and not just for the convenience of not filling out the form, but \nwhen you are a pharmacy, it is connected to your laboratory, it is \nconnected to your doctor, it is connected to the hospital, and you are \nthe center of it, and all of it is private and secure. That is a new \nand better world for everybody, including those who have insurance.\n  Who has not had somebody they know go into a hospital and come out \nwith a hospital-acquired infection? It has happened over and over. I \nhave had a friend who went in for a simple knee surgery, arthroscopic \nsurgery. He was a big athlete in college, and he needed a simple \nsurgery on his knee. He got a hospital-acquired infection--a strong, \nbig guy--and it nearly killed him. It took him out of work for weeks. \nMercifully, he recovered and everything is fine. It was touch and go \nfor a while, and the cost of all of that was tremendous from that \nhospital-acquired infection. He required weeks of medical care. \nEverybody has had that experience. About 100,000 people every year--\nAmericans we represent--die every year because of hospital-acquired \ninfections.\n\n  Senator Harkin tells me that it is the fourth leading cause of \ndeath--hospital-acquired infections. They don't care if you are insured \nwhen it comes to hospital-acquired infections. The insured will get one \njust as quickly as the uninsured. The quality provisions of this bill \nwill prevent that and diminish that. That number should be under 5,000. \nIt should be a rarity. Instead, it is a commonality. The system has to \nchange for that to happen.\n  If you have an illness, try to find a prevention program. Ask anybody \nyou know where they can go to find somebody who will support them in \ngetting an appropriate, sensible, supported prevention program for \nthemselves. It is rare to find. It is almost impossible. As I said \nearlier, when I was talking about the person who had a leg removed for \n$30,000 because there was nobody there to prevent them from letting \nthat disease get to that stage, there are big savings there. It is a \nhuman consequence. You can have all the insurance in the world, but if \nit doesn't have a prevention option, you are not helped.\n  The last thing I will say is that so many of us who feel comfortable \nright now with our insurance only feel that way because we have had the \ngood luck not to have the experience of having some loved one or \nourselves get very sick. People's viewpoints change when they have had \nthat experience. They find the limits of their policy. They see how \nfast the copays add up. They see the fine print in what they thought \nwas a great policy when times were good and they were healthy, with \njust a little injury here and there, and everything was taken care of \nfine; but when they got really sick they found that policy they thought \nthey could count on wasn't there for them.\n  Now the leading cause of families going into bankruptcy and losing \neverything in this country is somebody in the family having a health \ncare disaster that wiped them out. That should not be. It happens over \nand over and over. It happens to the insured. That is not the \nuninsured. If you are uninsured and you have medical bills, you know \nyou will have problems, but it is the insured who are caught by \nsurprise. They have their homes, their stock portfolios, perhaps, on \nthe side; they have a nest egg, and maybe they help support their \nchildren a little bit. And, boom, comes the illness and suddenly they \nhave all these costs and these bills and it is piling up and they \ncannot keep up and they start to get behind. Before you know it, they \nhave lost it all, and they are in bankruptcy.\n  Americans have that experience every day and every one of us have \nheard from somebody in our State who is right there. So I think the \npoint the chairman has been making, and Senator Merkley made, about how \nimportant it is for people who have insurance, in terms of improving \ntheir lives, their quality, and their care and prospects is very poor. \nI applaud the Senator for having made that point.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleagues from Rhode Island, Iowa, Senators \nWyden and Merkley, and Senator Brown who spent a little time talking \nabout this. There is a lot more to talk about, such as the quality \nissues that Senator Mikulski of Maryland spent a long time helping to \ndevelop, and Senator Murray from Washington on workforce and the \ncoverage questions that Jeff Bingaman worked on, as well.\n  We hope in the few days we have between now and adjournment--and we \nknow a good part of the time will be taken up with the Sotomayor \nnomination--we will have a chance to talk further about this bill and \nsay to our colleagues: We welcome your comments. There are five \ncommittees of Congress charged with the responsibility of health care. \nFour of the five have met and completed their work. Our committee, the \nHELP Committee, has completed its work. We know the Finance Committee \nis working to complete its work. I want to make clear that the HELP \nCommittee product will be very much a part of this effort. We welcome \nthe work of the Finance Committee. But much of health care coverage is \nthe shared purview and responsibility of the Health, Education,\n\n[[Page S8676]]\n\nLabor, and Pensions Committee, under the leadership of Senator Kennedy \nof Massachusetts, as well as the Finance Committee. Senator Kennedy has \nchampioned for four decades this effort. Regrettably, he cannot be with \nus because of his own struggles with illness. But he has helped frame \nthis. It has been a bipartisan effort over the years.\n\n  We are determined as we move forward in this debate that the product \nmy colleagues have worked on so diligently over these past number of \nmonths is going to be very much a part of our health care program.\n  I express my gratitude to each member of the committee who helped \nproduce this result that took so long. We have taken this time to \nexplain to our fellow citizens what we tried to incorporate in our bill \nthat will get us to the point of increased accessibility, increased \nquality, and affordable products. That is what we are gaining. That is \nthe purpose we are driving at to get those three goals met.\n  I think we achieved a good part of it with this bill. More needs to \nbe done, but, obviously, it is a great step in the right direction.\n  I see another partner of ours in this effort. He played a critical \nrole with community health care centers. I say to my colleague from \nVermont, last week I was in New Britain, CT. I have many community \nhealth centers in Connecticut. As a result of the stimulus package, \nseveral of them received some real help to expand because they are \novercrowded. Getting electronic records is critically important. Their \npatients have greater needs, but they have a medical home now.\n  I have three volunteer clinics in Connecticut, one in Norwalk, CT, \none in Danbury, CT, and one in Bridgeport, CT, under AmeriCares. That \nprogram only serves the uninsured. It is completely voluntary.\n  In Norwalk, I have 60 physicians in the area who volunteer their time \nto come in and serve the needs of the people of the greater Norwalk \narea, not to mention retired doctors, nurse practitioners, and others \nwho help.\n  I say to my colleague, that he has been a tremendous voice--in fact, \nour bill increases by 400 percent the commitment to community health \ncenters across our country. We can expand community health centers and \nprovide that medical home for so many people. They are a source of \nprevention, early detection, providing for the needs of families--all \nof these things that occur in these remarkable facilities called \ncommunity health centers.\n  The best champion, other than Ted Kennedy, who helped author the idea \nto begin with, is our colleague Bernie Sanders from Vermont. I thank \nhim for that effort.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Dodd for his kind words \nand extraordinary efforts over the last several months to lead the \nfight in health care reform.\n  Let me pick up on one issue Senator Dodd raised. Most Americans do \nnot understand this, but in the midst of a disintegrated health care \nsystem, we have 60 million Americans who do not on a regular basis have \naccess to a physician--60 million. What happens when those people get \nsick? If you are in Vermont and you are kind of stubborn, you delay \ngoing to the doctor when you should go, and you wait and you wait. And \n6 months after you first were feeling badly, you go crawling into the \ndoctor's office, and the doctor says: Why weren't you in here 6 months \nago?\n  And the person says: Well, I felt awkward. I didn't have any health \ninsurance. I was embarrassed.\n  The doctor says: I am getting you to the hospital because you are \nreally sick.\n  So instead of treating people when they are initially ill, what we \nend up doing for people who do not have access to a doctor on a regular \nbasis or do not have any health insurance is we wait until they become \nvery ill and then we send them to the hospital and spend tens of \nthousands of dollars, in some instances, when we could have treated \nthem with much less suffering and at much less cost.\n  There is another point that is not widely known, and that is, \naccording to the Institute of Medicine, in this country today, we lose \nabout 18,000 Americans every single year who die because they do not go \nto a doctor when they should go to the doctor. That is six times the \nnumber of people who were killed on 9/11 every single year.\n  What Senator Dodd is talking about and what many of us have worked on \nis significantly expanding the federally qualified health center \nprogram, started by Senator Kennedy four decades ago, widely supported \nin a bipartisan manner.\n  What studies tell us is, if, in fact, we can do what is in this \nlegislation and provide a community health center with physicians, with \ndentists, with low-cost prescription drugs, with mental health \ncounseling, do you know what we would end up doing, amazingly enough? \nWe save money. We save money. We invest over a 5-year period about $8 \nbillion, and we end up saving money because we keep people out of the \nemergency rooms, we keep people out of hospitals, we keep people alive. \nIf that is not a good investment, I don't know what is.\n  So the fight to make sure that every American has access to a doctor, \nto a dentist, to low-cost prescription drugs is certainly, in my mind, \none of the crowning achievements of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee piece of health care reform.\n  A month ago, I asked people on my e-mail list, which is not only \nVermont, but all across the country, to write to me and tell me their \nrelationship, how they are dealing with private health insurance \ncompanies. Within a week, we had over 4,000 responses. The booklet is \navailable on my Web site, sanders.senate.gov. I urge people to take a \nlook at it. If you want to know what is wrong with health care in \nAmerica, this booklet will tell you.\n  People are writing from their hearts, from their own suffering, \ndescribing the health care crisis. I want to read and comment on a few \nof the statements sent to my office. This is from a fellow in Swanton, \nVT, a small town in the northern part of Vermont:\n\n       My younger brother, a combat decorated veteran of the \n     Vietnam conflict, died three weeks after being diagnosed with \n     colon cancer. He was laid off from his job and could not \n     afford COBRA coverage. When he was in enough pain to see a \n     doctor, it was too late. He left a wife and two teenage sons \n     in the prime of his life at 50 years old. The attending \n     doctor said that if he had only sought treatment earlier, he \n     would still be alive.\n\n  People talk about waiting lines in Canada or in Great Britain. Let's \ntalk about over 18,000 Americans dying every year because either they \ndo not have any health insurance or, if they do, they cannot get access \nto a doctor.\n  When we talk about the health care crisis in America, it is not just \nthe pain that millions of Americans are experiencing, the fear, or the \ntens of millions of people who stay at their job today. Do you know why \nthey are staying at their job? Not because they particularly want to \nstay at their job, but because they have good health insurance and \ntheir wife has an illness that needs to be covered. Talk about economic \nnonsense, absurdity--millions of people staying at work because they do \nnot want to give up their health insurance. What President Obama says, \nbecause of the economic crisis, we have to address health care, is \nabsolutely right.\n  Some of our friends on the other side say what they have always said: \nLet's do nothing. You want to do nothing? Within 10 years, the amount \nof money you are paying for health care today will double. If you are a \nsmall business person today in Vermont or around the country and having \na hard time providing health care to your workers or maybe your family, \nthink about what happens when the cost of health care doubles. Think \nabout large corporations that have to compete with European, \nScandinavian countries, and companies where health care becomes a right \nof all people and not something placed on the employer.\n\n  In this year, amazingly enough, when we talk about health care and \neconomics--and Senator Whitehouse was alluding to this a moment ago--\nthere are 1 million people this year, it is estimated, who will go \nbankrupt because of medically related illnesses. Most of those people \nhave health insurance--1 million Americans. And our friends say: We \ncan't go forward; now is not the time to go forward on health care \nreform. Tell that to 1 million American families who have suffered \nbankruptcy.\n  In my view, the evidence is overwhelming that our current system is \nextraordinarily wasteful and bureaucratic; that in a very significant \nway,\n\n[[Page S8677]]\n\nthe function of our current health care system is not to provide \nquality health care to every man, woman, and child, but, in fact, to \nallow people within the industry--the private insurance companies, the \ndrug companies, the medical device suppliers--to make as much money as \nthey possibly can.\n  Amazingly enough, according to the papers in the last few days, the \nhealth care industry has spent over $130 million in the last quarter on \nlobbying. There are 100 Members in the Senate and 435 Members of the \nHouse--to spend $130 million?\n  Where do they get that money? They get that money, if they are a drug \ncompany, by charging the American people the highest prices in the \nentire world. I was the first Member of Congress to take Americans over \nthe Canadian border a number of years ago where women with breast \ncancer who were fighting for their lives were able to pick up breast \ncancer medicine at one-tenth the price. The drug companies cannot lower \nprices in this country--they have to charge us the highest prices in \nthe world--but somehow they do manage to come up with tens and tens of \nmillions of dollars to try to buy Members of the Congress.\n  While more and more people are losing their health insurance, we are \nseeing many of these private insurance companies seeing huge increases \nin their profits. We are seeing the insurance companies, the drug \ncompanies paying, in some cases, tens of millions of dollars in \ncompensation packages to their CEOs.\n  For anybody to suggest that this country does not need health care \nreform is simply not to understand what is going on from one end of \nthis country to the other. We are a great nation. There is no reason in \nthe world why we should end up spending almost twice as much per person \non health care as any other nation and yet have inferior health care \noutcomes in terms of infant mortality, in terms of life expectancy, in \nterms of preventable deaths.\n  We can do better. And right now, despite all of the lobbying money \ncoming in from the health care industry, the moral imperative is for \nMembers of Congress to think about the folks back home, the people who \nhave no health insurance, the people who are underinsured, the people \nwho are going bankrupt, the people who are staying at their work, not \nbecause they want to but because they have a decent health insurance \nprogram or the small business people who cannot invest in their company \nbecause they are busy spending all of their money on health care. We \ncan do better than that. We must do better than that. Now is the time.\n  I hope the American people work with us in standing up to very \npowerful special interests and moving us toward real health care \nreform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to briefly, before he leaves the \nfloor, commend my friend and colleague from Vermont. He has been a \nremarkable advocate, and this evening is yet one more example of it. He \nspeaks with that passion I love to hear about these issues and talks \nabout real people and what they go through every day.\n  I was thinking as he was talking, I say to Senator Sanders, there is \na wonderful small business guy in Connecticut named Penn Ritter. I have \nknown his family a long time. He got up and talked about his business \nand how difficult it has been to buy health care for his employees. He \ntalked about one particular case which is very moving.\n  They were laying people off. The economy was down. They didn't need \npeople. One of the people they were going to lay off had terminal \ncancer. He knew if he laid him off, he would have no access to the kind \nof health care coverage he would need to go through the difficult \nperiod he was about to go through. But the verdict was clear. This \nsmall business decided this was not going to happen. So they kept the \nman on, not because they could afford to keep him on--because they \ncouldn't afford it--but in good conscience they couldn't do that. There \nare people like that in small businesses all across our country, in \nevery community in which we reside, who make a difference every day. \nThere are wonderful providers and hospitals and places that take in \npeople and treat them every single day. I would like to see us, in this \nCongress, at least rise to the level of our citizenry who do these \nthings every day--the Penn Ritters of America, the doctors who work at \nManchester Memorial Hospital in Connecticut, those people who work at \nAmeriCare, those volunteer doctors who show up every day. I could go \ndown a long list, and every one of us can talk about what happens in \nour communities by caring people who help people maneuver and navigate \nin a difficult time during this health care crisis.\n\n  The least we should be able to do is to figure out how to meet the \nchallenges they meet every single day, and my colleague from Vermont is \nas eloquent as any other Member on this subject matter, and I thank him \nfor his comments.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank my colleague very much.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to call the attention of the Senate \nto the 40th anniversary of the Nevada Association for Latin Americans, \nInc. NALA is a Las Vegas-based organization that strives to provide low \nto moderate income families educational and social services to enhance \ntheir quality of life. NALA aids the people in the Silver State with \nexceptional services in education, language immersion, health \nprevention and immigration.\n  NALA was established as a nonprofit organization in 1969. As a \nHispanic social-service organization, NALA acquired a small daycare \ncenter in 1978. At the time it was serving mainly African-American \nfamilies, but now the center serves all low-income members of the \ncommunity. The Social Services that NALA offers include emergency \nrental, utility assistance, food vouchers, and food pantry assistance \nto individuals who qualify for assistance. During these difficult \neconomic times where many families are in dire need, we are grateful \nfor NALA's excellent services and resources.\n  The association's affordable preschool/childcare program benefits \nmore than 400 children annually. The preschool program includes an \nexceptional ESL program and meals for the children. Many of these \nchildren become so well versed in English, that most become teachers to \ntheir limited-English speaking parents. NALA offers HIV prevention \nservices and outreach to those living with AIDS through counseling, \nhealth care, and job training. In addition to their educational and \nhealth outreach, NALA offers immigration services through their \ntargeted program that assists with application processing, \nnaturalization preparation and employment referrals.\n  I praise the Nevada Association for Latin Americans, Inc. for their \n40 years of support to the low-income community of Nevada. It is \nthrough the hard work of organizations like NALA that low-income \nfamilies across Nevada and the United States will be able to overcome \nthe challenges of our current economy.\n\n[[Page S8678]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/03/senate-section/article/S8678-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                                BURUNDI\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, Burundi is a country that should receive \nmuch greater attention from this Congress and the Obama administration \nin the months and year ahead. As many of my colleagues will recall, \nBurundi was devastated by political violence throughout the 1990s, \nleaving over 100,000 people dead. Yet with the mediation of the late \nTanzanian President Julius Nyerere and then South African President \nNelson Mandela, and the active engagement of President Clinton, a peace \nagreement was finally signed in August 2000. Several armed groups \nrefused to accept the agreement, but they were brought into the fold \nover subsequent years. And in 2005, Burundi held multiparty national \nand local elections, a major milestone on its transition to peace.\n  In 2010, Burundi is set to hold its next round of elections. These \nelections have the potential to be another milestone in Burundi's path \ntoward reconciliation, lasting stability and democratic institutions. \nOver the last 4 years, Burundi has made significant progress in that \ndirection. However, there are still persistent tensions within \nBurundian society, which could be strained during this electoral \nperiod.\n  Despite all the progress that has been made, Burundi remains a \nfragile state and regularly appears on watch lists of countries \nvulnerable to internal conflict. For example, the Brookings \nInstitution's Weak States Index last year listed Burundi as the fifth \nweakest state in the world, behind Iraq, the DRC, Afghanistan, and \nSomalia. Moreover, according to the U.N. Human Development Index, \nBurundi continues to be one of the poorest countries in the world.\n  I have been particularly concerned by reports that both the Burundian \ngovernment and the armed opposition Forces for National Liberation--\nFNL--continue to resort to violence, intimidation and repression. \nAccording to the State Department's ``Country Reports on Human Rights \nPractices,'' members of the army, the police, and the National \nIntelligence Service were responsible for killings, torture, and \nbeatings of civilians and detainees in 2008, although there were fewer \nsuch reports than in the previous year. Human Rights Watch has \ndocumented a number of abuses committed against democratic political \nopponents by state agents and unofficial proxies in the first few \nmonths of 2009. Meanwhile, the FNL reportedly continues to abduct \ncivilians and use violence against local officials.\n  In the run-up to the 2010 elections, it is quite possible that these \nabuses and killings will increase as the parties compete for political \npower. Therefore, it is critical that the international community speak \nout now against human rights violations and the importance of \nmaintaining the rule of law. We need to press the Burundian government \nto ensure it is not participating in any abusive behavior and help it \nto improve the independence and capacity of its judicial institutions. \nWe also need to engage with and help strengthen the Electoral \nCommission so it can guard against any manipulation actual or perceived \nof the electoral process. Finally, we need to continue working with the \nUnited Nations Integrated Office in Burundi and the new Partnership for \nPeace in Burundi to advance disarmament and demobilization, \ntransitional justice, reconciliation and development efforts. Burundi's \npeace process has come a long way, but the process is far from \ncomplete.\n  The United States has a unique role to play in these efforts. Because \nof our role in helping to broker the Arusha peace accord, the United \nStates has significant good will in Burundi and is seen by many as a \ncredible arbiter. In the years since, we have continued to work with \nregional stakeholders in support of peace. In the months leading up to \nBurundi's election, we need to increase that support and amplify our \nvoice against abuses and political violence. I know President Obama's \nnominee to be our next ambassador to Burundi, Ambassador Pamela Slutz, \nunderstands these challenges and I look forward to working with her. \nWorking together, regional leaders and the international community can \nhelp Burundians avert an electoral crisis and keep the peace process on \ntrack.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/03/senate-section/article/S8678-2", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMMENDING RICHARD ``DICK'' PEMBROKE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to salute Richard ``Dick'' \nPembroke, of North Bennington, VT, for his years of service and \ndedication to the State of Vermont.\n  Dick has been chosen as this year's honoree at the fourth annual \nLiving History Day that will be held August 9, 2009. Dick's friends and \nfamily will pay tribute to him in downtown Bennington, for his many \nachievements and contributions to Bennington and to the State of \nVermont.\n  I have had the good fortune to have known Dick for many years. Born \nand raised on a family farm in my hometown of Montpelier, Dick and I \nalso share St. Michaels College in Vermont as our alma mater. He is a \ngood friend and I am delighted for him and the recognition that he is \nbeing given.\n  In honor of Dick Pembroke, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the \nBennington Banner's story, ``Pembroke will be honored August 9 as \n`Living History,' '' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Bennington Banner, July 23, 2009]\n\n        Pembroke will be honored August 9 as ``Living History''\n\n       North Bennington.--Richard ``Dick'' Pembroke of Harrington \n     Road will be this year's honoree for the fourth annual Living \n     History Day to be held on Aug. 9 in front of Powers Market.\n       A different resident is chosen each year to be recognized \n     for their achievements and contribution in shaping the local \n     community. The two-hour event offers others a venue to share \n     stories about the honoree and enjoy time with neighbors and \n     friends. In addition to stories, there will be music, Kevin's \n     hot dogs and much more. The event takes place from noon to 2 \n     p.m., is free and open to all ages.\n       Pembroke has lived a spiritually rich and diversified \n     private and public life. He was the eldest of four children, \n     born and raised in Vermont on the family farm in Montpelier. \n     He attended St. Michael's College in Winooski and \n     subsequently served in the Navy during the Korean War and \n     afterward, from 1951 to 1955. He met and married his wife, \n     MaryAnn, while stationed in Pensacola, Fla. Upon returning to \n     Vermont a short time later, he was employed at the First \n     National Grocery Store Corp.\n       Pembroke managed several stores before opening one in \n     Bennington in 1962. His love of horticulture and the outdoors \n     was insatiable. To fulfill this passion, he began a \n     landscaping business on the side, which gradually grew. In \n     1973, he left the grocery business and directed his full \n     attention to Pembroke Landscaping.\n       Being the father of one daughter and three sons kept him \n     busy and involved with loyal education. Pembroke coached \n     Little League and helped to construct the local Little League \n     park. He was also a member of the Mount Anthony Union High \n     School Booster Club from 1973 to 1980 as well as other school \n     organizations. Pembroke joined the Lions Club in 1957 and was \n     involved with building the current Lions Field. He was a \n     member of the University of Vermont board from 1980 to 1986, \n     director for the American Red Cross and a member of the \n     Knights of Columbus since 1963. He served on the Bennington \n     Zoning Board of Adjustment from 1975 to 1987 and was chairman \n     for 11 years.\n       In 1986, he discovered another avenue of public service \n     that suited him quite well: He was elected to the Vermont \n     House of Representatives, where he was chairman of the House \n     Transportation Committee for 12 of the 16 years he served. He \n     championed the construction of Route 279 in and around \n     Bennington and worked diligently on many infrastructure \n     projects related to safety and economic development.\n       In 2006, he was voted chamber of commerce person of the \n     year. ``Retirement'' is not a word in Pembroke's vocabulary. \n     He continues to keep a foot in the door of Pembroke \n     Landscaping and currently sits on the State Environmental \n     board as well as trustee/director of the Southwestern Vermont \n     Medical Center.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/03/senate-section/article/S8678-3", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8678-S8679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      COMMENDING EDDIE LEE PEPPLE\n\n Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today I honor Mr. Eddie Lee \nPepple, varsity basketball coach at Mercer Island High School, in \nretiring after 52 years of faithful service to our Nation and our \nyouth. His distinguished career has culminated as varsity coach at \nMercer Island High School where he has taught basketball for 42 years, \nleading the team to win 4 Washington State AAA Championships, and \ninspiring thousands of young students.\n  Coach Pepple was born in Denver, CO. He graduated from the University \nof Utah in 1955 with a bachelor of arts\n\n[[Page S8679]]\n\ndegree, and went on to serve in the Marine Corps from 1956-1957. He was \nthe captain of the Quantico Marine Corps basketball team and Pendleton \nMarine Corps basketball team, winning a Marine Corps Championship with \nthe Quantico Marines in 1956. He later earned his masters' degree in \n1965 at Oregon State University.\n  He began his coaching career in 1958 as the varsity basketball coach \nat Fife High School in Washington State, where he led the team to a 4th \nplace finish in the 1961 State Tournament. After 6 years of dedicated \nservice to Fife High School, Coach Pepple went on to be the assistant \ncoach at Meadowdale High School from 1964-1966, and then varsity coach \nat Mark Morris High School in 1967.\n  In 1968, Coach Ed Pepple began as varsity coach at Mercer Island High \nSchool, where he has led the team to 23 league championship \ntournaments, 4 final placements as State AAA Champions, and 13 second \nplace finishes in the State championship tournament. His overall \nwinning record during his tenure at Mercer Island High School is 78.8 \npercent after winning 882 of the 1119 games he has coached.\n  During these 52 years of devoted public service, Coach Pepple has \nbeen recognized by numerous organizations as an outstanding basketball \ncoach and is nationally renowned for his inspiration, dedication, and \nsuccess. In 1985, after leading Mercer Island High School to his first \nState AAA championship, Coach Pepple was awarded his first Coach of the \nYear Award by both the Kingco Conference, and the Washington State \nInterscholastic Basketball Association. He has since won the Kingco \nCoach of the year award five more times, and the Washington State \nInterscholastic Basketball Association award again in 1993.\n  In 1986, Coach Pepple was nationally celebrated when he received the \nRegion 7 Coach of the Year award from the National High School Athletic \nCoaches Association, NHSACA. He received this award once again in 1993 \nand 1998. In 1998 Coach Pepple was also recognized by the NHSACA as the \nNational Coach of the Year, one of the highest national awards a \ndistinguished coach can receive. He has also served as the prestigious \nWest Head Coach of the McDonald's All American Game, and served on the \nMcDonalds All American Game Selection Committee for 17 years.\n  In 1997 and 1999, the Washington Interscholastic Basketball Coaches \nAssociation also recognized Coach Pepple as the AAA Coach of the Year. \nHe has been the chairman of this organization for the past 26 years. In \ntotal, Coach Pepple has been awarded 17 Coach of the Year awards and \nhas been inaugurated into the Puget Sound Hall of Fame, the Washington \nInterscholastic Activities Association Hall of Fame, the Washington \nInterscholastic Basketball Coaches Association Hall of Fame, and most \nrecently the National High School Athletic Coaches Association Hall of \nFame in 2006.\n  Upon his retirement Coach Pepple will be inaugurated into the Everett \nCommunity College Hall of Fame, and honored by the establishment of the \nEd Pepple Coaches' Service Award by the Washington Interscholastic \nBasketball Coaches Association, as recognition of his service to the \nWashington State basketball community.\n  It is through the commitment and sacrifice of Americans such as Eddie \nLee Pepple that our young adults are able to thrive and succeed. He has \nbettered our communities in Washington State, and touched the lives of \ncountless students through his dedication to coaching and teaching. I \nam proud to thank him, his wife Shirley, and children Terry, Jill, \nJody, and Kyle for his honorable service to our Nation as a coach. I \ncongratulate Coach Pepple and give my best wishes as he concludes his \ndistinguished career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/03/senate-section/article/S8679-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/03/senate-section/article/S8679-2", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/03/senate-section/article/S8679-3", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., the House of Representatives, delivered by Mrs. Cole, \none of its reading clerks, announced that it has passed the following \nbills and joint resolution, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2510.

A bill to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \npermit facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs to be \ndesignated as voter registration agencies, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Veteran Voting \nSupport Act of 2009 with Senator Kerry, and our cosponsors: Senators \nDodd and Leahy.\n  This is a straightforward bill that shows our veterans the respect \nthat they deserve. Veterans have supported and served our Nation--many \nat great risk and sacrifice. It is unacceptable for us to allow \nbarriers to exist that make it more difficult for them to exercise \ntheir right to vote.\n  The bill that Senator Kerry and I are introducing today would require \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs to take steps to assist veterans \nwith voter registration and to make it easier for them to obtain \nballots and cast their votes.\n\n[[Page S8684]]\n\n  The most recent Census data we have--from a 2005 report--indicates \nthat more than 20 percent of our veterans are not registered to vote. \nThat means that almost 5 million veterans do not have an opportunity to \ncast their ballots.\n  Yet, we have massive VA programs in place that provide veterans with \nhealing and medical care, and ensure that they thrive on their return \nfrom military service.\n  In total, there are 1,261 total VA facilities. The Veterans Health \nAdministration operates 155 medical centers, 135 nursing homes, 717 \nambulatory care and clinic facilities; 45 residential rehabilitation \ntreatment programs, and 209 vet centers.\n  In those facilities there are as many as 5 million veterans who are \nnot registered to vote. That strikes me as a critical need unmet.\n  Even more disturbing, in certain cases, the VA has been hostile to \ncalls for it to facilitate voter registration and voting.\n  More than 2 years ago, I learned that a Department of Veterans \nAffairs facility in California had been opposing voter registration \nservices since 2004. I began inquiring and received conflicting \nanswers, but what was clear was that there was no cooperation or work \nto help veterans that used the facility to vote.\n  In Connecticut, Secretary of State Susan Bysiewicz defied the VA's \ndirective and tried to gain entry to a West Haven VA facility.\n  She intended to provide nonpartisan voter registration services, as \nwell as to show veterans how to use the new disabled-access voting \nsystems.\n  Guess what. She was turned away at the door.\n  As she was standing outside the door, she met a 91-year-old \ngentleman, a veteran of World War II. Secretary Bysiewicz asked him if \nhe would like to be registered to vote, and he said that he would.\n  After registering, he made the comment that ``I wanted to do this \nlast year--but there was no-one there to help me.'' That is wholly \nunacceptable.\n  Last year, throughout the year, Senator Kerry and I exchanged \nmultiple letters with the VA on this issue. We were told that VA \nofficials believed providing voting support or allowing groups to do so \nwould violate the Hatch Act.\n  The Hatch Act, however, prohibits partisan political activities from \nbeing conducted by Federal employees, on official time. It has not been \ninterpreted to include nonpartisan voter registration by the Office of \nSpecial Counsel, which interprets the Hatch Act. Furthermore, the \nveterans served by VA facilities are generally not Federal employees.\n  The VA then argued that nonpartisan voter registration services would \ncause ``disruptions to facility operations.''\n  That claim is even more dubious. Unless ``Rock the Vote'' comes to VA \nfacilities, voter registration drives are about as tame an activity as \nyou can get.\n  The law allows the Federal Government to choose to assist people with \nvoter registration if the State requests that a federal agency be \ndesignated as a registration facility under the National Voter \nRegistration Act and the agency accepts. Several States, including my \nhome State of California, under the leadership of Secretary Bowen, \nasked the VA designate facilities within their States under the \nNational Voter Registration Act. But they were refused.\n  Finally, after much negotiation, the VA settled on a new and \nsubstantially improved policy that allows state and local election \nofficials, as well as nonpartisan groups, access to VA facilities for \nvoter registration as long as they coordinate with the facility. This \nis a significant improvement, no doubt.\n  I believe, however, that Federal law is still necessary to ensure \nthat these voluntary policies are never rolled back, and that \nenforcement mechanisms are in place.\n  This is why we are introducing the Veteran Voting Support Act of \n2009. The bill would require the VA to provide voter registration forms \nwhenever veterans enroll in the VA health care system, or change their \nstatus or address in that system.\n  It would say that VA facilities must assist veterans who have trouble \nwith their voter registration forms in the same way that they help \nveterans fill out other forms, and it would say that veterans must be \nable to access and receive assistance with absentee ballots at VA \nfacilities.\n  It would allow nonpartisan groups and election officials to provide \nnonpartisan voter information and registration services to veterans.\n  And it would allow Attorney General enforcement through civil suits \nand injunctions and require an annual report to Congress from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs on progress related to this legislation.\n  It is a cornerstone of our democracy that every eligible citizen \nshould be registered and able to cast their vote.\n  This bill recognizes that nonpartisan and civil rights groups have \nlong played a critical role in helping people with the voter \nregistration process.\n  I believe it is time that we ensure that the Department of Veterans \nAffairs will provide veterans with the support they deserve to \nregister, cast their vote, and have that vote counted.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the Veteran Voting \nSupport Act of 2009.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1556\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Veteran Voting Support Act \n     of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Veterans have performed a great service to, and risked \n     the greatest sacrifice in the name of, our country, and \n     should be supported by the people and the Government of the \n     United States.\n       (2) Veterans are especially qualified to understand issues \n     of war, foreign policy, and government support for veterans, \n     and they should have the opportunity to voice that \n     understanding through voting.\n       (3) The Department of Veterans Affairs should assist \n     veterans to register to vote and to vote.\n\n     SEC. 3. VOTER REGISTRATION AND ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs (in this \n     section referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall provide a \n     mail voter registration application form to each veteran--\n       (1) who seeks to enroll in the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs health care system (including enrollment in a medical \n     center, a community living center, a community-based \n     outpatient center, or a domiciliary of the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs health care system), at the time of such \n     enrollment; and\n       (2) who is enrolled in such health care system--\n       (A) at any time when there is a change in the enrollment \n     status of the veteran; and\n       (B) at any time when there is a change in the address of \n     the veteran.\n       (b) Providing Voter Registration Information and \n     Assistance.--The Secretary shall provide to each veteran \n     described in subsection (a) the same degree of information \n     and assistance with voter registration as is provided by the \n     Veterans Administration with regard to the completion of its \n     own forms, unless the applicant refuses such assistance.\n       (c) Transmittal of Voter Registration Application Forms.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall accept completed voter \n     registration application forms for transmittal to the \n     appropriate State election official.\n       (2) Transmittal deadline.--\n       (A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (B), a completed \n     voter registration application form accepted at a medical \n     center, community living center, community-based outpatient \n     center, or domiciliary of the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     shall be transmitted to the appropriate State election \n     official not later than 10 days after the date of acceptance.\n       (B) Exception.--If a completed voter registration \n     application form is accepted within 5 days before the last \n     day for registration to vote in an election, the application \n     shall be transmitted to the appropriate State election \n     official not later than 5 days after the date of acceptance.\n       (d) Requirements of Voter Registration Information and \n     Assistance.--The Secretary shall ensure that the information \n     and assistance with voter registration that is provided under \n     subsection (b) will not--\n       (1) seek to influence an applicant's political preference \n     or party registration;\n       (2) display any such political preference or party \n     allegiance;\n       (3) make any statement to an applicant or take any action \n     the purpose or effect of which is to discourage the applicant \n     from registering to vote; or\n       (4) make any statement to an applicant or take any action \n     the purpose or effect of which is to lead the applicant to \n     believe that a decision to register or not register has any\n\n[[Page S8685]]\n\n     bearing on the availability of services or benefits.\n       (e) Limitation on Use of Information.--No information \n     relating to registering to vote, or a declination to register \n     to vote, under this section may be used for any purpose other \n     than voter registration.\n       (f) Enforcement.--\n       (1) Notice.--\n       (A) Notice to the facility director or the secretary.--A \n     person who is aggrieved by a violation of this section or \n     section 4 may provide written notice of the violation to the \n     Director of the facility of the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs health care system involved or to the Secretary. The \n     Director or the Secretary shall respond to a written notice \n     provided under the preceding sentence within 20 days of \n     receipt of such written notice.\n       (B) Notice to the attorney general and the election \n     assistance commission.--If the violation is not corrected \n     within 90 days after receipt of a notice under subparagraph \n     (A), the aggrieved person may provide written notice of the \n     violation to the Attorney General and the Election Assistance \n     Commission.\n       (2) Attorney general.--The Attorney General may bring a \n     civil action in an appropriate district court for such \n     declaratory or injunctive relief as is necessary to carry out \n     this section or section 4.\n\n     SEC. 4. ASSISTANCE WITH ABSENTEE BALLOTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Consistent with State and local laws, each \n     director of a community living center, a domiciliary, or a \n     medical center of the Department of Veterans Affairs health \n     care system shall provide assistance in voting by absentee \n     ballot to veterans residing in the community living center or \n     domiciliary or who are inpatients of the medical center, as \n     the case may be.\n       (b) Assistance Provided.--The assistance provided under \n     subsection (a) shall include--\n       (1) providing information relating to the opportunity to \n     request an absentee ballot;\n       (2) making available absentee ballot applications upon \n     request, as well as assisting in completing such applications \n     and ballots; and\n       (3) working with local election administration officials to \n     ensure proper transmission of absentee ballot applications \n     and absentee ballots.\n\n     SEC. 5. INFORMATION PROVIDED BY NONPARTISAN ORGANIZATIONS.\n\n       The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall permit nonpartisan \n     organizations to provide voter registration information and \n     assistance at facilities of the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs health care system, subject to reasonable time, \n     place, and manner restrictions, including limiting activities \n     to regular business hours and requiring advance notice.\n\n     SEC. 6.

A bill to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to \nprovide for the sharing of certain outer Continental Shelf revenues \nfrom areas in the Alaska Adjacent Zone; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I rise today for the first time on this \nfloor to mark the 50th anniversary of Alaska's statehood and to draw \nthe attention of my colleagues to an urgent issue that affects not only \nmy State but all of our States--the issue of global climate change.\n  This year, thanks to actions taken in this very Chamber, Alaska is \ncelebrating its golden anniversary of statehood. Acquiring the rights \nand responsibilities of full citizenship was the culmination of a dream \nfor citizens of the 49th State. Statehood granted us the ability to \nexercise control over our vast natural resources and gave us a full \nvoice in our national government. In the half century since, Alaska has \ngrown from the Nation's largest supplier of salmon to become the \nNation's storehouse of both seafood and energy.\n  Because of its strategic location near the top of the globe, Alaska \nplays a critical role in our Nation's defense. During the Cold War, the \nsuperpowers stared down each other across the frozen polar ice cap. \nThanks to a thaw in the geopolitical climate, the ``ice curtain'' \nseparating Alaska and Russia melted some 20 years ago. Today, it is a \nchange in the climate itself that present serious new challenges--and \ngreat opportunities--to my State and our Nation.\n  Alaska is now at Ground Zero for the effects of global climate \nchange. I take this opportunity today to detail how that is affecting \nthe lives of Alaskans. I will describe a package of legislation I am \nintroducing to prepare my State and the Nation for the next 50 years. \nDuring that time, the Arctic will play an even larger role in the \nNation's commerce, foreign policy, and energy independence.\n  Mr. President, to me there is no more dramatic illustration of global \nwarming in Alaska than these two pictures taken at Portage Glacier, \njust about 50 miles south of Anchorage. The top photo, taken by my dad \nin 1970, shows me and two of my brothers and a sister. The glacier is \nclearly in view. The bottom photo was taken 35 years later, in 2005. It \nis of my son, Jacob, standing in the exact same spot at the same time \nof year. The glacier is nowhere to be seen because it has dramatically \nreceded due to global warming.\n  Today in the Arctic, the sea is melting so fast that most of it could \nbe gone in 30 years. You can clearly see it in this polar projection of \nthe Arctic. The implications of the loss are enormous. Devastating for \nspecies such as the polar bear, walrus, and seals, which depend on ice \nfor their very survival; life-altering for Arctic residents who have \ndepended on marine mammals for their nutritional and cultural needs for \nthousands of years; literally earth-shattering for entire Alaskan \nArctic communities, which are being wiped away by erosion and thawing \npermafrost.\n\n  When this global air-conditioner is knocked off kilter, it \naccelerates climatic changes we are already witnessing around the globe \nthat neither science nor our political systems can stop.\n  Consider these examples.\n  Storms raging over waters that once were frozen solid but which are \nnow ice-free for much of the year are eroding sections of the Alaska \nshoreline at rates of 45 feet per year or more. This undermines entire \ncoastal villages like Shishmaref and Kivalina.\n  Thawing permafrost is causing roads and the foundations of homes to \nbuckle.\n  A recent study by the University of Alaska's Institute of Social and \nEconomic Research estimated that the impacts of climate change will \nincrease the cost of maintaining or replacing just today's public \ninfrastructure in my State by $6 billion.\n\n[[Page S8686]]\n\n  The potential release of massive amounts of methane now sealed in the \npermafrost threaten to accelerate the pace of climate change. That is \nknown to scientists as ``Arctic Feedback.''\n  Warming water temperatures are pushing cold water species north and \nattracting warm water species from the south. Fishermen in Sitka are \nencountering the giant Humboldt squid from Mexico.\n  Tuna--whose usual habitat favors the tropics--have been caught near \nHomer. And invasive species such as green crab are moving steadily \nnorthward.\n  Ocean acidification--the result of absorption of carbon into our \nmarine waters--weakens shellfish, coral, and even plankton, the very \nfirst link of the marine food chain.\n  At the G-8 Summit last month in Italy, developing nations agreed to \nthe principle of limiting the average increase in the Earth's \ntemperature to no more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial \nlevels.\n  In the American Arctic, we exceeded that long ago. The diminishing \nice creates opportunities in the Arctic, but even these pose new \nchallenges. For example, the Beaufort and Chukchi seas are believed to \ncontain almost twice as much oil as already has been produced from the \nNorth Slope.\n  Arctic oil and gas development has been conducted safely on-shore in \nAlaska. Alaskans also have the technology to safely produce it off-\nshore.\n  But subsistence users who rely on marine mammals for their way of \nlife are legitimately concerned about the special challenges of how to \nprevent and respond to an oil spill in broken sea ice.\n  The diminishing Arctic ice pack could open new grounds to commercial \nfishing, which can create new jobs. This also presents challenges to \nmanage fish stocks in this region as we learn more about the impact of \nfishing in these previously inaccessible waters.\n  Opening the Northwest Passage, the Northern Sea Route and eventually \nthe polar sea, will bring an increase in shipping and even tourism to \nthe Arctic. This means new economic development and additional jobs to \nthe northern part of our state.\n  Our neighbors have taken notice of the warming Arctic, too. This \npicture of a Russian submersible planting that country's flag on the \nNorth Pole's ocean floor was shocking to Americans and other Arctic \nnations.\n  The Swedish Foreign Minister, whose nation is president of the \nEuropean Union this year, demonstrates that Europe understands these \nchanges when he recently said the melting polar sea ice is creating \nrevolutionary new transportation possibilities between the Atlantic and \nPacific.\n  Although Alaskans are well aware of the impacts of climate change in \nour State, national decisionmakers are just starting to come to grips \nwith its challenges and opportunities.\n  A proposed American Arctic policy was adopted in the final days of \nthe Bush administration. While not perfect, it highlights many areas \nthat need further focus.\n  Here in the Congress, climate change has risen to a high priority in \nthese Halls and in the Obama administration.\n  I commend these many initiatives and pledge my cooperation with other \nMembers of this body and the national administration.\n  To advance that effort, today I am introducing a package of seven \nbills to address these challenges, almost all of which have been caused \nby, or made worse by, climate change.\n  I call this package--Inuvikput. It is a word from the Inupiaq Eskimos \nof the Alaska North Slope which means ``the place where we live.''\n  I can think of no more appropriate term coming from the very people \nwho are being affected every day by climatic changes in America's \nArctic, the place they have called home for thousands of years.\n  Mr. President, my package starts with improving our fundamental \nunderstanding of the region. We need to invest in basic science to \nbetter understand Arctic oceanography, meteorology, biology of its fish \nand marine mammals, as well as natural resources and oil and gas \npotential.\n  We need a coordinated research plan. It should start with baseline \nobservations and include better science supporting Arctic-specific oil \nspill prevention and response.\n  This plan also must include local and traditional knowledge. After \nall, some of the first and most accurate predictions of Arctic climate \nchange were from Native elders.\n  My bill calls on the Secretary of Commerce to undertake a \ncomprehensive strategy to coordinate Arctic research, to make \nrecommendations to Congress on a long-term Arctic Ocean research plan \nand to provide the resources for this vital mission.\n  We also need to promote Pan-Arctic research, especially with our \nRussian and Canadian neighbors, to address scientific issues that span \ninternational borders.\n  My second bill would provide the United States equal standing with \nother Arctic nations when it comes to our participation in the \ninternational Arctic Council and other forums.\n  Other leading Arctic nations--Russia, Canada, Norway--are represented \nby ambassador-level diplomats on the Council.\n  I appreciate the dedication of those who have represented us before \nthe Arctic Council and other forums. I also thank Secretary Clinton and \nother high level diplomats for their interest in the Arctic. But the \nUnited States needs a permanent representative on an equal footing with \nthe representatives of other nations in these important forums. Our \nAmbassador should advocate American interests in science, sustainable \ndevelopment, transportation and our defense posture.\n  The third piece of legislation deals with preparedness for the coming \nexpanded use of the Arctic. We must increase our investment in basic \ninfrastructure to maintain a permanent presence in the Arctic, for \nscientific, economic development and national security missions.\n  Critical to that is the need to replace our fleet of icebreakers. The \nPolar Sea and the currently idled Polar Star have both served beyond \ntheir 30-year life. The Healy is newer, but designed primarily for \nscientific research.\n  That scientific mission is important. But we need an icebreaking \nfleet to assert our national interests by patrolling our Arctic waters, \nmonitor increased traffic, and respond to search and rescues, oil \nspills and other incidents.\n  In addition to their life-saving mission, the Coast Guard is a vital \npartner with Alaska's commercial fishing industry. This $4 billlion \nindustry is one of our Nation's truly American industries, providing \n58,000 jobs. Our Coast Guard needs facilities to serve as a base for \naerial surveillance, spill prevention and emergency response \ncapabilities in the Arctic.\n  Currently, our closest Coast Guard air base is located in Kodiak, a \n900-mile commute just to reach the Arctic Coast. That's like patrolling \nthe Gulf of Mexico from air bases in New York.\n  I applaud the stamina of our Coast Guard crews who have kept our C-\n130s in the Arctic skies by performing maintenance work on the ramp in \nsubfreezing conditions. The least we could do is provide them with a \nheated hangar. My legislation would address that need and other \ncritical infrastructure needs.\n  Fourth, we must achieve a balance in environmentally responsible \nresource development in the Arctic. A diminished ice cap may clear the \nway for more affordable development of the enormous energy reserves the \nU.S. Geological Service says lie beneath Arctic waters. This region \ncontains an estimated 30 billion barrels of oil and 220 trillion cubic \nfeet of natural gas.\n  These resources can create thousands of American jobs and help assure \nour national energy security.\n  We must get the science right and provide the infrastructure \nnecessary to protect human and animal life and the environment.\n  To help achieve that, my measure calls on the Coast Guard to assess \nArctic development and develop the necessary infrastructure.\n  It also requires the Secretary of Commerce to direct research to \nprevent and improve oil spill recovery in Arctic waters.\n  My fifth bill deals with the benefits of energy development in the \nArctic. Most Alaskans support oil and gas exploration in the Outer \nContinental Shelf. We can do development there in the right way, as \nshown here.\n  Another example is BP's Liberty field, located off Alaska's northern\n\n[[Page S8687]]\n\ncoast. To minimize impacts, directional drilling from this island pad \ncan tap oil reserves 8 miles away in the water.\n  As a part of this package, my bill extends to Alaskans the same share \nof Federal revenues that residents of the gulf coast States currently \nreceive. It would direct a portion of those revenues to those most \naffected--the residents of Alaska's North Slope--where communities have \ndepended on marine mammals from these same waters for thousands of \nyears. I believe the Arctic's resources belong to the people of the \nArctic and should be shared among them.\n  My sixth bill deals with a critical omission from the new \nPresidential directive on the Arctic--addressing the health problems of \nArctic people.\n  Alaskans and others who live in Northern latitudes experience \nnumerous health problems, including higher rates of alcohol abuse, \ndiabetes, high blood pressure and, tragically death from injury and \nsuicide.\n  In many cases, it is unclear what causes these problems. More \nresearch is necessary into prevention and treatment.\n  This bill proposes a study of mental and behavioral health issues in \nthe Arctic. It would create an ``Arctic desk'' at the National \nInstitutes of Health that was called for in Federal legislation in 1984 \nbut has never been established.\n  Finally, it would institute a health assessment program at the \nCenters for Disease Control focused on the Arctic. This vital research \nwill not only benefit residents of my State but citizens across the \ncountry.\n  The seventh bill in this package addresses the huge losses of coastal \nAlaskan territory, as a result of dramatic climate change. A June 2009 \nGovernment Accountability Study on this issue says: ``most of Alaska's \nmore than 200 Native villages are affected to some degree by flooding \nand erosion.'' In some cases, entire Arctic villages in my State are at \nrisk of serious erosion or of being washed into the sea.\n  To make matters worse, some of the most severe flooding in recent \nhistory occurred this spring. Millions of dollars in damage was done to \nAlaska communities, prompting State and Federal disaster declarations.\n  To address these issues, I propose creation of an Arctic adaptation \nfund. This fund would help the State of Alaska, Alaska Native \norganizations, affected Arctic communities, and the private sector deal \nwith the impacts of climate change. This includes flooding, erosion, \npermafrost melting, and damage to public transportation systems and \nbuildings. The fund also would assist in dealing with habitat \nrestoration, clean energy development, and other economic development \nactivities.\n  Mr. President, I am considering introducing an additional piece of \nlegislation in this package. It focuses on providing the people of \nAlaska's Arctic with a greater voice in development decisions affecting \ntheir lives.\n  This bill would establish on Arctic Regional Citizens Advisory \nCouncil. It would be modeled after similar councils operating \nsuccessfully in the Prince William Sound and Cook Inlet regions of \nAlaska.\n  At the request of North Slope Borough Mayor Edward Itta and our \nconstituents there, I agreed to hold off on this bill for now so we can \ncontinue the conversation with the people of the region, along with \nindustry and regulatory stakeholders.\n  In addition to the legislation I am introducing today, Senate \nratification of two treaties would dramatically improve our Nation's \nability to address Arctic climate change.\n  The first is the Convention on the Law of the Sea. Negotiated in \n1982, this treaty is designed to settle long-standing disputes over \nnational rights to offshore waters and resources. The Senate's \nratification of this treaty would put the United States at the table at \na time of great change in the Arctic.\n  I note support for the Law of the Sea Treaty comes from a broad \nspectrum of organizations, from environmental groups and oil companies \nto the U.S. military.\n  I strongly support ratification of the Law of the Sea Treaty and will \nbe proud to cosponsor this measure.\n  The second key international agreement the Senate should ratify to \naddress Arctic health issues is the Treaty on Persistent Organic \nPollutants, or POPs.\n  These pollutants--PCBs, DDT, dioxin, and even fire retardants--are \ncarried by wind and sea currents to the Arctic. They are then trapped \nby the ice and are stored in the fatty tissue of fish and marine \nmammals that are a main component of the local subsistence diet.\n  The POPs treaty was adopted in 2001. But like the Law of the Sea, it \nhas never been ratified. It is time that changed. I am honored to be a \ncosponsor of Senator Harkin's bill, S. 519, to implement provisions of \nthis treaty.\n  I look forward to working with the chairman and ranking member of the \nForeign Relations Committee and the Obama Administration to bring these \ntreaties forward to the Senate for consideration as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, because of Alaska, America is an Arctic nation. My \nState has over 700 miles of shoreline along the Arctic Ocean, and over \n100 million acres above the Arctic Circle. If you define Arctic by \ntemperature, it encompasses an even broader area that includes the \nBering Sea and the Aleutian Islands.\n  Through the diligent work of many scientists, we have learned much \nover the past century. But there is much we still do not understand.\n  This century, and the next 50 years of Alaska statehood, brings great \nchallenges and even greater opportunities. To succeed, we must address \nthe broad policy implications of an ice-diminishing Arctic on the \ndiplomatic, scientific, and national security fronts.\n  We must make the needed investments to ensure the United States \nmaintains its leadership at the top of our globe. We must listen to and \naddress the needs of the residents of the Arctic.\n  With this Inuvikput package of legislation, we will take a major step \ntoward achieving these important goals.\n  As they say in America's Arctic, Quyanaqpak. Thank you.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Casey):\n  S. 1568. A bill to assist in the establishment of an interpretive \ncenter and museum in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, to protect and interpret \nthe history of the industrialization of the United States; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation that will honor and preserve the industrial legacy of our \nNation for the benefit of current and future generations. The bill, \nwhich I am introducing along with my Pennsylvania colleague Senator Bob \nCasey, would establish a partnership between the Department of Interior \nand the National Museum of Industrial History: a museum and \ninterpretive center to be located at the site of the former Bethlehem \nSteel Plant in Bethlehem, PA.\n  The industrial revolution was a critical period in American history, \nduring which our country and the foundation of our national economy \nexperienced an unprecedented transition. It is important that people, \nespecially children and future generations, have an opportunity to \nlearn about the history of American industrialization and how it shaped \nour world and our lives. For this opportunity to be realized, the \ntimeless stories and treasured relics of our industrial history must be \npreserved, interpreted and made available for all to see, study and \nenjoy. The National Museum of Industrial History will exist for just \nthis purpose.\n  The Museum will be located at an ideal site to tell the story of \nAmerica's industrial history because the former tenant of the site was \na lead character in the story. The Bethlehem Steel Company was a world-\nleader in steel production for nearly 150 years and truly epitomized \nthe industrial revolution and expansion throughout the 19th and 20th \ncenturies. Steel produced in Bethlehem was used to build some our \ncountry's most treasured structures and landmarks, including the \nChrysler Building in New York City and the Golden Gate Bridge in San \nFrancisco. Bethlehem Steel was a major contributor to the war effort \nduring the first and second World Wars, building many ships and \nsupplying much of the armored plating and large-caliber guns for our \narmed forces. Bethlehem Steel began to cease much of its operation in \nthe 1990s and was bought by another\n\n[[Page S8688]]\n\nsteel company in 2001. The closing of Bethlehem Steel marked the end of \nan era and also created one of the largest brownfield sites in the \ncountry. It is on this site, rich in history and industrial heritage, \nwhere the National Museum of Industrial History will stand as a \nmonument to industry and as an educational resource to the public.\n  The legislation I have introduced will establish an agreement between \nthe Department of Interior and the National Museum of Industrial \nHistory, wherein the Department will assist in the creation and program \ndevelopment of the Museum. Every dollar provided by the Federal \nGovernment would have to be matched by a non-Federal source. The Museum \nhas a long history of working with the Federal Government. The National \nMuseum of Industrial History was the first museum to become affiliated \nwith the Smithsonian Institute. This partnership spawned the \nSmithsonian Institute's ``Affiliates Program,'' which now has over 150 \nmembers around the country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW:\n  S. 1569. A bill to expand our Nation's Advanced Practice Registered \nNurse workforce; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \naddress our growing workforce shortage. I am pleased to be joining my \ngood friend, Congresswoman Lois Capps, a nurse herself, in introducing \nthis legislation. Our legislation is supported by AARP, the American \nAcademy of Nurse Practitioners, the American Association of Colleges of \nNursing, the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists, the American \nCollege of Nurse Practitioners, the American College of Nurse-Midwives, \nthe American Nurses Association, the National Association of Pediatric \nNurse Practitioners, and the National Organization of Nurse \nPractitioner Faculties.\n  Since its creation in 1965, Medicare has provided some support for \nthe costs of nursing education. While relatively small as compared to \nsupport for graduate medical education for physicians, $150 million vs. \n$9 billion per year, Medicare has for many years been the largest \nfederal source of funding for nurse training. While nursing education \nand patient care needs have changed tremendously since 1965, Medicare's \npolicy in this area has not kept up to date.\n  My bill amends Medicare to provide incentives to expand the number of \nadvanced practice registered nurses, APRN, trained and to prepare them \nto undertake the essential cost-saving reforms to our health care \ndelivery system: an increased focus on primary and preventive care, \nimproved coordination of care, access to primary care and anesthesia \nservices in rural and medically underserved areas, and enhanced efforts \nto reduce costly medical errors that will lower health care costs and \nimprove patient care. This legislation also focuses on training nurses \nin community-based settings, such as community health centers, rural \nclinics and individual health professional offices, arming them with \nthe practical clinical experience they need.\n  The respected economic analysis firm The Lewin Group has conducted a \nthorough analysis of this proposal. They found that it would increase \nthe number of APRNs graduating by 25 percent. This is a very \nsignificant increase and one that is greatly needed. Additionally, \ntraining more APRNs will help us develop more faculty, which are \ndesperately needed to train the next generation of nurses. Every \nnursing school dean in Michigan has told me that this is a huge issue \nto them.\n  This relatively modest investment in APRNs will provide Americans, \nespecially those in rural and other areas of health care shortages, \nwith the primary and preventive care, care coordination, and chronic \ncare management they too often lack today.\n  At a time when our country faces a shortage of healthcare \nprofessionals, funding for the clinical education of APRNs, including \nnurse practitioners, certified nurse-midwives, certified registered \nnurse anesthetists, and clinical nurse specialists is vitally important \nto meet the demand for expanded health care, which is expected under a \nnewly reformed delivery system.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 29, 2009.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     133 Senate Hart Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: On behalf of the undersigned \n     organizations, we would like to express our support for your \n     legislation that will amend Title XVIII of the Social \n     Security Act to provide payment to hospitals for the costs of \n     expanded advanced practice nurse training programs. At a time \n     when our country faces a shortage of healthcare \n     professionals, funding for the clinical education of Advanced \n     Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs), including nurse \n     practitioners, certified nurse-midwives, certified registered \n     nurse anesthetists, and clinical nurse specialists is vitally \n     important to meet the demand for expanded health care, which \n     is expected under a newly reformed delivery system.\n       APRNs are ideally suited to help implement delivery system \n     reforms such as an increased focus on primary, transitional, \n     and preventive care, enhancing access for rural and medically \n     underserved populations, improving care coordination, chronic \n     care management, and reducing costly medical errors. Yet in \n     2008, U.S. nursing schools turned away 6,904 qualified \n     applicants from graduate nursing programs due to insufficient \n     numbers of faculty, clinical sites, classroom space, clinical \n     preceptors, and budget constraints. This Medicare funding \n     would expand the current focus to nursing education at the \n     graduate level. It would also expand clinical education \n     provided through Medicare funding to include home and \n     community-based settings as well as hospitals, using \n     affiliations between accredited schools of nursing and \n     community-based health care settings. The outcome would be a \n     much more robust APRN workforce to meet growing demand \n     especially among the Medicare population and those in \n     underserved areas. In fact, according to a Lewin report \n     commissioned by AARP to investigate this type of proposal, \n     your bill would increase the number of APRNs by 25%.\n       We applaud your efforts and those of your staff for \n     introducing Graduate Nursing Education legislation, which \n     will benefit future APRNs so they can provide high quality, \n     cost effective care to the most vulnerable populations in all \n     areas across the country. Thank you for your recognition of \n     the role APRNs will play in a reformed healthcare system.\n           Sincerely,\n         AARP, American Academy of Nurse Practitioners, American \n           Association of Colleges of Nursing, American \n           Association of Nurse Anesthetists, American College of \n           Nurse Practitioners, American College of Nurse-\n           Midwives, American Nurses Association, National \n           Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, National \n           Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculties.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/03/senate-section/article/S8688-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8688-S8689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 234--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL SAVE \n                        FOR RETIREMENT WEEK 2009\n\n  Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Enzi, and Mr. Cardin) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 234\n\n       Whereas people in the United States are living longer and \n     the cost of retirement continues to rise, in part because the \n     number of employers providing retiree health coverage \n     continues to decline and retiree health care costs continue \n     to increase at a rapid pace;\n       Whereas Social Security remains the bedrock of retirement \n     income for the great majority of the people of the United \n     States, but was never intended by Congress to be the sole \n     source of retirement income for families;\n       Whereas recent data from the Employee Benefit Research \n     Institute indicates that, in the United States, less than \\2/\n     3\\ of workers or their spouses save for retirement, and that \n     the actual amount of retirement savings of workers lags far \n     behind the amount that will be needed to adequately fund \n     their retirement years;\n       Whereas saving for retirement is a key component to overall \n     financial health and security during retirement years;\n       Whereas many workers may not be aware of retirement savings \n     options, or may not have focused on the importance of, and \n     need for, saving for retirement;\n       Whereas many employees have access to defined benefit and \n     defined contribution plans to help prepare for retirement, \n     yet many may not take advantage of employer-sponsored defined \n     contribution plans at all or to the full extent allowed by \n     the plans under Federal law;\n       Whereas many workers saving for retirement through tax-\n     preferred savings plans have experienced declines in account \n     values due to the recent economic downturn and market \n     decline, making continued contributions all the more \n     important;\n\n[[Page S8689]]\n\n       Whereas all workers, including public- and private-sector \n     employees, employees of tax-exempt organizations, and self-\n     employed individuals, can benefit from the advantages of tax-\n     preferred savings plans, and from increased awareness of the \n     need to develop personal budgets, and financial plans; and\n       Whereas October 18 through October 24, 2009, has been \n     designated as ``National Save for Retirement Week 2009'': \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Save for \n     Retirement Week 2009;\n       (2) supports efforts to raise public awareness of the need \n     to use efficiently the substantial tax revenues, estimated to \n     exceed $127,000,000,000 for the fiscal year 2009 budget, that \n     subsidize retirement savings;\n       (3) supports efforts to raise public awareness of the \n     importance of saving adequately for retirement and of the \n     availability of tax-preferred employer-sponsored retirement \n     savings plans; and\n       (4) calls on States, localities, schools, universities, \n     nonprofit organizations, businesses, other entities, and the \n     people of the United States to observe National Save for \n     Retirement Week with appropriate programs and activities with \n     the goal of increasing the retirement savings for all the \n     people in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/03/senate-section/article/S8689-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 235--DESIGNATING AUGUST 16, 2009, AS ``NATIONAL \n                             AIRBORNE DAY''\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, Mr. Reed, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \nByrd, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Begich, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Burr, Mr. \nCrapo, Mrs. Hagan, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Inouye, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Cochran, \nMr. Conrad, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Burris, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Bingaman, \nMr. Cardin, Mr. Reid, Mr. Thune, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Casey, Mr. Merkley, \nMr. Lieberman, Mr. Bond, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Corker) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 235\n\n       Whereas the airborne forces of the Armed Forces have a long \n     and honorable history as units of adventuresome, hardy, and \n     fierce warriors who, for the national security of the United \n     States and the defense of freedom and peace, project the \n     effective ground combat power of the United States by Air \n     Force air transport to the far reaches of the battle area \n     and, indeed, to the far corners of the world;\n       Whereas August 16 marks the anniversary of the first \n     official Army parachute jump on August 16, 1940, an event \n     that validated the innovative concept of inserting United \n     States ground combat forces behind a battle line by means of \n     a parachute;\n       Whereas the United States experiment with airborne infantry \n     attack began on June 25, 1940, when the Army Parachute Test \n     Platoon was first authorized by the Department of War, and \n     was launched when 48 volunteers began training in July 1940;\n       Whereas the success of the Army Parachute Test Platoon in \n     the days immediately before the entry of the United States \n     into World War II led to the formation of a formidable force \n     of airborne units that have served with distinction and have \n     had repeated success in armed hostilities;\n       Whereas among those airborne units are the former 11th, \n     13th, and 17th Airborne Divisions, the venerable 82nd \n     Airborne Division, the versatile 101st Airborne Division (Air \n     Assault), and the airborne regiments and battalions (some as \n     components of those divisions, some as separate units) that \n     achieved distinction as the elite 75th Ranger Regiment, the \n     173rd Airborne Brigade, the 187th Infantry (Airborne) \n     Regiment, the 503rd, 507th, 508th, 517th, 541st, and 542nd \n     Parachute Infantry Regiments, the 88th Glider Infantry \n     Regiment, the 509th, 551st, and 555th Parachute Infantry \n     Battalions, the 325th and 327th Glider Infantry, and the \n     550th Airborne Infantry Battalion;\n       Whereas the achievements of the airborne forces during \n     World War II prompted the evolution of those forces into a \n     diversified force of parachute and air-assault units that, \n     over the years, have fought in Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, \n     Panama, the Persian Gulf region, and Somalia, and have \n     engaged in peacekeeping operations in Lebanon, the Sinai \n     Peninsula, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo;\n       Whereas the modern-day airborne force that has evolved from \n     those World War II beginnings is an agile, powerful force \n     that, in large part, is composed of the 82nd Airborne \n     Division, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), and the \n     75th Ranger Regiment;\n       Whereas the modern-day airborne force also includes other \n     elite forces composed entirely of airborne trained and \n     qualified special operations warriors, including Army Special \n     Forces, Marine Corps Reconnaissance units, Navy SEALs, and \n     Air Force combat control teams, each of which is part of the \n     United States Special Operations Command;\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the \n     United States on September 11, 2001, the 75th Ranger \n     Regiment, special forces units, and units of the 82nd \n     Airborne Division and the 101st Airborne Division (Air \n     Assault), together with other units of the Armed Forces, have \n     been prosecuting the war against terrorism by carrying out \n     combat operations in Afghanistan, training operations in the \n     Philippines, and other operations elsewhere;\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the \n     United States on September 11, 2001, airborne units played a \n     pivotal role in the war in Afghanistan, including the \n     unflinching pursuit of the enemies of the United States \n     during the battles of Mazar-i Sharif, Kabul, Qala-i-Jangi, \n     Tora Bora, and Operation Anaconda;\n       Whereas United States paratroopers, which include the 82d \n     Airborne Division, 75th Ranger Regiment, Special Operations \n     Forces, 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat team, and elements of \n     the 4th Brigade 25th Infantry Division, have demonstrated \n     bravery and honor in an effort to pursue the enemies of the \n     United States, to stabilize Afghanistan, and to strive for \n     calm in a troubled region;\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the announcement of Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom by President George W. Bush in March 2003, the \n     75th Ranger Regiment, special forces units, and units of the \n     82nd Airborne Division, the 101st Airborne Division (Air \n     Assault), the 173rd Airborne Brigade, and the 4th Brigade \n     Combat Team (Airborne) of the 25th Infantry Division, \n     together with other units of the Armed Forces, have been \n     prosecuting the war against terrorism, carrying out combat \n     operations, conducting civil affairs missions, and assisting \n     in establishing democracy in Iraq;\n       Whereas the airborne forces are, and will continue to be, \n     at the ready and the forefront until the Global War on \n     Terrorism is concluded;\n       Whereas of the members and former members of the United \n     States airborne forces, all have achieved distinction by \n     earning the right to wear the ``Silver Wings of Courage'' of \n     the United States airborne forces, thousands have achieved \n     the distinction of making combat jumps, 69 have earned the \n     Medal of Honor, and hundreds have earned the Distinguished-\n     Service Cross, Silver Star, or other decorations and awards \n     for displays of such traits as heroism, gallantry, \n     intrepidity, and valor;\n       Whereas the members and former members of the United States \n     airborne forces are all members of a proud and honorable \n     fraternity of the profession of arms that is made exclusive \n     by those distinctions which, together with their special \n     skills and achievements, distinguish them as intrepid combat \n     parachutists, special operation forces, and, in former days, \n     glider troops;\n       Whereas the history and achievements of the members and \n     former members of the airborne forces of the United States \n     Armed Forces warrant special expressions of the gratitude of \n     the people of the United States; and\n       Whereas, since the airborne community celebrates August 16 \n     as the anniversary of the first official jump by the Army \n     Parachute Test Platoon, August 16 would be an appropriate day \n     to recognize as National Airborne Day: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates August 16, 2009, as ``National Airborne \n     Day''; and\n       (2) calls on the people of the United States to observe \n     National Airborne Day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, \n     and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/03/senate-section/article/S8689-2", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8689-S8690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 236--COMMEMORATING THE 175TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n      ABOLITION OF SLAVERY IN THE BRITISH EMPIRE ON AUGUST 1, 1834\n\n  Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. \nBrownback) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 234\n\n       Whereas people in the United States are living longer and \n     the cost of retirement continues to rise, in part because the \n     number of employers providing retiree health coverage \n     continues to decline and retiree health care costs continue \n     to increase at a rapid pace;\n       Whereas Social Security remains the bedrock of retirement \n     income for the great majority of the people of the United \n     States, but was never intended by Congress to be the sole \n     source of retirement income for families;\n       Whereas recent data from the Employee Benefit Research \n     Institute indicates that, in the United States, less than \\2/\n     3\\ of workers or their spouses save for retirement, and that \n     the actual amount of retirement savings of workers lags far \n     behind the amount that will be needed to adequately fund \n     their retirement years;\n       Whereas saving for retirement is a key component to overall \n     financial health and security during retirement years;\n       Whereas many workers may not be aware of retirement savings \n     options, or may not have focused on the importance of, and \n     need for, saving for retirement;\n       Whereas many employees have access to defined benefit and \n     defined contribution\n\n[[Page S8700]]\n\n     plans to help prepare for retirement, yet many may not take \n     advantage of employer-sponsored defined contribution plans at \n     all or to the full extent allowed by the plans under Federal \n     law;\n       Whereas many workers saving for retirement through tax-\n     preferred savings plans have experienced declines in account \n     values due to the recent economic downturn and market \n     decline, making continued contributions all the more \n     important;\n       Whereas all workers, including public- and private-sector \n     employees, employees of tax-exempt organizations, and self-\n     employed individuals, can benefit from the advantages of tax-\n     preferred savings plans, and from increased awareness of the \n     need to develop personal budgets, and financial plans; and\n       Whereas October 18 through October 24, 2009, has been \n     designated as ``National Save for Retirement Week 2009'': \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Save for \n     Retirement Week 2009;\n       (2) supports efforts to raise public awareness of the need \n     to use efficiently the substantial tax revenues, estimated to \n     exceed $127,000,000,000 for the fiscal year 2009 budget, that \n     subsidize retirement savings;\n       (3) supports efforts to raise public awareness of the \n     importance of saving adequately for retirement and of the \n     availability of tax-preferred employer-sponsored retirement \n     savings plans; and\n       (4) calls on States, localities, schools, universities, \n     nonprofit organizations, businesses, other entities, and the \n     people of the United States to observe National Save for \n     Retirement Week with appropriate programs and activities with \n     the goal of increasing the retirement savings for all the \n     people in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/03/senate-section/article/S8700-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL AIRBORNE DAY\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 235\n\n       Whereas the airborne forces of the Armed Forces have a long \n     and honorable history as units of adventuresome, hardy, and \n     fierce warriors who, for the national security of the United \n     States and the defense of freedom and peace, project the \n     effective ground combat power of the United States by Air \n     Force air transport to the far reaches of the battle area \n     and, indeed, to the far corners of the world;\n       Whereas August 16 marks the anniversary of the first \n     official Army parachute jump on August 16, 1940, an event \n     that validated the innovative concept of inserting United \n     States ground combat forces behind a battle line by means of \n     a parachute;\n       Whereas the United States experiment with airborne infantry \n     attack began on June 25, 1940, when the Army Parachute Test \n     Platoon was first authorized by the Department of War, and \n     was launched when 48 volunteers began training in July 1940;\n       Whereas the success of the Army Parachute Test Platoon in \n     the days immediately before the entry of the United States \n     into World War II led to the formation of a formidable force \n     of airborne units that have served with distinction and have \n     had repeated success in armed hostilities;\n       Whereas among those airborne units are the former 11th, \n     13th, and 17th Airborne Divisions, the venerable 82nd \n     Airborne Division, the versatile 101st Airborne Division (Air \n     Assault), and the airborne regiments and battalions (some as \n     components of those divisions, some as separate units) that \n     achieved distinction as the elite 75th Ranger Regiment, the \n     173rd Airborne Brigade, the 187th Infantry (Airborne) \n     Regiment, the 503rd, 507th, 508th, 517th, 541st, and 542nd \n     Parachute Infantry Regiments, the 88th Glider Infantry \n     Regiment, the 509th, 551st, and 555th Parachute Infantry \n     Battalions, the 325th and 327th Glider Infantry, and the \n     550th Airborne Infantry Battalion;\n       Whereas the achievements of the airborne forces during \n     World War II prompted the evolution of those forces into a \n     diversified force of parachute and air-assault units that, \n     over the years, have fought in Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, \n     Panama, the Persian Gulf region, and Somalia, and have \n     engaged in peacekeeping operations in Lebanon, the Sinai \n     Peninsula, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo;\n       Whereas the modern-day airborne force that has evolved from \n     those World War II beginnings is an agile, powerful force \n     that, in large part, is composed of the 82nd Airborne \n     Division, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), and the \n     75th Ranger Regiment;\n       Whereas the modern-day airborne force also includes other \n     elite forces composed entirely of airborne trained and \n     qualified special operations warriors, including Army Special \n     Forces, Marine Corps Reconnaissance units, Navy SEALs, and \n     Air Force combat control teams, each of which is part of the \n     United States Special Operations Command;\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the \n     United States on September 11, 2001, the 75th Ranger \n     Regiment, special forces units, and units of the 82nd \n     Airborne Division and the 101st Airborne Division (Air \n     Assault), together with other units of the Armed Forces, have \n     been prosecuting the war against terrorism by carrying out \n     combat operations in Afghanistan, training operations in the \n     Philippines, and other operations elsewhere;\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the \n     United States on September 11, 2001, airborne units played a \n     pivotal role in the war in Afghanistan, including the \n     unflinching pursuit of the enemies of the United States \n     during the battles of Mazar-i Sharif, Kabul, Qala-i-Jangi, \n     Tora Bora, and Operation Anaconda;\n       Whereas United States paratroopers, which include the 82d \n     Airborne Division, 75th Ranger Regiment, Special Operations \n     Forces, 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat team, and elements of \n     the 4th Brigade 25th Infantry Division, have demonstrated \n     bravery and honor in an effort to pursue the enemies of the \n     United States, to stabilize Afghanistan, and to strive for \n     calm in a troubled region;\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the announcement of Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom by President George W. Bush in March 2003, the \n     75th Ranger Regiment, special forces units, and units of the \n     82nd Airborne Division, the 101st Airborne Division (Air \n     Assault), the 173rd Airborne Brigade, and the 4th Brigade \n     Combat Team (Airborne) of the 25th Infantry Division, \n     together with other units of the Armed Forces, have been \n     prosecuting the war against terrorism, carrying out combat \n     operations, conducting civil affairs missions, and assisting \n     in establishing democracy in Iraq;\n       Whereas the airborne forces are, and will continue to be, \n     at the ready and the forefront until the Global War on \n     Terrorism is concluded;\n       Whereas of the members and former members of the United \n     States airborne forces, all have achieved distinction by \n     earning the right to wear the ``Silver Wings of Courage'' of \n     the United States airborne forces, thousands have achieved \n     the distinction of making combat jumps, 69 have earned the \n     Medal of Honor, and hundreds have earned the Distinguished-\n     Service Cross, Silver Star, or other decorations and awards \n     for displays of such traits as heroism, gallantry, \n     intrepidity, and valor;\n       Whereas the members and former members of the United States \n     airborne forces are all members of a proud and honorable \n     fraternity of the profession of arms that is made exclusive \n     by those distinctions which, together with their special \n     skills and achievements, distinguish them as intrepid combat \n     parachutists, special operation forces, and, in former days, \n     glider troops;\n       Whereas the history and achievements of the members and \n     former members of the airborne forces of the United States \n     Armed Forces warrant special expressions of the gratitude of \n     the people of the United States; and\n       Whereas, since the airborne community celebrates August 16 \n     as the anniversary of the first official jump by the Army \n     Parachute Test Platoon, August 16 would be an appropriate day \n     to recognize as National Airborne Day: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates August 16, 2009, as ``National Airborne \n     Day''; and\n       (2) calls on the people of the United States to observe \n     National Airborne Day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, \n     and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/03/senate-section/article/S8700-2", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8700-S8701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCOMMEMORATING THE 175TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY IN THE \n                             BRITISH EMPIRE\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Res. 236\n\n       Whereas the United States and the United Kingdom have \n     become beacons of freedom and democracy around the world;\n       Whereas the history of the people of Africa is inextricably \n     tied to the histories of the United States and the United \n     Kingdom;\n       Whereas, for centuries, millions of people from Africa and \n     their descendants were enslaved in the United States and the \n     territories of the British Empire;\n       Whereas the slave trade spanned many regions of the world, \n     including Africa, the Caribbean, the United States, and \n     territories of the British Empire;\n       Whereas the people of Africa forced into slavery were \n     dehumanized, humiliated, abused, and often separated from \n     their families to be sold;\n       Whereas the institution of slavery, predicated upon racist \n     beliefs, infected and corrupted the social fabrics of the \n     United States and the United Kingdom;\n       Whereas the Underground Railroad embodied courage, \n     hospitality, and fortitude, and served as an impetus for the \n     abolition of slavery;\n       Whereas the Underground Railroad provided a means of escape \n     from slavery by incorporating a network of abolitionists, \n     secret routes, and safe houses throughout the United States \n     and the territories of the British Empire;\n       Whereas the efforts of Harriet Tubman and like-minded \n     abolitionists in the Underground Railroad helped tens of \n     thousands of slaves escape to freedom during the early 19th \n     century;\n       Whereas Harriet Tubman demonstrated her fearless devotion \n     to liberty during her service as a conductor on the \n     Underground Railroad and was responsible for leading fugitive \n     slaves through the countryside to safe houses;\n       Whereas Harriet Tubman became known as ``Moses'' among \n     slaves and abolitionists because her estimated 19 trips in \n     the decade following her emancipation in 1849 to States that \n     permitted slavery led to the liberation of approximately 300 \n     slaves;\n       Whereas the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 jeopardized the \n     safety of escaped slaves in the United States;\n       Whereas the establishment of Underground Railroad safe \n     houses in Canada, a territory of the British Empire, provided \n     a safe haven for escaped slaves;\n       Whereas the abolition of slavery in the British Empire on \n     August 1, 1834, established a chief terminal for the \n     Underground Railroad and laid the foundation for the eventual \n     abolition of slavery in the United States;\n       Whereas the Salem Chapel British Methodist Episcopal Church \n     in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada, served as an important \n     center of abolitionist activity and served as the final \n     destination for many escaped slaves;\n       Whereas many freed slaves became members of Salem Chapel \n     British Methodist Episcopal Church and settled in the \n     community; and\n       Whereas the abolition of slavery in the British Empire \n     influenced the United States by setting the precedent that \n     the dehumanizing practice of slavery would not, and could \n     not, be tolerated if a Nation is to conform with the \n     fundamental tenets of democracy and equality for all people: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the fundamental importance of the abolition \n     of slavery in the British Empire in the history of the United \n     States and Canada; and\n       (2) celebrates the 175th anniversary of the abolition of \n     slavery in the British Empire on August 1, 1834.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/03/senate-section/article/S8701-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 3435\n\n  Mr. DODD.
