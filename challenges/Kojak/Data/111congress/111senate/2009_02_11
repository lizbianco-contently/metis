Madam President, I would like to take this time to bring \nus up-to-date on where we stand with this recession, nationally and in \nmy home State, and also to alert the American people to something.\n  In 1993, when Bill Clinton got elected, this country was in a lot of \ntrouble. We had terrible deficits--we had a terrible trade deficit, we \nhad debt. President Clinton and the Democratic Congress came in, and we \nsaid we have to get our country back on track. The President put \ntogether a budget. I wish to remind people that budget did not get one \nRepublican vote. I wish to read to you what Senator Lott, on August 6, \n1993, said about that Clinton budget.\n  As we all know, that Clinton budget got us on the path of deficit \nreduction and an actual surplus in our fiscal year budget. It set us on \nthe path of debt reduction. As a matter of fact, we were far along on \nthat path. We expected to have no debt whatsoever. When George Bush got \nin office, the Republicans took over and the deficits soared and the \ndebt soared.\n  I wish to read what Senator Lott said in 1993. Remember, it was a \nvery similar situation in terms of a budgetary crisis, a fiscal crisis. \nWhen Bill Clinton's budget passed--and we helped him get it passed--we \nset off on a path of economic recovery that was unmatched. Listen to \nthis. This is Senator Trent Lott, August 6, 1993, in opposition to the \nDemocrats' economic plan:\n\n       This is a pork alert: Pork alert. This bill is 1,800 pages. \n     We will not know until next April 15, probably, all the stuff \n     that's in here. Are we talking about a little money? . . . \n     No, we are talking about big sums.\n\n  He says:\n\n       So when you stand up and say Republicans have not been \n     involved, let me assure you, we should have been involved. We \n     would have liked to have been involved. But we would like to \n     concentrate on spending cuts at first. And then talk about \n     other things like economic growth incentive activities, that \n     we would like to see considered in this process.\n\n  The Republicans who have been in charge for a very long time have \nbeen the party of ``no'': Do it my way or it is the highway. Only I can \nwrite the perfect bill.\n  I have said, and I say this respectfully to my friends, I could write \na perfect bill--for me. I can assure you the people of California would \nlike my bill better than the bill that is before us. Each of us can \nstand and write the perfect bill.\n  So we have a choice. We can allow this new President to have the \nopportunity to do what he said he would do during the campaign, which \nis to ensure that this National Government becomes part of the \nsolution.\n  Believe me, I defend my Republican friends' right to say no, no, no. \nThey have every right to do it. They have absolutely every right to do \nit. What I feel a little sad about is they feel they have to \nfilibuster; each and every time\n\n[[Page S2092]]\n\nwe have to get 60 votes--60 votes--60 votes--because they know very \nmuch it becomes a hardship. But that is what they are doing.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this and another quote printed in the \nRecord.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. BOXER. In 1993, when they opposed the Democrats' economic plan, \nback then, that plan that set us off on economic recovery and economic \nprosperity, they said almost the same exact words: We are not involved, \nit is pork, it is this, it is that, it is a big bill. They held up the \nbill.\n  It is all the same. It is not the GOP; it is the SOP, the ``same old \nparty.'' Right now we can't be the same old party.\n  Democrats can't be the same old party, Republicans can't be the same \nold party.\n  We need to join together. I hope more of my colleagues on the other \nside will join us. I thank the three who have, and I look forward to \nworking with them as we move out into the future.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                              1993 Quotes\n\n       Last, the American people should know unequivocally this \n     plan does not reduce our long-term deficit. What I am \n     suggesting is, if you like these taxes, wait around because \n     the deficit starts back up in 1998 even with all of these \n     taxes and more will be needed. And I ask where are we going \n     to get the spending cuts and the money to bring it under \n     control? My guess is more taxes year after year.--Senator \n     Packwood August 6, 1993\n       This is a pork alert: Pork alert. This bill is 1,800 pages. \n     We will not know until next April 15, probably, all the stuff \n     that has been slid in here. Are we talking about, oh, just a \n     little bit of money? A few million here and there? No; we are \n     talking about big sums.\n       So when you stand up and say the Republicans have not been \n     involved, let me assure you, we should have been involved. We \n     would have liked to have been involved. But we would like to \n     concentrate on spending cuts at first.

Madam President, yesterday the Senate cast one of the \nmost expensive votes in history. We have heard a lot from our friends \nabout the dangers of deficits over the last few years. Yet the Senate \nthis week voted to spend more than $1.2 trillion, including interest, \nover the next 10 years. The projected annual budget deficit for this \nparticular fiscal year is also $1.2 trillion. We are told, of course, \nthis is just the beginning. We have known for weeks the Treasury \nSecretary is planning a financial rescue plan. We still don't know the \ncost. Apparently, the sticker shock would have been too much to take, 1 \nday after the Senate voted to spend $1.2 trillion on a stimulus--all of \nthis on top of the $400 billion Omnibus appropriations bill we will \nsoon vote on, which will bring discretionary spending for the Federal \nGovernment for the very first time to over $1 trillion this year.\n  Americans are wondering how we are going to pay for all of this. \nJudging by the market reaction to Secretary Geithner's announcement \nyesterday and the newspaper editorials this morning, it is clear \neveryone is looking for a little more detail. With that in mind, the \nimportance of a thorough review of the administration's budget is all \nthe more important, so we know the totality of what the administration \nis asking of taxpayers.\n  Any parent knows you don't buy a new car and plan the summer vacation \nbefore you set the family budget for the year. I think Americans would \nlike to know exactly how the administration plans to pay for all these \nthings in the context of all the normal annual spending.\n  In the 24 days Congress has been in session this year, Congressional \nDemocrats have agreed to spend more than $50 billion a day. Americans \nknow they have a limit on their spending. This week they are wondering \nwhat the Government's limit is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/11/senate-section/article/S2092-3", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ENERGY PRODUCTION\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, our new Secretary of the Interior has \nweighed in on developing American oil and gas resources located on our \nOuter Continental Shelf. As the process moves forward, it is my hope he \nwill be mindful that hindering the growth of responsible domestic \nenergy production means hindering an increase of American jobs at a \ntime when many people are out of work. It also means hindering \nAmerica's dependence on foreign oil, which has a direct impact, of \ncourse, on the price of gasoline.\n  Last summer, Congress heard from Americans, and I heard from \ncountless Kentuckians, demanding a balanced approach to our energy \nproblem that includes boosting American energy production as well as \nconserving what we already have.

Madam President, you know in your State of New York and I \nknow in my State of Illinois what this recession really means. In \nDecember, the recession hit my home State of Illinois hard. We lost \n1,200 jobs a day in the month of December--36,000 jobs. That is a hit \nthat continues, I am afraid, in the month of January and maybe even in \nthe early part of February. The overall unemployment rate for America \nis 7.6 percent. Madam President, 3.6 million jobs have been lost since \nthe beginning of the recession several months ago. Clearly, that is the \nelement which is driving our discussion now about what to do.\n  There are some on the other side of the aisle in Congress who argue \nthat the best thing to do is nothing, let the economy solve its own \nproblems. But, sadly, many of us are meeting the casualties of this \nrecession, and many of us know them personally because they are in our \nfamilies.\n  I talk to a lot of my friends who are struggling. It does not sound \nlike much, you know, when they say: My hours have been cut back. A \nfriend of mine, a lady who is raising three children, a single mom \nraising three kids, had her hours cut back. Her agency does counseling \nfor drug addiction. So she is only working three-quarters of the \nregular time she was expecting. Well, as a result of that cutback in \nher pay, she could not pay her rent, and, sadly, she is now facing some \nof the hardest decisions of her life. So just a cutback in pay for many \npeople who live on the margin makes all the difference. And then, of \ncourse, there are those who lost their jobs altogether. Many of those \npeople find they stand the possibility of losing their homes. They \ncannot make the mortgage payments, and they are facing foreclosure. \nTheir savings that have been devastated by the decline in the stock \nmarket have now become the only place to turn. They have had to make \nserious decisions.\n  I talked to groups of college presidents from Illinois who came to \nsee me, and some of them, community colleges. The colleges and \nuniversities are struggling because a lot of students are sitting there \nsaying: I cannot keep going to school. I mean, dad lost his job and mom \nis working, and I am a big drain on their savings at a time when they \ndo not have it. So colleges and universities are scrambling all over \nthe campus to try to get people to stay in school. They are afraid they \nare going to lose them. Community college representatives who came to \nvisit me yesterday said, incidentally, their enrollment is up because a \nlot of the students say: I can no longer go to the expensive other \nschool, so I am going to come back and do community college courses and \ntry to keep up with it.\n  Lifestyles are changing. People are making decisions; some of them we \nhope will be temporary, some may not. That is what troubles me when we \nlook\n\n[[Page S2093]]\n\nat the debate in Congress. There are so many people who, I am afraid, \nare removed from this. It really would do a lot of Senators some good \nto get in touch with the real world out there and what people are going \nthrough. We are somewhat insulated in the life we lead, and we have to \novercome that because the people who are the casualties and victims \nhere are the ones who should be remembered when it comes to these \nvotes.\n  Now, President Obama inherited this. I am not going to dwell on the \nmistakes and miscalculations of the previous administration. That is a \nmatter of record. There is no point in going into that. That was \nyesterday. We need to talk about today and tomorrow. What are we going \ndo about this?\n  What the administration, what the President wants to do is to make \nsure we do not stand back as spectators and watch this collision that \nis occurring, destroying a lot of lives and a lot of people's hopes. So \nhe came to us and said: We have to breathe some life into this economy. \nWe think that this year in America, $1 trillion less will be spent on \ngoods and services, $1 trillion taken out of the economy. What happens? \nShops close. People are laid off if there is not economic activity. So \nwhat the President has said is: Let's infuse back into the economy \ngovernment spending now to try to make up for that and to try to get us \nmoving forward.\n  Now, I understand--and we all have to be honest about this--that the \nmoney we spend on this stimulus is money added to our Nation's debt. \nBut failing to do anything and allowing this recession to continue to \ngo downhill will increase our Nation's debt anyway and, of course, will \nadd to a lot of suffering by families and businesses. So the President \ncame forward and said: Let's focus on several things. First, let's \nprovide tax relief to working families. They are struggling. They need \na helping hand. Let's provide help in a safety net, a little more money \nfor people who are unemployed, $25 a week. For anybody who thinks that \nis a huge amount of money, that is $100 a month for people unemployed. \nFor most of us, that does not mean a lot; for people struggling to get \nby, it could be important.\n  Also, there is some help when it comes to continuing health \ninsurance. That is one of the first things that happen when you lose a \njob--you lose your health insurance. The COBRA program allows you to \nturn to Government help for that, but it is darn expensive if you have \nto pay both the employee and employer share. So we are trying to \nprovide a helping hand when it comes to the folks who have lost their \nhealth insurance, giving them a little bit of help so their families \nare not left defenseless to the next diagnosis or the next disease.\n  Then we add, for the poorest of the poor, those who are struggling \nthe hardest, help with food stamps. You know, if you keep track in your \nown community, you are going to find that a lot of pantries and church-\nrun efforts to help feed people have more folks showing up than ever. \nEven those who are working part time are struggling to put food on the \ntable. So we provided additional help when it comes to this \nsupplementary feeding program to help families who are struggling the \nhardest.\n  I have often used this statistic, but I still marvel at the fact that \none out of eight people in the State of Michigan is on food stamps--one \nout of eight. It shows you what has happened to their economy, and, \nsadly, many of our States are following in terms of our own needs.\n  So we have the tax cuts for working families, we have this safety \nnet, and the President has also asked us to put money into spending \nthat will not only create jobs but make an investment in America's \nfuture.\n  Transportation is the obvious thing to turn to, but it goes beyond \nthat. President Obama would like to see us put more money into building \nlibraries, laboratories, and the classrooms of the 21st century, \nmodernizing schools so they are energy efficient, reducing the cost of \nenergy. That is a good investment for families, and it is a great \ninvestment for schools. The President wants money to go in, as well, to \nhealth technology so we start computerizing medical records across \nAmerica. That is a first step in bringing medical care into the 21st \ncentury. With computerized records, doctors and nurses are less likely \nto make mistakes. They are more likely to have all the information they \nneed before they make a diagnosis and suggest a treatment. It will \nreduce the cost of medical care and reduce the number of mistakes made, \nwhich is very important. That is money well spent.\n  The President focuses on energy. He is right to do so. We have to \nunderstand, as long as we are dependent on foreign nations for our \nmajor energy sources, we are at their mercy. We saw it happen when \ngasoline was over $4 a gallon, and it could happen again. We have to be \nthoughtful in the way we move forward in this economy, creating jobs \nbut looking for more energy efficiency, more energy independence. That \nis part of the President's goal.\n  Yesterday, Secretary of the Treasury Mr. Geithner came forward with a \nplan dealing with banking institutions. It is a complex problem, and it \nis a multifaceted response. It tries to get at the heart of these banks \nthat, sadly, have portfolios riddled with mortgages that have been \novervalued. We have to get to the bottom line so the banks have solid \nbalance sheets and the people have more confidence in them and, \nimportantly, the credit being offered by these institutions starts \ncoming forward so businesses, large and small, individuals buying homes \nor automobiles, have a chance.\n  It is a big agenda, and there are a lot of people on the other side \nof the aisle who say: We shouldn't do any of this. What are we doing \nthis for? The economy will fix itself.\n  I disagree. The American people expect us to find solutions, do our \nbest to come up with good-faith efforts to find solutions. They expect \nus to work together and not squabble, to try to find give-and-take that \nleads to a good solution. They want to make sure there is \naccountability. They are mad--I am too--that $350 billion was spent \nseveral months ago for the so-called TARP, and at the end of the day, a \nlot of people said: How much did they spend and what did it do?\n  That is taxpayer dollars. We have a responsibility to be transparent \nand be held accountable as part of that. They certainly expect us to do \nthis on a timely basis. They don't want Congress chewing over this \nissue for weeks and months while the economy continues to decline.\n  Some have suggested: Are you saying this is going to work? Is this \nperfect? The answer is, no; I am not sure. But if we do nothing, I know \nwhat will happen. It is going to get progressively worse, where more \npeople lose their jobs, more businesses fail, more families suffer, and \nwe will see a spiral head downhill and continue not only in the United \nStates but around the world. That is why what we are doing in the \nstimulus program is so important, that we get it done. As we speak, \nlast-minute negotiations are underway for the stimulus bill. I hope we \ncan get it done even today to send a clear message across the United \nStates and maybe to the rest of the world, as they are paying \nattention, that we take it seriously. We are not going to buy into a \nHerbert Hoover mentality that everything will get well if we leave it \nalone. It is not going to happen.\n  This patient, the American economy, is in serious need of attention \nnow. We need to apply the tourniquets to stop the bleeding. We need to \nmake a good diagnosis and order the medicine and treatment that is \nessential. It has to be done in a timely fashion. I encourage my \ncolleagues to come together. Fortunately for us, three Republicans \nstepped forward in the Senate and joined this effort. We could not have \ndone it without them. We have listened to them. We have accepted their \ncounsel. We have made changes and compromises. We have tried to work \ntogether. I invite even more to finally realize that just standing back \nand saying: No, I will not do a thing, isn't going to solve this \nproblem. We are expected to work together.\n  We understand what led up to this; we don't want to dwell on the \npast. But we want to look forward to a new America that gets back on \nits feet using the spirit of this country to restore the economy and \nget us moving forward again.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield for a few questions?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n\n[[Page S2094]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I was thinking the other day to when we had another \ndifficult crisis of confidence in the economy in 1993, when Bill \nClinton was elected and we had deficits as far as the eye could see and \ndebt as far as the eye could see. Things were slowing. We were in \ndifficulty. A new President came forward, Bill Clinton, and we had the \nCongress, the Democrats did. We passed a budget. We did it without one \nRepublican vote. Thank goodness here we have three. We have the 60-vote \nsupermajority Republicans are insisting upon. If you remember, it was \nSenator Bob Kerrey who had to think long and hard and decided to \nsupport that.\n  I wonder if my friend remembers because I just looked up some of the \ncomments made by the Republicans. I read into the Record one of them by \nTrent Lott. He said: We have not been involved in this. This is going \nto be a disaster. This is awful. They said: No.\n  I wonder if my friend knows about the Clinton economic record: 23 \nmillion new jobs created during the 8 years of the Clinton Presidency; \nthe largest surplus in history was left behind by President Clinton, \nover $230 billion; unemployment rates were the lowest in three decades; \nthere was the lowest overall poverty and child poverty rate since the \n1970s.\n  Does my friend remember that battle and how we Democrats had to do it \nall by ourselves?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I remember it well because I was serving in the House at \nthe time. When we called the Clinton plan to try to reduce the deficit \nand invigorate the economy, we did not have a single Republican who \nsupported us. When it came to the Senate, it passed because Vice \nPresident Gore cast the deciding vote so it could go forward. That is \nthe reality. There were many skeptics. You mentioned Senator Lott. \nThere were others who said: This isn't going to work. The best thing to \ndo is nothing. Sadly, they were wrong. They should have known they were \nwrong. We ended up seeing a surge in economic growth, the likes of \nwhich we have not seen in modern times.\n  I think right now we are in a slightly different situation because we \nare not talking about a big economic surge. We need to stabilize the \neconomy. That is the key. I am afraid many of the people who are \ncriticizing President Obama's efforts are not in touch with what is \ngoing on at home.\n  I watched this morning, as I am sure the Senator from California did, \nas President Obama went to Ft. Myers, FL, and talked to two particular \npeople. One was Henrietta Hughes, who said: I am living in my car. I am \na homeless person. What I wouldn't give to have my own kitchen and \nbathroom. Can you help me?\n  Sadly, a lot of people are homeless today. The President reached out, \nembraced her, and said: We will do what we can. Someone in the \ncommunity stepped forward.\n  Another fellow said: I have been at McDonald's for 4 years. \nMcDonald's is a great Illinois corporation, but the fact is, he wants \nbenefits. He wants improvement in wages. You see a lot of people \nstruggling and falling behind. If we don't stabilize this economy, that \ngroup is going to grow--people losing their homes, people in jobs that \ndon't even sustain them.\n  What we are doing is a leap of faith. We are saying: We believe in \nthis President. We believe in this last election where the people said \nthey wanted change. We are going to stick with this President and move \nforward. We hope some Republicans will join us this time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think my friend is so eloquent as usual. The point I am \ntrying to make is, we faced a serious economic problem in 1993, when a \nDemocratic President took over. You are right. Things are way worse, \nand it is a different circumstance. But the same thing happened then. \nWe had Senate leadership, Senator Lott saying, on August 6, 1993: This \nis a pork alert, pork alert. It is 1,800 pages. We are talking about \nbig sums. He said: We have to concentrate on spending cuts first.\n\n  They predicted gloom and doom. What happened was the greatest \neconomic recovery in modern history because we took a chance. We \nfollowed the wisdom of many economists at the time. We know now that if \nthe Republicans would just join with us, we can get this economy moving \nin the right direction. A trillion dollars has been taken out of the \neconomy due to lost productivity. Who is going to put it back? The \nbanks won't. We are the only ones who can put it back. It is not going \nto be a trillion. It is probably under $800 billion. But it is the way \nto go forward.\n  I agree with my friend. I am so glad President Obama is out there. \nDoesn't he agree--and this is my last question. Then I will do a \npresentation about what is happening in my State--that it is important \nfor the President to get out there, not to a group of people who have \nbeen prescreened, who are all his admirers, but actually to get there \nwith all these people who are troubled? They are worried. They have \nhope and faith, but they are scared. It gives him a reality check \nrather than listening to what goes on around here because I am afraid \nthe GOP, the Grand Old Party, has turned into the same old party, the \nsame old negativity we heard in 1993 when we had another Democratic \nPresident get us on the right road to an amazing recovery. It is sort \nof the same old thing.\n  I wonder how my friend feels about our President getting out among \nthe people.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from California knows the President, before \nhe was elected, was my colleague for 4 years in the Senate. Every \nThursday morning at 8:30, then-Senator Obama and I would get together \nfor a town meeting which we opened to people who came to Washington. \nOriginally, it was for people from Illinois who came to Washington. \nThen when I saw the crowds growing with my colleague, Senator Obama, I \nsuggested those who wish they were from Illinois or just those who want \nto see Barack Obama. We would have a huge room full of people. Many of \nthem were fans and admirers. But I watched Senator Obama field \nquestions then.\n  During the campaign I saw the same thing. This is risky business \nabout which politicians are warned: Don't walk into that crowd that has \nnot been prescreened because they are going to throw you curve balls. \nThey will criticize you. It could get tough and out of hand. Be ready.\n  He is ready because he has been tested. He was tested as a Senator, \ncertainly tested 2 years on the campaign trail. It is downright \nrefreshing that he walks in and has somebody hold up their hand and he \ndoesn't know what is coming. This could be a person who would never \nconsider voting for him, a person who disagrees with him completely, \nand he is prepared to hear that. That is a refreshing change in \nAmerican politics. I hope he sticks with it. I think he will.\n  The fact that he is going to communities that are suffering--whether \nit is Elkhart, IN, or Ft. Myers, FL--he is doing his best, as \nPresidents are generally isolated in the White House and away from most \nof the people, to get back in touch. I hope our colleagues will do the \nsame, whether they go to New York or California or Illinois or Florida. \nGo out and talk to the folks.\n  In my hometown of Springfield, my wife came in Sunday and said: I was \njust driving down South Grand Avenue, and there was a young woman \nstanding there with a sign saying: I am out of work. Can you help me \nfeed my family?\n  This was in my hometown. That is an eye opener. There are people like \nthat. But she was so desperate she stood out by the side of the road \nasking for help. That is happening.\n  We have to do something about it. The answer is not to ignore it. The \nanswer is not to do nothing. The answer is to do our level best to find \na solution so we can have our best efforts, working together to find a \nway, an accountable way, to get the economy moving again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. What is the order now?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is conducting morning \nbusiness, and the Senator is authorized to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I want to pick up on where I left off. \nThis is the same old, same old fight again. I looked back for some more \nquotes on the Clinton economic plan which led to 23 million new jobs, \nthe longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history. \nI read what Senator Lott from the other side said about it.\n  Here are other Senators: We are going to pile up more debt. We are\n\n[[Page S2095]]\n\ngoing to cost jobs. That was Senator Conrad Burns.\n  What happened? We went into surplus, and we created 23 million new \njobs.\n  Orrin Hatch:\n\n       Make no mistake, these higher rates will cost jobs.\n\n  That was because there were some tax hikes on the wealthiest few. It \nwent on and on.\n  This is Phil Gramm, the guru of the other side:\n\n       I want to predict here tonight that if we adopt this bill \n     the American economy is going to get weaker and not stronger, \n     the deficit four years from today will be higher than it is \n     today and not lower. . . .\n\n  He was wrong. This is no longer an academic debate. The Republicans, \nin 1993, said the same things about the Clinton plan they are saying \nabout the Obama plan.\n  Phil Gramm again:\n\n       I believe that hundreds of thousands of people are going to \n     lose their jobs as a result of this program. I believe that \n     Bill Clinton will be one of those people.\n\n  Well, Bill Clinton got reelected. Twenty-three million new jobs were \ncreated. He left behind the largest surplus in history. Unemployment \nrates were the lowest in three decades. We had the lowest overall \npoverty and child poverty rates since the 1970s.\n  Charles Grassley, my colleague:\n\n       I really do not think it takes a rocket scientist to know \n     this bill will cost jobs.\n\n  That is what he said of the Clinton plan that created 23 million new \njobs.\n  Connie Mack from Florida, from the other side of the aisle:\n\n       This bill will cost America jobs, no doubt about it.\n\n  Senator William Roth, from the other side:\n\n       It will flatten the economy. I am concerned about what it \n     will do to our families. . . .\n\n  Well, what did it do to our families? The Clinton plan, with the \nDemocratic support, created 23 million new jobs, left behind the \nhighest surplus in history, unemployment rates were the lowest in three \ndecades, and we had the longest peacetime expansion of economic \nexpansion in history.\n  Rick Santorum, from the other side of the aisle:\n\n       . . . bad policy. Let's do something that creates jobs that \n     doesn't feed the monster of government.\n\n  It goes on and on, and later today I will read some more into the \nRecord.\n  So as I was listening to the debate yesterday and the day before and \nthe day before--it has been good--I had a sense of deja vu. I heard \nthis before. I turned to my staff and I said: Can you go and find out \nwhat the Republicans said about Bill Clinton's economic plan that was \nso successful? We did not get one Republican vote. Thank God we are \ngetting three Republican votes for this plan because they have set a \n60-vote filibuster-proof vote. That is what we need, which is a shame, \nbut that is the way it is.\n  So what I would like to do today, again, is make the point that \nRepublicans and Democrats have a philosophical disagreement. They had \nit back in 1993. We tested who was right and who was wrong. We put in \nthe Clinton plan. We got a great economic recovery. We got surpluses as \nfar as the eye could see. We had the debt going totally down.\n  When the Republicans took over, the deficits soared, the debt \ndoubled, and we have now on the backs of the American people--every \nman, woman, and child--$17,000 more in debt as a result of an open \ncheckbook for Iraq and tax cuts to the millionaires and the \nbillionaires who never needed it anyway. That is a fact. It has been \nproven. There is no debate over it.\n  I have what the Republicans said back then, and I know what happened \nto the economy. So if you are looking for past history to guide what we \ndo today, it is time to step to the plate and support President Obama. \nHe has learned from history. He has looked at what happened. He \nunderstands.\n  So I want to take us now to where we are in this recession: 3.6 \nmillion jobs lost since the beginning of the recession. I want people \nto think about 3,600,000 people. Think about your own community, how \nmany people live in that community. Think about your own State, how \nmany people live in that State. Think about what it means to have these \nmany people unemployed, and think about what it means for their \nfamilies, for their spouses, for their children, in the face of this. \nDoing nothing is not a passive act. It is a hostile act. It is a \nhostile act because doing nothing says: We like the status quo. We \ndon't care about this. Let it just play out. I say that is \nunacceptable.\n  Now, we can look at what is happening month by month: almost 600,000 \njobs lost in January; 524,000 in December; 533,000 in November. This is \nwhat is happening on the ground today.\n  The other day, I placed into the Record some of the layoffs that are \ngoing on in my State--everything from Macy's, to Starbucks, to little \nmom-and-pops, to big companies, to high-tech, all over California. We \nhave 37 million people, and, as they say in California, when we get a \ncold, everybody else sneezes because we have such an impact. We would \nbe about the seventh largest economy in the world.\n  This is another bad picture, I show you in the Chamber--unemployment \nrates rising: 6.7 percent in November; December, 7.2 percent; January, \n7.6 percent. In my home State, it is now 9.3 percent unemployment. And \nthere are some communities that have 15 percent unemployment. That is \ngetting closer to a depression.\n  We have a problem, and we cannot afford stall tactics around here and \n60-vote supermajorities. We cannot afford partisanship. We need \ncooperation because the longer we wait to put those dollars into our \ncommunities, the more job losses we are going to see.\n  Total unemployed Americans: 11.6 million. That is unemployed \nAmericans at the time. Think about that. Think about your community. \nThink about your State. Think about what 11.6 million unemployed \nAmericans means. There are 1.6 million unemployed Californians. The \nnumber of long-term unemployed--they have been looking and looking and \ncannot find work--is 2.6 million.\n  By the way, there are 7.8 million underemployed Americans, meaning \npeople who get part-time work who want full-time work--so many people \nwho have higher skills that are not being put to good use. \nUnderemployment is a problem. It is a serious problem.\n  They say pictures speak a thousand words. I show you a picture of a \nhomeless man in Bakersfield. My local officials in Bakersfield, CA, \nhave noticed a rise in the number of homeless individuals. These are \nindividuals without shelter. As shown in this picture, here is one \nhiding his face--hiding his face. It is a sad thing, and we are seeing \nmore of it across our Nation.\n  Job seekers in search of employment at a Goodwill Industries career \ncenter in Los Angeles. A Los Angeles man who lost his job at a computer \ndisposal facility was forced to place his children into foster care. \nImagine all of us having to place our children into foster care because \nwe could not find another job to support our family. He said: You've \ngot to stay positive, but the economy is failing. I'll take anything.\n  He visited this Los Angeles Goodwill career center to learn about job \nopportunities.\n  The other day, I held up a picture from Florida where thousands of \npeople came for 35 firefighter jobs, and they had to have the police \ncome out, not that anyone was acting out, but they just needed order--\nfor 35 firefighter jobs.\n  In Fresno, kids are having a good time, but where are they having a \ngood time? In a pool at a home that has been foreclosed upon. They are \ncreating backyard skateboard arenas. The skaters found the addresses of \nforeclosed homes on the Internet or through friends who work in real \nestate, and these young people came there to this foreclosed home. This \nhome was once teeming with a family. Your home is your castle. It is a \ndream being lost.\n  If we do not pass this first leg of our economic recovery package, \nthis will continue. Because it is one thing to lose your home because \nyour interest rate got out of reach--that is a terrible thing--it is \nworse when you lose your home because you lost your job. So this is not \na good picture.\n  This is an area in our State that was ready for development in the \ncity of Rio Vista in eastern Solano County. The city of Rio Vista is \nnearing bankruptcy, its problems coming from plummeting property and \nsales taxes, a lack of funds coming from the State. The city has laid \noff employees. They have left open full-time positions. They\n\n[[Page S2096]]\n\nhave frozen salaries. They have cut city programs. And they have closed \ncity hall 1 day a week. This is a small city, and the reverberations \nare many.\n  The San Fernando Valley Career Center--this is a picture of a \ngentleman who is desperately looking for work. This is what he says: I \ndon't have a single cent in my pocket.\n\n  He has been unemployed since September. He visited this career center \nto seek job opportunities. People are trying desperately to find work.\n  It is easy to stand up here and say: I don't like the bill. I don't \nlike page 47. I don't like paragraph 2 and paragraph 8. The bottom line \nis, you can either have the perfect bill, no bill, or the compromise. \nAgain, yesterday we passed the compromise, and we need to get this \ndone.\n  This breaks my heart. I know all of us feel this way when we see our \nconstituents who are hard workers, who cherish work, who want the pride \nof a job, having this circumstance.\n  There is a story from North Hollywood: a mother of five laid off in \nNovember 2007, spending hours each day looking for work. She said: This \nis the longest I've been unemployed. I feel stressed out. I have bills \npiling up.\n  So we are at the crossroads. President Obama is getting out to this \ncountry. He is going to places like this, where people are desperate. \nThis is ``one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice \nfor all.'' We are not going to live up to that ideal if we do not act \nnow.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle, believe me, they had their \nturn. They had 8 years of their turn. They took a surplus, they turned \nit into deficit. They took debt that was on the way out and expanded it \nby double, laying on the backs of every man, woman, and child another \n$17,000 of debt. They had their chance. This is the worst economy we \nhave seen since the Great Depression. They had their chance. They had \nan open checkbook for Iraq and they had an open checkbook for their \nvery wealthy friends, and it did not work.\n  When we were in charge--we are not perfect, God knows, that is for \nsure--we got this economy back on track. We know what it takes. We have \nto stimulate this economy. That is the first leg. When it gets on its \nfeet, we will wrap our hands around these deficits and get them under \ncontrol. We will make sure our financial system has sensible regulation \nagain so people have confidence in it. We know what we are doing.\n  It is true that the problems are vast, but this country did go \nthrough the Great Depression. And what did we see? When we put people \nto work, it restored their faith and confidence. When we mobilized for \na war, we mobilized the productivity of people. We do not want to \nmobilize for war now, but we do want to mobilize for energy \nindependence by turning to clean energy and creating technologies we \ncan export. We know we have to take care of the housing crisis. We know \nwe have to get ahead of it. We know we have to help people stay in \ntheir homes. This next tranche of the TARP funds that Timothy Geithner \ntalked about--the money is already there--$50 billion will be used for \nthat, and I hope even more. So we know what we are doing.\n  We are not standing up here with a plan that, as President Obama \nsaid, is plucked out of the air. It is not plucked out of the air. He \nspoke to economists--Democratic economists, Republican economists, and \nthose all over the map--and the vast majority say we need to stimulate \nthis economy, get money to the cities, get money to the counties, get \nmoney to the States, get money to the private sector, rebuild our \nphysical infrastructure, our highways, our bridges. These are things we \nneed to do anyway--these are things we need to do anyway. We need to \nget funds to law enforcement so we are not laying off police officers \nbut hiring them. We need to get funds to our schools so we are not \nlaying off teachers, but we are hiring them. We need to have tax breaks \nin here to encourage investments in alternative clean energy so we can \nmake our government buildings energy efficient. These are all things \nthat save money, create jobs, and we have to do them anyway.\n\n  So as President Obama has said, we didn't expect this kind of an \neconomic crisis, but it is upon us. It is upon us. Listen to my friends \non the other side and go back to 1993. They are saying the same things. \nThey were the party of ``no'' then; they are the party of ``no'' now. \nNo, no, no, no, no; don't do it. It is not going to work; it is going \nto hurt the economy; it will lead to a recession; it will increase the \ndebt. All the things they are saying now they said then. They always \nhave a reason to say no.\n  I wish to close by saying to the three Republican colleagues of mine \nwho came forward: Thank you again. I have said it before. It takes \ncourage. It is hard to go against the caucus you sit in every day. It \nis hard. I have had to do it on a couple of things. It is very \nunpleasant. I remember being 1 of 11 people who went a different way on \none occasion on a gay rights issue. It was very hard. I remember being \n1 of 23 who voted against the Iraq war. It was popular then. It was \nvery hard. I remember voting against the Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit because I thought it would lead to major problems with people \ngetting kicked off their insurance when they needed their medicines the \nmost. It also stopped Medicare from negotiating. It didn't allow them \nto negotiate for lower prices, and I felt the pharmaceutical companies \nwere going to make a bundle and the people wouldn't get the benefits. I \nwas in the minority. So I know how it feels to be in the minority. I \nknow how it feels to vote differently than most of your colleagues. It \nis a lonely feeling. I say to those Republican friends on the other \nside: You are showing courage and you are showing wisdom. You are also \nshowing you have learned from history, because you went back to the \nClinton years where we didn't get one Republican vote for a bold \neconomic plan. All the dire predictions turned out to be totally false.\n  We need to get back to those days of economic growth and expansion, \nbut we can't do it until we move forward with this three-legged stool, \nthis economic stimulus package to create jobs, jobs, jobs; the housing \npiece to address the terrible loss of confidence in housing, to help \npeople stay in their homes and stop the slide; and, of course, the \nthird piece of making sure our financial sector works once again, so \nthat creditworthy people can step to the plate, go to the bank, and get \na loan. It is very hard to do that.\n  I wish to point out one other piece of the package that is so \nimportant. The small businesses in our country will have some credit. \nThis is very key. They will be able to go to the SBA and get this \ncredit. So this is a package that is worthy of our support. It is far \nfrom perfect because, again, each of us could write the perfect bill, \nbut that is not possible. Thank you to my Republican friends who have \njoined us.\n  I wish to say to the conferees: I understand the pressures they are \nunder and I make a plea to them that within the confines of the numbers \nwe sent over, I hope they can find the right path to take so that this \nbill coming out of conference is acceptable over here, we get the 60 \nvotes, and we move forward. We have a lot of work to do.\n  Today I was on a TV show and it was so interesting because one of the \nexperts on the show said, Well, wait a minute. You are talking about \nthis economic stimulus. What about energy independence? What about \nhealth care? And he went on and on. What about exports? I thought after \nI got off the show: In 8 years we have developed all of these problems. \nWe are not going to fix them in 24 hours. You have to have a list, as \nPresident Obama has, and tick them off one at a time, address these \nissues one at a time. The first issue is the stimulus. The second issue \nwill be the financial sector, and then the housing sector. We are \nalready talking about an energy bill that is going to come out pretty \nsoon, which is going to be very exciting. These experts were saying we \nneed a bold vision for America. I agree with them, but we can't fix \nwhat went wrong in 8 years in 24 hours. Give us a couple of months, at \nleast, to get it on track and the effects of it will start being felt \nsoon after that, but we can't do everything in 1 day.\n  So, yes, these experts are right. We have to do all of this, but we \nhave to start at the beginning. The stimulus package is No. 1. We are \nalmost there. When it comes back from conference, we will have another \nvote, and it will go to the President's desk, and then we will move \nforward with the rest of the economic recovery plan. I do believe in\n\n[[Page S2097]]\n\nmy hearts of hearts--I have been around here a while--I do believe \nPresident Obama has learned from history. I do believe President Obama \nis a student of history, because if you are not a student of history \nyou are going to repeat the mistakes of the past. I think he knows what \nworks and I think he knows what doesn't work. So let's get behind him \non this first initiative. Let's get it done. Then we will attack each \nand every problem, because there are many we have on our plate, but we \nwill deal with them. I am confident--this is America--we will be \nstronger at the end of the day.\n  Thank you very much, Madam President. I yield the floor, and I note \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, we have made some difficult decisions \nover the past few months. After years of failed policies that have \ndragged our economy into the ditch, we still have many more difficult \ndecisions ahead.\n  The next big decision will be for Republicans and Democrats working \ntogether on a final version of the jobs bill. Now we have an \nopportunity to focus on a bill that will rebuild our economy from the \nground up by putting Americans back to work right now.\n  The jobs bill we passed yesterday creates jobs--up to 4 million of \nthem--and saves many more by investing in our roads, bridges, water \nsystems, energy facilities, and our schools.\n  This is long-term infrastructure that will support our economy for \ngenerations to come. The jobs bill also invests in what matters--\npeople. It invests in health care and an education, puts cops on the \nstreet.\n  Where I come from, we call things as we see them. The word \n``stimulus'' is a Washington, DC, word that doesn't mean much in my \nbook. That is why, from day one, I have called this the jobs bill \nbecause that is exactly what it is.\n  You are either for jobs or you are against jobs. Every day, we hear \nof layoffs by the tens of thousands.\n  Unemployment numbers are skyrocketing. Businesses--and even entire \nindustries--are being forced to call it quits.\n  The national housing slump is taking its toll on Montana's timber \nindustry. The Columbia Falls Aluminum Company is at risk of closing its \ndoors after decades of being a major driver of the economy in Flathead \nValley. The Stillwater Mine has laid off hundreds of its employees.\n  Montana's unemployment rate jumped from 4.9 percent in December to \n5.4 percent last month. That is an increase, in 1 month, of a half \npercent.\n  The numbers are grim, and they are real. Now is the time for Congress \nto vote for jobs.\n  They say a picture is worth a thousand words. This picture is worth \nmuch more than that. It is a picture that I came across in the \nWhitefish Pilot the other day. It was taken by a guy named David \nErickson.\n  The man in this picture is standing on a street corner in Whitefish, \nMT. He is holding a cardboard sign that says: Work needed. He is \nsomeone whom I represent in the Senate. He is one of the 950,000 \nMontanans whom I am proud to call my boss. His story is a story of \nmillions of Americans right now--millions of Americans who either don't \nhave a job or who went to work today wondering if it will be the last \nday on the job.\n  Millions of Americans are wondering how they are going to be able to \ncontinue to put food on the table for their families or pay their \nmortgage or pay for medicine or pay for childcare.\n  We are not talking about a few folks who drew a short stick. We are \ntalking about millions of Americans who are in the same boat as this \nguy in the picture--folks who are paying a tough price for the failed \neconomic policies of the past.\n  Some DC politicians say we don't need to pass a jobs bill because the \ncurrent recession is only temporary. I ask you to tell that to the guy \nstanding on the street in Whitefish, MT, or to the unemployed woman who \nwrote me to say she is willing to sweep the streets with a broom if we \nwill give her a job.\n  These are proud folks. They don't want unemployment checks; they want \npaychecks. Right now, work is needed. That is the task ahead for my \nfriends in the House and Senate who are working on the final version of \nthe jobs bill.\n  We need jobs, jobs, and more jobs. We don't need politics as usual. \nNow is not the time for Congress to be against jobs. It is the time for \nCongress to work together to put folks back to work by investing in \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we have an opportunity in the next day \nor two to do something extremely significant to create jobs in this \ncountry, to help rebuild the middle class of this country, and to help \nrebuild confidence in the economy and to turn things around in America. \nI am anxious to do that, and I know our leadership is working very hard \nat this moment.\n  I thank Senator Reid and everyone involved in this effort, the \nSpeaker, and I thank our colleagues who have worked across the aisle \nwith us to be able to address what is the most serious economic crisis \ncertainly since the Great Depression. We have seen numbers of jobs lost \nthat only rival back to 1945.\n\n  In the morning I had the opportunity to chair a meeting with business \nleaders from around the country in every part of the economy, from \nretail sales to restaurants to manufacturing to homebuilders, realtors, \nthe health care industry and information technology. One thing came \nthrough loudly and clearly.\n  First, they are optimistic about America. They want to say we can get \nthrough this. But there is a sense that we have to move boldly and we \nhave to get something done to turn things around. That is what this \neconomic recovery package is all about.\n  We know the numbers. Certainly I know the numbers in Michigan. My \nconstituents, the families of Michigan, understand the numbers of what \nhas been happening to people in my State and across the country. But we \nhave seen since December of 2007 over 3.6 million jobs lost.\n  It is my understanding now we have more people looking for work than \nthere are available jobs. As a result of policies, of actions and \ninaction in the last 8 years, we now see over 11.7 million workers \nwithout a job. They want to work. People want to work. They work hard. \nPeople in my State right now are working hard if they are working. They \nmay be working one job, two jobs, three part-time jobs to try to hold \nit together. But they want to work. We have seen the set of economic \npolicies and inaction for too long that has created this horrible \neconomic tsunami for too many people in this country.\n  In my home State, unemployment is 10.6 percent, the highest in 25 \nyears. That is only the people we count. It does not count the people \nwho have been unemployed so long that they are no longer involved in \nthe numbers.\n  The people of Michigan want to work. They want jobs. They want to be \nable to pay their house payment, be able to put food on the table, be \nable to have their small business be successful, be able to manufacture \nand make things in Michigan for this country and be a part of a vibrant \nmiddle class, which has been so wonderful about our country. That is \nwhat this economic recovery package is all about. We don't want to see \nthese numbers, 3.6 million lost jobs.\n  This is a picture from Miami. It is a little bit warmer in Miami than \nit is in\n\n[[Page S2098]]\n\nmy State at the moment, although they cannot snow ski. That is \nsomething we encourage people to do. I know in your home State of \nPennsylvania as well, it is a little bit colder. We are enjoying the \nwonderful north at the moment. But this is serious. On this picture you \ncould take off Miami and put Michigan and it would be the same. This is \na picture of a thousand people who lined up for 35 firefighting jobs in \nMiami. First, this recovery package will help keep those firefighters \non duty. It will help keep police officers on duty. It will help keep \nteachers in our classrooms. It is critically important that that part \nof the package be passed.\n  But when you look at a thousand people--and we have seen thousands of \npeople show up in lines around block after block for jobs--this is not \nabout them wanting to work. It is about whether we are going to have \neconomic policies that create jobs both in the short run and in the \nlong run. I do not want to see any more of these pictures than I \nabsolutely have to--Americans who are standing in line waiting to try \nto get one of a handful of jobs available.\n  This is about creating jobs in America. That is what this is about. \nWe want to turn those numbers around. We know there is no silver \nbullet. Believe me, I don't think there is anybody here who wishes more \nthere was a silver bullet because I would take it, I don't care whose \nidea it was. We don't have a silver bullet. But we do know from talking \nto smart people, economists, from conservative economists to liberal \neconomists to everything in between, we do know there are things that \nwill make a big difference. In fact, those same economists were telling \nus that those things would make a difference last year and the year \nbefore and the year before. Unfortunately, there were not the votes, \nthe support to be able to do those things.\n  Now it has changed. We have a different leader in the White House. We \nhave different Members of the Senate who now agree with the majority of \nthe economists in the country about what should be done to be able to \nmove us forward; what should be done on jobs, and housing, and critical \ninvestments to be able to get the economy going again.\n  I am very proud of the fact that we have in front of us a plan that \nis part of a three-legged stool. We have Secretary Geithner, who was \ntestifying yesterday in the Banking Committee. Today he is in the \nBudget Committee, which I am on, talking about two other critical \npieces. Housing, how do we get housing going again? How do we stimulate \nthe housing markets? How do we create a bottom in this economic \nfreefall so we can get investments going again and people can stay in \ntheir home or buy a new home. Second, he is talking about how do we get \ncredit flowing again, so we are not only giving money to banks but they \nare loaning the money so that small businesses can get the credit they \nneed, so that the manufacturers, large and small, in my State can get \nthe credit they need to be able to operate, to be able to make parts, \nto be able to do business. We also know it is critically important that \npeople be able to buy a car.\n  The two biggest investments most people will make are their home and \ntheir automobile. We in Michigan would like them to buy a lot of \nautomobiles, made in Michigan, by the way.\n  The reality is we have seen credit shrink and dry up in a way that \nhas caused incredible damage to the economy. So there are three \npieces--two of those Treasury is tackling through existing dollars--\nthat is incredibly important--and the third one is what we are doing in \nterms of creating jobs. The bottom line is not about just creating \njobs; it is about rebuilding the middle class of this country. Every \nother country looks at us with envy because of this great economic \nengine, this great quality of life engine called the middle class of \nAmerica. That is what we are investing in for the future. The people of \nthis country who have not seen any kind of assistance through \ntrickledown economics over the last 8 years, people who said, hey, how \nabout us? How about my job? What you are doing is just talking about a \nfew people. How about the majority of people?\n  This economic recovery package is for the majority of Americans. I am \nvery pleased to see that we basically have, in this American Recovery \nand Reinvestment Act, three goals. One is the focus on creating or \nsaving up to 4 million jobs. Believe me, I know you share that we want \nthat to be 4 and 5 and 6 million and we are not going to stop just \nbecause we pass this recovery package. But this is a critical \ninvestment in jobs.\n  We want to make sure there are tax cuts for families, middle-class \nfamilies. Let's put money in the pockets of the middle class for a \nchange, rather than only those at the top, in terms of wealth. And we \nwant to invest in America's future. That is what we are all about.\n  I am very proud that there is an emphasis on the new green economy \nwhich does all of these things at once. We are here talking about \ninvestments in new technologies that can be built in America. I know \ncolleagues probably get tired of me saying it, but it is not enough to \ninvest in research and development or to be able to provide incentives \nfor using alternative energy--wind or solar or buying electric \nvehicles. We want to build them in America. Mr. President, 70 percent \nof the jobs in the stimulus in wind energy are in manufacturing wind \nturbines. There are 8,000 different parts in a wind turbine. I can \nassure you we can make every single one of those in Michigan and the \nones we can't, we will outsource to Pennsylvania.\n  The reality is we can build the wind turbine. We can build the solar \npanel. A third of all of the polysilicon materials used in solar panels \nare actually created in Michigan through Dow-Corning. Unfortunately, \ntoo much of that is shipped out to other countries. They build the \nsolar panel, it comes back and it is used. We have incentives in this \npackage that will help make sure they are built here--a new 30-percent \nmanufactured tax credit for alternative energy.\n  We are not competing with low-wage countries on these issues. We are \ncompeting with countries such as Germany. That is not exactly a low-\nwage or low-cost country but a country that has a specific \nmanufacturing strategy and tax incentives. This proposal does that. It \ninvests in a number of different alternative energies and focuses not \nonly on research and development, on producing the energy, but also on \nmaking sure that we are putting an emphasis on manufacturing.\n  We also here have a strategy for moving to plug-in electric vehicles \nthat are so important for our future--first, by investing in advanced \nbattery technology, research, and again manufacturing; investments for \nthose to be done here.\n  I was very excited when we saw Ford developed the first Ford Escape \nhybrid SUV, the first plug-in hybrid SUV. It was great, done in \nAmerica, actually being built in Missouri. But the battery had to come \nfrom Japan. We don't make the battery here. Japan has invested hundreds \nof millions of dollars in creating the battery technology to get there \nfirst in the competition for the next generation of vehicles.\n  South Korea, Germany, China, and even India have put together a \nmanufacturing strategy to focus on these things. This recovery plan \ndoes that for the first time. It puts America back on track with \ninvestments in battery technology development and manufacturing. \nSecondly, it does something critically important--and I wish to thank \nSenator Cantwell for her leadership and I am proud to work with her in \nthe effort to create expensing tax incentives for manufacturing of \nelectric vehicles, manufacturing incentives not only for those \ncurrently making a profit and for startups and those not making a \nprofit at this time. That is critically important for you to have the \nresearch in the battery development, incentives for manufacturing the \nvehicles, and then we also have consumer tax credits for purchasing \nvehicles.\n  We know that when you first create a new product, whether it is your \nBlackBerry or your iPhone, your computer, whatever it is, it is far \nmore expensive in the beginning. If you sell a large volume, the price \ncomes down. So at the beginning we know consumer credits are very \nimportant to help with that initial cost. There are credits of up to \n$7,500 for purchasing a vehicle, the kind of vehicle we want for the \nfuture. In this package, we raise the total on the number of vehicles \nthat would qualify for that credit.\n\n[[Page S2099]]\n\n  I wish to thank President Obama and his team for advocating for the \nFederal Government to be part of creating a market by making a \ncommitment to purchase vehicles for the Federal Government. We purchase \na lot of cars and trucks. We can help create that market not only for \nbuilding the vehicles but to bring the price down to consumers by \ncreating a larger market. That is in here as well.\n  There is also a major focus on what has been called the smart grid, \nto make sure we have the electric capacity. I am told today, if every \none of us had a plug-in electric vehicle and plugged it in, the lights \nwould go out. We would be in trouble. We do not have the capacity. So \nwe are focusing on that as well.\n  Senator Cantwell's amendment focuses on what is called smart meters \nin homes. Again, we are talking about a strategy that, frankly, I am \nvery excited about because it is focused on jobs and developing those \ntechnologies and it is focusing on the future.\n  Frankly, it is focusing on the ability for us to get off foreign oil. \nThe last thing we want, and the way we have been headed, is to exchange \ndependence on foreign oil for dependence on foreign technology. This \nrecovery package says, you know what, that does not make any sense. \nLet's create jobs and, at the same time, be working toward getting us \noff foreign oil, making sure we can keep the vehicle production in this \ncountry because we certainly do not want to be asking other countries \nfor their tanks or their trucks or other vehicles. So it is a national \nsecurity issue.\n  But let's do this in a way that makes sense in terms of a total \nstrategy. So in this recovery plan we do a number of things for green \ntechnology. But there is a strategy, a plan, job training being another \ncritical part of the plan. That is in here as well.\n  We also know we can immediately create jobs rebuilding America. Some \nfolks will criticize that somehow the spending on jobs for roads and \nbridges, water and sewer systems and other projects does not make \nsense. It makes a lot of sense. We have about 25 percent of the bridges \nin this country that are viewed as structurally unsafe. We need to be \nabout the business of giving a facelift to America. For those who are \nin our middle years now, we understand that. The truth is we have not \nbeen investing in American infrastructure. We have not been investing \nin roads, bridges, water and sewer.\n  Guess what. There is a new kind of infrastructure. It is called the \nInternet. I want the small businesses in Michigan to have access to \nhigh-speed Internet so they can do business around the world and stay \nin Michigan. The capacity to do that is helped in this bill.\n  We also make sure hospitals can have access to technology so they not \nonly make sure they are providing complete information in the care of \nsomeone but they are cutting costs. We are talking about not only \ntraditional infrastructure and water and sewer and roads and bridges \nand public transportation, which is critically important, but we are \nalso talking about looking to the future--as our President has said, \nnot looking back but looking to the future.\n  Part of what is in the future, as well, is investing in key portions \nrelated to education, related to access to college. That is here as \nwell, all of which keeps people working and creates opportunities. When \nyou help a family afford to send their kids to college, they are not \nthen trying to figure out, since home equity loans are hard to come by \nnow, how in the world they are going to juggle and be able to make the \nhouse payment and be able to send the kids to college.\n  So this is all part of the picture in terms of stimulus. I would \nsuggest this is critically important and long overdue.\n  We also have a focus in here on those who have been caught up in this \neconomic tsunami, those who have been hurt. I can certainly speak for \nMichigan because it has been multiple years, not 1 year, not 2 years, \nthat we have seen job loss.\n  In this package, we also make sure individuals and businesses that \nare hit the hardest receive assistance. We make sure we extend \nunemployment compensation--in the hardest hit States, up to 33 weeks \nfor an individual. We provided extra help in putting food on the table, \nto be able to keep health care.\n  It is great to have COBRA. If you have health insurance through your \nemployer, then you go on unemployment and the COBRA payment can cost \nalmost your entire unemployment check to be able to keep health care \nfor your family. So we provide help for families, while they are going \nthrough a transition to get new employment.\n  We also--this is very important to Michigan and I know to the \nPresiding Officer's State as well--make sure we have in place support \nfor workers who have lost their jobs because of unfair trade practices \nand make sure job training, health care, and other assistance is \navailable as well.\n  We also know many people who, through no fault of their own, are \nfinding themselves with no health care and needing to go to Medicaid. \nFor individuals without health care, States are being hit very hard. \nThere were 25,000 new individuals in December in Michigan who signed up \nto get health care assistance. This will help with that as well.\n  Families in America are hurting. This package recognizes that and \nsupports them and, frankly, according to every economist, creates a \nhuge stimulus to the economy as we are doing that. It makes sense that \nwhen someone is out of work and they receive a little bit more money in \ntheir pocket, they are going to spend it. They do not have the \nopportunity to save it. They are going to have to spend it to be able \nto pay the mortgage, the rent, to be able to pay for food. We have \nheard this from economists, we have heard it actually for several years \nnow. We have been hearing from economists that the quickest way to \nstimulate the economy, to get money in the economy, is to extend \nunemployment benefits, to help with food assistance because the people \nare going to go to the grocery store, they are going to buy the food. \nThe grocers are going to be able to turn around and purchase food \nsupply from vendors and then the ripple is very large. So we did that \nbecause it is both a stimulus and it is also the moral thing to do, the \nright thing to do, when people in America are hurting.\n  We know, again, there are more people out of work than there are jobs \navailable. We have, I believe, a moral obligation to pay attention and \ndo what we can to help while families get back on their feet.\n  There are many parts of this bill, but another important part for \nfamilies is in the ability to put money in their pockets, in terms of \nmiddle-class tax cuts, child tax cuts for families, and to be able to \nmake sure any tax relief is targeted to those first who have not \nreceived much of a tax cut in a long time. But, secondly, there are \nthose in the middle class who most need to have money in their pockets \nand those working hard to get into the middle class who most need money \nin their pockets as well. We make sure we also focus on helping our \nveterans and seniors put money into their pockets. Again, we know this \nwill help stimulate the economy.\n  Overall, I am here to say this package needs to get done. It needs to \nget done as quickly as possible. It needs to get done by tomorrow or by \nFriday. I hope we will not see more filibustering going on and more \ndelays.\n  I hope we will come together. No one says anything we pass is \nperfect. We do the best we can. In this case, I have to say this is \nsomething economists have said will work. We know we need the jobs. We \nknow families need help. We know what we need to do for investments in \nthe future. We know what we need to do to support small businesses, \nwhat we need to do to be able to support manufacturing, to keep jobs in \nAmerica.\n  This is not rocket science. We know what needs to be done. This \npackage addresses that. This is about creating jobs in America. That is \nfundamentally what this is about. We have gone for too long, we have \nlost over 4 million manufacturing jobs, good-paying, middle-class jobs \nin America in the last 8 years. We have over 11 million people out of \nwork today. Now is the time. Now is the time for us to help the people \nof America get back to work.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan.)

Madam President, during the Presidential campaign, \ncandidate Barack Obama came to Nevada 20 times. Most of those visits \nwere to Las Vegas. It is a place he and I have spoken about lots of \ntimes. His staff who came with him loved Las Vegas. I want everyone to \nunderstand that when President Obama, at his press conference Monday \nnight, said there was a need for an economic recovery plan, he was very \nserious about that, and he meant it.\n  During the question-and-answer period, the President made remarks \nconcerning trips to Las Vegas by financial services companies and their \nemployees. I have spoken at length with President Obama's Chief of \nStaff Rahm Emanuel. I will speak to the President when I have that \nopportunity. Mr. Emanuel made it clear to me--and I know this is the \ncase--that President Obama's criticism was aimed at the potential use \nof taxpayer funds for junkets.\n  Now, we gave a lot of money to these banks, and they shouldn't be \ntaking junkets with any of that money, whether they go to Las Vegas, \nLos Angeles, Salt Lake City, New York City, or anyplace else. That was \nthe point President Obama was making.\n  We all know Las Vegas is a premier destination source of the world, \nand people look upon it as a good place to go for a little timeout. I \nrepeat, during the campaign President Obama was in Nevada 20 times. In \nfact, he just accepted my invitation to visit again this spring, early \nsummer for the first time as our President.\n  Nevada has lots of hotel rooms, but Las Vegas has more than 140,000--\nfar more than any other place in the world. We have millions of feet of \nvisiting space. The largest convention center in the world is in Las \nVegas.\n  As all Americans spend less as a result of our economic crisis, it is \nimportant to note that Las Vegas, with an average daily hotel rate of \nonly $119, is one of America's most affordable cities to visit. It is \none reason nearly 6 million people came to Las Vegas to attend more \nthan 20,000 meetings and conventions last year.\n  President Obama and I agree that every penny of taxpayer funds should \nbe protected. We also agree Las Vegas is one of America's greatest \ndestinations for tourists, families, and businesses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, earlier today the junior Senator from \nCalifornia was discussing President Clinton's 1993 tax hike bill that \nbroke his campaign promise to cut taxes on those making $200,000 or \nless and instead raised taxes on those making more than $20,000 a year. \nThe junior Senator from California said this morning:\n\n       Charles Grassley: I do not think it takes a rocket \n     scientist to know that this bill will cost jobs. That is what \n     he said of the Clinton plan that created 23 million jobs.\n\n  That is the end of the quote of what this Senator said. It is an \naccurate quote, but I want to make sure there is a context.\n  I made that statement about the 1993 Clinton tax hike bill on seniors \nand the vast majority of other Americans. The junior Senator from \nCalifornia is saying that one tax hike bill in 1993 is solely \nresponsible for the creation of 23 million jobs between 1993 and the \nyear 2000 and, in a sense, we should ignore all other economic events, \nincluding the work of the Republican Congress, free-trade legislation, \nand many other factors that actually caused the job creation during \nthat period. Other than being simply wrong, it revises fiscal history. \nI felt the need to respond to those remarks because the junior Senator \nfrom California called me out by name on the Senate floor.\n  I gave a speech on the Senate floor just yesterday that clearly \nrebuts her mistaken assertion that the Clinton 1993 tax hike bill was \nthe cause of 23 million jobs. Perhaps she was involved in partisan \nnegotiations on the stimulus bill instead of watching my speech at that \ntime.\n  I will note that as one of five Senate conferees on the stimulus \nbill, I have been excluded from participating in conference \nnegotiations and instead will only be invited to a photo op today \nscheduled at 3 p.m. which the Democrats are referring to as the one \nconference meeting that is required under the rules. Dave Camp, the \nonly other Republican tax writer who is a conferee, has also been \nexcluded from conference negotiations.\n  There will not be any negotiations, give or take, or compromise at \nthat meeting; it will simply be to ratify a deal that Democrats and \nthree Republicans out of 219 Republicans in the entire Congress have \nagreed to. In fact, there were more Democrats--11 in the House of \nRepresentatives--who voted against the stimulus package than there were \nthe three Republicans who voted for it. This bill was handed over to \nthe House Democratic leadership to write, and they wrote a bill that \nwas loaded down with a lot of unnecessary--well, I shouldn't say \nunnecessary spending; I should say spending that goes way beyond the 2-\nyear window of stimulus; a window that Dr. Summers, the President's \neconomic adviser, said ought to be timely, temporary, and targeted. \nThat is 2 years, that is not forever.\n  So this bill is not stimulative, then, or goes way beyond being \nstimulative, and it tended to include items that reward Democratic \nsupporters such as unions and environmental groups. It has an enormous \nbailout of States that overspent their budgets and a lot of spending \nthat belongs in an appropriations bill but which has no place in a \nstimulus bill. Less than 34 percent of the Senate bill was tax relief, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, which is the official \nscorekeeper on that matter. Less than 1 percent of the Senate bill was \ntax relief for small business, and small businesses are the engine for \njob growth in our economy, creating three-fourths of new jobs in our \neconomy.\n  Since the junior Senator from California clearly did not hear my \nspeech from yesterday, I wish to go over some of the key items she has \noverlooked. Two days ago, and again this morning, there was a lot of \nrevision or perhaps editing of recent budget history. Our President \nalluded to it. I agree with the President there is a lot of revisionism \nin the debate. The revisionist history basically boils down to two \nconclusions: that all of the so-called good fiscal history of the 1990s \nwas derived from a partisan tax increase of 1993; and No. 2, that all \nof the bad fiscal history of this decade to date is attributable to \nbipartisan tax relief plans earlier this decade.\n  Now, not surprisingly, nearly all of the revisionists who spoke \ngenerally oppose tax relief and support tax increases. The same crew \ngenerally support spending increases and oppose spending cuts. In the \ndebate so far, many on this side have pointed out some key, undeniable \nfacts. The bill before us, with interest included, increases the \ndeficit by over $1 trillion. The bill before us is a heavy stew of \nspending increases and refundable tax credits, seasoned with small \npieces of tax relief. The bill before us has new temporary spending \nthat if made permanent will burden future budget deficits by over $1 \ntrillion. All of this occurs--all of it occurs--in an environment where \nthe automatic economic stabilizers are kicking in to help the most \nunfortunate in America with unemployment insurance, food stamps, and \nother benefits--things that are part of the social fabric of America \nthat are meant to take care of people in need, and particularly right \nnow when we are in a recession, they automatically trigger in to higher \nlevels of spending. That antirecessionary spending, together with lower \ntax receipts and the TARP activities, has set a fiscal table of a \ndeficit of $1.2 trillion. That is the highest deficit as a percentage \nof the economy in post-World War II history, not a pretty fiscal \npicture. It is going to get a lot uglier as a result of this bill. So \nfor the folks who see this bill as an opportunity to recover America \nwith Government taking a larger share of the economy over the long \nterm, I say congratulations.\n  If a Member votes for this bill, that Member puts us on the path to a \nbigger role for the Government, but supporters of this bill need to own \nup to\n\n[[Page S2101]]\n\nthe fiscal course they are charting. That is where the revisionist \nhistory comes from. It is a strategy to divert, through a twisted blame \ngame, from the facts before us. One can ask: How is this history \nrevisionist? So I would take each conclusion one by one.\n  The first conclusion is that all of the good fiscal history was \nderived from the 1993 tax increase. To knock down this assertion, all \nyou have to do is take a look at this chart--not a chart produced by \nthe Senator from Iowa but a chart produced from data from the Clinton \nadministration, and it is right here. It is the same chart I had up a \ncouple of days ago. The much ballyhooed partisan 1993 tax increase \naccounts for 13 percent--you can say 13 percent or you can say just 13 \npercent, and I prefer the latter--just 13 percent of the deficit \nreduction through the decade of the 1990s.\n  The biggest source of deficit reduction, 35 percent, came from, as \nyou can see, cuts in defense spending. Of course, that fiscal benefit \noriginated from President Reagan's stare-down of the Communist regime \nin Russia before 1989, and we didn't have to spend as much on defense \nbecause the Cold War was--well, there wasn't a Cold War, I suppose you \ncould say. The same folks on that side who opposed President Reagan's \ndefense buildup take credit for the fiscal benefit of a peace dividend.\n  The next biggest source of deficit reduction, 32 percent, is other \nrevenue. It came from various sources. Basically, this was the fiscal \nbenefit from progrowth policies, such as the bipartisan capital gains \ntax cut of 1997, and the free-trade agreements President Clinton, with \nRepublican votes, established.\n  The savings from the policies I have pointed out translated into \ninterest savings. So you get the 15 percent that is from interest \nsavings.\n  Now, for all the chest-thumping about the 1990s, these chest thumpers \nwho push for big social spending didn't bring much to the deficit \nreduction table of the 1990s. That contribution was the 5 percent you \nsee up there.\n  What is more, the fiscal revisionist historians in this body tend to \nforget who the players were. They are correct that there was a \nDemocratic President in the White House. But they conveniently forget \nthe Republicans controlled the Congress for that period, where the \ndeficit came down and turned to surplus. They tend to forget they \nfought the principle of a balanced budget that was the centerpiece of \nour policy at that time, the Republican Party's policy.\n  Remember the Government shutdown in late 1995?\n  They ought to remember that. Remember what it was about? It was about \na plan to balance the budget. Republicans paid a political price for \nforcing the issue. But, in 1997, President Clinton agreed. Recall, as \nwell, all through the 1990s what the year-end battles were all about. \nOn one side, congressional Democrats and the Clinton administration \npushed for more spending. On the other side, congressional Republicans \nwere pushing for tax relief. In the end, both sides compromised. That \nis the real fiscal history of the 1990s.\n  Let's turn to the other conclusion of the revisionist fiscal \nhistorians. That conclusion is that, in this decade, all fiscal \nproblems are attributable to the widespread tax relief enacted in \n2001--which was a bipartisan bill--2003, 2004, and 2006.\n  In 2001, President Bush came into office and inherited an economy \nthat was careening downhill. Investment started to go flat in 2000--you \nknow, the NASDAQ bubble that lost 50 percent of its value. In February \n2000, we started down the road of more than 40 months of downturn in \nthe manufacturing index. Then we had the economic shocks that related \nfrom the 9/11 terrorist attacks and then you can add in the corporate \nscandals to that economic environment.\n  It is true, as fiscal year 2001 came to a close, the projected \nsurplus turned to a deficit, and we have a chart that shows the start \nof this decade's fiscal history.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Is it possible to get 3 more minutes?\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, if the Senator would like an additional 5 \nminutes, that is OK with me.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I appreciate that. I have to get out of here at that \ntime anyway. I have a radio program I have to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, we have the chart that you have seen \nbefore, and nobody has disputed the chart. Maybe you can dispute the \ninterpretations of it, but these are figures you can rely upon.\n  If my comments were meant to be partisan shots, I could say this \nfavorable fiscal path from 2003 to 2007 was the only period, aside from \n6 months in 2001, where Republicans controlled the White House and the \nCongress. But unlike the fiscal history revisionists, I am not trying \nto make any partisan points; I am trying to give you the fiscal facts.\n  We have another chart that compares tax receipts for the 4 years \nafter the much ballyhooed 1993 tax increase and the 4-year period after \nthe 2003 tax cut.\n  On a year-by-year basis, this chart compares the change in revenues \nas a percentage of GDP. In 1993, the Clinton tax increase brought in \nmore revenue as compared to the 2003 tax cut. That trend, though, \nreversed as both policies moved along in years. You can see from the \nchart how the extra revenue went up over time relative to the flat line \nof the 1993 tax increase, which ought to make it very clear that you \ndon't necessarily bring in more revenue because you increase taxes, and \nyou can decrease taxes, stimulate the economy, encourage business \nactivity, encourage investment, and bring in more revenue.\n  The progrowth tax and trade policies of the 1990s, along with the \n``peace dividend'' had a lot more to do with deficit reduction in the \n1990s than the 1993 tax increase, which was only 13 percent of deficit \nreduction. In this decade, deficits went down after tax relief plans \nwere put in full effect.\n  That is the past. We need to make sure we understand it. But what is \nmost important is the future. In fact, the last election, based upon \nPresident Obama's very own statements, was about the future, not about \nthe past. So we should not be talking about the past. People in our \nStates sent us here to deal with future policy. They don't send us here \nto flog one another similar to partisan cartoon cutout characters over \npast policies. They don't send us here to endlessly point fingers of \nblame. Now let's focus on the fiscal consequences on the bill in front \nof us. That is what this vote, before we end this week, is all about.\n  President Obama rightly focused us on the future with his eloquence \nduring the campaign. I would like to take a--paraphrase a quote from \nthe President's nomination acceptance speech:\n\n       We need a President who can face the threats of the future, \n     not grasping at the ideas of the past.\n\n  President Obama was right.\n  We need a President, and I would add Congressmen and Senators, who \ncan face the threats of the future. This bill, as currently written, \nposes considerable threats to our fiscal future. Senator McCain's \nspending trigger amendment showed us the way. We can rewrite this bill \nto retain its stimulative effect, but turn off the spending when the \nrecovery occurs.\n  Grasping at ideas of the past or playing the partisan blame game will \nnot deal with the threats to our fiscal future.\n  It is not too late to do a clean stimulus bill, which is what the \nAmerican people want and need. There is a way to reach a real \nbipartisan compromise, not just picking off a few Senators that \nfrequently vote with the Democrats. We can have a significant amount of \ninfrastructure spending for roads and bridges. Even though some on our \nside of the aisle have issues with the making work pay credit, we could \ntake that and expand it to cover all those making up to $250,000--which \nis the level that President Obama and his surrogates said during the \ncampaign that he wants to cut taxes for people. Instead, the making \nwork pay credit phases out starting at $70,000 for individual workers. \nSo we are saying a large part of the middle class by President Obama's \ndefinition won't get the tax cut. In fact, the ``we give a tax cut to \n95 percent of working families'' number that has been bandied about is \nwrong. According to the Joint Committee on\n\n[[Page S2102]]\n\nTaxation, 87 percent of workers qualify for some or all of the credit, \nand even less get all of the credit. So there is a way forward. It is a \nclean stimulus bill. All the Democratic agenda items and spending items \nthat should go in the appropriations bill can get done in regular \norder. The Democrats have the votes. They don't need to push that \nagenda on the American people and dig a deficit ditch an additional \n$1.2 trillion deeper with this bill, when interest on the bill is \nconsidered. They have the votes to push their agenda later in the year. \nFor now, let's give the American people what they want, a clean \nstimulus bill, and not scare them into thinking that the Democratic \nagenda needs to be pushed in the stimulus bill. It is reminiscent of \nthat famous chicken--Chicken Little, who said ``The Sky is Falling.'' \nLet's do a clean stimulus bill instead.\n  I think this clears up the record. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I was glad to yield the additional 5 \nminutes to my friend from Iowa. Senator Grassley has always been, as \nfar as I could see, bipartisan in my 2 years in the Senate. I thank him \nfor that. I often don't agree with his reasoning, but I always agree \nwith his motive. I wish to make a couple comments--and I know he has to \nleave and that is fine. I wish to make some comments on his comments, \nand then I will talk more precisely and directly about this stimulus \npackage that we are convinced will create millions of jobs for our \neconomy and our country.\n  I was joined in a press conference today by the President of the \nNational Association of Manufacturers, a group that rarely supports me \nin my campaign and rarely supports the Presiding Officer in hers, as it \nis a group that simply doesn't agree with us. The National Association \nof Manufacturers thinks this stimulus package is just right. They like \nthe spending part, the tax cuts part; they think it is the right mix. \nThey were resounding in their support today. Also joining Senator Jack \nReed and me was the president of the National Association of Realtors.\n  There are a lot of very important economic organizations and business \ngroups that are supportive of this legislation. I am sorry it has \nbecome so partisan to the Republicans and that only three of them could \nsee their way to support a bill that has gotten huge bipartisan and \nbusiness support and labor support around the country and not even \nthree people in the House of Representatives. So I have a couple \ncomments on Senator Grassley's comments.\n  I am incredulous when you see people stand and try to make the 1990s \neconomy out to have not been very good and the economy of the last \ndecade to have been better. Yet anything good that happened in the \n1990s had to do with Republican policies, and anything bad that \nhappened in this decade had to do with Democratic policies. It goes \nback to something I am even more incredulous about, and that is this \ncottage industry that has been created in this country in the last year \nthat Franklin Roosevelt's Presidency was a failure and that it caused \nthe Depression and then caused the second depression and recession in \n1937. It is remarkable. I am not an economic expert. I took economics \ncourses in high school and in college, but I am a prolific reader. I \ndon't ever recall reading--from conservative or liberal economists and \npeople in between, such as academics or business people--that Franklin \nRoosevelt's economic policies were a failure, until 6 months ago when \nit was clear that Barack Obama was going to be President and was going \nto follow some of Roosevelt's ideas of direct spending to put people to \nwork, for infrastructure, for health care, education, and a lot of \nthings Franklin Roosevelt did, such as regulation of Wall Street, of \nthe minimum wage and worker's compensation and unemployment \ncompensation--all the things that Roosevelt began.\n  On a personal note, I add that this desk at which I stand is desk No. \n88. They each have numbers on them. This desk was occupied, back in the \n1930s, by future Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black, then a Senator from \nAlabama. Hugo Black supposedly sat at this desk when he wrote the \nminimum wage bill; he wrote it on the Senate floor, apparently, and it \nlater became law.\n  What intrigues me is that there are Wall Street Journal columnists--\nno surprise--and Washington Times, Republican ideologues, and \nconservative think tanks funded by some of the wealthiest outsourcing \nkinds of corporations in America, who are trying to discredit Franklin \nRoosevelt's policies in order to discredit President Obama's policies. \nIt is historical revisionism that sounds almost like, I daresay, the \nSoviet Union--this kind of revisionist history that I don't even get.\n  There is no question in any fair-minded historian's mind that what \nFranklin Roosevelt did mattered in a very positive way. He built a \nbanking structure that kept us safe for 75 years, until the Republicans \nderegulated it in the last 8 years. He built a wage structure that \ncreated a middle class. He got us out of the Depression, along with \nothers he worked with.\n  Enough of that. When I heard my friend from Iowa talk about the \n1990s, that the Clinton policies didn't work and that, in 2001, the \nBush policies did--where I come from, in Ohio, we say that doesn't pass \nthe straight-face test. I don't think anybody believes them. These \ncolumnists and pundits and rightwing ideologues and think-tank \nacademics keep saying it, so I guess they are talking to each other but \nnot to the American public.\n  Let me talk about the stimulus. The Senate, yesterday, took a major \nstep toward revitalizing this stumbling economy.\n  We passed legislation that would create jobs in construction, \nengineering, green energy, social work, health care, the retail sector, \nthe service sector, and the manufacturing sector--preserving those jobs \nnow and building jobs in the future.\n  These are jobs that stimulate consumer spending, which stimulates \neconomic activity, economic activity that fuels growth and gets us out \nof recession. When you build a bridge, you put money in the pockets of \nsheet metal workers and operating engineers and laborers and carpenters \nand electricians.\n  When you build an infrastructure project, that money does two things: \nIt goes directly into the economy because these are good-paying jobs \nthat create a middle class, and they will spend that money on homes, \ncars, and consumer items. It also, as I have learned in doing \nroundtables around Ohio--I have done 125 roundtables in all of Ohio; I \nhave been in all the 88 counties listening to people talk. I invite 20 \nor 25 people in a community, a good cross-section of people. It is not \njust the mayors and county engineers who say we need more sewers, \nbroadband, water systems, bridges, highways, and roads. It is also \neconomic development directors of the communities' chambers of \ncommerce, the plant managers, and other business people who understand \nthat to do economic development, you need clean water for \nmanufacturing, you need a good transportation system, bridges, water, \nsewer systems, broadband, and all these things. That is what this \nstimulus package is about--infrastructure. It creates 4 million jobs, \nsome directly and immediately, as we set the table and build a \nfoundation for economic development.\n  The bill, I also add, invests in alternative energy. That means good-\npaying jobs, energy innovation, and energy independence. It means \nfighting for global independence and fighting global warming, a force \nthat is threatening animal species and could only jeopardize the human \nspecies as well. An overwhelming number of scientists say that.\n\n  This bill will not only stimulate our economy, it will make sure our \nNation can regain its economic footing and does not do it just to lose \nit again in the future.\n  We cannot be dependent on foreign oil and hope to thrive in the \nglobal economy. We cannot let our transportation infrastructure erode. \nThat is what has happened in the last 10 years.\n  At the beginning of this decade that some of my Republican friends \nbrag about, the economic policy of the early Bush years, we had a \nbudget surplus when he stood on the Capitol steps and took the oath of \noffice. We had a budget surplus in this country. Then the President \nwent to war with Iraq, spending $3 billion a week. The President did \ntax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.\n\n[[Page S2103]]\n\nAnd all of a sudden, we have this huge budget deficit that my \nRepublican friends rail against we are adding to.\n  When President Obama took office, the budget deficit was at $1 \ntrillion for that fiscal year. It went from zero to $1 trillion. Madam \nPresident, $1 trillion is a thousand billion; a billion is a thousand \nmillion. If you spent $1,000 every second of every minute of every hour \nof every day, it would take you 33 years to spend $1 trillion. The \npages sitting in front of me average in age about half that; am I \ncorrect? Sixteen years or so? They have lived about half a billion \nseconds. For them to spend $1 trillion, they would have had to spend \n$2,000 every second of every minute of every hour of every day in their \nyoung lives to get to $1 trillion. You, Madam President, would have to \nspend a little less, being very young but a bit older than they are.\n  Let me talk for a moment about what is happening with the States.\n  Every State in this country--unless they are energy States, unless \nthey make money in their State treasuries from oil production, coal \nproduction, natural gas production--is faced with a huge budget \ndeficit. My State of Ohio, for instance, as so many States, is forced \nto cut services. Cutting services means cutting jobs, it means laying \noff people, and it means hurting communities. It means all of that.\n  We cannot dismiss this situation. We must confront it. We must do \nsomething about it. It means as people lose their jobs, as a plant in \nJackson, OH, the Meridian plant, closes or a plant somewhere else in \nGallipolis or Mansfield or Toledo, OH, closes--when a plant shuts down, \nit is not just those workers who lose, as tragic as it is; it also puts \nmore demands on the mental health system, more demands on the food \npantry, more demands on communities that simply cannot afford it. As \ntheir tax base shrivels, they cannot afford it.\n  Economic recovery will not happen at the national level unless it \nhappens at the State level. With dramatically reduced revenues, States \nare left with no options. They are cutting basic jobs, and they are \ncutting basic services. They are cutting social workers, teachers, \nmental health counselors, and public safety personnel. We cannot \nfunction that way. If what we do in the recovery bill adds jobs but the \nStates take them away, we will be left treading water.\n  The House-passed economic recovery bill includes dollars the States \ncan use to weather this economic storm. And if they don't weather it, \nnone of us will.\n  So I hope Senators and Representatives negotiating the final bill \nwill agree upon the House-passed State stabilization fund. It just \nmakes sense.\n  This bill, as I said earlier, is endorsed by the National Chamber of \nCommerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Realtors, and \nbusinesses all over the Presiding Officer's State of North Carolina and \nmy State of Ohio. It is endorsed by small businesses, by manufacturing \nbusinesses--all those companies that create so much wealth and jobs in \nour society.\n  In my State, from Toledo to Columbus, our universities are engaging \nin groundbreaking research. From Cleveland to Cincinnati, regional \npartnerships are being formed to advance solar and wind technology. My \nState is well on the way to becoming the Silicon Valley of alternative \nenergy. We are about to put wind turbines in Lake Erie--the only place \nin the world where wind turbines will actually be located in \nfreshwater. We are building hydropower on the Ohio River. We have the \nlargest solar manufacturer of any State in the country in northwest \nOhio. The University of Toledo is doing all kinds of wind turbine \nresearch, fuel cells in Stark State and Canton and Rolls Royce and \nMount Vernon. Fuel cell development and research is far ahead of most \nplaces in the country, with biomass, Battelle in Columbus, all kinds of \ncoal research. We are doing things that, with this bill, we can do \nbetter.\n  There is $33 billion in green energy tax incentives in this bill to \ngrow jobs by encouraging green energy production. What value is it if \nwe wean ourselves from foreign oil by using solar but we are not \nproducing solar in our country?\n  Oberlin College, which is 15 minutes from my house, has the largest \nsingle building on any college campus in America powered fully by solar \nenergy built 3, 4 years ago. We got those solar panels from Germany and \nJapan. Why do we do that? We do it because in the early part of this \ndecade President Bush pushed through this Senate and the House--I was a \nMember of the House--an energy bill that dumped all of its tax \nincentives, subsidies and incentives, to oil and gas, not to solar, not \nto wind, not to fuel cells, not to biomass, not to where we should have \nbeen looking. It was the same old game, same old politics, same old \n``help your friends in the oil and gas industry, cash your campaign \nchecks, and do the country wrong.'' That is why this bill is so \nimportant to do something else.\n  Lastly, I wish to talk about another provision of the bill which \nprobably is the strongest provision of the bill; that is, the ``Buy \nAmerican'' provision Senator Dorgan and I worked on in the last couple \nof years.\n  In a recent survey of Americans, 84 percent support the ``Buy \nAmerican'' provision--perhaps the strongest statement of the public on \nany provision in the stimulus bill. The fact is, we are asking people \nin North Carolina, Ohio, and around this country to reach into their \npockets and come up with hundreds of billions of dollars to spend on \nthe stimulus package. They ask three things: first, that we be \naccountable in doing this right; second, they ask that the jobs be in \nthe United States; third, they ask that the materials used for this \ninfrastructure also be made in the United States. That is the compact \nwe have come to, and I believe that is so very important.\n  I have had discussions with people at the highest levels of the Obama \nadministration about the importance of ``Buy American'' and about \nenforcement. We have had some of these ``Buy American'' laws on the \nbooks since the Roosevelt years. It is part of the reason he was \nsuccessful. The Bush administration simply turned its back on this law. \nThey simply did not enforce it. They granted waivers, waivers that were \nnot even public. For instance, the 800-mile fence along the Mexico-\nUnited States border was made with Chinese steel, probably illegally. \nBut the Bush administration just said: OK, buy the steel wherever you \nwant, instead of putting Americans to work.\n  I close with, as all of us in this body--most of us--understand, we \nneed to get this economy back on track, we need to set the stage for a \nprosperous future. Partisanship at this stage is a slap in the face of \nunemployed Americans, families facing foreclosures, communities sinking \ninto poverty, and, frankly, to middle-class America, who just wants an \neven break and wants us to get our economy back on track. Action is our \nonly option. Let's move.\n  I yield the floor. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/11/senate-section/article/S2103-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2103-S2123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF WILLIAM J.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of William J. Lynn, III, of \nVirginia, to be Deputy Secretary of Defense.\n\n[[Page S2104]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I utilize.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the \nnomination of Bill Lynn to be Deputy Secretary of Defense. This \nnomination was reported to the Senate by the Armed Services Committee \nby voice vote on February 5, without objection or dissenting vote.\n  Since the time that he received his law degree from Cornell Law \nSchool and his master's degree in public affairs from the Woodrow \nWilson School more than 25 years ago, Mr. Lynn has devoted his life to \npublic service and the national defense. For 6 years, Mr. Lynn worked \nas the military legislative assistant and legislative counsel to \nSenator Ted Kennedy. In 1993, he moved to the Department of Defense, \nwhere he served first as director of program analysis and evaluation, \nand then as comptroller until 2001. Over the years, he has also served \nas a senior fellow at the National Defense University, on the \nprofessional staff at the Institute for Defense Analyses, and as an \nexecutive director of the Defense Organization Project at the Center \nfor Strategic and International Studies.\n  At the end of the Clinton administration, Mr. Lynn went to the \nprivate sector for the first time, working first for DFI international \nand then for Raytheon Corporation, where he has served as senior vice \npresident of government operations and strategy, overseeing the \ncompany's strategic planning and government relations. As a result of \nthe senior positions he has held with Raytheon, Mr. Lynn has vested and \nunvested stock in the company, as well as salary, bonus, and retirement \npayments that are due now and in the future\n  Mr. Lynn's situation is of course not unique. Numerous nominees to \nsenior positions in prior administrations--including nominees to serve \nas Secretary of Defense, Deputy Secretary of Defense, Under Secretary \nof Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, Secretaries of \nthe Military Departments, and Service Acquisition Executives--have \nserved in similar industry positions and held similar financial \ninterests at the time of their nominations.\n  Over the years, the Senate Armed Services Committee has developed a \nstrict set of ethics guidelines to address potential conflicts of \ninterest, and the appearance of conflicts of interest, arising out of \nsuch nominations. These guidelines are tougher and more comprehensive \nthan the rules historically imposed by the executive branch or by other \ncongressional committees. When I say ``These guidelines'' are tougher \nand more comprehensive, I am referring here to the guidelines that the \nSenate Armed Services Committee has developed.\n  For example, under generally applicable executive branch ethics \nrules, a nominee could address actual or potential conflicts without \ndivesting stock or other financial interests by recusing himself from \nmatters involving his former employer--subject to a waiver by DOD \nethics officials. However, the Armed Services Committee of the Senate \ntakes a stricter approach. We require that nominees to Senate-confirmed \npositions divest themselves of stock, stock options, and other \nfinancial interests in companies that do business with the Department \nof Defense. In the case of stock options that have not yet vested, and \nwill not vest within 90 days after confirmation, the committee insists \nthat the nominee renounce the options--in other words, forfeiting the \nentire value of the stock options.\n  The committee's strict divestiture requirements are added to the \nrequirements of statutory and regulatory ethics rules applicable to all \nexecutive branch officials. Our rules require senior executive branch \nofficials to recuse themselves from decisions impacting their former \nemployers for a period of 1 year, even if they have already divested \nall financial interest. When I said ``our rules'' I was referring here \nto the executive branch rules. As a result, nominees to senior DOD \npositions are subject to both divestiture and recusal requirements.\n  These ethics requirements have been effective. Over the 12 years that \nI have served as chairman or ranking member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, I am not aware of a single instance in which a Senate-\nconfirmed defense official who previously served in industry has even \nbeen alleged to have taken an action favoring his former employer. We \nmay agree or disagree with some of the decisions that these senior \nofficials have made, but conflict of interest does not appear to have \nbeen alleged in any of those disagreements.\n\n  Mr. Lynn has complied with all of the committee's requirements. In \naccordance with our ethics guidelines, Mr. Lynn has agreed to divest \nhis financial interest in his former employer within 90 days of his \nconfirmation. In order to accomplish this purpose, he has agreed to \nforfeit restricted stock. By the way, this stock has a value between \n$250,000 and $500,000. But that stock does not vest until late in 2009 \nor 2010. In short, Mr. Lynn has agreed to forfeit that restricted stock \nand thereby make a significant financial sacrifice in order to return \nto Government service.\n  In addition, Mr. Lynn will be subject to the statutory and regulatory \nrecusal requirements that I have already discussed. These recusal \nrequirements are subject to waiver by the senior ethics official in the \nDepartment of Defense. However, Mr. Lynn has taken an additional step \nby agreeing not to seek any waiver of the recusal requirements during \nhis first year in office with regard to any matter on which he \npersonally lobbied either Congress or the executive branch. This \ncommitment on Mr. Lynn's part goes beyond the steps taken by previous \nnominees to senior positions at the Department of Defense.\n  The bottom line is this. Mr. Lynn, if confirmed, will be subject to \nethics restrictions that are stricter than those historically imposed \nby the executive branch, stricter than those applied by other \ncongressional committees, and stricter even than those applied by the \nArmed Services Committee to previous nominees with similar backgrounds.\n  On January 21, 2009, President Obama issued an Executive order on \nethics commitments by executive branch personnel. This Executive order \nincludes a provision that would, for the first time, preclude \nregistered lobbyists from seeking or accepting employment with an \nagency that they had lobbied within the previous 2 years. Because Mr. \nLynn was a registered lobbyist for Raytheon, he could not have been \nappointed Deputy Secretary of Defense without a waiver of this \nprohibition.\n  On January 23, 2009, the Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget approved a waiver to two paragraphs of the executive order, \nclearing the way for Mr. Lynn to serve.\n  Mr. Lynn will still be subject to the tough new postemployment \nrestrictions in the executive order. Those would preclude him from \nlobbying any DOD official for 2 years after leaving office, and from \nlobbying any political appointee in the Obama administration for the \nduration of the administration, should he leave his position before the \nend of the administration.\n  This waiver was appropriate: Mr. Lynn is a career public servant \nwhose recent history in the private sector was more of an exile than a \ncalling. He didn't leave the Department of Defense 8 years ago because \nhe wanted to cash in on inside connections or information, but because \nthe Clinton administration came to an end. When Mr. Lynn hopefully \npasses through the doors of the Pentagon as Deputy Secretary of \nDefense, he will return to his roots as a public servant, put his \nrelationships in industry behind him, and recognize that his sole duty \nand obligation is to his country and the national defense.\n  Today, the Department of Defense faces huge management challenges. \nThe Government Accountability Office reported last year that the cost \noverruns on the Department's 95 largest acquisition programs alone now \ntotal almost $300 billion over the original program estimate, even \nthough the Department has cut unit quantities and reduced performance \nexpectations on many programs in an effort to hold down costs.\n  The Department's financial system remains incapable of producing \ntimely, accurate information on which sound business decisions can be \nbased. The Department's civilian workforce has been decimated by \ndecades of freezes and cuts, leaving us dependent on contractors who \nperform many functions\n\n[[Page S2105]]\n\nthat should be performed by Government personnel.\n  Mr. Lynn's background in senior management positions in the \nDepartment of Defense and in industry over the last two decades gives \nhim the kind of knowledge and experience that will be useful to address \nthese challenges. In the course of the committee's consideration of Mr. \nLynn's nomination, I have spoken to him about the challenges facing the \nDepartment of Defense. I have been impressed by his grasp of the \nproblems the Department faces and his ideas for addressing them.\n  Under these circumstances, and those are the circumstances I have \noutlined about cost overruns, we cannot afford a Deputy Secretary who \nis either disengaged or ineffectual. We need someone with the kind of \nexperience and background Mr. Lynn will bring to the job. His \nnomination, again, was approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee \nwithout a single dissenting vote. I hope our colleagues will support \nthis nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I intend to vote in favor of the \nnomination of Mr. Lynn to be the Deputy Secretary of Defense. Mr. Lynn \nhas an extensive record of public service. He has served as the \nDirector of Program Analysis and Evaluation in the Pentagon during the \nClinton administration, and following that he was the Under Secretary \nof Defense, Comptroller, from 1997 to 2001. He served as, obviously, \nthe chief financial officer for the Department of Defense.\n  After his DOD service, Mr. Lynn, as we know, became a registered \nlobbyist and the Raytheon Company's senior vice president of government \noperations. In that position he led Raytheon's strategic planning and \noversaw all of their Government relations activities.\n  Mr. Lynn has served as I mentioned, but nowhere, I might point out, \ndoes he have in his resume any extensive managerial experience. One of \nthe major functions of the Deputy Secretary of Defense is to make the \nPentagon run. Mr. Lynn does not have that executive managerial \nexperience.\n  Having said that, elections have consequences, as we all know, and \nthis is the selection that the President of the United States made, and \nthe Secretary of Defense also supports his nomination.\n  I do not view the fact that Mr. Lynn became a lobbyist for Raytheon \nas, per se, disqualifying. Mr. Lynn has indicated his willingness to \ncomply with the ethical requirements of the executive branch aimed at \npreventing conflicts of interest, and he has agreed to the additional \nstock divestment obligations that the Committee on Armed Services has \nconsistently required of nominees.\n  I have been concerned, however, about the practical problems that \nwould arise from Mr. Lynn's past lobbying activities and the legitimate \nconcerns the American people would have if Mr. Lynn made decisions \nrelated to the programs for which he lobbied.\n  I sent a letter to Mr. Lynn on January 26, with a follow-up letter on \nJanuary 29, asking him to articulate in detail what specific matters \nwould be affected. Mr. Lynn responded on January 30 indicating that he \nhad worked on the DDG-100 surface combatant, the AMRAAM air-to-air \nmissile, the F-15 airborne radar, the Patriot Pure Fleet Program, the \nFuture Imagery Architecture, and the Multiple Kill Vehicle. He provided \nme with written assurances that he would refrain from participating in \nany decisions regarding those programs for 1 year if he is confirmed.\n  I believe these assurances and with ongoing reviews within DOD that \nencompass rigorous screening Mr. Lynn will endeavor to perform \neffectively as the Deputy Secretary of Defense.\n  I am aware, as I mentioned, that he has the support of Secretary \nGates, and I obviously consider that to be an endorsement in Mr. Lynn's \nfavor. President Obama, as we all know, signed an Executive order on \nJanuary 21, 2009, that established a praiseworthy ``revolving door \nban'' that would bar any lobbyist from working for an agency they \nlobbied within 2 years of an appointment. The Executive order included \na provision for granting a public interest waiver, and Mr. Lynn was \ngiven a waiver.\n  It is disappointing that President Obama, who pledged continuously \nthroughout the campaign to change the culture of Washington and the \ninfluence of lobbyists, then almost immediately chose to nominate \nseveral individuals, including Mr. Lynn, who required a waiver.\n  So after proudly trumpeting a new change and the new rules and \nregulations, several individuals--and a couple have had to withdraw \ntheir nominations--that Mr. Lynn required a waiver or exemption to that \npolicy. Obviously, the American people were promised one thing but \ndelivered another.\n  My colleague, Senator Grassley, who will be speaking later, sent a \nletter on January 29 to OMB Director Peter Orszag asking for a \njustification for the granting of the waiver. I ask unanimous consent \nthat Mr. Orszag's response on February 3 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 3, 2009.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: Thank you for giving the \n     Administration the chance to address the questions you raise \n     in your letter of January 29, 2009 regarding the granting of \n     a waiver that exempts Mr. William J. Lynn from certain \n     provisions in President Obama's Executive Order on Ethics \n     Commitments by Executive Branch Personnel (the ``Order''). We \n     appreciate your concerns and are glad to have the opportunity \n     to fully explain the decision to grant this waiver, which we \n     strongly believe to be the correct one.\n\n\n                              I. Background\n\n       The President signed the Executive Order on Ethics \n     Commitments by Executive Branch Personnel on January 21, \n     2009. The Order includes some of the strictest ethics rules \n     ever imposed on executive branch personnel. In addition to \n     barring appointees from accepting gifts from registered \n     lobbyists, the Order places sharp limitations on individuals \n     traveling back and forth between government service and the \n     private sector, using their government service for personal \n     enrichment at the expense of the public interest.\n       The Order takes an especially strong stand against \n     lobbyists moving into and out of the executive branch. The \n     Order restricts registered lobbyists who are appointed to an \n     executive agency from participating in any particular matter \n     on which they lobbied within the past two years and from \n     participating in the specific issue area in which that \n     particular matter falls, subject to the waiver provision \n     discussed below. Registered lobbyists are also restricted \n     from seeking or accepting any employment within an executive \n     agency that they lobbied within the past two years.\n       The Order has been roundly praised by commentators and \n     leading good government advocates as the toughest ever of its \n     kind. To cite just a few, Democracy 21 said that ``the new \n     Executive Order contains the toughest and most far reaching \n     revolving door provisions ever adopted,'' and went on to say \n     that the Order ``goes further than any previous action taken \n     by a President to restrict the ability of presidential \n     appointees who serve in the Executive Branch from coming back \n     to lobby the Administration, and also to limit the role of \n     lobbyists coming in to serve in the Administration.'' The \n     Washington Post reported that experts viewed the Order as \n     ``considerably broader than those other presidents imposed,'' \n     and Meredith McGehee, policy director of the Campaign Legal \n     Center, said in a statement that ``[no] two ways about it, \n     the revolving-door provisions in the new executive order \n     issued by President Obama are very tough.''\n        Even the toughest rules, however, need reasonable \n     exceptions. That is why the Order provides that a waiver of \n     these restrictions may be granted in limited circumstances. \n     The waiver may be granted when it is determined ``(i) that \n     the literal application of the restriction is inconsistent \n     with the purposes of the restriction, or (ii) that it is in \n     the public interest to grant the waiver.'' Sec. 3(a). The \n     Order goes on to explain that the ``public interest'' may \n     include, but is not limited to, exigent circumstances \n     relating to national security or to the economy. Sec. 3(b). \n     The Order also instructs the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget to consult with the White House Counsel \n     when determining whether a waiver is necessary and \n     appropriate.\n       Experts have praised the inclusion of a waiver provision in \n     the Order. For example, Norman Ornstein, a Resident Scholar \n     at the American Enterprise Institute stated that: ``This \n     tough and commendable new set of ethics provisions goes a \n     long way toward breaking the worst effects of the revolving \n     door. There are many qualified people for the vast majority \n     of government posts. But a tough ethics provision cannot be \n     so tough and rigid that it hurts the country unintentionally. \n     Kudos to President Obama for adding a waiver provision, to be \n     used sparingly\n\n[[Page S2106]]\n\n     for special cases in the national interest. This is all about \n     appropriate balance, and this new executive order strikes \n     just the right balance.''\n       Similarly, Thomas Mann, Senior Fellow of Governance Studies \n     and the Brookings Institution notes: ``The new Obama ethics \n     code is strict and should advance the objective of reducing \n     the purely financial incentives in public service. I applaud \n     another provision of the EO, namely the waiver provision that \n     allows the government to secure the essential services of \n     individuals who might formally be constrained from doing so \n     by the letter of the code. The safeguards built into the \n     waiver provision strike the right balance.''\n\n\n                    II. Responses to Your Questions\n\n       In considering the waiver for Mr. Lynn so that he might \n     serve as Deputy Secretary of Defense, we believe the right \n     balance has been struck by granting a waiver at the request \n     of the Secretary of Defense to a qualified candidate whose \n     service to the country is critical to our national security. \n     With that in mind, we want to address your specific \n     questions.\n       First, you asked what criteria were used in determining \n     that Mr. Lynn's waiver was necessary to further ``the public \n     interest.'' As noted above, the Order specifically states \n     that the public interest includes ``exigent circumstances \n     relating to national security.'' These circumstances include \n     the urgent need to have the best-qualified individuals \n     serving at the highest levels of the President's national \n     security team. As Secretary Gates stated with regard to \n     asking the President to nominate Mr. Lynn to be the Deputy \n     Secretary: ``I interviewed Bill Lynn; I was very impressed \n     with his credentials; he came with the highest \n     recommendations of a number of people that I respect a lot. \n     And I asked that an exception be made, because I felt that he \n     could play the role of the deputy in a better manner than \n     anybody else that I saw.''\n       Mr. Lynn's qualifications for the Deputy position are well \n     known. Mr. Lynn served as Under Secretary of Defense \n     (Comptroller) under President Clinton, before which he had \n     served as the Director for Program Analysis and Evaluation in \n     the office of the Secretary of Defense. Prior to that, he \n     served as an Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for \n     Budget. High-level experience in managing Pentagon budgetary, \n     finance and procurement functions is extremely rare, and \n     it was particularly important to Mr. Lynn's selection \n     here.\n       As you are aware, the Department of Defense faces enormous \n     management challenges. During Mr. Lynn's previous tenure at \n     DoD, there were significant efforts to improve financial \n     reporting, including two major initiatives. First, in 1998, \n     DoD adopted for the first time a Financial Management \n     Improvement Plan, which was a strategic framework for \n     improving critical financial systems and feeder systems in \n     the future. Second, the DoD Senior Financial Management \n     Council was reconstituted during 2000 and adopted a \n     comprehensive program management plan in January 2001.\n       Mr. Lynn was generally credited with putting appropriate \n     managerial emphasis on improving financial reporting. For \n     example, on February 17, 2000, the Deputy Inspector General \n     testified to Congress that ``the DoD has seldom, if ever, \n     been so committed to across the board management improvement \n     . . . . with continuous management emphasis, th[e] \n     initiatives should dramatically improve the efficiency of DoD \n     support operations over the next several years.'' DOD IG \n     Report No. D-2000-077 at 4.\n       Similarly, on May 9, 2000, Jeffrey Steinhoff from the \n     General Accounting Office (now the Government Accountability \n     Office) testified that ``DOD has made genuine progress in \n     many areas throughout the department. . . . We have seen a \n     strong commitment by the DOD Controller and his counterparts \n     in the military services to addressing long-standing, deeply \n     rooted problems.'' GAO/T-AIMD/NSIAD-00-163 at 2.\n       This progress could be seen in several areas. For example, \n     when Mr. Lynn took over as Comptroller, DoD could not even \n     generate a list of its finance and accounting systems. GAO/\n     AIMD-97-29 (Jan. 31, 1997). By the time he had left, DoD had \n     identified 167 critical systems, had achieved compliance with \n     federal financial management standards in 19 of those \n     systems, and had a plan to achieve compliance for the balance \n     of its systems by FY 2003. To take another example, under Mr. \n     Lynn's watch, DoD continued its progress in significantly \n     consolidating and streamlining its financial centers and \n     financial systems. Between 1991 and 2000, DoD consolidated \n     330 accounting and finance locations into 26, and reduced the \n     number of finance and accounting systems from 648 to 190. \n     Accomplishments like these led John Hamre, who was Mr. Lynn's \n     predecessor as Comptroller and who also served as Deputy \n     Secretary, to state that ``I don't know anybody who did the \n     job better than Bill Lynn.''\n       Mr. Lynn's experience is not limited to the Pentagon. From \n     1987 until 1993, Mr. Lynn served on the staff of Senator \n     Edward Kennedy as the legislative counsel for defense and \n     arms control matters and as the Senator's staff \n     representative on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Prior \n     to 1987, he was a senior fellow in the Strategic Concepts \n     Development Center at National Defense University, where he \n     specialized in strategic nuclear forces and arms control \n     issues. He was also on the professional staff of the \n     Institute of Defense Analyses. From 1982 to 1985, he served \n     as the executive director of the Defense Organization Project \n     at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n       In short, Mr. Lynn's executive branch experience, combined \n     with his legislative, think-tank and private sector \n     experience, gives him the precise set of skills that are not \n     only necessary to the job, but are rare in their breadth and \n     depth. That is why former Secretary of Defense William Cohen, \n     who served as Mr. Lynn's supervisor during the Clinton \n     Administration, commented that he has ``precisely the kinds \n     of skills required'' to serve as the Deputy Secretary. We \n     share both the current and former Secretaries' views that Mr. \n     Lynn's experience and skill set would make him an exceptional \n     Deputy Secretary of Defense.\n       Second, you asked about the potential for conflicts of \n     interest given Mr. Lynn's past position at Raytheon Company \n     (``Raytheon''). These issues were carefully reviewed as part \n     of the consideration of Mr. Lynn, and we believe that strong \n     safeguards have been erected that address these concerns and \n     allow Mr. Lynn to serve. We note that these arrangements were \n     structured in conformance with the Armed Services Committee's \n     longstanding requirements and practices. These arrangements \n     have also been approved by the Defense Department's ethics \n     official as eliminating potential conflicts and providing for \n     appropriate protective measures.\n       Specifically, Mr. Lynn will divest his Raytheon stock \n     within 90 days of his appointment, including his shares in \n     the Raytheon Savings and Investment Plan. He also will \n     forfeit all of his restricted stock units that he holds under \n     the 2007-2009 Raytheon Long-Term Performance Plan (LTPP) and \n     the 2008-2010 LTPP, and will divest those shares he holds \n     under the 2006-2008 LTPP within 90 days of their vesting in \n     February. To ensure there are no conflicts regarding the \n     stock, he will not participate personally and substantially \n     in any particular matter that has a direct and predictable \n     effect on the financial interests of Raytheon until he has \n     divested the stock, unless he first obtains a written waiver, \n     pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 208(b)(1), or qualifies for a \n     regulatory exemption, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 208(b)(2).\n       Further, for a period of one year after his resignation \n     from Raytheon, he will not participate personally and \n     substantially in any particular matter involving specific \n     parties in which Raytheon is a party, unless first authorized \n     to participate, pursuant to 5 C.F.R.  2635.502(d). \n     As an additional precaution, Mr. Lynn has promised not to \n     seek authorization to participate in decisions on any of the \n     six specific programs where he personally lobbied: the DDG-\n     1000 surface combatant, the AMRAAM air-to-air missile, the F-\n     15 airborne radar, the Patriot Pure Fleet program, the Future \n     Imagery Architecture, and the Multiple Kill Vehicle.\n       Finally, consistent with the customary practice for \n     departing executives of Raytheon, Mr. Lynn will continue to \n     participate in the Raytheon Defined Benefit Plan, which would \n     pay him about $4,300 monthly beginning on January 1, 2019. In \n     accord with the letter signed by the Chairman and Ranking \n     Member of the Senate Committee on Armed Services dated \n     September 23, 2005, Mr. Lynn has agreed that prior to acting \n     in any particular matter that is likely to have a direct, \n     predictable, and substantial effect on the financial interest \n     of Raytheon, he will consult with his Designated Agency \n     Ethics Official, and will not act in the matter unless that \n     official determines that the interest of the Government in \n     his participation outweighs any appearance of impropriety, \n     and issues a written determination authorizing his \n     participation. Mr. Lynn understands that such an \n     authorization does not constitute a waiver of 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 208 and does not affect the applicability of that \n     section.\n       Under the circumstances, we believe this arrangement \n     accomplishes the twin goals of enforcing tough ethical \n     standards that protect the public interest, while also \n     assuring that the nation is not deprived of a talented and \n     badly-needed public servant to assist with the defense of our \n     nation.\n       Third, you ask about the process for selecting Mr. Lynn. We \n     can assure you that the selection of Mr. Lynn came at the end \n     of an extensive process that resulted in a consensus opinion \n     that Mr. Lynn was the best-qualified candidate for this job. \n     Multiple candidates were considered and interviewed over the \n     course of what was a long and rigorous review. Ultimately, \n     though, this is a position for which there is a short list of \n     truly qualified applicants who have the kind of experience we \n     detailed earlier in response to your first question. Taking \n     into account all of the factors, including the concerns \n     raised in your letter, the President and Secretary Gates felt \n     that Mr. Lynn was the best person for the job.\n       Fourth and finally, you have asked whether Mr. Lynn's \n     ability to perform his job will be impaired by any necessary \n     recusals. We do not believe the ethics compliance process \n     described above will hinder Mr. Lynn from doing his job. The \n     process strikes a reasonable balance under the circumstances. \n     It waives the need for Mr. Lynn to recuse himself from issues \n     that would otherwise be implicated by paragraphs 2 and 3 of \n     the ethics pledge, but still requires him to follow the \n     remainder of the Order, including the revolving door exit \n     provisions and the gift ban, as well as the other \n     restrictions detailed in this letter.\n       Again, thank you for this opportunity to address these \n     issues. As the Ethics Executive\n\n[[Page S2107]]\n\n     Order and the other Orders and Presidential Memoranda signed \n     on the same day reflect, President Obama and all of us in the \n     Executive Office of the President are committed to running a \n     highly transparent and accountable administration. We look \n     forward to working with you on these issues and on government \n     reform issues more broadly.\n           Sincerely,\n     Peter R. Orszag,\n       Director, Office of Management and Budget.\n     Gregory B. Craig,\n       Counsel to the President.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. With respect to the waiver, Mr. Orszag stated:\n\n       The selection of Mr. Lynn came at the end of an extensive \n     process that resulted in a consensus opinion that Mr. Lynn \n     was the best qualified candidate for the job.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Mr. Lynn's executive branch experience, combined with his \n     legislative, think tank and private sector experience--\n\n  As you note, he did not mention a managerial role that he might have \nhad in his career--\n\n     gives him the precise set of skills that are not only \n     necessary to do the job, but are rare in their breadth and \n     depth.\n\n  I hope Mr. Lynn will be a rare exception to the new rule--you know, \none of the things I had hoped would happen because of the deep \ndisapproval the American people have in the way we do business is this \nkind of cycle of lobbyists to executive branch, to legislative branch, \nto lobbyists. It goes on in this town with enormous frequency and has \nled to scandals, indictments, and convictions of former staff members, \nformer Members of Congress, and former members of the executive branch. \nI had hoped that somewhere in America there would be someone who had \nthe experience and knowledge and background in running what probably, I \nbelieve, is the largest organization in the world, the Department of \nDefense, rather than again having to go inside the beltway.\n  But as I mentioned, elections have consequences. The President has \ndesignated Mr. Lynn and others to positions which are in violation of \nthe much heralded Executive order he made concerning not having \nlobbyists serve in Government.\n  So I will give him at least, in my opinion, my vote, the benefit of \nthe doubt, and will vote in favor of Mr. Lynn's nomination.\n  He responded to, albeit belatedly, the questions I submitted to him. \nI wish him well. We face enormous challenges both in the way the \nDepartment of Defense operates, the acquisition programs--and many of \nthem are completely out of control, with cost overruns that are \nstaggering--to a lack of efficiency in a number of areas.\n  I not only wish Mr. Lynn well, but I look forward to working with him \nas we do whatever we can to defend this Nation's vital national \nsecurity interests as well as manage the functions of a bureaucracy \nwhich, in all candor, has defied sound management under both Republican \nand Democratic administrations.\n  I know Senator Coburn and Senator Grassley will be over later on. I \nam confident that Mr. Lynn's nomination will be voted out \noverwhelmingly by the Senate. I hope Mr. Lynn will do well in his new \nposition of responsibility. I pledge to work with him as much as \npossible, as I have done with Secretaries of Defense and Deputy \nSecretaries of Defense in Republican and Democratic administrations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wanted to thank Senator McCain for his support. It is \nexceedingly important, and his very thoughtful statement makes a real \ncontribution to the debate.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to raise questions \nabout whether Mr. Lynn ought to be Deputy Secretary of Defense. I do it \nwith the normal courtesy, that a President ought to be able to name \npeople to his team, and I do it based upon two questions: One, the use \nof the waiver for him to be in this position contrary to the Executive \norder of President Obama; and, secondly, to raise questions about his \nactivity as chief financial officer in the second Clinton \nadministration, and now coming to be Deputy Secretary of Defense. I \nwill try to lay this out as best I can with documentation.\n  I will not be able nor do I need to document the first consideration \non the waiver. I wanted to express views on it.\n  I thought I had seen the last of Mr. Lynn when President George W. \nBush first took office. I was dead wrong. So I had to send my staff out \nto where the Senate buries old skeletons. It is the Records Center out \nin Maryland, the scenic countryside about 20 miles from the Capitol. \nThere I had my staff dig up the remains of what came to be known, and \nwhat I came to know about Mr. Lynn's activities as chief financial \nofficer about 10 years ago.\n  I would give a little bit of word of advice to my colleagues, \narchival of your materials. I found that political nominees, good and \nbad, come back like Australian boomerangs. Some take longer than others \nto return, but eventually you will see them again.\n  Mr. Lynn is currently employed as senior vice president, government \noperations, of a major defense contractor, Raytheon. Until June 2008, \nMr. Lynn was registered as Raytheon's principal lobbyist to the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  I have serious questions about the nomination. My first area of \nconcern is that Mr. Lynn does not appear to meet President Obama's \nstrict new ethical standards for executive branch appointees. Those \nstandards were laid down in an Executive order of January 21, 2009.\n  It is important for me to say what ethics means to me. Everyone has a \ndifferent idea as to what ethics represents. This is a complicated \nissue, and I don't want there to be any confusion about this word or \nprinciple. The Merriam Webster dictionary defines the word ``ethics,'' \none, as the discipline dealing with what is good and bad, with moral \nduty and obligation. This definition is very clear, but I want to go a \nstep further to say that, to me, ethics are very uncomplicated \nprinciples of life. Simply put, when faced with tough choices or \ndecisions, we must always do what is true and correct.\n  Throughout the Presidential campaign, candidate Barack Obama \nrepeatedly promised to close the revolving door and change the \npolitical culture in Washington. This was one of his top priorities. \nConsistent with those promises, within 24 hours of being sworn in, he \nsigned the Executive order that set new ethical standards in stone. \nUnder the ``revolving door ban'' section of those rules, Mr. Lynn \nshould have been barred from serving as Deputy Secretary of Defense \nuntil July 2011. I understand Mr. Lynn has been given a special order \nby the administration to further the public interest.\n  According to a letter I have received from OMB Director Peter Orszag \nof February 3, 2009--and I have it here if anybody is interested in \nreading it. Senator Levin has already had this letter printed in the \nRecord.\n  According to this letter from OMB Director Peter Orszag of February \n3, 2009, Mr. Lynn's waiver was based on ``exigent circumstances \nrelating to national security.''\n  Director Orszag stated:\n\n       Mr. Lynn is uniquely qualified for this position and is \n     urgently needed to serve on the President's national security \n     team.\n\n  Mr. Orszag was responding to my letter of January 29, 2009, asking \nfor the justification of the waiver.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 29, 2009.\n     Hon. Peter Orszag,\n     Director, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Director Orszag: I write today to express my concerns \n     with the recent decision to grant a waiver for Mr. William J. \n     Lynn, exempting him from the strict new ethics rules outlined \n     in President Obama's Executive Order titled ``Ethics \n     Commitments by Executive Branch Personnel,'' signed on \n     January 21, 2009.\n\n[[Page S2108]]\n\n       Mr. Lynn has been nominated by the President to serve as \n     the Deputy Secretary of Defense. He is currently employed as \n     a senior vice president at a major Department of Defense \n     (DOD) contractor--Raytheon Company. Until very recently, he \n     was also registered as Raytheon's principal lobbyist to the \n     DOD.\n       Throughout the presidential campaign, President Obama \n     repeatedly promised the American voters that he would ``close \n     the revolving door'' in order to greatly limit the role of \n     lobbyists in his administration. He warned lobbyists, they \n     ``won't find a job in my White House'' and [lobbyists] ``will \n     not run my White House, and they will not drown out the \n     voices of the American people.'' He also stated: ``If you are \n     a lobbyist entering my administration, you will not be able \n     to work on matters you lobbied on or in the agencies you \n     lobbied during the previous two years [emphasis added].'' \n     Further, President Obama explained why it was important to \n     close the revolving door: ``Lobbyists spend millions of \n     dollars to get their way. The status quo sets in. . . . They \n     use their money and influence to stop us from reforming \n     [government policies]''. He added, ``. . . together, we will \n     tell the Washington lobbyists that their days of setting the \n     agenda are over.''\n       President Obama's message was crystal clear: allowing \n     lobbyists to pass freely through the revolving door was \n     simply not in the public interest. He espoused that lobbyists \n     in government ``are a problem'' because they block needed \n     reforms--reforms that Mr. Obama promised to the American \n     people.\n       President Obama's promises to ``close the revolving door'' \n     seemed to be a top priority. He meant what he said. He kept \n     his promise. In fact, within 24 hours of being sworn in, \n     President Obama signed a new Executive Order titled, ``Ethics \n     Commitments by Executive Branch Personnel'' to cement his \n     campaign pledge into an official order. Paragraphs two and \n     three of Section One--entitled ``Revolving Door Ban''--\n     appeared to solidify President Obama's pledge to ``close the \n     revolving door.''\n       However, exactly two days after signing the Executive \n     Order, you exercised authority delegated to you under Section \n     3 of the Executive Order and issued a waiver to Mr. Lynn, \n     which effectively gutted the ethical heart of the President's \n     ``Revolving Door Ban.'' I find it difficult to reconcile Mr. \n     Lynn's nomination to be the Deputy Secretary of Defense with \n     the purpose and intent of the Executive Order.\n       Mr. Lynn was a registered Raytheon lobbyist for six years. \n     His lobbying reports clearly indicate that he lobbied \n     extensively on a very broad range of DOD programs and issues \n     in both the House and Senate and at the Department of \n     Defense. If confirmed, Mr. Lynn would become the top \n     operations manager in the Pentagon. He would be the final \n     approval authority on most--if not all--contract, program and \n     budget decisions. Surely, a number of Raytheon issues would \n     come across his desk. Mr. Lynn's conflict of interest has \n     been characterized by some as an ``impossible conflict.'' The \n     Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin, has \n     stated that Mr. Lynn will have to recuse himself from those \n     decisions for one year. Since Raytheon is a big defense \n     contractor, those recusal requirements could limit Mr. Lynn's \n     effectiveness as Deputy Secretary of Defense.\n       Based upon President Obama's statements made during the \n     presidential campaign and leading up to and following the \n     signing of the Executive Order, I simply cannot comprehend \n     how this particular lobbyist could be nominated to fill such \n     a key position at DOD overseeing procurement matters, much \n     less be granted a waiver from the ethical limitations listed \n     in the Executive Order.\n       Additionally, I have serious questions about the message \n     that this waiver sends to other lobbyists seeking employment \n     in President Obama's administration. Despite strong language \n     limiting the role of lobbyists in the Executive Order, it \n     appears to me that Mr. Lynn's nomination and the waiver \n     granted to him leaves ``the barn door wide open'' for other \n     potential nominees with lobbying backgrounds to circumvent \n     the Executive Order. This is a giant loophole that places the \n     burden of granting waivers strictly with the Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget (OMB). As such, I believe a \n     detailed explanation of the reason for granting the waiver is \n     warranted in order to ensure that the granting of future \n     waivers is done in a fully transparent manner and given the \n     sunshine such an important decision deserves.\n       The waiver provision in the Executive Order provides that \n     the OMB Director may grant a waiver for two reasons, (1) \n     ``that the literal application of the restriction is \n     inconsistent with the purposes of the restriction'' or (2) \n     ``that it is in the public interest to grant the waiver''. \n     These provisions are general and provide wide latitude in \n     determining when a waiver is applicable. For instance, in Mr. \n     Lynn's case, the waiver simply states: ``After consultation \n     with Counsel to the President, I hereby waive the \n     requirements of Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Ethics Pledge of \n     Mr. William Lynn. I have determined that it is in the \n     public interest [emphasis added] to grant the waiver given \n     Mr. Lynn's qualifications for his position and the current \n     national security situation. I understand that Mr. Lynn \n     will otherwise comply with the remainder of the pledge and \n     with all preexisting government ethics rules.''\n       While I am glad to see that the waiver does not appear to \n     fully circumvent the Executive Order or other existing \n     government ethics rules, the broad language used in \n     determining that the waiver is in the ``public interest'' is \n     a concern. Little detail is provided as to why the waiver is \n     necessary. Only general criteria used in the analysis and \n     justification for the waiver are given. Accordingly, I \n     strongly urge OMB to publicly set forth a list of criteria \n     utilized to examine whether a waiver would be in ``the public \n     interest.'' Further, OMB should also publicly set forth \n     criteria examined to determine when ``literal application of \n     the restriction is inconsistent with the purposes of the \n     restriction.'' By making these criteria public, it will go a \n     long way toward making OMB decisions transparent and \n     providing the American people with a full accounting of why \n     waivers to the Executive Order are necessary. I strongly \n     encourage OMB to do this as soon as possible to ensure those \n     decisions do not merely become an arbitrary basis to \n     circumvent the Executive Order.\n       Additionally, I respectfully request that OMB provide \n     responses to the following questions:\n       (1) What criteria did OMB use to determine that Mr. Lynn's \n     waiver was necessary to further ``the public interest''?\n       (2) Does OMB believe there are no inherent conflicts of \n     interest to have Mr. Lynn serve as the Deputy Secretary of \n     Defense overseeing procurement from a company he formerly \n     lobbied for? If not, why not?\n       (3) Given President Obama's position on lobbyists serving \n     in government positions, did anyone in OMB ask the President \n     or his Counsel to consider whether other candidates for the \n     position would be better qualified before granting the Lynn \n     waiver?\n       (4) Does OMB believe Mr. Lynn's requirement that he recuse \n     himself in certain instances under provisions of the \n     Executive Order not impacted by the waiver will hinder him \n     from doing the job? Why or why not?\n       The idea behind President Obama's promise to close the \n     revolving door and ban lobbyists from his administration had \n     one purpose: to protect the public interest. The new rules \n     are designed to protect the taxpayers against wasteful and \n     unnecessary expenditures and policies that might be advocated \n     by ``special interests'' inside the government. By granting \n     Mr. Lynn's waiver, it appears that OMB has undermined the \n     principal purpose of the new ethics rules--to protect the \n     public interest. It seems like the OMB waiver embraces the \n     lobbyist culture that President Obama promised to change. As \n     Director of OMB, your decisions set the tone for the entire \n     federal bureaucracy. By making the waiver process more \n     public, OMB would send a clear and unambiguous message: \n     transparency is first and foremost when it comes to dealing \n     with ethics rules.\n       Please bring transparency and accountability to Mr. Lynn's \n     waiver and all future waivers of the Executive Order by \n     providing details about why waivers have been granted and the \n     criteria used to determine them.\n       I would very much appreciate a prompt answer to my \n     questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Charles Grassley,\n                                                   Ranking Member.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I also understand that President Obama's picks for \nthese key positions should be respected. I said that about President \nBush. I have to say it about President Obama. They were elected. They \nhave a certain respect of the people, and that respect should not be \nquestioned by the Senate except under extraordinary circumstances. I \nthink these are extraordinary circumstances, and I am bringing it up.\n  Mr. Lynn has informed me that he would be divesting his financial \nstakes in Raytheon in the next 90 days. He also said he would not \nengage in any Raytheon-related decisions for 1 year at DOD unless he \nreceives a special waiver.\n  Regrettably, for Mr. Lynn and for American taxpayers, getting rid of \nconflicts of interest is not as easy as it might sound. The Raytheon \nCorporation has hundreds of potential contracts and programs with the \nDepartment of Defense. As such, the Office of Government Ethics will \nhave to set up a full-time department just to handle Mr. Lynn's \nconflict-of-interest Raytheon waivers.\n  On the one hand, I believe the best leaders lead by example. So mean \nwhat you say. For that reason, I challenge Mr. Lynn to take control of \nthis ethical debate and demonstrate true leadership on this issue by \nsticking to the principles set forth by President Obama's Executive \norder on ethics commitments by executive branch personnel. Special \nwaivers and exemptions undermine the basic principle of good \ngovernment.\n  Changing the rules as you go along tends to foster a basic sense of \ndistrust of the Government of all Americans. We all know that is a \nproblem. We have to be cautious to make sure we don't make the \nsituation worse. Why make rules if you know you are going to break \nthem? How can gutting the ethical heart of the new ethics rule be in\n\n[[Page S2109]]\n\nthe public interest when those very same rules were created in the \nfirst place in the public interest?\n  Even the best qualified nominees with the highest recommendation \nshould recognize when serving in his or her post would not be in the \npublic interest. I believe the American people expect nominees to be \ntrue and honest. Given his chosen career path, Mr. Lynn should know he \ndoes not comply with the spirit or intent of the Executive order on \nethics.\n  If he is seriously devoted to serving his country and this President, \nMr. Lynn should consider withdrawing his nomination and ask to be \nreconsidered when he is within the ethics ``revolving door'' principles \nlaid down by my President, Mr. Obama. Then he would come back in 2 \nyears to seek such appointment. This country will always need good \nleaders who lead by example. By doing this, he would set the standard \nof excellence for all other nominees to follow. It would restore \nintegrity and credibility to President Obama's new ethics rules. As it \nstands now, unfortunately, the Lynn nomination is rolling down a very \nlow road at high speed. By setting the new rules aside for the first \ntop-level appointee to come down the pike, President Obama and his \nadministration appear to embrace the very same culture President Obama \npromised to change.\n  None of us knows for sure whether Mr. Lynn's nomination is truly in \nthe public interest. We can only hope it is. In time, we will find out.\n  What is going to take me longest to explain is documentation of some \nactivity of Mr. Lynn when he was Chief Financial Officer and how that \nfits into some questions I have about the position to which he was \nnominated.\n  My second area of concern pertains to Mr. Lynn's financial management \nrecord at the Pentagon. Mr. Lynn served as Chief Financial Officer at \nthe Department of Defense from November 1997 through 2000. I first came \nto know Mr. Lynn in 1998, after he was appointed to the position. \nBetween June 1997 and July 1998--1 month, approximately--I conducted an \nin-depth investigation of internal financial controls at the Department \nof Defense. I was testing basically internal controls within the \nDepartment. I reviewed about 200 financial transactions from Pentagon \noffices where the fraud had occurred. We examined purchase orders, \ncontracts, invoices, delivery verifications or receipts, and, finally, \nwe examined final payments. We even checked to see if remit addresses \nwere correct. In short, we looked at the whole ball of wax.\n  The results of this investigation were presented in a report in \nSeptember 1998. This is a report my staff and other people put \ntogether. The report concluded, in September 1998, involving the Chief \nFinancial Officer and/or things under his command or jurisdiction:\n\n       Internal controls at the Department of Defense were weak or \n     nonexistent.\n\n  The Government Accountability Office, then called the General \nAccounting Office, concurred with my assessment.\n  Our investigations found that not one of the accounts payable files \nexamined was 100 percent up to snuff. I was alarmed to find they all \nhad either minor or major accounting deficiencies. If the Department of \nDefense had followed standard accounting practices, none of the bills \nshould have been paid. Unfortunately, all went out the payment door.\n  The most glaring and persistent shortcoming observed was the near \ntotal absence of valid receiving reports in the accounts examined at \nthe Defense Finance and Accounting Service Center in Denver, CO. A \nreceiving report is one of the most important internal control devices. \nThey provide written verification that the goods and services billed on \nan invoice were received and matched with what was ordered. In all the \nfiles examined, we found only 6 out of 200 genuine receiving reports, \nor what they call DD-250 forms. The rest of the files contained none. \nOf the six receiving reports found, all were either invalid or \nincorrect.\n  We also noticed gaping holes in another key control mechanism, remit \naddresses. A remit address is important because it is at the end of the \nmoney trail, where the money goes. The review found zero control over \nremit addresses. A total of 286 technicians in the Dallas center had \nauthority to alter remit addresses. This was a violation of another \nbasic internal control principle--separation of duties. A person \nresponsible for paying bills should never be allowed to change a remit \naddress.\n  On September 23, 1998, I met with Mr. Lynn to discuss the findings of \nmy investigation. I provided him with a draft of the report. I asked \nhim to review it and provide comment. In his response, dated 5 days \nlater, September 28, 1998, Mr. Lynn did not challenge the findings in \nthis report. So we have this report I have been referring to, and I \nasked Mr. Lynn for comment on that report. I have his letter here not \nchallenging the findings.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Under Secretary of Defense,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 28, 1998.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: At our meeting of September 23, \n     1998, you requested that I review and comment on the ``Joint \n     Review of Internal Controls at Department of Defense'' draft \n     report dated September 21, 1998.\n       I am very troubled by the problems cited in this report, as \n     well as the related General Accounting Office (GAO) report. \n     Effective internal controls are essential to the detection \n     and prevention of fraudulent activity in our vendor payment \n     operations. Without question, the Krenick and Miller fraud \n     cases, which are at the core of both reports, indicate that \n     there are unacceptable weaknesses in our internal control \n     programs. Although both individuals were caught and \n     convicted, and funds were recovered, we must ensure that the \n     appropriate actions are taken to prevent further abuses. Let \n     me briefly describe for you the measures that the Defense \n     Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) is taking to improve \n     internal management controls.\n       First, we are taking steps to ensure that the vendor pay \n     process establishes positive control over payment-related \n     information. An important step in this regard is to tighten \n     controls over remittance addresses through use of a Central \n     Contractor Registration database maintained by the \n     acquisition community. Eliminating the ability of personnel \n     in the paying offices to change the addresses to which \n     payments are sent will correct a critical weakness that was \n     exploited in the fraud cases cited.\n       Second, to reinforce the principle that there must be a \n     strong separation of responsibilities for providing and \n     verifying payment information, we are strengthening the \n     processes that preclude a single individual from controlling \n     multiple critical portions of the payment process. In \n     particular, pursuant to a GAO recommendation, DFAS is \n     reducing by at least half the number of employees who have \n     the highest level of access to the Integrated Accounts \n     Payment System.\n       Third, a critical internal control is the positive check of \n     payment information with accounting data prior to \n     disbursement. To ensure the effectiveness of this control, we \n     will make systems changes to eliminate the ability of a \n     single individual to have concurrent access to both the \n     vendor payment system and the accounting system.\n       No internal control system will work if it is not \n     rigorously adhered to throughout the organization. During \n     August of this year, a top to bottom review of the various \n     vendor pay operations was accomplished at each DFAS center \n     and operating location. This review concentrated on \n     identifying weaknesses in the application of these controls \n     and business practices. At the same time, DFAS has conducted \n     a stand down of all vendor pay operations to provide formal \n     training in internal controls and fraud awareness. Finally, \n     earlier this month, I met personally with all of the \n     directors of the DFAS centers and operating locations to \n     stress the need to strengthen our management controls.\n       To ensure a more permanent senior level oversight of \n     internal controls, DFAS has established a separate \n     organization which reports directly to the Director's office. \n     The mission of this organization will be internal review, \n     fraud prevention, fraud detection, and audit follow-up. One \n     of the primary functions of this office is to track and \n     ensure that accepted recommendations from existing fraud \n     oases, GAO audits, along with other internal and external \n     reviews and reports are implemented. This unit will be \n     operational within the next 30 days.\n       In closing, Senator, I want you to know that I place the \n     highest priority on ensuring that we have the best possible \n     protections against fraud and wrongful payments. We have more \n     to do, but I believe that we have made a strong start in \n     responding to the lessons of the Miller and Krenick cases. I \n     have conveyed these thoughts to Senator Durbin as well.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  William J. Lynn.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. In this letter, Mr. Lynn appeared to agree with all of \nmy findings and recommendations 100 percent. That is a conclusion I \nmake. The letter will be in the Record, so Members can read it for \nthemselves. He said\n\n[[Page S2110]]\n\nthat he was ``very troubled'' by every one of the control weaknesses \ncited in the report.\n  Mr. Lynn further stated:\n\n       There are unacceptable weaknesses in our internal control \n     programs.\n\n  He promised me he would be taking aggressive corrective action to \nimprove and tighten controls. He concluded by saying:\n\n       I want you to know that I place the highest priority on \n     ensuring that we have the best possible protections against \n     fraud and wrongful payments.\n\n  I also shared my concerns with Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen in a \nletter dated October 5, 1998. In his response on November 16, 1998--and \nI have that response from Secretary Cohen here--he offered identical \nassurances.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 5, 1998.\n     Hon. William S. Cohen,\n     Secretary of Defense, Pentagon,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bill, I am writing to follow up on my recent \n     Subcommittee hearing that examined the results of the Joint \n     Review of Internal controls at the Department of Defense.\n       First, I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to \n     the Department of Defense (DOD) for excellent cooperation and \n     support throughout the Joint Review of Internal Controls. The \n     person who is most responsible for energizing this project is \n     Mr. Bob Hale, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for \n     Financial Management and Comptroller. We first met on June \n     27, 1997 to lay the ground work for the project. At that \n     meeting, Mr. Hale agreed--with the full backing of the \n     Secretary of the Air Force--that this would be a joint review \n     between his office and my Subcommittee on Administrative \n     Oversight and the Courts. As part of this arrangement, Mr. A. \n     Ernest Fitzgerald, Management Systems Deputy of the Air \n     Force, was authorized to participate. Mr. Fitzgerald was a \n     key asset, since internal controls are one of his primary \n     areas of responsibility. The ``jointness'' of this project \n     contributed greatly to its success. Despite some rough spots, \n     this approach could serve as a model for future cooperative \n     efforts. Due largely to Mr. Fitzgerald's active \n     participation, the department directed some corrective action \n     as problems were being discovered and documented.\n       Second, I have the distinct impression that no one in the \n     department takes much exception to the findings and \n     recommendations contained in either the Joint Staff Report or \n     the accompanying reports issued by the General Accounting \n     Office. The attached letter from the Under Secretary of \n     Defense, Mr. Bill Lynn, is testimony to that fact. He admits \n     that he is ``very troubled'' by the control weaknesses that \n     were uncovered by the Joint Review and is taking aggressive \n     corrective action. Those efforts appear to be focused in one \n     critical area--tightening controls over the process for \n     placing ``remittance addresses'' on checks and electronic \n     fund transfers. I am encouraged by Mr. Lynn's positive \n     attitude and his determination to address these problems in \n     meaningful ways. However, my long experience with the \n     department causes me to feel some skepticism. In the past, I \n     have found wide disconnects between what is promised by \n     senior DOD officials and what is really done. I hope you will \n     personally make sure that Mr. Lynn and other responsible \n     officials fix this terrible problem.\n       I intend to follow up until I feel that the taxpayers' \n     money is adequately protected.\n       Third, as Mr. Lynn said, he was ``very troubled'' by the \n     problems cited in the reports. The Joint Staff Report, for \n     example, states that the control environment within the \n     Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) is \n     characterized by ``fraud and deceit''--to use the exact words \n     of a senior DFAS official. Between late 1995 and early 1997, \n     there were repeated reports and allegations of fraudulent \n     activity in DFAS--particularly at the OPLOC at Dayton, Ohio. \n     In at least three instances, the Director of the Denver \n     center, Mr. John Nabil, ordered the Director of Internal \n     Review, LTC Boyle, to investigate. In each case, LTC Boyle \n     confirmed the existence of fraudulent activity within DFAS. \n     Mr. Nabil even signed a memorandum (attached) on September \n     30, 1996 that substantiates the existence of criminal \n     activity within his organization. Yet every one of these \n     ``red warning flags'' was ignored, and DFAS management failed \n     to report suspected violations of 18 U.S.C. 1001 and other \n     laws to the proper authorities--as required by law. The end \n     result of this mismanagement was costly to the taxpayers. \n     Embezzlers like SSGT Miller--and certainly others--were \n     allowed to tap into the DOD money pipe--unrestricted--and \n     steal huge sums of money--undetected. Eventually, an employee \n     at Dayton blew the whistle and called the law directly. Maybe \n     those persons who raised red flags at Dayton deserve awards?\n       In conclusion, I don't believe that the problems at the \n     Dayton OPLOC are an isolated case. I think they are part of a \n     general pattern of fraud and abuse within DFAS. The Joint \n     Staff Report uncovered evidence of similar kinds of \n     fraudulent activities at the Denver center in 1997 and 1998. \n     I intend to refer this matter and other related matters to \n     investigative and audit agencies for further investigation.\n       Bill, someone needs to be held accountable for what \n     happened at the Dayton OPLOC and for what appears to be \n     happening at the Denver center today. Who is responsible? \n     Without some accountability, Mr. Lynn's promises will, in \n     fact, come to nothing. Please let me know what you decide to \n     do.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                Charles E. Grassley, Chairman,\n\n          Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts.\n       Attachment.\n\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 16, 1998.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the \n         Courts, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chuck: This is in response to your recent letter \n     following your Subcommittee hearing regarding internal \n     controls at the Department of Defense (DoD). Be assured we \n     take this matter very seriously. I know my Comptroller, Mr. \n     Bill Lynn, has discussed with you measures the Defense \n     Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) is taking to improve \n     internal management controls.\n       Your letter made specific mention of the DFAS Denver Center \n     in Colorado, and the fraud case at its subsidiary office in \n     Dayton, Ohio. Even though the perpetrator at Dayton was \n     caught and convicted, the case indicates weaknesses in \n     internal management controls that must be remedied. Toward \n     that end, DFAS has implemented a number of very specific, \n     system-oriented improvements to strengthen existing controls, \n     establish new controls, and ensure that published procedures \n     are followed. In addition, we have instituted an extensive, \n     in-depth internal review of the entire Denver Center network. \n     DFAS also established a separate office to strengthen \n     internal controls and ensure compliance at all levels.\n       DFAS, as an organization, is 7 years old and is composed of \n     approximately 20,000 personnel located in 17 states. We \n     should acknowledge the dedicated public servants who go out \n     of their way every day to ensure that the taxpayers' money is \n     protected. Bill Lynn and I will help them in every way we can \n     to make sure that the suggestions for improvement, which have \n     been presented in the various reports, hearings, and \n     meetings, are evaluated and implemented where necessary.\n       Chuck, you and I share a common interest in protecting \n     scarce financial resources, while supporting the great men \n     and women of our armed forces. The hard work by you and your \n     staff has assisted significantly in the progress we have \n     made. We will continue to work to improve our financial \n     management.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                             Bill.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. While Secretary Cohen and Chief Financial Officer Lynn, \nthe nominee now under consideration, both assured me over and over that \nthey were taking steps to tighten internal controls--I am shocked to \nsay this--they were already quietly moving in the opposite direction. \nThey were busy pushing other policies to weaken and undermine internal \nfinancial controls.\n  So I want to get into that. In 1998, when Mr. Lynn was chief \nfinancial officer, something we call pay-and-chase was the Pentagon \nlingo used to describe the Department of Defense vendor paying process. \nWith pay-and-chase, the Pentagon paid bills under $2,500 first, and \nthen worried about chasing down receipts later. You get it--pay-and-\nchase: pay without worrying about what you are buying or the invoice \nand then, after you pay, go out and find some justification for the \npayment.\n  Ever wonder why there is waste in the Defense Department? Sometimes \nreceipts were found under pay-and-chase, sometimes not. Nobody seems to \ncare either way. This is how the Department of Defense ended up with \nnot $2,500 here and there but with billions of dollars in what they \nrefer to as unmatched disbursements--another big control problem with \nwhich chief financial officer Bill Lynn was thoroughly familiar.\n  Pay-and-chase accurately characterized the core DFAS problem I \nwitnessed during my review of internal controls from 1997 through 1998. \nI saw pay-and-chase up close and personal. Pay-and-chase was not an \nofficial policy; it was an unofficial policy. It was actively practiced \nbut not authorized by any Government regulation or laws.\n  As I understand it, pay-and-chase was supposed to end in October 1997\n\n[[Page S2111]]\n\nwhen the Department of Defense general counsel determined it was \nillegal. But it did not stop. Secretary Cohen wanted to, instead, \nlegalize pay-and-chase and make it the law of the land.\n  On February 2, 1998, when Mr. Lynn was chief financial officer, \nSecretary Cohen asked the Senate for legal authority to pay bills \nwithout receipt with no dollar limit. Now, that is pretty high up in \nthe Department that you are deciding that we ought to have a policy to \npay bills without receipts, and to do it not with a $2,500 limit but \nwith no dollar limit. This proposal was embodied in section 401 of the \nDefense Reform Initiative. It was touted--can you believe it--as a \nmeasure to ``streamline'' the DOD payment process.\n  Fortunately, the Congress rejected this absurd and misguided \nlegislative proposal. But you know what the thinking was at the highest \nlevels of the Defense Department. So I discussed Secretary Cohen's pay-\nand-chase proposal in great detail in a speech on the floor of this \nbody on May 5, 1998. You will find that on pages S4247 through S4250. I \nplaced, at that time, Secretary Cohen's request in the Record.\n  So what was Mr. Lynn's position on section 401 of Secretary Cohen's \nDefense Reform Initiative? I asked him this question on February 5, \n2009. This is what he said: He could not ``recall'' taking a position \non it but agreed it was wrong ``to pay bills without a receipt.''\n  This seems like a real cop-out. I responded this way:\n\n       In February 1998, you had been [chief financial officer] \n     for several months. This issue fell directly under your \n     purview. How could you possibly avoid taking a position on an \n     issue the Secretary of Defense was urging the Senate to \n     adopt? As the Chief DOD Lobbyist for Raytheon, you say it was \n     wrong. As the DOD [chief financial officer] back in 1998, why \n     didn't you know it was wrong and speak up about it [at that \n     time]?\n\n  My records appear to indicate that pay-and-chase continued as the \nunofficial policy through 1998 and eventually evolved into another more \ntroublesome policy known as ``straight pay.'' This policy was even more \ndangerous for the taxpayers. The straight pay policy had much higher \ndollar thresholds than the old pay-and-chase plan. Believe it or not, \nit was a whopping half million dollars.\n  Straight pay was Mr. Bill Lynn's baby. This policy was personally \napproved by Mr. Lynn in a memorandum on December 17, 1998, and \nreauthorized in another memo on March 9, 1999, and possibly again \nlater. This is that document:\n\n     Memorandum for Director, Defense Finance and Accounting \n         Service\n     Subject: Prevalidation Threshold\n\n       In a memorandum dated December 17, 1998, I authorized a \n     temporary $500,000 threshold on new contracts paid by the \n     Mechanization of Contract Administration Services (MOCAS) \n     system. This temporary authorization is scheduled to expire \n     on March 22, 1999. However, while the Defense Finance and \n     Accounting Service Columbus Center has made significant \n     improvements in the backlog of payments, we are not at the \n     point where we can lower the threshold to $2,500. Therefore, \n     the temporary threshold of $500,000 is extended for another \n     90 days for Columbus MOCAS payments only.\n       I request you continue to provide me with a monthly report \n     showing progress in resolving the current prevalidation \n     process delays. The monthly report should include your plan \n     to lower the threshold at the appropriate pace to reach the \n     goal of total prevalidation by July 2000. As we improve our \n     systems capabilities, we will continue to aggressively reduce \n     the threshold until all payments are prevalidated.\n                                                  William J. Lynn.\n\n  On January 19, 1999, I addressed a letter to Mr. Lynn expressing \ngrave concern about straight pay and requesting verification of certain \nfacts surrounding this policy. The facts in question were provided to \nme anonymously by a DFAS employee. I wanted Mr. Lynn to check out all \nof this for me.\n  Prior to the implementation of straight pay, the DFAS center in \nColombia, OH, had a prevalidation policy that required that all \ndisbursements over $2,500 be matched with obligations or contracts \nprior to payment, which is the way it ought to be--well, no; it ought \nto be for every dollar, but at least over $2,500 it had to be matched. \nWhen an invoice was submitted to the center for payment, a DFAS \ntechnician searched the database for supporting obligations and \nreceipts.\n  If supporting documentation could not be found, a red warning flag \nwas supposedly run up the pole. Accounting due diligence was needed to \nconfirm if this particular invoice was valid, a duplicate, or \nfraudulent payment. In theory, these red flags had to be resolved. As \nyou would expect, in practice, that did not always happen.\n  Mr. Lynn's straight pay policy raised the prevalidation threshold by \n$497,500, up to finally a half million dollars. This allowed the DFAS \ntechnicians to make payments up to a half million dollars without a \nvalid obligation. To cover these payments, technicians were ordered to \ncreate a bogus account known as negative unliquidated obligations. Now, \nthat is a Harvard word, isn't it. But they called it NULO for short, \nthe acronym. So we have these negative unobligated obligations. Bills \nwere then paid from these bogus NULO accounts which carried negative \nbalances.\n  Mr. Lynn's policy gave DFAS accountants up to 6 months to link the \npayments to valid supporting obligations in the accounting records. If \nvalid supporting documentations could not be found in that timeframe, \nthen the center was authorized to cover the payments with other \navailable funds with no further investigation. This is how the \nunmatched disbursements of the Department of Defense were born and \neventually built into the billions of dollars.\n  In my January 19, 1999, letter to Mr. Lynn, I drew some comparisons \nbetween straight pay and the case of Air Force SSgt Robert L. Miller. \nNow, Robert L. Miller may not be a very famous name to most people \naround here, and he would not be to me if I had not run into him \nthrough this investigation. So I wanted to draw a comparison between \nthe straight pay policy and the case of this Air Force staff sergeant.\n  I think Mr. Lynn and others in the Pentagon at the time remember the \nMiller case, and remember it all too well, or at least they did at that \ntime. I examined that case and several others just like it in great \ndetail at a hearing before my Judiciary Subcommittee on Oversight on \nSeptember 28, 1998.\n  As chief of vendor pay at a DFAS center, then-Staff Sergeant Miller \nhad pursued his own unlawful versions of straight pay. Miller had full \naccess to the Integrated Accounts Payable System. As such, Miller was \nable to manipulate Department of Defense systems to create obligations \nand invoices where none existed and generate nearly $1 million in \nallegedly fraudulent payments to his mother and his girlfriend. Miller \nwas not apprehended because internal controls at DFAS were effective, \nthe things that were under the control of Mr. Lynn; he was caught \nbecause a coworker blew the whistle on him. She was one of Miller's \nsubordinates who had allegedly been sexually harassed by him.\n  At that time, I told Mr. Lynn--the same Mr. Lynn whose confirmation \nwe are considering now--that his straight pay policy appeared to \nauthorize DFAS accountants to do essentially what Staff Sergeant Miller \ndid: create false bookkeeping entries to cover large payments in the \nabsence of valid obligations. DFAS and Miller obviously had different \ngoals, but there was a common denominator, and that common denominator \nwas manipulation of the accounting system.\n  DFAS payment policies practiced on Mr. Lynn's watch left the barn \ndoor wide open to fraud and outright theft of the taxpayers' dollars.\n  The Government Accountability Office, which provided excellent \nsupport all the way through my investigation, fully agreed with this \nassessment.\n  There was another disturbing facet of the Miller case that I took up \nwith Mr. Lynn. On October 19, 1995, the date that Staff Sergeant Miller \nbecame chief of vendor pay at the Dayton center--a position considered \nfar above his rank--he was already under investigation in connection \nwith, one, the alleged disappearance of Government checks at Castle Air \nForce Base and, two, allegedly directing at least eight fraudulent \nchecks valued at $50,769 to his mother.\n  On October 26, 1995, just 1 week after Staff Sergeant Miller became \nchief of vendor pay at Dayton, an investigating officer at Castle Air \nForce Base made this recommendation about Miller:\n\n       Management should not place SSgt Miller in a position where \n     he is entrusted with funds again . . .\n\n\n[[Page S2112]]\n\n\n  After this report was issued, Miller should have been removed from \nhis position at the Dayton center immediately. But it took 2 years, \nuntil June 1997, when Miller was arrested for allegedly stealing the \nmillion dollars.\n  The whole Miller story, of course, is unbelievable.\n  In view of his problems at Castle Air Force Base, why did the DFAS \ncenter place him in charge of vendor pay? Why did DFAS keep him there \nafter an official report indicated he could not be trusted with the \nmoney? That makes as much sense as hiring a bank robber to be the bank \nteller.\n  On September 18, 1998, I wrote another letter that I have. This is \nletter No. 9, which I ask unanimous consent be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 18, 1998.\n     Hon. William J. Lynn III,\n     Comptroller and Chief Financial Officer,\n     Pentagon, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bill: I am writing to thank you for providing the \n     ``Investigation of Major Loss of Funds'' at Castle AFB \n     involving Staff Sergeant (SSGT) Robert L. Miller, Jr. and to \n     raise several additional questions.\n       I am very disturbed by what I found in the investigative \n     report on the disappearance of U.S. Treasury checks at Castle \n     AFB. The very obvious red warning flag raised by this report \n     was totally ignored by management at the Defense Finance and \n     Accounting Service (DFAS).\n       The report states that ``SSGT Miller was negligent in the \n     loss of the two treasury checks entrusted to him.'' It says: \n     ``He breached his duty,'' and it says ``he failed to \n     safeguard his funds.'' For a military pay agent, that would \n     normally be a death sentence. And if those words didn't ruin \n     SSGT Miller's career in money matters forever, the report's \n     recommendation number one should have done it. The \n     investigating officer recommended that: ``Management should \n     not place SSGT Miller in a position where he is entrusted \n     with funds again. . . .'' Those are strong words.\n       The recommendation that SSGT Miller not be trusted with \n     money again was made on October 26, 1995. That recommendation \n     came exactly one week after SSGT Miller was ``forced'' into a \n     position at the DFAS/Dayton finance center that was far above \n     his rank. A much more senior civilian--Mr. Chuck Tyler--who \n     occupied that position, was summarily removed to make room \n     for SSGT Miller. Although official organizational charts \n     indicate that SSGT Miller was just Chief of the Data Entry \n     Branch, officials familiar with SSGT Miller's operation \n     contend that he was, in fact, Chief of the entire Vendor Pay \n     Department. In that position, he had direct control over \n     billions of dollars in payments. In addition, for unknown \n     reasons, SSGT Miller was given unrestricted access to the \n     check generating system known as the Integrated Accounts \n     Payable System or IAPS. This was a clear violation of \n     internal control procedures. His predecessor--Mr. Tyler--had \n     much more limited access.\n       On October 19, 1995--the date on which SSGT Miller was \n     ``forced'' into Mr. Tyler's position, SSGT Miller was under \n     active investigation for the disappearance of a large sum of \n     money at Castle AFB. Unfortunately, his suspicious and \n     improper conduct at Castle was not limited to the two missing \n     Treasury checks. He had also generated at least 8 fraudulent \n     checks worth $50,769.00, which were addressed to his mother, \n     Ruby J. Miller. Only these facts were apparently not known at \n     the time. Furthermore, on October 19, 1995, he was just a few \n     days away from generating his first fraudulent check at \n     Dayton. This one was for $12,934.67 and was also addressed to \n     his mother.\n       All the new information that surfaced in connection with \n     SSGT Miller's court-martial clearly shows that the \n     investigating officer's concerns about SSGT Miller and money \n     were based on sound judgement. SSGT Miller could not be \n     trusted with money again. If the investigating officer's \n     advice had been followed, SSGT Miller's criminal activities \n     could have been brought to a screeching halt in October 1995 \n     instead of June 1997. In November 1995, a trusted employee at \n     the Dayton center, Mr. Otas Horn, even warned Colonel Berger \n     about the dangers of placing SSGT Miller in Mr. Tyler's \n     position with unrestricted access to IAPS. This early warning \n     was followed by repeated reports of criminal conduct at \n     Dayton throughout 1996, including an internal DFAS memo \n     signed by Mr. Nabil, Director of the Denver Center, on \n     September 30, 1996. Most involved fraudulent documents \n     created in SSGT Miller's section. All involved criminal \n     conduct--violations of 18 U.S.C. 1001--as noted in Mr. \n     Nabil's memo. Why didn't DFAS management report this criminal \n     activity to the law as required by every rule in the book?\n       Bill, I would like to return to the investigating officer's \n     recommendations: ``Management should not place SSGT Miller in \n     a position where he is entrusted with funds again. . . .'' \n     When this report was issued, SSGT Miller should have been \n     removed from his new position at Dayton--on the spot. Who in \n     SSGT Miller's chain of command at Dayton was responsible for \n     acting on the findings and recommendations in the \n     investigative report? Was it Mr. Nabil? Was it the Commander \n     at Dayton, Colonel Berger? Or was it Captain Brown, SSGT \n     Miller's immediate supervisor? Who at Dayton had knowledge of \n     this report? Who in DFAS management was responsible for \n     totally ignoring this very dangerous red warning flag?\n       Bill, the responsible person or persons in your \n     organization need to be held accountable for ignoring obvious \n     and repeated warning signals about SSGT Miller's \n     trustworthiness and giving him unrestricted access to your \n     department's money vault.\n       I respectfully request a response to my questions by \n     September 23, 1998.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                Charles E. Grassley, Chairman,\n\n                                    Subcommittee on Administrative\n                                         Oversight and the Courts.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I wrote this letter to Mr. Lynn and asked him two \nquestions: Who at Dayton--that means the financial center at Dayton--\nhad knowledge of the Castle Air Force Base report on Miller? Who in the \nfinance center management was responsible for totally ignoring this \nvery dangerous red warning flag? I ended my letter to Mr. Lynn this \nway:\n\n       Bill, the responsible person or persons in your \n     organization need to be held accountable for ignoring obvious \n     and repeated warning signals about SSGT Miller's \n     trustworthiness and giving him unrestricted access to your \n     department's money vault.\n\n  I asked for answers to these two questions by September 23, 1998. \nThat would have been 5 days after I wrote the letter. None ever \narrived, as far as I know.\n  When I did not get a prompt response to my January 19 letter to Mr. \nLynn on straight pay, I raised those same issues with Secretary Cohen. \nI did that at a hearing before the Budget Committee on March 2, \n1999. This is what Secretary Cohen said at the time:\n\n       There is no authorized procedure called Straight Pay.\n\n  Now, get that. You have straight pay that people talk about, and you \nhave a Secretary of Defense saying there is no authorized procedure \ncalled straight pay.\n\n       The process described is not correct and is not authorized.\n\n  These answers do not square with the evidence I have tried to lay \nout.\n  Then, on March 9, came further explanation from Chief Financial \nOfficer Lynn. He said essentially the same thing but with a slightly \ndifferent twist:\n\n       The Straight Pay policy you refer to in your letter is not \n     used at our Columbus Center. . . .\n\n  There are some words left out. It goes on to say:\n\n       ``Straight Pay,'' as reported to you, does not exist at the \n     Columbus Center.\n\n  This letter No. 10 explains that in great detail, and I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record letter No. 10.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Under Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 9, 1999.\n     Hon. Charles B. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: This is in reply to your recent \n     letter on my decision to raise the prevalidation dollar \n     threshold for payments of contracts paid using the \n     Mechanization of Contract Administration System (MOCAS) at \n     the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Columbus \n     Center.\n       In the prevalidation plan that we submitted to Congress, we \n     stated we would gradually lower the threshold until all \n     payments were prevalidated by July 2000. We took an \n     aggressive approach in our attempt to reach the goal of 100 \n     percent prevalidation before July 2000. Contracts awarded \n     before FY 1997 are now prevalidated at the current statutory \n     level of $1,000,000. Since March 1997, we have attempted to \n     prevalidate all contracts above $2,500 that were issued in FY \n     1997 and later.\n       Unfortunately, we could not sustain the new prevalidation \n     level in MOCAS and meet our obligations under the Prompt \n     Payment Act. The imposition of the $2,500 prevalidation \n     threshold, together with other factors, caused critical \n     delays in our connector payments. In December 1998, after \n     carefully considering the need to reduce our payment backlogs \n     while complying with the Prompt Payment Act, I temporarily \n     raised the prevalidation dollar threshold to $500,000 for \n     centrally administered contracts paid through MOCAS. I also \n     recently extended this threshold increase until June 1999. \n     However, we still plan to meet our July 2000 goal to \n     prevalidate all payments. We will continue to lower the \n     prevalidation threshold, but at a deliberate pace to achieve \n     our goal\n\n[[Page S2113]]\n\n     of prevalidating all payments by July 2000 and ensuring \n     compliance with the Prompt Payment Act.\n       The ``Straight Pay'' policy you refer to in your letter is \n     not used at our Columbus Center. Before a payment is made in \n     Columbus using MOCAS, the system must have entries that \n     validate a contract exists, an invoice has been presented, \n     and goods or services have been received or accepted. \n     Increasing the prevalidation threshold does not waive the \n     requirement to have these items before a payment is made. In \n     addition, MOCAS does not allow one person to enter all three \n     data elements into the system. I have enclosed a description \n     of the MOCAS payment process. I believe that after you review \n     our contract payment process, you will agree that some \n     critical elements of the process were not provided to you and \n     that ``Straight Pay,'' as reported to you, does not exist at \n     the Columbus Center.\n       You also expressed concern that with the threshold raised \n     to $500,000, DFAS experience the same type of fraud in MOCAS \n     that SSgt Miller perpetuated using the Integrated Accounts \n     Payable System (IAPS) in Dayton. The MOCAS payment \n     environment is significantly different from the IAPS \n     environment. The MOCAS system architecture does not permit \n     multiple levels of access. The internal controls built into \n     MOCAS that force separations of functions all but eliminate \n     the possibility of one person creating fraudulent payments.\n       I am still committed to reaching the goal of total \n     prevalidation by July 2000. As we improve our systems \n     capability, we will combine to aggressively reduce the \n     threshold until all payments are prevalidated. I appreciate \n     your interest and look forward to working with you to improve \n     our operations.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  William J. Lynn.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I felt as though then-Secretary Cohen on the one hand \nand Chief Financial Officer Lynn were trying to convince me that \nstraight pay did not exist. Their statements appear to be, even today, \nmisleading and inaccurate.\n  Just because I didn't explain the policy exactly right did not mean \nthe policy did not exist. Everything that was coming over the transom \nat night to me was telling me that I was on the right track.\n  I responded to the denials this way--and they are in this letter, my \nletter No. 11. I wish to quote a couple of sentences:\n\n       If this statement is indeed accurate--and ``Straight Pay'' \n     doesn't exist, then why do I have official DFAS documents \n     establishing ``Straight Pay Procedures?'' Are these documents \n     a fake?\n\n  Are these documents I am getting a fake if they come directly from \nthe financial center?\n  I later discovered another DFAS document, dated March 8, 1999, which \nstates:\n\n       Due to concerns over the use of the term ``straight pay'' \n     and its connotation, we must delete all references to \n     ``straight pay'' the from the policy. . . .\n\n  Now, how does that square with what the Secretary of Defense Cohen \ntold me? How does that square with the exchange I had with Bill Lynn, \nChief Financial Officer at that time? Those things are in this document \nNo. 12.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have document No. 12 printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   Defense Finance\n\n\n                                       and Accounting Service,\n\n                                                    March 8, 1999.\n\n\n                    memorandum for see distribution\n\n     Subject: Policy for Processing Unmatched Disbursements\n       Effective November 1, 1999, you were authorized to post \n     unmatched disbursements (UMDs) without posting a negative \n     unliquidated obligation (NULO) offset for transactions \n     meeting criteria described in the attached policy. Due to \n     concerns over the use of the term ``straight pay'' and its \n     connotation, we must delete all references to ``straight \n     pay'' from the policy, and clarify that the policy does not \n     create an environment for fraudulent payments. Terms such as \n     unmatched disbursements or direct disbursements were \n     substituted.\n       Operating location (OPLOC) recommendations to add other \n     categories under paragraph F, ``Unmatched Disbursements Which \n     May Be Recorded Without Research, Approval, and NULO \n     Offset,'' were incorporated. For example, Fund Type K \n     transactions for Deposit/Suspense Accounts and disbursements \n     posted under processing center ``Y,'' etc., were added. The \n     inclusion of these categories did not change the intent or \n     scope of the policy. We also clarified that for disbursements \n     made against obligations recorded as Miscellaneous Obligation \n     Reimbursement Documents (MORD) where the difference exceeds \n     $3,000, Financial Service Office/Accounting Liaison office \n     (FSO/ALO) approval is not required, but the FSO/ALO should be \n     notified within 4 work days.\n       The revised policy is attached for your action. OPLOCs will \n     continue to maintain a log on unmatched disbursements \n     requiring FSO/ALO review. Copies of attached Missing \n     Commitment/Obligation form (Atch 1) may be kept in lieu of a \n     log.\n       We are requesting you to submit another report from the log \n     statistics you gather for UMDs processed between February 1--\n     May 31, 1999. The UMD Report, in Excel 5.0 format, is due to \n     DFAS-DE/ASP on June 11, 1999. Please submit report via \n     cc:mail to address indicated on attached report format. At \n     that time we will decide whether another reporting cycle is \n     necessary.\n       These procedures were coordinated with the Office of the \n     Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Financial \n     Management-Air Force Accounting and Finance Office (AFAFO/\n     FMF). If you have any questions, my project officer is Ms. \n     Mirta Valdez, DFAS-DE/ASP, (303) 676-7708 or DSN 926-7708.\n                                                   Sally A. Smith,\n                                          Dierctor for Accounting.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I say to my colleagues, is the March 8, 1999, date on \nthis document a coincidence or was this a bureaucratic tactic to \nsuppress, to bury or to rename the policy to conform with the highest \nlevel of rhetoric that I heard in March of that year?\n  Not getting the straight story from the Pentagon, I brought the issue \nof straight pay to the attention of one of our colleagues now and a \ncolleague back then, Senator Inhofe, who was chairman of the Readiness \nSubcommittee on Armed Services. My letter to Senator Inhofe is dated \nApril 8, 1999, and I have that letter here as No. 13 document.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have document No. 13 printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 8, 1999.\n     Hon. James M. Inhofe,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support, \n         Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Jim: In view of your upcoming hearing on financial \n     management at the Department of Defense (DOD) along with my \n     continuing interest in these matters, I am submitting several \n     questions bearing on internal control issues for your \n     consideration.\n       Back on January 19, 1999, I wrote a letter to DOD's Chief \n     Financial Officer (CFO), Mr. Bill Lynn, to verify certain \n     facts pertaining to a policy known as ``straight pay.'' The \n     facts in question were provided anonymously by an employee at \n     the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS). In a \n     nutshell, this policy authorizes DFAS to make payments up to \n     $500,000.00 when no corresponding obligation or contract \n     could be located in the database or otherwise identified. \n     When bills are paid in the absence of contracts, how does \n     DFAS know how much money, if any, is owed? As I understand \n     it, this policy was personally approved by Mr. Lynn.\n       In my mind, this is a very dangerous policy. But it is not \n     only dangerous. It is also misguided, and it may violate the \n     law. It is certainly helping to erode one of the last visible \n     traces of internal controls at DOD, and its continued use \n     will undermine any hope of a ``clean'' audit opinion on the \n     department's annual financial statements--as required by the \n     Chief Financial Officers Act.\n       Last year, during my investigation of the breakdown of \n     internal controls at DOD, I learned that Air Force Staff \n     Sergeant (SSGT) Robert L. Miller, Jr. had pursued his own \n     version of ``straight pay'' while Chief of Vendor Pay at \n     DFAS' Dayton center during 1995-1997. With full access to the \n     Integrated Accounts Payable System, SSGT Miller was able to \n     create obligations, where none existed, and generate nearly a \n     $1,000,000.00 in fraudulent payments to his mother and \n     girlfriend. Now, Mr. Lynn's ``straight pay'' policy \n     authorizes DFAS technicians to do exactly what SSGT Miller \n     did--create false bookkeeping entries to cover large payments \n     in the absence of supporting contracts. This policy leaves \n     the door wide open to fraud and mismanagement.\n       I am attaching a copy of my letter to Mr. Lynn on \n     ``straight pay'' dated January 19, 1999. Since Mr. Lynn never \n     answered this letter, I had to verify the facts on my own in \n     consultation with the General Accounting Office. According to \n     a March 8, 1999 DFAS memorandum, Mr. Lynn's ``straight pay'' \n     policy is still in place today, though its name has been \n     changed to avoid any negative connotations. DFAS is concerned \n     that the term ``straight pay'' may suggest a permissive \n     ``environment for fraudulent payments.''\n       I would very much appreciate it if you would place a copy \n     of my letter in the hearing record and raise my enclosed \n     questions on DOD's ``straight pay'' policy. My questions \n     should be directed to Mr. Lynn.\n       Again, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to \n     submit questions for your upcoming hearing on DOD Financial \n     Management problems.\n       In addition, in the very near future, I expect to be \n     submitting ``a legislative reform package'' to you and other \n     colleagues for consideration. The rationale for this draft \n     legislation is outlined under the heading ``The Need for DOD \n     Financial Reforms'' on pages 25 to 29 of the Budget \n     Committee's report on the Concurrent Resolution on the\n\n[[Page S2114]]\n\n     Budget for FY 2000 (Senate Report No. 106-27).\n       I look forward to having Mr. Lynn's responses to my \n     questions on ``straight pay'' and working with you in the \n     future on these matters.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles E. Grassley,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I told my friend from Oklahoma that I considered \nstraight pay to be ``a very dangerous and misguided policy that might \nviolate the law.'' I also told him about the Miller case heretofore \nreferenced. I urged Senator Inhofe to ask Secretary Cohen and Chief \nFinancial Officer Lynn five questions on straight pay at an upcoming \nhearing.\n  Mr. Lynn attempted to clarify the Department of Defense position on \nstraight pay in a letter dated June 18, 1999. That is document No. 14.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have document No. 14 printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Under Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 18, 1999.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: This is in reply to your recent \n     letter to the Honorable William S. Cohen, Secretary of \n     Defense, concerning the Department of Defense responses to \n     your questions submitted for the record following a March 2, \n     1999, hearing before the Senate Budget Committee. Enclosed is \n     the Department's response to your questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  William J. Lynn.\n       Enclosure.\n\n       Responses to the Questions of Senator Charles E. Grassley\n\n       Question. The General Accounting Office (GAO)--in report \n     No. AIMD-99-19--states that Mr. Hamre's policy authorizes the \n     Navy to delay recording obligations in excess of available \n     budget authority for up to five years. The GAO further \n     indicates that the purpose of the policy allowing such delays \n     in recording obligations in the books of account is to avoid \n     a potential over obligation and violation of the \n     Antideficiency Act. Are these two statements accurate and \n     correct?\n       Answer. The policy referenced in GAO report No. AIMD-99-19 \n     is not intended to and, in fact, in no way does, shield any \n     DoD Component from a violation of the Antideficiency Act. \n     Similarly, in no instance is the policy intended to allow any \n     DoD Component to willingly defer the recording of a known \n     valid obligation in excess of available budget authority.\n       The Department's policies require that an obligation be \n     established at the time a contract is entered into or a good \n     or service is ordered, and to be recorded within 10 days of \n     the date on which the obligation is incurred. Additionally, \n     prior to making a disbursement, the applicable technician is \n     required to verify that an appropriate contract or other \n     ordering instrument exists, that a government official has \n     verified that the goods or services have been received and \n     that a proper invoice requesting payment has been received. \n     Also, depending on the amount of the payment, the technician \n     may be required to prevalidate an obligation. (Prevalidation \n     is the process of checking to ensure that a matching \n     obligation has been recorded in the accounting records prior \n     to making a disbursement.) Additionally, the technician also \n     is required to identify the proper appropriation to be \n     charged and the accounting office responsible for the related \n     obligation. Further, the disbursement should be matched to \n     the applicable obligation at the time the disbursement is \n     made, if feasible, or as soon thereafter as is feasible.\n       The GAO report referred to above addresses in-transit \n     disbursements. In-transit disbursements occur when the paying \n     office (the office making the disbursement) is different than \n     the accounting office (the office accounting for the \n     obligation). In such instances, in addition to determining \n     the existence of a contract or ordering document and \n     verifying the receipt of the goods or services before making \n     the payment, and deducting the amount of the payment from the \n     cash balance of the appropriation involved, the paying office \n     also must forward the disbursement information to the \n     accounting office to enable the disbursement to be recorded \n     against the related obligation. (Only the applicable \n     accounting office, and not the paying office, can record a \n     disbursement against its related obligation. Thus, this \n     latter action is required irrespective of whether the \n     disbursement was prevalidated prior to payment.)\n       Since the amount of in-transit disbursements is deducted \n     from the cash balance of the applicable appropriation at the \n     time of disbursement, the Department can determine if the \n     cash balance of the appropriation involved is positive or \n     negative. Since a negative cash balance is an indication of a \n     potential Antideficiency Act violation, if an appropriation \n     has a negative cash balance, the Defense Finance and \n     Accounting Service is required to stop making any further \n     payments chargeable to the appropriation. Additionally, the \n     DoD Component involved is required to initiate an \n     investigation of a potential Antideficiency Act violation. \n     Except in very rare instances, in-transit disbursements do \n     not result in a negative cash balance in the applicable \n     appropriation. Since the appropriations charged have a \n     positive cash balance that means that amounts disbursed from \n     those appropriations are not in excess of available budget \n     authority.\n       As stated above, when the paying office is different than \n     the accounting office, the paying office must forward the \n     disbursement information to the accounting office to enable \n     the disbursement to be recorded against the related \n     obligation. During the time that the information is being \n     transmitted from the paying office to the accounting office \n     the information is said to be in-transit, and the \n     disbursement is said to be an in-transit disbursement. Once \n     the information is received by the accounting office, the \n     accounting office attempts to match the disbursement to an \n     obligation, and the disbursement no longer is considered to \n     be an in-transit disbursement. At that point, the \n     disbursement becomes a matched disbursement, an unmatched \n     disbursement or a negative unliquidated obligation.\n       Over 90 percent of in-transit disbursements are matched to \n     an obligation within 60 days of arriving at the applicable \n     accounting station. However, in some instances the \n     information does not arrive at the applicable accounting \n     office or the information that does arrive is not sufficient \n     to allow the applicable accounting office to attempt to match \n     the disbursement to an obligation. In such circumstances, the \n     accounting office must take additional steps to research and \n     obtain the information required to allow it to attempt to \n     match the disbursement to an obligation.\n       Until the 1990s, the Department had no policy regarding \n     such research efforts and did not require that obligations be \n     recorded for unresolved in-transit disbursements. The policy \n     addressed in the referenced GAO report recognized that, \n     consistent with DoD policy, in most instances, obligations \n     are established at the time an applicable contract is entered \n     into or goods or services are ordered. However, in those \n     instances where an accounting office does not receive \n     detailed information on an in-transit disbursement, this lack \n     of detailed information often precludes the accounting office \n     from being able to attempt to identify the disbursement to an \n     obligation. Establishment of a new obligation for such \n     disbursements, in many instances, could result in a duplicate \n     obligation. In order to avoid such duplicate obligations, the \n     Department allows the DoD Components time to conduct \n     additional research. Often, this requires a considerable \n     period of time and involves significant manual research. This \n     is especially so for those in-transit disbursements made by \n     one of the over 300 former paying offices that now have been \n     closed.\n       Question. If a bill for $499,999.99 is submitted to the \n     Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Columbus Center \n     for payment and the responsible technician is unable to \n     identify a matching obligation, and Mr. Lynn's waiver is used \n     to authorize the payment, exactly how is the payment posted \n     in the books of account? Without a valid, matching \n     obligation, there are just three options: (a) post it to a \n     bogus account; (b) post it to the wrong account; or (c) don't \n     post it. How does DFAS do it?\n       Answer. In the example described above, the technician at \n     the DFAS Columbus Center would not be required to validate \n     that an obligation was recorded in the official accounting \n     records prior to making the payment because the dollar amount \n     would be below the prevalidation threshold amount in effect \n     at the DFAS Columbus Center. (However, at any DFAS location \n     other than the Columbus Center, this amount would be above \n     the prevalidation threshold amount and the technician would \n     be required to match the proposed disbursement to the \n     applicable obligation prior to making the disbursement.) \n     Although in the above example, the technician at the DFAS \n     Columbus Center would not be required to match the payment to \n     an obligation prior to payment, the technician would be \n     required to determine that the payment otherwise is valid. \n     This would require that the technician verify that an \n     appropriate contract or other ordering instrument exists and \n     that a government official verified that the goods or \n     services were received. Also, the technician would be \n     required to identify the proper appropriation to be charged \n     and the accounting station where the related obligation is \n     recorded. Generally, this information would reside, and could \n     be found, in the payment system at the DFAS Columbus Center.\n       Irrespective of whether a disbursement is matched to an \n     obligation prior to payment, once a payment is made by the \n     DFAS Columbus Center, the amount of the disbursement would be \n     deducted from the cash balance of the applicable \n     appropriation charged and information concerning the \n     disbursement would be forwarded to the applicable accounting \n     station. When that information arrived at the applicable \n     accounting station, the accounting station would: match the \n     disbursement to the applicable obligation recorded in the \n     accounting system; or if the amount of the disbursement \n     exceeded the amount of the applicable obligation, match the \n     disbursement to the applicable obligation but record a \n     negative unliquidated obligation against the same account for \n     the amount of the difference between the disbursement and the \n     obligation; or if no corresponding obligation record can be \n     found in\n\n[[Page S2115]]\n\n     the accounting system, treat the disbursement as an unmatched \n     disbursement.\n       Question. While the DFAS attempts to identify the matching \n     obligation, is the payment placed in the ``in-transit'' \n     status?\n       Answer. The Columbus Center, using the Department's \n     existing finance network, would forward information on the \n     disbursement to the applicable accounting station. That \n     information would be considered to be ``in-transit'' for the \n     period of time necessary for the information to be forwarded \n     from the Columbus Center to the applicable accounting \n     station. Once the information arrived at the accounting \n     station, the accounting station would match the disbursement \n     to the applicable obligation and the transaction no longer \n     would be considered to be in an in-transit disbursement.\n       Question. If a valid, matching obligation cannot be found, \n     how is the problem resolved?\n       Answer. If a valid, matching obligation cannot be found, \n     the disbursement is treated as an unmatched disbursement. In \n     the case of an unmatched disbursement, the applicable \n     accounting station and DoD Component involved are given 180 \n     days to conduct research to identify the matching obligation. \n     If, after the 180-day period, a valid matching obligation \n     cannot be found, the DoD Component involved is required to \n     establish a new obligation for the disbursement.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. In his followup letter, Mr. Lynn backed away from his \nassertion that straight pay did not exist. So they said it didn't \nexist, and now you see an assertion backing away from that. While he \nnever used the term ``straight pay,'' he did not try to disassociate \nhimself from the policy. His description of the policy was generally \naccurate, though somewhat incomplete.\n  I raised essentially the same question with Mr. Lynn in a recent \nletter, dated January 29, 2009, because of his appointment to this \nposition of Deputy Secretary of Defense. Regrettably, he provided \nessentially the same answers in a letter dated February 3, 2009.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record those two \nletters, documents 15 and 16.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 29, 2009.\n     Mr. William J. Lynn,\n     Senior Vice President, Raytheon Company, Arlington, VA.\n       Dear Mr. Lynn: I am writing to follow-up on six questions I \n     submitted for the record at your nomination hearing before \n     the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this month.\n       Two of my questions pertain to a potential conflict of \n     interest flowing from your status as a registered lobbyist \n     with the Raytheon Company. Four of the questions pertain to \n     your efforts as the Department of Defense (DOD) Chief \n     Financial Officer (CFO) to bring the department into \n     compliance with the CFO Act. I am eagerly waiting for your \n     answers to my six questions.\n       Since submitting those questions for the record, I have had \n     an opportunity to retrieve and examine certain archived files \n     on DOD financial management issues that I investigated in the \n     late 1990's while you were the DOD CFO and Comptroller. I \n     came across two files of particular interest as follows: 1) \n     ``Straight Pay;'' and 2) ``Pay and Chase.'' These are DOD \n     payment policies that were either attributed to you and/or \n     adopted while you were the department's Chief Financial \n     Officer in charge of such matters. My follow-up questions \n     pertain to these matters.\n       In 1998, when you were CFO, ``Pay and Chase'' was a term \n     used to describe DOD vendor payment policy. With ``Pay and \n     Chase,'' the Pentagon paid bills first and worried about \n     tracking down the receipts later. Sometimes receipts were \n     found; sometimes not; And sometimes no effort was made to \n     look. This is how DOD ended up with billions of dollars in \n     unmatched disbursements. As I understand it, this was SOP \n     when you were CFO. It was unofficial policy. It was practiced \n     but not authorized in government regulations or law.\n       Secretary of Defense Cohen attempted to legalize ``Pay and \n     Chase.'' He wanted to make it the law of the land. He \n     forwarded his proposal to the Senate on February 2, 1998 as \n     part of a larger package of so-called defense reforms. At \n     that point in time, you were CFO, and this matter fell \n     directly under your area of responsibility. ``Pay and Chase'' \n     was just one small piece of the Defense Reform Act of 1988--\n     also known as the Defense Reform Initiative (DRI). ``Pay and \n     Chase'' was embodied in Section 401 of that bill. It was \n     touted as a measure to ``streamline'' DOD payment practices.\n       Section 401 would have authorized DOD to pay bills without \n     receipts with no dollar limit. It would have required only \n     random after-the-fact verification of some receipts. And it \n     would have relieved disbursing officers of all responsibility \n     for fraudulent payments that might have resulted from the \n     policy.\n       There is nothing in my files to indicate Section 401 of \n     Secretary Cohen's DRI became law. I believe ``Pay and Chase'' \n     continued as an unofficial policy and evolved into another \n     troublesome one known as ``Straight Pay.'' This policy was \n     initially approved by you in a signed memorandum on December \n     17, 1988.\n       On January 19, 1999, I wrote to you, expressing grave \n     concern about ``Straight Pay.''\n       Prior to the implementation of ``Straight Pay,'' the \n     Defense Finance and Accounting Center (DFAS), Columbus, Ohio \n     had a pre-validation policy that required all disbursements \n     over $2,500.00 be matched with obligations prior to payment. \n     When a bill was submitted to the center for payment, a \n     technician searched the database for the supporting \n     obligation or contract. If one could not be found, a red \n     warning flag was allegedly run up the pole. Was it a \n     duplicate or fraudulent payment? Your ``Straight Pay'' policy \n     raised the pre-validation threshold to $500,000.00. \n     ``Straight Pay'' allowed the technician to ignore the warning \n     signals and make payments up to $500,000.00 without checking \n     documentation. Then the accountants at the center were \n     directed to create bogus accounts for negative unliquidated \n     obligations or ``NULO'' to cover the payment. The bill was \n     then paid from the bogus account with a negative balance. The \n     center had six months to locate valid supporting obligation. \n     If a valid, matching obligation could not be found within \n     that time frame, then the center would cover the payment with \n     other available funds with no further investigation.\n       In my letter to you, I drew some comparisons between \n     ``Straight Pay'' and the scenario in the case of Air Force \n     Staff Sergeant (SSGT) Robert L. Miller, Jr. You may remember \n     the Miller case. I examined that case--and others like it--in \n     great detail at a hearing before my Judiciary Oversight \n     Subcommittee on September 28, 1998. As Chief of Vendor Pay at \n     another DFAS Center, SSGT Miller had pursued his own version \n     of ``Straight Pay.'' With full access to the Integrated \n     Accounts Payable System, SSGT Miller was able to create \n     obligations, where none existed, and to generate nearly a \n     $1,000,000.00 in allegedly fraudulent payments to his mother \n     and girlfriend. He was not caught until a co-worker blew the \n     whistle.\n       Mr. Lynn, on the surface at least, your ``Straight Pay'' \n     policy appeared to authorize DFAS technicians to do \n     essentially what SSGT Miller allegedly did--create false \n     bookkeeping entries to cover large payments in the absence of \n     supporting documentation. Your policy left the barn door wide \n     open to fraud and mismanagement. At the time, the General \n     Accounting Office agreed with that assessment.\n       Also, at the time, I told you and other senior officials--\n     and spoke extensively about this problem on the floor--that \n     ``Straight Pay'' was a dangerous, misguided, irresponsible, \n     and unbusinesslike policy. Furthermore, it was totally \n     inconsistent with various provisions of Title 31 of the U.S. \n     Code, Money and Finance.\n       American taxpayers deserved to know that their hard earned \n     money was being protected and properly accounted for under \n     your leadership at DOD. So please help me understand your \n     position on ``Straight Pay.'' It seemed to be completely \n     inconsistent with your responsibilities under the CFO Act. As \n     CFO, how could you endorse such a policy?\n       Your prompt response to my questions would be appreciated,\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles E. Grassley,\n     Ranking Member.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 February 3, 2009.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: Thank you for your letter of January \n     29, 2009 concerning my tenure as Under Secretary of Defense \n     (Comptroller) and Chief Financial Officer from November 1997 \n     to January 2001. You asked specifically about two payment \n     practices: ``Pay and Chase'' and ``Straight Pay''.\n       The Denver Center of the Defense Finance and Accounting \n     Service (DFAS) initiated the ``Pay and Chase'' pilot 'in \n     early 1997 in order to achieve more timely payments. It was a \n     limited test that allowed certain payments under $2,500 to be \n     made based on matching a proper invoice to the corresponding \n     contract. Receipt and acceptance was followed up after the \n     payment was made. The pilot was discontinued by October 1997 \n     when the DoD General Counsel and DFAS General Counsel found \n     that matching a proper invoice and contract alone was not \n     legally sufficient to make a payment. The Department proposed \n     legislation to Congress in 1998 called Verification After \n     Payment that would have authorized making payments from the \n     invoice/contract match, but that request was later dropped \n     without Congressional action.\n       ``Straight Pay'' is an informal term used to describe the \n     practice of making payment based on a three way match of a \n     proper invoice, receiving report and contract when an \n     obligation has not yet been recorded in the accounting \n     records. ``Straight Pay'' recognizes the government's legal \n     obligation to make payment and was used to ensure contractors \n     were paid on time and to reduce payment backlogs and \n     associated interest penalties due to late payments. Under \n     ``Straight Pay'' policies, payments could not be made on an \n     invoice alone. But if DFAS had a proper invoice together with \n     a valid contract for the goods/services and a valid receiving \n     report that the goods/services had been delivered, payment \n     could be made without a matching obligation. DFAS then \n     contacted the Military Services to update the\n\n[[Page S2116]]\n\n     accounting records, ensuring that the expenditure was \n     recorded and valid.\n       The Defense Department has two important obligations: to \n     ensure that those who provide goods and services to the \n     Department are paid on time pursuant to the Prompt Payment \n     Act and to make certain there are proper controls that ensure \n     the Department has received the goods and services pursuant \n     to a valid contract. At a time when the Department faced a \n     backlog of unpaid invoices and mounting interest costs due to \n     late payments, ``Straight Pay'' was an attempt to draw the \n     right balance between those objectives by reducing late \n     payments while still ensuring that the Department had \n     received what it paid for and that the accounting records \n     were accurate.\n       Best practices require that all proper invoices be matched \n     with a receiving report and contract, and that the obligation \n     be pre-validated in the accounting records prior to payment. \n     The Department made progress toward this pre-validation \n     objective while I was Under Secretary. And I understand that \n     further progress has been made since I left. If confirmed, I \n     will work with the Chief Financial Officer and the Military \n     Departments to achieve this important goal.\n       Finally, you raised the case of Air Force Staff Sergeant \n     Robert L. Miller, who defrauded the Department in a series of \n     activities between October 1994 and June 1997. The Miller \n     case did not actually involve ``Straight Pay''. It did, \n     however, expose significant internal control weaknesses \n     within both DFAS and the Air Force. As a consequence of the \n     Miller case, I directed DFAS to take a series of corrective \n     actions, including revising internal control guidance to \n     ensure better segregation of duties, reviewing and adjusting \n     vendor payment access to the minimum number of personnel \n     needed to properly conduct business, ensuring proper \n     documentation existed to pay invoices, and correcting \n     deficiencies in computer system security. In addition, DFAS \n     in November 1999 established an Internal Review office to \n     examine its systems and operations for weaknesses and \n     potential cases of fraud.\n       As you requested, I have also included answers to the six \n     questions you submitted for the record after my nomination \n     hearing on January 15, 2009. Looking ahead, if confirmed as \n     Deputy Secretary of Defense, I will do my utmost to \n     strengthen the Department's financial management and internal \n     controls designed to prevent fraud. I will also work to \n     accelerate the modernization and integration of the \n     Department's management information systems. From my earlier \n     DoD tenure, I know the obstacles to achieving this, but I \n     also know its vital importance. In this era of increasing \n     fiscal strain, financial stewardship at the Department of \n     Defense is essential, and I look forward to making that \n     happen.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             William J. Lynn, III.\n\n                    Senate Armed Services Committee\n\n                        Questions for the Record\n\n   (To consider the following nominations: William J. Lynn III to be \n Deputy Secretary of Defense; Robert F. Hale to be Under Secretary of \nDefense (Comptroller) and Chief Financial Officer; Michele Flournoy to \nbe Under Secretary of Defense for Policy; and Jeh Charles Johnson to be \n    General Counsel, Department of Defense. Witnesses: Lynn, Hale, \n                           Flournoy, Johnson)\n\n       Senator Chuck Grassley\n\n\n                          Financial Management\n\n       93. Mr. Lynn, as the Under Secretary of Defense \n     (Comptroller), you were the Department's Chief Financial \n     Officer (CFO). That position was established by the CFO Act \n     of 1990. Section 902 of the CFO Act states: ``The CFO shall \n     develop and maintain an integrated agency accounting and \n     financial management system, including financial reporting \n     and internal controls.'' This requirement existed for at \n     least 5 years before you became the DOD CFO. While you were \n     CFO, did DOD operate a fully integrated accounting and \n     financial management system that produced accurate and \n     complete information? If not, why?\n       Answer: The DoD financial and business management systems \n     were designed and created before the CFO Act of 1990 to meet \n     the prior requirements to track obligation and expenditure of \n     congressional appropriations accurately. The CFO Act required \n     the Department to shift from its long-time focus on an \n     obligation-based system designed to support budgetary actions \n     to a broader, more commercial style, accrual-based system. To \n     accomplish this transformation, several things needed to be \n     done. First, the Department created the Defense Finance and \n     Accounting Service (DFAS) to consolidate financial \n     operations, which was accomplished in 1991 before my tenure \n     as Under Secretary. Second, the Department had too numerous \n     and incompatible finance and accounting systems. From a peak \n     of over 600 finance and accounting systems, I led an effort \n     to reduce that number by over two thirds. This consolidation \n     effort also strove to eliminate outdated financial management \n     systems and replace them with systems that provided more \n     accurate, more timely and more meaningful data to decision \n     makers. The third and most difficult step in developing an \n     integrated accounting and financial management system has \n     been to integrate data from outside the financial systems. \n     More than 80 percent of the data on the Defense Department's \n     financial statement comes from outside the financial systems \n     themselves. It comes from the logistics systems, the \n     personnel systems, the acquisition systems, the medical \n     systems and so on. On this effort, we made progress while I \n     was Under Secretary but much more needs to be done. If \n     confirmed, I will take this task on as a high priority.\n       94. Mr. Lynn, under section 3515 of the CFO Act, all \n     agencies, including DOD, are supposed to prepare and submit \n     financial statements that are then subjected to audit by the \n     Inspectors General. While you were the CFO, did DOD ever \n     prepare a financial statement in which all DOD components \n     earned a ``clean'' audit opinion from the DOD IG? If not, \n     why?\n       Answer: In the 1997, the Department of Defense had twenty-\n     three reporting entities, only one of which, the Military \n     Retirement Fund, had achieved a clean audit. Over the next \n     four years, the Department under my leadership as Under \n     Secretary earned a ``clean'' opinion on three other entities: \n     most importantly, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service \n     in 2000, followed by the Defense Commissary Agency and the \n     Defense Contract Audit Agency in 2001. We were unable to \n     obtain clean opinions on the other reporting entities. The \n     primary reason for not earning clean opinions on the \n     remaining entities was the difficulty of capturing data from \n     non-financial systems and integrating that data into the \n     financial systems in an auditable manner. It is my \n     understanding that the Department still faces the challenge \n     of integrating financial and non-financial systems to support \n     the auditability of the DOD financial statements.\n       95. Mr. Lynn, as CFO, what specific steps did you take to \n     correct this problem?\n       Answer: Under my leadership, the DOD instituted several \n     important efforts to achieve a ``clean'' audit opinion. The \n     primary effort was described in the Biennial Financial \n     Management Improvement Plan (FMIP) which was submitted to \n     Congress in 1998. That plan merged previous initiatives with \n     new ones into a single comprehensive effort to achieve both \n     financial management improvement and auditability. To \n     directly address auditability, the FMIP included an effort in \n     collaboration with the Office of Management and Budget, the \n     General Accounting Office, and the Office of the Inspector \n     General to address ten major issues identified by the audit \n     community: 1) internal controls and accounting systems \n     related to general property plant and equipment; 2) \n     inventory; 3) environmental liabilities; 4) military \n     retirement health benefits liability; 5) material lines \n     within the Statement of Budgetary Resources; 6) unsupported \n     adjustments to financial data; 7) financial management \n     systems not integrated; 8) systems not maintaining adequate \n     audit trails; 9) systems not valuing and depreciating \n     property, plant and equipment; and 10) systems not using the \n     Standard General Ledger at the transaction level. Due to this \n     effort, substantial progress was made on most of these issues \n     and several were resolved, including valuation of the \n     military retirement health benefits liability, the reduction \n     of unsupported adjustments to financial data, and the \n     identification of environmental liabilities.\n       96. Mr. Lynn, 18 years after the CFO Act was signed into \n     law, DOD is still unable to produce a comprehensive financial \n     statement that has been certified as a ``clean'' audit. It \n     may be years before that goal is met. If DOD's books cannot \n     be audited, then the defense finance and accounting system is \n     disjointed and broken. Financial transactions are not \n     recorded in the books of account in a timely manner and \n     sometimes not at all. Without accurate and complete financial \n     information, which is fed into a central management system, \n     DOD managers do not know how the money is being spent or what \n     anything costs. That also leaves DOD financial resources \n     vulnerable to fraud, waste and abuse, and even outright \n     theft. The last time I looked at this problem billions--and \n     maybe hundreds of billions--of tax dollars could not be \n     properly linked to supporting documentation. As Deputy \n     Secretary of Defense, what will you do to address this \n     problem? Please give me a realistic timeline for fixing this \n     problem.\n       Answer: The Department needs stronger management \n     information systems. I can assure you that, if confirmed, I \n     will be committed to improving financial information and \n     business intelligence needed for sound decision making. I \n     have not yet completed my review of all the information \n     needed to provide a specific timeline; however, I will \n     continue to examine this issue, including consideration of \n     this and other Committees' views as well as the resources \n     needed for the audit, before forming my assessment of how \n     close DoD is to a clean audit.\n\n\n                     Potential Conflict of Interest\n\n       97. Mr. Lynn, as a Senior Vice President of Government \n     Operations at the Raytheon Company, you were a registered \n     lobbyist until July 2008. Correct? How long were you a \n     registered lobbyist?\n       Answer: I was a registered lobbyist for Raytheon from July \n     2002 to March 2008.\n       98. Mr. Lynn, in his ``Blueprint for Change,'' President-\n     elect Obama promises to ``Shine Light on Washington \n     Lobbying.'' He promises to ``Enforce Executive Branch \n     Ethics'' and ``Close the Revolving Door.'' He promises: ``no \n     political appointees in an Obama-Biden administration will be \n     permitted to work on regulation or contracts directly and \n     substantially related to their prior employer for 2 years.'' \n     Raytheon is one of the big defense contractors. As Deputy \n     Secretary, Raytheon issues will surely come\n\n[[Page S2117]]\n\n     across your desk. If you have to recuse yourself from \n     important decisions, you would limit your effectiveness as \n     Deputy Secretary of Defense. How will you avoid this problem \n     for 2 years?\n       Answer: I have received a waiver of the ``Entering \n     Government'' restrictions under the procedures of the \n     Executive Order implementing the ethics pledge requirements. \n     The waiver, however, does not affect my obligations under \n     current ethics laws and regulations. Until I have divested my \n     Raytheon stock, which will be within 90 days of appointment, \n     I will take no action on any particular matter that has a \n     direct and predictable effect on the financial interests of \n     Raytheon. Thereafter, for a period of one year after my \n     resignation from Raytheon, I also will not participate \n     personally and substantially in any particular matter \n     involving Raytheon, unless I am first authorized to do so \n     under 5 C.F.R. Sec.  1A2635.502(d). In addition, for the one \n     year period covered by Section 502, I have agreed not to seek \n     a written authorization for the handful of issues on which I \n     personally lobbied over the past two years. If confirmed, I \n     pledge to abide by the foregoing provisions. I would add that \n     I have not been exempted from the other Executive Order \n     pledge requirements, including the ones that restrict \n     appointees leaving government from communicating with their \n     former executive agency for two years and bar them from \n     lobbying covered executive branch officials for the remainder \n     of the Administration.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. Lynn continues to defend straight pay, a policy \nthat Secretary Cohen said didn't exist back then. He said it was \nnecessary ``to ensure that contractors were paid on time.''\n  Well, can't you pay contractors on time by having invoices and all \nthe proper documentation to write even a $1 check? That is the \nstreamlining effect that former Secretary Cohen argued for in his \nfailed June 2, 1998 DRI legislative initiative.\n  I exchanged followup Q and A on these matters with Mr. Lynn on \nFebruary 5 and 6 this year, and I will include those letters in the \nrecord as well. As Chief Financial Officer at one of our biggest \ndepartments, Mr. Lynn signed the memo authorizing straight pay policy. \nIt was his policy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the followup documents be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                                  Washington, DC February 5, 2009.\n     Mr. William J. Lynn,\n     Senior Vice President, Raytheon Company, Arlington, VA\n       Dear Mr. Lynn: I am writing to follow-up on our recent \n     exchange of correspondence regarding your record as the Chief \n     Financial Officer (CFO) at the Department of Defense (DOD).\n       I respectfully request that you respond to the following \n     questions in writing:\n       (1) On February 2, 1998, when you were CFO, Secretary of \n     Defense Cohen asked the Senate for legal authority to pay \n     bills without receipts with no dollar limit. This proposal \n     was embodied in Section 401 of the Defense Reform Initiative \n     (DRI). What was your position on this legislative proposal?\n       (2) In a letter to you dated January 19, 1999, I expressed \n     grave concern about a DOD payment policy known as ``Straight \n     Pay.'' This policy was authorized by you in documents that \n     bear your signature. The purpose of my letter was to verify \n     the facts pertaining to this policy that was brought to my \n     attention by a Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) \n     employee, Your response to this letter is dated March 9, \n     1999. In your letter, you report that ``Straight Pay'' does \n     not exist. This is what you said: ``Straight Pay'' is not \n     used at our Columbus Center . . . `Straight Pay,' as it was \n     reported to you, does not exist at the Columbus Center.'' \n     Secretary Cohen made essentially the same statement in \n     response to questions I raised at a Budget Committee hearing \n     on March 2, 1999. He stated: ``there is no authorized \n     procedure called straight pay.'' In your February 3, 2009 \n     letter, by comparison, you provided a description of the \n     ``Straight Pay'' policy. Did ``Straight Pay'' exist at the \n     Columbus Center in 1998-99?\n       (3) How do you explain a DFAS Memo dated March 8, 1999 that \n     contains the following instructions: ``Due to concerns over \n     the use of the term `Straight Pay' and its connotation, we \n     must delete all references, to `straight pay' from the policy \n     and clarify that policy does not create an environment for \n     fraudulent payments. Terms such as unmatched disbursements or \n     direct disbursements were substituted.'' Did you instruct \n     DFAS to get rid of the term ``Straight Pay.''\n       (4) Do you believe unmatched disbursements were a \n     satisfactory outcome?\n       (5) One day after DFAS gave ``Straight Pay'' policy a new \n     name, you issued orders to keep the policy alive. Your memo \n     of March 9, 1999 actually re-authorized the policy for \n     another 90 days beyond the March 22, 1999 expiration date. Is \n     that true?\n       (6) When you were CFO, were you knowledgeable or aware of \n     the arbitrary allocation scheme used by DFAS at the Columbus \n     Center for making progress payments? That policy also had an \n     informal name. It was called ``bucket billing.'' Both the \n     GAO. and IG had conducted numerous audits and reviews of \n     these procedures and declared them to be illegal. If you knew \n     about these bill paying practices, what specific steps did \n     you take to correct the problem?\n       (7) I note that the waiver granted to you in connection \n     with President Obama's new ethics rules was co-signed by OMB \n     Director Orszag and Mr. Gregory B. Craig, Counsel to the \n     President. I understand that you have past associations with \n     Mr. Craig. Please characterize your relationship with Mr. \n     Craig?\n       (8) According to the Project on Government Oversight \n     (POGO), Raytheon is ``ranked #4 in a top 50 corrupt list'' of \n     government contractors. POGO reports numerous instances of \n     double billing on aircraft maintenance contracts, contractor \n     kickbacks, defective pricing, False Claims Act violations, \n     substitution/nonconforming products, violations of SEC rules, \n     etc. involving Raytheon. As the top Raytheon lobbyist, to \n     what extent did you know about or become involved with any of \n     these issues? Did you ever discuss any of these issues with \n     DOD officials or Members of Congress or congressional staff?\n       (9) In view of the fact that your nomination appears to be \n     inconsistent with President Obama's rules pertaining to the \n     ``Revolving Door Ban,'' do you belief you have compromised \n     any of your personal and/or professional values by accepting \n     it?\n       Your continuing cooperation in this matter would be greatly \n     appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles E. Grassley,\n                                                   Ranking Member.\n                                                 February 5, 2009.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: I am writing to respond to your \n     letter of February 5, 2009. Following my February 3, 2009 \n     letter, you asked nine additional questions.\n       (1) Although I took office as Under Secretary just before \n     the Defense Reform Initiative was submitted to Congress, I \n     did not participate in the development of Section 401. I do \n     not recall having taken a position on it. At this time, I \n     would not support a proposal that with no dollar limit would \n     allow the Defense Department to pay bills without a receipt.\n       (2) In your letter of January 19, 1999, you equated an \n     obligation to a contract, implying that ``Straight Pay'' \n     allowed payment without a valid contract. As I explained in \n     both my recent February 3, 2009 letter and the earlier March \n     9, 1999 letter, ``Straight Pay'' required that the Department \n     be in possession of a valid contract as well as a valid \n     invoice and a valid receiving report prior to payment being \n     authorized. If this three way match existed, the policy \n     allowed payment without a matching obligation in the \n     accounting records, with the proviso that the Military \n     Services update the accounting records to ensure that a valid \n     payment had been made. In short, ``Straight Pay'' did exist \n     at the Columbus Center in 1998-99, but the process was \n     different than the one you described in your January 19, 1999 \n     letter.\n       (3) I am not aware of the March 8, 1999 DFAS memo that you \n     referenced. To my knowledge, I did not sign or authorize it.\n       (4) Unmatched disbursements are not a satisfactory outcome. \n     They reflect the age and inadequacy of some of our finance \n     and accounting systems. This is one of the primary reasons \n     that I supported the modernization of our finance and \n     accounting infrastructure when I was Under Secretary in the \n     late 1990s and why I will continue to support that \n     modernization should I be confirmed as Deputy Secretary.\n       (5) As I stated in my February 3, 2009 letter, ``Straight \n     Pay'' was an attempt to strike the right balance between \n     meeting our obligations to pay on time and ensuring the \n     Department only paid vendors for what was actually received \n     under a valid contract. The 90-day extension of that policy \n     on March 9, 1999 was done because the backlog of unpaid \n     invoices remained at an unacceptable level.\n       (6) With regard to progress payments, I took steps to \n     ensure that payment procedures were tightened. In 1998, I \n     directed that on all new contracts, other than firm fixed \n     price contracts, the practice of prorating payments \n     proportionately to all accounting classification reference \n     numbers be discontinued. Effective August 31, 1998, the \n     Department began distributing progress payments on the basis \n     of the best available estimates of the specific work being \n     performed under the contract. Both the Office of the \n     Inspector General and the Office of the General Counsel of \n     the Department of Defense reviewed and approved the new \n     policy.\n        (7) I served on the staff of Senator Edward Kennedy in the \n     late 1980s with Gregory B. Craig, who is now Counsel to the \n     President.\n        (8) While at Raytheon, I did not participate in any of the \n     of the issues that you cite. Nor did I lobby on those issues \n     with either Defense Department officials or any Members or \n     staff in Congress.\n       (9) I am honored that President Obama nominated me to serve \n     as Deputy Secretary of Defense. If confirmed, I will serve \n     the Department and the nation to the best of my\n\n[[Page S2118]]\n\n     ability. It is fully consistent with my personal and \n     professional values to return to public service at this time.\n           Sincerely,\n     William J. Lynn III\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 2009.\n     Mr. William J. Lynn,\n     Senior Vice President,\n     Raytheon Company, Arlington, VA\n       Dear Mr. Lynn: I have reviewed your letter of February 5, \n     2009, in which you attempt to address the questions I raised \n     in a letter to you also dated February 5th.\n       I am baffled by some of your answers. You have answered \n     questions I did not ask; you have not answered questions I \n     did ask; and some of your answers appear to be incomplete as \n     follows:\n       First, in question #1, I asked you about your position on \n     Section 401 of Secretary Cohen's Defense Reform Initiative \n     presented to the Senate in February 1998. You responded as \n     follows: ``I did not participate in the development of \n     Section 401. I do not recall having taken a position on it. \n     At this time, I would not support a proposal that with no \n     dollar limit would allow the DOD to pay bills without a \n     receipt.'' In February 1998, you had been CFO for several \n     months. This issue fell directly under your purview. How \n     could you possibly avoid taking a position on an issue the \n     Secretary of Defense was urging the Senate to adopt? As the \n     Chief DOD lobbyist for Raytheon today, you say it was wrong. \n     My question is: As the DOD CFO back in 1998, why didn't you \n     know it was wrong and speak up?\n       Second, in question #2, I asked: ``Did `Straight Pay' exist \n     at the Columbus Center in 1998-99?'' You responded this way: \n     ``Straight Pay' did exist at the Columbus Center in 1998-99, \n     but the process was different than the one you described.'' \n     Your response today is a bit different from the one you \n     provided me in 1999. In early March 1999, both you and \n     Secretary Cohen reported to me that ``Straight Pay'' did not \n     exist. Period. This is what Secretary Cohen said in response \n     to my questions at a Budget Committee hearing on March 2, \n     1999: ``there is no authorized procedure called straight \n     pay.'' And he attributed that statement to you. You are \n     saying it existed but not exactly as I described it. I find \n     these explanations somewhat confusing. Even if I did not \n     describe it exactly right, it still existed. And this is why \n     I raised question #3.\n       Third, The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) \n     employees were providing me with documents that clearly \n     indicated that the ``Straight Pay'' did, in fact, exist.\n       DFAS employees even provided me with an elaborate set of \n     rules on how this policy was to be implemented. Then I \n     received a high-level DFAS memo that appeared to constitute a \n     direct order to suppress the policy, bury it, if necessary, \n     or re-name it. This memo, dated March 8, 1999, contained the \n     following instructions: ``Due to concerns over the use of the \n     term `Straight Pay' and its connotation, we must delete all \n     references to `straight pay' from the policy and clarify that \n     policy does not create an environment for fraudulent \n     payments. Terms such as unmatched disbursements or direct \n     disbursements were substituted.'' As you know, unmatched \n     disbursements--like ``Straight Pay''--leave the door wide \n     open to fraud and theft. But that is a separate issue. In \n     question #3, I asked: ``Did you instruct DFAS to get rid of \n     the term ``Straight Pay?'' You did not answer this question. \n     You responded by saying you are not aware of that memo and \n     did not sign it or authorize it. I will re-phrase the \n     question, because some high official was probably creating \n     pressure for this change. While CFO, did you ever issue any \n     instructions to DFAS or anyone else regarding use of the term \n     or words ``Straight Pay''?\n       Fourth, in question #5, I asked you if you approved and \n     signed documents authorizing ``Straight Pay.'' In your \n     response, you tell me why the policy was necessary but do not \n     accept direct responsibility for approving the policy. While \n     CFO, did you ever approve and sign documents authorizing \n     ``Straight Pay''?\n       Fifth, in question #6, I asked you about your knowledge of \n     the arbitrary allocation scheme--also known as ``Bucket \n     Billing''--used at the Columbus Center for making progress \n     payments on contracts. At the time, both the GAO and DOD IG \n     had declared that this policy was illegal. As you may \n     remember, I addressed this matter in great detail with your \n     predecessor, Mr. John Hamre. You now report that a new policy \n     was put in place on August 31, 1998. You also reported that \n     the IG reviewed and approved that policy. Having a new policy \n     is an important first step, but my question is this: Is the \n     new policy working as advertised? In 1999, did you follow-up \n     and check to see if payments were being posted to the correct \n     appropriation accounts?\n       Sixth, in question #7, I asked you about your association \n     with Mr. Gregory B. Craig, who was directly involved in the \n     review and approval of the waiver you were granted in \n     connection with President Obama's new ethics rules. I asked \n     this question: ``Please characterize your relationship with \n     Mr, Craig?'' You answered: ``I served with him on the staff \n     of Senator Kennedy in the late 1980s.'' Again, please \n     characterize your relationship with Mr. Craig? What \n     discussions took place between you and Mr. Craig regarding \n     this matter?\n       Seventh, I will re-phrase question #9 as follows: Do you \n     believe that your nomination is fully consistent with the \n     spirit and intent of the ``Revolving Door Ban'' in paragraphs \n     2 & 3 of Section 1 of the new rules?\n       I very much appreciate your patience and cooperation with \n     this matter.\n           Sincerely\n                                                 Charles Grassley,\n     Ranking Member.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 February 9, 2009.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: I am writing in response to your \n     letter of February 6, 2009. You asked some additional follow \n     up questions to your letters of February 3, 2009 and February \n     5, 2009.\n       (1) You asked about my position on Section 401 of the \n     Defense Reform Initiative in 1998. As I indicated, the \n     development of Section 401 took place before I took office as \n     Under Secretary in late 1997, so I was not engaged in the \n     process that led to the inclusion of Section 401 in the \n     Defense Reform Initiative. Further, Section 401 was dropped \n     before I ever had an opportunity to review or take a position \n     on the provision.\n       (2) You asked for further clarification on the issue of \n     ``Straight Pay'' at the Defense Finance and Accounting \n     Service (DFAS) Columbus Center. To my knowledge, ``Straight \n     Pay'' was an informal term used to describe a payment process \n     in the Air Force network. Your March 1999 letter and your \n     Budget Committee hearing question to Secretary Cohen used the \n     term ``Straight Pay'' differently, that is to describe the \n     pre-validation process used by the Mechanization of Contract \n     Administration System (MOCAS) at the Columbus Center. The \n     purpose of my response to your letter and Secretary Cohen's \n     response to your hearing question in 1999 was not to argue \n     over the term ``Straight Pay'', but rather to explain the \n     pre-validation process used at Columbus accurately and fully. \n     Specifically, we both described how the three-way match \n     procedures worked. They required that no payments could be \n     made without a valid invoice, a valid contract, and a valid \n     receiving report. If this three-way match existed, the policy \n     allowed payment without a matching obligation in the \n     accounting records, with the proviso that the Military \n     Services update the accounting records to ensure that a valid \n     payment had been made.\n       (3) As I wrote previously, I was not aware of the March 8, \n     1999 DFAS memo that DFAS employees provided to you. Nor do I \n     recall ever issuing instructions to DFAS or anyone else \n     regarding the use of the term ``Straight Pay''.\n       (4) You asked about documents that I signed authorizing \n     ``Straight Pay''. I am not aware of any official documents \n     that I signed that included the term ``Straight Pay''. I did, \n     however, approve and sign documents that authorized the \n     three-way match process described in my answer in paragraph 2 \n     above. These included the March 9, 1999 memo, to which you \n     referred in your February 5, 2009 letter. This memo re-\n     authorized a temporary increase in the threshold on new \n     contracts paid by the MOCAS system due to the backlog of \n     payments. The original authority for the temporary increase \n     in the threshold was a December 1998 memo, which I also \n     approved and signed.\n       (5) With regard to the new policy that I directed on \n     progress payments in 1998, I did follow up and found DFAS was \n     following the payment distribution instructions required by \n     that policy. It is my understanding that the policy remains \n     in practice today with some enhancements to further ensure \n     payment distribution is made in accordance with the contract.\n       (6) As I stated in my previous letter, Mr. Gregory Craig \n     and I were co-workers on Senator Kennedy's staff in the late \n     1980s. Over the ensuing decades, we have had only very few \n     contacts. Additionally, my contacts with the review and \n     approval of my waiver were not with Mr. Craig, but with his \n     colleagues in the White House Counsel's office, who conducted \n     the extensive analysis supporting the waiver. Ultimately, \n     this analysis was then reported and approved by Mr. Craig.\n       (7) I believe that my nomination is consistent with the \n     spirit and intent of President Obama's Executive Order. I, \n     like every nominee, am bound by the Order's provisions. \n     However, because of my previous work experience, I was \n     granted a waiver to a portion of Section 1, which is allowed \n     under Section 3 of the Order. The reasons for receiving the \n     waiver were described in a February 3, 2009 letter to you \n     from Mr. Peter Orszag, Director of OMB and Mr. Craig, White \n     House Counsel. Notwithstanding, I remain bound by the Order's \n     revolving door exit provisions as well as all other \n     provisions contained in the Order.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to respond to your questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              William J. Lynn III.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I believe this policy developed under Mr. Lynn's \nleadership was dangerous, misguided, and irresponsible. It demonstrated \na lack of sound business judgment. It may have been inconsistent with \nvarious provisions of law. Because don't the taxpayers expect you write \na check, you have a reason for writing it, you have an invoice or \nsomething that says you\n\n[[Page S2119]]\n\nowe X number of dollars? Straight pay left the taxpayers' hard-earned \nmoney vulnerable to fraud and theft, and we have had that.\n  I was not alone in this assessment. At my subcommittee hearing on \nSeptember 28, 1998, the Government Accountability Office witness said \nessentially the same thing. DFAS payment policies in Mr. Lynn's watch \nleft the door wide open to fraud.\n  For all these reasons, I have to say Mr. Lynn, as Chief Financial \nOfficer, did not do everything humanly possible to protect the \ntaxpayers' interests. When he pushed the straight pay policy and went \nsilent on pay-and-chase, he did not act in the public interest.\n  As Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Lynn was also supposed to do his part \nto develop and integrate a finance and accounting system that would \nallow the Department of Defense to produce a financial statement that \ncould earn a clean audit opinion. I know this is a massive and complex \nundertaking, but Mr. Lynn could have gotten the ball rolling in the \nright direction, even if he didn't get it under control.\n  I can guarantee one thing: The principle of straight pay was not \nconducive to the creation of an integrated accounting system. One of \nthe first steps in that process is to link obligations to \ndisbursements. Straight pay truncated that link and undermined \nintegration.\n  Although he claimed to have launched several important reform \ninitiatives, there appears to be little or no measurable progress \ntoward the goal of integration on his watch. In fact, his payment \npolicies probably took us in the wrong and opposite direction and had \nan opposite effect. The Department's books of account were a mess when \nMr. Lynn became Chief Financial Officer, they were a mess when he left, \nand I have a feeling they remain a mess today, with no fix in sight.\n  Congress passed the Chief Financial Officers Act in 1990 in an \nattempt to fix the problems in accounting of Government finances in \nevery department. Eighteen years after this legislation, the Department \nof Finance, as a whole, has yet to earn a clean audit.\n  Mr. Lynn should not be the only person held accountable for poor \naccounting at the Department of Defense. He was one of many individuals \nin a long line of Chief Financial Officers and Comptrollers who, for \nwhatever reason, were unsuccessful in solving the financial misstep at \nthe Defense Department. Mr. Hamre, his predecessor, used to say: \n``Fixing this problem is like changing a tire on a car going at 100 \nmiles per hour.''\n  I have shared some of my sentiments on Mr. Lynn's performance as \nChief Financial Officer. I hope these insights are helpful to my \ncolleagues before they vote yes or no on this nomination. If confirmed, \nwe hope he will do everything possible to protect our national \nsecurity. We hope he will protect the taxpayers' hard-earned money, and \nwe hope he will make sure the taxpayers' money is wisely spent and, \nmost importantly, spent according to law. We hope he will usher in a \nnew era of financial accountability at the Department of Defense. At \nthis point, we simply don't know what Mr. Lynn will do. I don't own \nthat crystal ball that would be necessary to make that determination. \nIt is all about the future, and that is relatively unknown. But we do \nknow something about what he did in the past as the Department of \nDefense Chief Financial Officer.\n  As Chief Financial Officer, he advocated very questionable accounting \npractices that obviously were not in the public interest. Writing a \ncheck in any department without knowing what that check is paying for \nis not in the public's interest. It is not a wise expenditure of public \nmoney. We need accounting systems that account for every dollar going \nout, having a purpose of a service or a product that it bought. I urge \nmy colleagues then to weigh those considerations in reaching a decision \non how to vote on the Lynn nomination.\n  Lastly, I wish to take a moment to thank the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee leadership, both Republican and Democratic, and their staff \nfor their patience on this issue. I appreciate the time Chairman Levin \nhas given me to discuss this nomination. I lay everything I have said \nbefore the Senate for consideration.\n  I have already sought permission to have some of these documents \nprinted in the Record, so I don't think I have to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Let me, first, thank Senator Grassley for his dedication to trying to \nchange the climate around here. He has been on the forefront. I happen \nto disagree with him on the conclusion he has reached--or apparently \nreached--relative to Mr. Lynn for reasons I will go into. Nonetheless, \nhe has been an advocate of reform and he continues to do that. I will \nexplain why I think, in this instance, his concerns do not fit the \nsituation.\n  In the first instance, when he suggested the President is changing \nthe rules as we go along by providing a waiver to Mr. Lynn as part of \nthe new Executive order, that is part of the Executive order.\n  Let's not change the rules during the game. That is part of the rule \nPresident Obama has adopted in the new Executive order. It has some \nvery stringent requirements. Part of them are waived by the President's \nOffice of Management and Budget--in this case, for reasons they gave. \nPart of the new rule is not waived, the critical postemployment \nprohibition that applies to Mr. Lynn. I think that for the reasons \ngiven by President Obama's Budget Director, the waiver is a legitimate \none, central in this case for the reasons given.\n  By the way, when we talk about waivers, this is not at all unique. \nMr. Lynn's situation is not in the least bit unique. Waivers have been \ngiven and provided in previous cases because senior officers have had \nexperience in the private sector. Secretary Gates was subject to the \nsame rule, subject to the same waiver requirement. Secretary Rumsfeld \nwas subject to the same waiver and the same waiver requirement, as were \nDeputy Secretary England and Secretary Wolfowitz. This has been a \ncommon practice. I don't think anybody in those cases, or in any other \ncase we know about, where either a waiver has been required or the \nwaiver provision has been applicable--we know of no situation where \nthere was a conflict of interest.\n  What President Obama has done is tighten the requirement. He also \nprovided for the possibility of a waiver for part or all of the new \nrequirement. Part of the new requirement has been waived by the new \nPresident, but to suggest that he simply has waived his new requirement \nis not accurate because part of it was not waived. The critical part \nnot waived is that the new officeholder, if confirmed--Deputy Secretary \nLynn--will be subject to the prohibition that he may not lobby anybody \nin the Government if he leaves before the administration finishes, nor \nmay he lobby anybody in the Department of Defense for a year after he \nleaves. These are very strict, new requirements that are not waived in \nthe case of Secretary Lynn. What has been waived by the administration \nis the other part of the Executive order. That is No. 1.\n  Senator Grassley has gone into a lot of technical arguments relative \nto Mr. Lynn when he previously served. I want to deal with that the \nbest we can.\n  These events took place 7 to 10 years ago, but they don't involve \nethics issues at all. They involve what Mr. Lynn said in letters \nrelative to certain accounting practices at the Department of Defense \nat that time. I have reviewed these answers, and the questions were \nvery appropriate questions asked by Senator Grassley. I commend him for \nasking the questions.\n  There were 4 separate letters to Mr. Lynn, with 30 detailed questions \nabout practices for validating vendor payments in certain parts of the \nDepartment of Defense more than 10 years ago. Mr. Lynn has responded to \nevery one of the letters Senator Grassley very appropriately wrote, and \nto each of his questions. It is my view, after reading all of the \nquestions and the answers, that while the vendor payments that were \ndescribed by Senator Grassley are real, No. 1, it is not fair to \nattribute those problems to Mr. Lynn. Secondly, the problems as \ndescribed by Mr. Lynn and the responses he gave were accurate.\n  First, the description was of the pay-and-chase--the way of paying \nvendors. That system was illegal. You cannot pay a vendor without \nchecking that invoice against the contract or against the receipt of \nthe goods. That was the\n\n[[Page S2120]]\n\nproblem with the pay-and-chase system. There was a failure to check the \ninvoice that came in, the document that the goods were received and \nthat they were proper under the contract. That system ended. It had to \nend; it was illegal. A new system was put into place where the vendor's \nbill was checked against the receipt of the goods and against the \ncontract. That is a very different deal. It is a legal system. Unlike \nso-called pay-and-chase, which preceded it, which was illegal, what \nSenator Grassley and others have described as a straight pay system was \nlegal. The problem is that it was a confusing name because it implied \nthat the previous system of not checking an invoice against the receipt \nof the goods or the contract continued, when it did not continue. It \nwas dramatically changed from something that was illegal to something \nthat was legal.\n  For instance, Senator Grassley, when he wrote Mr. Lynn back on \nJanuary 29, 2009, said:\n\n       Straight pay allowed the technician to ignore the warning \n     signals and make payments up to half a million dollars \n     without checking documentation.\n\n  That is not accurate. They had to check documentation. There were \nsome things they could not check because the systems are deficient at \nthe Department of Defense, including what is the original source of the \nmoney in the Defense Department's budget. Does it come from R or does \nit come from acquisition? That part, they still cannot check. Those \nsystems have been deficient, and continue to be, but with the help of \nthis body and hopefully real energy in the DOD, that can be corrected. \nWe all need that.\n  Senator Grassley has been in the forefront of trying to get these \nkinds of controls in place. I commend him for that. But it is not \naccurate to say that straight pay, so-called, which was the followup \nsystem, allowed these payments without checking documentation. That is \nwhat Mr. Lynn disagrees with. When you look at his answers, that is the \ndisagreement between Mr. Lynn's answers and what Senator Grassley \ndescribes as being accurate.\n  Part of the problem here, by the way, that Senator Grassley had is \nnot with Mr. Lynn, it is with Secretary Cohen. Repeatedly and \naccurately, Senator Grassley points to the action of then-Secretary of \nDefense Cohen, saying he didn't do this, and Mr. Lynn didn't change it, \nor Secretary Cohen didn't do something, and Mr. Lynn did not disagree. \nThe problem was with the Secretary of Defense, which is outlined by \nSenator Grassley, to the extent that it exists.\n  It is hard for me to believe Secretary Cohen would not be eligible to \nbe Secretary of Defense again or would not be confirmed unanimously by \nthis body. Yet the mistakes attributed to Mr. Lynn are also attributed \nto then-Secretary Cohen, for whom Mr. Lynn worked. But does anyone \nseriously suggest that if Secretary Cohen were reappointed as Secretary \nof Defense, we would not confirm Bill Cohen by a vote of 100 to 0?\n  So, Mr. President, without getting into a lot more detail--and these \nare incredibly complicated and detailed issues--let me summarize by \nsaying that the difference here has been described--there is a \ndifference over the description of a system of payment and the way in \nwhich Mr. Lynn describes it. When you look at his complete answers, it \nseems to me, there is a fair description of what the problem was.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for William \nLynn to be confirmed as Deputy Secretary of Defense. Bill has a \ncombination of experience and sound judgment. He worked here on Capitol \nHill as a significant policy aide to Senator Kennedy on the Armed \nServices Committee. He has been the comptroller of the Department of \nDefense. He has detailed and specific knowledge of the vast programs \nthat will be handed over to the DOD. He has also worked in industry. \nFrankly, the job of Deputy Secretary of Defense is a place in which all \nthese roads come together--the relationship with Capitol Hill, the \nrelationship with industry, and a detailed understanding and knowledge \nof the way the Pentagon really works from the inside, not from the \noutside.\n  He is uniquely situated to take on these daunting challenges that \nface us, at a time when we are engaged in two conflicts--Afghanistan \nand Iraq--and a continuing war against extremists across the globe and \nat a time when our budget is going to be challenged because of a \ndeclining economy in the United States and across the globe. The \ndifficult judgments that have to be made require the expertise and \nexperience Bill Lynn can bring and few can match.\n  One other thing that I think is particularly compelling about this \nnomination is the enthusiastic support of it by the Secretary of \nDefense, Bob Gates. There is no one in Government whom I admire more \nfor their patriotism, their sacrifice to the Nation, and their service. \nThe Secretary of Defense has made it very clear that he believes Bill \nLynn is someone whom he not only can work with, but he will aid him \nimmensely in his extraordinary challenges to face the threats I have \nalready illustrated. For me, Bob Gates's testimony and endorsement is \ncompelling evidence that this Senate should confirm Bill Lynn \nimmediately this afternoon.\n  As I mentioned before, Bill worked in the Department of Defense. He \nhas knowledge of the whole range of programs. That is absolutely \ncritical because he will have to make judgments about these programs to \nadvise the Secretary of Defense.\n  For his work at the Department of Defense--which has been talked \nabout this afternoon, but this wasn't mentioned--he received the Joint \nDistinguished Civilian Service Award from the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff. Again, the military understands not only the important \nduty he is performing but also, in their own conduct and affairs, \nunderstands the values of integrity, character, and commitment to the \nnational interest. He has won awards from the Army, Navy, and Air \nForce. He also received the 2000 Distinguished Federal Leadership Award \nfrom the Association of Government Accountants for his efforts to \nimprove defense accounting practices.\n  He also gained valuable experience within private industry. Again, \nBill is not unique in having an industry background. In fact, the \ncurrent Deputy Secretary of Defense, Gordon England, came from an \nindustry background. My observation of Secretary England is that his \nperformance has been outstanding, aided by the insight he has had into \nthe multibillion-dollar contracts that industry has with the Department \nof Defense, insight he has into the decisionmaking in corporate \nAmerica, insight he has into the way business is done in the defense \ncommunity. That has aided him, not disabled him, in doing an excellent \njob. Once again, Bill Lynn comes from a similar background. As Chairman \nLevin pointed out, the Secretary of the Navy, who I also believe has \ndone an outstanding job, also came from a background in the defense \nindustry.\n  This goes also to the other issue raised about the waiver. \nEssentially, Bill Lynn stands in the same shoes, I think, as Gordon \nEngland and others--ladies and gentlemen who worked in private industry \nbut recognized when they took the oath to serve the people in this \ncountry, they had only one boss--the people of the United States. They \nare committed to that duty.\n  Also, I think, frankly, the rules have been followed scrupulously by \nhis predecessors and will be followed by Bill Lynn regarding conflicts \nwith his previous employer. I believe he is going to err on the side of \ncaution when it comes to programs that may be under the purview of his \nprevious employer, or anyone else, because having gotten to know Bill, \nI understand he is not only a man of intelligence but a man of \ncharacter.\n  We have someone uniquely situated to begin to aid the Secretary of \nDefense in the important challenges before us: How do we create a \nstrategy of redeploying forces successfully out of Iraq? How do we \nincrease our presence in Afghanistan and help military and civilian \nagencies to deal with that troubling situation? How do we deal with \nissues of defense modernization? How do we prepare for longer term \nthreats? How do we continue to be active across the globe to, we hope, \npreempt terrorist activities, whether it be in the Near East, Far East, \nor anyplace on this globe?\n\n[[Page S2121]]\n\n  Again, Bill Lynn is superbly qualified to do this. He is a graduate \nof Dartmouth with a law degree from Cornell Law School, and a master's \nin Public Affairs from the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton--again, \nsuperb academic preparation and superb life preparation. He is someone \nwho has, again, the character and the insights to render remarkable \nservice to the Department of Defense.\n  I hope my colleagues will join with me in supporting this nomination, \nrounding out a team of excellent patriots and professionals in the \nDepartment of Defense. I must commend President Obama. He made a very \nsound, I won't say unusual, but unexpected announcement early on by \noffering the position of Secretary of Defense to Bob Gates. Bob served \nwith distinction under President Bush. President Obama recognized, \nfirst, the quality of this Secretary, Secretary Gates, and also the \nneed for continuity in the operations of the Department of Defense. \nThat was a strong not only signal of continuity but endorsement of the \nwork and effort of thousands and thousands of uniformed military \npersonnel and civilian employees in the Department of Defense. That \nchoice was amplified in his selection of Bill Lynn. Again, the \nendorsement of Secretary Gates speaks volumes about the team President \nObama has put together.\n  I hope at the conclusion of this debate, we could send a very strong \nvote of confirmation and confidence in the team that President Obama \nhas assembled--Secretary Gates, hopefully Deputy Secretary Lynn, and \nthe other members--because the tasks before them are, indeed, daunting \nand because their success will be our success.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I apologize to Chairman Levin. I had to \nleave the floor to attend a conference meeting on the stimulus bill \nbefore he finished his remarks.\n  I would like to rebut his remarks regarding Mr. Bill Lynn.\n  In regards to the Executive order on ethics, I agree President Obama \nis attempting to set high standards for executive branch appointees; \nhowever, giving special waivers to nominees such as Mr. Lynn water down \nthe spirit and authority of his own Executive order. I would ask \nPresident Obama: How many more waivers will you grant in the next 4 \nyears?\n  I say to Chairman Levin, you seemed to blame former Defense Secretary \nCohen for the financial troubles at DOD, not Mr. Lynn. I could not \ndisagree with you more on this issue. Chief Financial Officer Lynn was \nchiefly responsible for the policies and regulations governing \naccounting practices. His straight-pay policy went against all \ncommonsense accounting practices. DFAS technicians should not have paid \nbills like they did without first confirming that the proper \nobligations were in the books of account.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Inhofe pertaining to the introduction of S. 412 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask to speak as if in morning business \nand have the time counted against our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Ensign are printed to today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Nevada. I wish to \nspend just a few minutes. I am not going to talk for a long period of \ntime, and I will yield back my time.\n  I am extremely concerned with the nomination of Mr. Lynn. It has \nnothing to do with Mr. Lynn. Some can be critical of his time as \nComptroller. Some can be critical of some of the lack of forthrightness \nin some of the answers about the accounting and controlling and \nauditing systems in the Pentagon, and I think that is rightly so. We \nhad several hearings on IT improvements and waste in the contracting of \nIT through the Pentagon. We had several hearings in the last two \nCongresses about the waste in contracting. Mr. Lynn dealt with a large \namount of that.\n  Let that be as it may. The reason I stand to speak against his \nnomination is this is a nomination that is going to be the person who \nruns the day-to-day operation of the Pentagon. If you look at \nmanagement experience, what there has been in running an organization \nthat has 2.9 million employees--it is the largest component, even \nincluding mandatory programs, that we have.\n  It also is the area where we have some of the greatest amount of \nwaste. We had it during his tenure as Comptroller. We had it during the \nBush administration years. Why would we put someone into that position \nwho has not performed in a stellar fashion when given the authority to \nfix a lot of those problems before? Why would we put someone in charge \nwho is going to be handicapped? There is no question, given the waiver \nhe has received, he will be absolutely handicapped in all the \ncontracting that goes before the Pentagon.\n  Let me explain. His former company is one of the five largest defense \ncontractors in the country. It is not just the areas he has lobbied in \nthe past few years, such as the Aegis Ballistic Missile, the DDG-1000 \ndestroyer, the Excalibur precision-guided munitions, the Joint Land \nAttack Cruise Missile Defense Netted Sensor System and the Multiple \nKill Vehicle System, which comes to $41 billion, 10 percent of the \nPentagon's budget, but every other contract that has Raytheon as a \nsubcontractor from which he is going to have to recuse himself.\n  What he is going to be limited to is personnel matters and accounting \nmatters. He will not be able to make those decisions without first \ngetting a waiver to make them and then, if you are granting a waiver to \nmake the exception and make a decision, here is what is going to \nhappen.\n  Let me give the history of the tanker program in the United States. \nWe, first, had a contract let to Boeing, which was complicated by some \nvery bad acting on the part of Boeing and some Defense Department \nofficials, and it got thrown out.\n  We last had a contract for the tanker program that was awarded to \nEADS. There was a protest filed on it. It got thrown out.\n  Everything he is not involved with, Raytheon can file a protest that \nthey were excluded because the management chain was not the same. We \nhave created the basis for a new protest on everything Raytheon will \nnot win in the future. If Raytheon does win a contract, we have created \na protest for everyone who wasn't Raytheon to protest because there \nis a conflict of interest.\n\n  Ask yourself, in this dire economic time we are in, with the largest \nagency we have, why we would put somebody in that position who is going \nto be--for at least 1 year and probably for 2, if we wanted to \nethically look at it--totally out of the realm of the most important, \noutside our military men and women, most important aspect of the \nPentagon, which is purchasing, contracting defense weapons systems.\n  We are setting a man in a position. It is no reflection on him. He is \nvery knowledgeable. He has been a good public servant. We are putting \nhim in a position to fail. We have guaranteed that contracting will not \ngo smoothly at the Pentagon because we have created two new bases for \nprotests over contracts. We can go through all the contracting, and it \nis going to be raised--and rightly so. There is going to be a \nlegitimate protest on both sides of these issues that is going to delay \nthe ability of the American people to\n\n[[Page S2122]]\n\ncontract for things we should be contracting for. More importantly, it \nis going to significantly raise the cost.\n  The third point I would make is, because he is going to have to \nexclude himself from the vast majority of decisions in contracting and \npurchasing, the very position he is meant to fill, to run the day-to-\nday operations, means Secretary Gates is going to have to run the \noperations. If he has to run the operations himself, why does he need a \nDeputy Secretary of Defense?\n  President Obama, I think rightly, has asked Secretary Gates to stay \non. I think the continuity with that was great. I am sorry he didn't \nask others to stay on until we got past this period of time. In spite \nof the good will of Mr. Lynn, a man of character, a man of integrity, \nwe have set him up to fail.\n  I have no doubt he is going to be placed in that position today when \nwe vote. But we ought to think. The biggest problem we have with our \nbody, in terms of what we do, is we do not think long run. We think \nshort term. What we have done is totally handicapped him, but we are \nalso going to handicap our military.\n  This is not a time we should be doing that. We should be creating a \nstreamlined procurement process that rebuilds the procurement offices, \nwhich need to be rebuilt--that has no question about the authority of \nthe Deputy Secretary of Defense to make solid, fair, clear, and \ndecisive actions and decisions. What we are going to do is ensure that \ndoes not happen.\n  I thought it was interesting that Senator McCain's main point was he \ndid not have the managerial experience to do this. Senator McCain is \ngoing to vote for him because he has such high regard for Secretary \nGates. But think about that statement. He does not have the managerial \nexperience to run a 2.9 million individual organization, and he is \nhandicapped. We are going to handicap him so he meets the ethical \noutlines President Obama so rightly has put in place.\n  I think it is a bad decision. I think it is a wrong decision. Once \nagain, the consequences for that will be inefficiency, ineffectiveness, \nand a greater cost for this country. Anytime we have a greater cost on \nanything now, it goes directly to our kids and our grandkids.\n  I hope my associates in the Senate will give a rethought to whether \nwe ought to handicap this man this way. Surely somebody can fill the \nbill and let Mr. Lynn wait a year and then come in and do what he wants \nto do and what President Obama wants him to do.\n  Again, we will make a serious mistake if we approve him, not only for \nus, not only for our kids but for him as he attempts to run the largest \norganization in the world.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise in support of the confirmation \nof William J. Lynn to be the next Deputy Secretary of Defense.\n  I recently had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Lynn and discuss many \nof the important defense challenges that face our Nation. I came away \nfrom that meeting duly impressed by his dedication to seek new and \ninnovative solutions to many of these issues.\n  Throughout his career, he has demonstrated a singular devotion to our \nnational defense. In the early 1980s he was the executive director of \nthe Defense Organization Project at the Center for Strategic and \nInternational Studies. This organization was a major catalyst for the \nGoldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 which transformed and modernized the \nDepartment of Defense. Those reforms are still the foundation from \nwhich the Department operates today.\n  As a senior fellow at the National Defense University, Mr. Lynn \ncontinued his work collecting ideas and crafting solutions to solve a \nmyriad of national defense issues. Then, prior to entering the \nDepartment of Defense, he worked for 6 years as the military \nlegislative assistant to my good friend and colleague, Senator Kennedy, \na senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  In 1993, Mr. Lynn joined the Defense Department and served 4 years as \nthe director of program analysis and evaluation in the Office of the \nSecretary of Defense. There he oversaw the Department's ever-evolving \nstrategic planning progress. He was then appointed as the Under \nSecretary of Defense Comptroller where he served 4 years providing \ncandid advice to the Secretary of Defense on all budgetary and fiscal \nmatters.\n  His most recent endeavor was as senior vice president at Raytheon \nCompany where he focused his energy and expertise on strategic \nplanning. In this role, he ensured that a major American corporation \ndeveloped and produced technologies that met the conflicts of today and \nthe dangers of tomorrow.\n  During these challenging times, it is essential we have leaders in \nour Defense Department with strength of purpose and a vision for \ninnovation. William Lynn is such a leader. I am proud to pledge my \nsupport and look forward to working with him to create smart and \neffective solutions that support the brave men and women who defend our \nNation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, consistent with my practice of deferring \nto Presidents on executive branch nominations, I will vote to confirm \nWilliam Lynn to be Deputy Secretary of Defense. I do have some \nconcerns, however, about Mr. Lynn's longtime service as a lobbyist for \na major defense contractor. I hope that, if confirmed, Mr. Lynn will \ntake seriously the need for serious reforms to address the Department's \ntroubling record of financial mismanagement.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on \nthe confirmation of the nomination of William J. Lynn occur at 5 p.m. \ntoday, with the other provisions of the previous order remaining in \neffect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to support the \nconfirmation of Mr. William J. Lynn, III, for the important position of \nDeputy Secretary of Defense. He will be the chief deputy to the \nSecretary of Defense, the largest Department of Government, with great \nresponsibilities for weapons systems and to our men and women who serve \nin harm's way.\n  If confirmed, Mr. Lynn would be the thirtieth deputy secretary. I \nfirmly believe that he is uniquely qualified for the position and would \nserve well in that post. He served as Under Secretary of Defense-\nComptroller during President Clinton's administration from 1997 to \n2001. He was widely commended for providing strong managerial emphasis \non improving the Department's financial management.\n  In addition to his service as comptroller, he has served as Director \nfor Program Analysis and Evaluation and as Assistant Secretary of \nDefense for the Budget. He has broad experience with many of the core \nissues within the Department of Defense.\n  My meeting with him was positive and I have heard people comment on \nhis strong character. Many of the issues that come before the \nDepartment of Defense are contentious. Rather than basing decisions on \nmerit, people often try to infect those decisions with politics. I \nbelieve he will stand firm to ensure that our men and women in uniform \nget the best equipment and training for the best value. This type of \njudgement is a critical attribute for a deputy. If the deputy is weak; \nif he compromises or tries to play politics with a defense contractor, \nor allows a Member of Congress or the executive branch to have undue \ninfluence, he can damage the reputation of the Department of Defense. \nMore importantly, such influence can prevent our servicemembers from \ngetting the best equipment at the best value in a timely manner.\n  He also has 6 years of experience working in the defense industry. He \nwell understands the challenges facing both the defense industry and \nthe Department of Defense.\n  I am convinced his experience in DOD, coupled with his experience in \nthe defense industry, makes him a nominee we can support for this very \nimportant position.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for his \nstatement. It is a very important and\n\n[[Page S2123]]\n\nvaluable statement. He is a highly valued member of the Armed Services \nCommittee and comments coming from him will have an impact on this \nbody. I am grateful.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof William J. Lynn, III, of Virginia, to be Deputy Secretary of \nDefense?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof William J. Lynn, III, of Virginia, to be Deputy Secretary of \nDefense?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly. I know my friend \nfrom Oklahoma is going to come back and speak, but I wish to make a \ncouple comments. I know there has been a deal reached on the stimulus \nbill. I wish to make a couple comments about that.\n  We have not received the bill. There are rumors going around about \nthis, that, and the other. One of the details that seems to be coming \nout is that the housing portion of the stimulus bill has been cut down \ndramatically.\n  I had an alternative to the stimulus bill that focused on housing, to \na great degree, and also targeted some tax cuts to families and small \nbusinesses to create jobs. The reason we focused a great deal of it on \nthe housing problem was because the housing problem is the cancer that \nhas dragged the rest of the economy down. It has spread throughout the \nrest of the economy.\n  As any person in the medical field understands that if you just treat \nthe symptoms and not the underlying cause, the patient gets sicker and \nsicker. Unfortunately, the President is talking about fixing housing \nbut certainly not at this point.\n  It is regrettable that we didn't take a big portion of the money that \nis being spent in this stimulus bill and actually fix housing. It is \nvery disturbing because we are going to spend $800 billion and who \nknows how much more in order to fix the housing problem. We are running \nup debt after debt on our children. This is their credit card we are \nrunning up, and they are going to have to pay higher taxes into the \nfuture.\n  Once we get the bill, we are going to have to take a close look over \nthe next day or two and go through it. It is very disappointing, it \nappears, that this stimulus bill is going to do very little, if \nanything, to fix the housing problem in the United States. My home \nState of Nevada leads the country in foreclosures. We understand what \nother States are starting to go through or just recently have been \ngoing through, and how severely it affects the economy. It is \nunfortunate that the stimulus bill that is supposed to fix the economy \nis not addressing the No. 1 problem we have in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/11/senate-section/article/S2123-4", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2123-S2124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LAS VEGAS TRAVEL\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, it seems as though reason and common sense \nare once again being tossed aside. I am referring to the recent remarks \nby President Obama when he singled out one of the most premiere cities \nin the world, Las Vegas.\n  When it comes to convenience and affordability, very few, if any, \nplaces in the world can compare to Las Vegas. It is home to more than \n140,000 hotel rooms, millions of feet of meeting space, and a central \ngeographic location that makes it easy for employees from around the \ncountry to come to meet.\n  It is no wonder so many businesses decide to have their conventions \nin Las Vegas. It is more than convenience, though. Las Vegas offers a \nvalue that is unique. For instance, the average hotel room today in Las \nVegas is $119 a night. That is why I find it disturbing that Las Vegas \nis being singled out.\n  It is more than that. Take Goldman Sachs as one example. First, it \ngoes without saying that all companies that are receiving TARP funds \nmust be responsible and not waste precious taxpayer dollars. Because of \nrecent criticism, Goldman Sachs announced that it was moving a 3-day \nconference from Las Vegas to San Francisco. To do this though, they had \nto pay a $600,000 cancellation fee, re-route flights, and re-book the \nsame trip in another city, which is even more expensive than Las Vegas.\n  I ask, is that common sense? Let me repeat this. They had to pay more \nthan a half million dollars in cancellation fees, re-route flights, and \nre-book the same trip in another, more expensive city. For what? So \nthat Goldman can promote a false sense that it was spending the \ntaxpayers' money more wisely. This is ridiculous. This is what the \nAmerican people are sick of.\n  Is San Francisco a more affordable city than Las Vegas? Actually, it \nis much more expensive. I will shoot this straight. What Goldman Sachs \ndid was purely a phony public relations gimmick, but it is not fooling \nanyone. The conference they booked in Las Vegas is still taking place. \nNow it is just much more expensive. This makes no sense at all. So \nlet's cut to the chase.\n  Wherever these meetings take place, business takes place. Let me give \nyou an example. The Consumer Electronics Show, known as CES: This is an \nannual business meeting in Las Vegas. CES attendees come to Las Vegas \nfrom over 140 countries around the world. They can conduct a year's \nworth of business\n\n[[Page S2124]]\n\nin one location, minimizing travel and saving energy in the process.\n  During the Consumer Electrons Show, approximately 1.7 million \nmeetings are conducted. Transactions are ordered, commerce is buzzing, \nand the entrepreneurial spirit of business flourishes. This is economic \nactivity that extends beyond whichever city serves as the host.\n  It benefits all of us when an opportunity for business growth and \nproductivity takes place. So let's not lose sight of this fact, \nespecially now. Business meetings are an important tool. Let's make \nsure we do not leave common sense off the agenda.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/11/senate-section/article/S2124-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RETIREMENT OF GUY ROCHA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Guy Rocha, who \nretired from his post as Nevada State archivist on February 2 exactly \n28 years to the day from the time he assumed this position. He began as \nthe youngest State archivist in the Nation. At this time, only the New \nHampshire and Maryland State archivists have served longer than him. \nHis exceptional archival and research abilities have earned him an \nimpressive reputation and have made him an invaluable asset to the \nState of Nevada.\n  Guy Louis Rocha was born on September 23, 1951. He grew up in Las \nVegas and later moved to Reno. His first job with the State was with \nthe Nevada Historical Society in Reno in 1976. He was appointed to be \nthe State archivist in 1981. As the State archivist, Guy was \nresponsible for managing Nevada's historically valuable records dating \nall the way back to 1851. For his longtime service, he received the \nAward of Merit for Leadership in History from the American Association \nfor State and Local History.\n  Above all, Guy is known for his love of truth. He commonly corrects \nthe inaccuracies of reporters and journalists. For 12 years he has \nwritten the ``Historical Myth a Month'' column for Sierra Sage, and \nsince 2000 he has written a biweekly column in Reno Gazette-Journal. \nFor his work in debunking popular Nevada myths he has come to be known \nas the ``myth-buster.''\n  His research expertise and impartiality have even been called upon to \nprovide historical evidence in settling legal disputes. In addition to \nhis archival duties, he has authored two books and many articles and \nbook reviews and he has served as a rotating host for Reno's National \nPublic Radio show ``High Desert Forum.'' Guy also owns a production \ncompany that produces historical documentaries.\n  Guy Rocha has been rightly called a ``State treasure.'' His \ncontributions as the State archivist, as an historian, and as a writer \nform an impressive legacy to be honored by current and future \ngenerations. All Nevadans have reason to be proud of Guy Rocha, and I \nknow I join them in congratulating him on a well-earned retirement from \nhis duties as Nevada State archivist.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/11/senate-section/article/S2124-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO GARY AND JONATHAN HARRIS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to two \nheroic soldiers of the U.S. Army from my home Commonwealth of Kentucky, \nGary and Jonathan Harris. Father and son, each was awarded the Silver \nStar for valorous acts in two separate wars.\n  The Silver Star is the Nation's third-highest award for gallantry in \naction against an enemy of the United States. Those rare few who \nreceive it do so because of their display of selfless sacrifice and \nunparalleled courage under fire.\n  Jonathan Harris, a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter pilot holding the rank \nof chief warrant officer 2, came under attack near Gardez, Afghanistan, \non July 2, 2008, while attempting to transport soldiers. His Blackhawk \nwas attacked by the enemy with rocket-propelled grenades and anti-\naircraft gun systems. Jonathan was able to relocate and land the \nburning helicopter in a nearby field and safely evacuate the \npassengers. He then contacted another helicopter to extract his crew.\n  During the evacuation, while helping escort his wounded fellow \nsoldiers to the new helicopter, Jonathan exposed himself to gunfire \nwhile protecting his wounded men and killing at least one attacker. \nOnly after every member of the crew, ground forces, and extraction team \nwere safely onboard did CW2 Jonathan Harris himself get into the \nhelicopter. Because of these heroic deeds, Jonathan Harris is the first \naviator to receive the Silver Star since the Vietnam war.\n  Gary Harris, Jonathan's father, was a staff sergeant serving in \nVietnam when he performed the acts of gallantry that would earn him the \nsame medal as his son's. Gary was a squad leader on August 15, 1969, \nwhen he and his fellow soldiers came under intense mortar and rocket \nfire while on combat patrol. He instructed his men to return fire and \nmoved them into a more strategic position.\n  During the battle, Gary ran across the field of combat to assist \nmedics while ignoring the risk to his own life from the enemy's \ngunfire. He helped transport the wounded to the medical-evacuation \nhelicopter, saving the lives of many.\n  SSG Gary Harris received his original Silver Star in the mail, never \nhaving the benefit of a formal ceremony--until now. This past November, \nGary Harris was honored at a ceremony in Fort Campbell, KY., while \nJonathan Harris received his award at the Combined Joint Task Force-101 \nHeadquarters in Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan. They were able to view \neach other's ceremonies via video teleconference. At his ceremony, Gary \nHarris also received the Bronze Star Medal for his meritorious service \nin Vietnam as well as the Silver Star.\n  As is typical of so many of the brave men and women in uniform I have \nhad the honor to meet over the years, both the father and the son \ninsist that their own actions are not particularly remarkable. Each was \nquick to point to the other as more worthy of admiration and respect.\n  ``For me, I feel like my grandfathers and my dad, those are the true \nheroes,'' said Jonathan Harris. ``I would like to think that something \nwas passed on to me.''\n  Gary, on the other hand, recognized the value of the strong bond his \nson had with his fellow soldiers. ``These guys really stick together,'' \nhe said. ``We did the same thing, but I don't think we were near as \ncohesive a group as they are. They are really gung ho about taking care \nof each other. . . . I know what it is like, every day facing death. It \njust tears your nerves all to pieces for a while.''\n  Gary and Jonathan Harris are excellent examples of the brave and \ndedicated soldiers that make America's Armed Forces the best in the \nworld. And clearly there is a strong sense of duty, honor and love of \ncountry that runs in the Harris family and has been passed on from \nfather to son. Their spirit of service represents the very best of what \nKentucky has to offer our great Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing SSG Gary \nHarris and CWO Jonathan Harris for the many sacrifices they have made \nto our country. Kentuckians everywhere are honored to know and love \nsuch brave heroes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/11/senate-section/article/S2124-3", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2124-S2125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I call this body's attention to the recent \ndevelopments in Iraq. Last month, Iraqis went to the polls to vote in \nthe second provincial election since the hand-over of power in 2004. \nElections were conducted peacefully under the watchful eyes of Iraqi \nsecurity forces, and the results were quickly certified by the United \nNations.\n  This peaceful expression of political will is yet another \ndemonstration of political progress in Iraq. Less than 2 years after \nsome were declaring the war lost and the surge a failure, violence has \ndeclined, and the world--most importantly the Arab world--saw Iraqis \npeacefully voting, their security ensured by an increasingly competent \nIraqi army and police.\n  Not only was the election process successful, the results also merit \nattention. The Iraqi people voted in favor of secular parties competing \nwith the Iranian-backed religious parties. These results in many ways \nrepresent a remarkable change from the 2005 provincial elections that \nstrengthened many extremist and foreign-backed parties opposed to the \ncentral government. Sunnis, who largely boycotted the 2005 elections, \nparticipated broadly in January's election. Their involvement should \nenhance national reconciliation and bolster a more moderate and diverse \ngovernment representative of the Iraqi people.\n\n[[Page S2125]]\n\n  This progress is reversible. A lot rests on whether the President \nlistens to his generals in the coming weeks and months or whether he \nbows to liberal interest groups and his campaign rhetoric and initiates \na premature retreat. But this is an important sign of what our soldiers \nand the Iraqi people have worked so hard to achieve. Again, in 2 years \nsince the surge began, and now that it has been over for 6 months, we \nhave seen a constant decrease in violence, increased capabilities by \nthe Iraqi government and military, and now an election where the Iraqi \npeople largely chose moderate parties over extremist ones.\n  Unfortunately, the media devoted little attention to the success of \nthese peaceful elections, just as they have neglected many of the noble \nefforts of our men and women in uniform. I recently received an email \nfrom a constituent whose brother-in-law is currently serving in the \n10th Combat Support Hospital at Ibn Sina Hospital, Baghdad. In the \nbuilding that used to provide health care to Saddam's family and the \nBaathist elite, these servicemen and women provide some of the best \ncare in the country to all types of patients, from Iraqi children \nburned by household kerosene lamps to American soldiers with traumatic \ninjuries. Their hard work and the self-sacrifice of all who serve in \nIraq has contributed to the dramatic progress made in Iraq.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/11/senate-section/article/S2125-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2125-S2126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009\n\n\n                 Community Orienting Policing Services\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Mikulski, the \nchairwoman of the Commerce, Justice, and Science, CJS, Appropriations \nSubcommittee, and Senator Klobuchar in a colloquy about the importance \nof the Community Orienting Policing Services, COPS, grant program. I \nwould first like to thank my friend from Maryland for her tireless work \nand leadership on this bill. I know Senator Klobuchar and I and many \nothers are very thankful that the Appropriations Committee included \nfunding for the COPS Universal Hiring Program in this bill.\n  It is important now more than ever that we support our State and \nlocal law enforcement agencies that are on the front lines in combating \ncrime. With unemployment on the rise and tax revenues plummeting, the \nconditions are ripe for crime rates to climb again. States and \nmunicipalities are being forced to slash their budgets, including \ncritical funding for police, who will need to cut their already \ndepleted ranks even further without help. As crime escalates, there \nwill be fewer officers and resources to protect our families and \ncommunities, unless we act now.\n  Providing timely funding for the COPS Hiring Program will not only \nhelp to address vital crime prevention needs but will also have an \nimmediate and positive impact on the economy by allowing State and \nlocal police forces to quickly fill vacancies and hire new officers and \nstaff. In police hiring, nearly 100 percent of the money goes directly \nto job creation. These are good, middle-class jobs for middle-class \npeople, and they can be filled immediately. These are often jobs for \npeople who live in the hardest hit communities and will spend their \nmoney close to home.\n  Eliminating the 25-percent nonfederal match requirement, as the House \nbill does, will ensure that funds get to State and local law \nenforcement fast, meaning that law enforcement officers can be hired \nfast, without putting a new burden on states and localities that are \nalready strapped during this time of financial distress. The match \nrequirement could cause strained States and localities to decline COPS \nfunding they would otherwise take, meaning fewer jobs would be created.\n  In its first hearing of the new Congress, the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee received testimony from police chiefs and former Justice \nDepartment officials who explained that helping our local police during \nthis economic downturn is needed now more than ever to keep America \nsafe and keep our economy moving. Waiving the nonfederal match \nrequirement in the economic recovery and reinvestment package will \nfurther ensure that police forces will be able to quickly refill their \nranks and get more cops on the beat.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator from Vermont working with me to \nrestore funding for this important program. We have worked together in \nthe fight to turn back the cuts made by the previous administration to \nFederal resources that assist State and local communities in fighting \nviolent crime. I know all too well the importance of the COPS Hiring \nProgram and share your concerns about the effect of the economic \ndownturn on our neighborhoods. We need to make sure those on the blue \nline have a full team to combat increased crime in communities. My \nsubcommittee recognizes that need, which is why we put $3.5 billion \ntotal for State and local law enforcement activities. This includes $1 \nbillion for COPS hiring grants, for which we waived the salary cap for \nhiring or rehiring career law enforcement officers and civilian public \nsafety personnel.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I thank Chairwoman Mikulski and the Senator from \nVermont. As we work toward economic recovery, ensuring the safety of \nAmerica's communities is a critical component to economic stability and \ngrowth. Local governments across the country are facing extraordinary \nbudget shortfalls necessitating cutbacks in services, programs, and \npersonnel. I have heard from police in my State how drastically the \nsubstantial decline in Federal funding for State and local law \nenforcement has affected them. The financial situation in our country \nis dire and requires us to do everything we can to help our struggling \npolice forces so they can protect our neighborhoods and communities.\n  Apart from the program's benefit to community safety, the COPS Hiring \nProgram has obvious and important economic value. All of the funding \ngoes directly to pay the salaries of officers hired to work in police \ndepartments across the country. Moreover, many neighborhoods in inner \ncities and rural towns throughout America that were once crime-ridden \nand depressed have flourished in the nineties and in this decade, \ncreating businesses, increasing value, and powering local economies. \nMaintaining a strong community police presence can allow us to protect \nthese economic gains.\n  With the rising unemployment rate and the foreseeable increase in \ncrime, we cannot afford the continuing depletion of the ranks of our \nState and local law enforcement officers, nor can we ask them to \noperate without the resources needed to do the job effectively. Waiving \nthe match requirement, as the House has done, will ensure that all \nStates and localities will be able to afford and accept the COPS \nfunding which is so badly needed.\n  No city or State has been spared from this recession. I know the \nchairwoman and the Senator from Vermont understand the importance of \nensuring the COPS funding is as accessible as possible and have \nwitnessed the need in their own States as well.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator from Minnesota is right that this is an \nissue in Maryland, as well as nationwide. As the economic recovery \npackage moves to conference, we will work to ensure mechanisms are in \nplace for this critical program to be quickly and effectively \nimplemented and accessible to those in need of assistance.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank Chairwoman Mikulski and Senator Klobuchar. I am \nhopeful that as the economic recovery and reinvestment plan moves \nforward that we may work together to see if this important issue can be \naddressed in conference.\n\n\n              victims' compensation and assistance grants\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to join Senator Mikulski, the chairwoman of the \nCommerce, Justice, and Science, CJS, Appropriations Subcommittee, in a \ncolloquy about the importance of including additional funding to States \nfor victims' compensation and assistance in the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act of 2009. I would first like to thank my friend from \nMaryland, who has worked so hard for the success of this bill. I \ncommend her for fighting to include and maintain vital funding to \nsupport some of the most vulnerable Americans today, who need our help.\n  During the past year, victim service professionals have seen a clear \nincrease in victimization and victim need. The National Crime Victim \nHelpline has experienced a 25-percent increase in calls,\n\n[[Page S2126]]\n\nas job losses and economic stress translate into increased violence in \nthe home and in our communities. The shortage of affordable housing and \nrising unemployment are causing victims to require longer stays in \nemergency shelters. The increasing unemployment rate also means victims \nare less likely to have insurance to cover their crime-related \nexpenses. In addition to significant State and county budget cuts, \ncorporate and individual donations are decreasing. Across the board, \nvictim service providers are strapped for funding.\n  As the Senate considers extraordinary legislation to address the \ncurrent economic crisis, I believe it is imperative for the record to \nreflect the intent behind the provisions included in this legislation. \nTo ensure that there is no doubt about what we intended, I ask my \nfriend from Maryland whether it is her understanding that the funding \nincluded for State victims' compensation and assistance programs would \nbe in addition to any funding states receive from their annual Victims \nof Crime Act, VOCA, Grants in the 2009 and 2010 appropriations bills?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I would say to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nthat is what we intend.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator. It is not the Senate's intent to \ndeduct the funding for victims compensation included in the economic \nrecovery package from the grant money they would receive from regular \nVOCA formula grants. Through this bill, we intend to provide extra \nfunding for compensation programs, to pay more costs for victims' \nrecovery.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. That is correct as well. The funding I included in the \nCJS portion of economic recovery package for crime victim compensation \nprograms will be in addition to their annual VOCA grants, and will not \nbe deducted from their annual VOCA grants.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the chairwoman of the CJS Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Senator Mikulski, for engaging in this colloquy. And I \nthank her for working with me to include victim services in the \neconomic recovery legislation, which will help ensure that those \nalready victimized by crime are not also victims of our economic \ncrisis.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I commend this body for including \nprovisions in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to \nenergize the fledgling green economy. While I am concerned by the \nenormous cost of this bill and lack of offsets, I recognize the need \nfor urgent action as we strive to keep and create jobs for those who \nare suffering because of our failing economy.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced the Community Revitalization Energy \nConservation Act, S. 222, as part of my E4 Initiative aimed at fueling \njob creation and spurring economic development. I am very pleased that \nso much of what I proposed in this bill has been included in the \neconomic recovery package. The economic recovery legislation passed by \nthe Senate includes an increase for the bond limit for the Qualified \nEnergy Conservation Bond program from $800 million to $3.2 billion, \nmore than a 300 percent increase. While I proposed increasing the \nprogram to $3.6 billion, I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee \nfor including such a significant increase.\n  The second component of my Community Revitalization Energy \nConservation Act would boost job growth and help businesses and \nhomeowners go green by expanding the types of projects that are \neligible for the Qualified Energy Conservation Bond program, which was \nestablished by Congress last fall. I am pleased the Senate adopted my \namendment making this change as part of the economic recovery package.\n  Business and labor leaders and others in Wisconsin have told me about \nthe tremendous potential for energy efficiency retrofits to generate \nmore green-collar jobs. And already, Wisconsin communities are \nbeginning to pursue these improvements. My amendment will allow \nWisconsin to launch programs--modeled after Milwaukee's proposed Me2 \nprogram--throughout the State by utilizing the tax credit bonds \nallocated to Wisconsin under the Qualified Energy Conservation Bond \nprogram.\n  My amendment specifically ensures that States and local governments \ncan increase the number of building retrofits by eliminating \nsignificant financial barriers facing homeowners and businesses \ninterested in making energy efficiency and conservation improvements. \nIt does this by allowing energy efficiency projects to be performed as \npart of a ``green community program'' using grants, loans, or other \nrepayment mechanisms, such as periodic fees included on a utility bill \nor municipal bill. By using utilities as intermediaries, States and \nlocalities can ensure homeowners and businesses do not incur upfront \ncosts and can gradually pay back the costs of the energy efficiency \nretrofits through their electricity or water bills at a rate that \nreflects energy savings. For example, if a monthly energy bill before \nenergy efficiency improvements is $150 and with improvements the energy \ncosts are down to $110, then at most a homeowner or business would pay \n$40 monthly towards paying off the costs of the energy efficiency \nbuilding retrofits.\n  Presently, buildings account for 40 percent of total U.S. energy \nconsumption and 70 percent of U.S. electricity consumption so there are \nsignificant gains to be made with energy efficiency. Projects that \ncould qualify for the funding include heat-saving measures like \ninsulation, electricity-saving measures like lighting and appliances, \nwater-saving measures like low-flow shower heads and toilets, renewable \nenergy generating devices like photovoltaic solar installations, storm \nwater management like rain barrels, or other measures that also result \nin reduced energy use.\n  My amendment will allow Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds to \nsupport these partnerships among cities, utilities, homeowners, and \nbusinesses to make energy efficiency improvements within more people's \nreach and put Americans to work.\n  I thank Senator Debbie Stabenow for cosponsoring this amendment, and \nI appreciate the endorsements from the Air Conditioning Contractors of \nAmerica, American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, Apollo \nAlliance, National Electrical Contractors Association, National SAVE \nEnergy Coalition, and the Plumbing-Heating-Cooling Contractors-National \nAssociation.\n  I am pleased my provision was included, offering another opportunity \nto help jumpstart the green economy and bring relief to our citizens as \nwe reinvest in America. I intend to work with conferees to ensure the \nprovision is retained and look forward to its enactment as part of \neconomic recovery legislation.\n  I am also pleased that funding was included for several other energy \nprograms that I sought funding for including the Energy Efficiency and \nConservation Block Grant Program and the Weatherization Assistance \nProgram, both of which can quickly generate jobs and generate lasting \nenergy savings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/11/senate-section/article/S2126-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2126-S2127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in regards to a \nrecent rollcall vote held in the Senate. On February 5, 2009, the \nSenate voted 32 to 65 on Senate amendment No. 140, which was offered by \nthe junior Senator from Wisconsin. Due to an inadvertent error, I \nrecorded my support for this amendment. I would like to take a few \nmoments to clarify my views regarding this amendment.\n  As my colleagues know, this amendment would have allowed a point of \norder to be raised against congressionally directed spending for \nprograms whose authorization has lapsed. This amendment would have \nhamstrung the Senate in the exercise of its constitutionally delegated \n``power of the purse.'' Procedures already exist for Senators to strike \nprovisions of bills they find objectionable, including language in \nappropriation bills. For example, Members may offer amendments to \nstrike or amend such provisions as they deem appropriate. In addition, \nas my friend, the senior Senator from Hawaii, has pointed out, this \namendment would have exempted funding requests for unauthorized \nprograms included in the President's budget request from this so-called \n``earmark point of order.'' In effect, this would have allowed \nunelected bureaucrats the ability to request funding for programs whose \nauthorization has lapsed while denying elected and accountable members \nof the Senate from doing likewise.\n\n[[Page S2127]]\n\nFinally, important programs like the ones that could be affected by \nthis point of order should not be penalized by Congress's inability to \nenact authorization bills in a timely fashion.\n  Together, the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Senate \nCommittee on Appropriations are taking steps to provide for \nunprecedented levels of transparency in the appropriations process. As \na new member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, I look forward \nto working with my colleagues to address the pressing issues that will \ncome before the committee, and I appreciate the opportunity to clarify \nmy views on this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/11/senate-section/article/S2127-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2127-S2130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. KERRY.

If the \n     principal subject matter of a measure or matter to be \n     referred falls within the jurisdiction of more than one \n     subcommittee, the chairman or the committee may refer the \n     matter to two or more subcommittees for joint consideration.\n       (b) Assignments.--Assignments of members to subcommittees \n     shall be made in an equitable fashion. No member of the \n     committee may receive assignment to a second subcommittee \n     until, in order of seniority, all members of the committee \n     have chosen assignments to one subcommittee, and no member \n     shall receive assignments to a third subcommittee until, in \n     order of seniority, all members have chosen assignments to \n     two subcommittees.\n       No member of the committee may serve on more than four \n     subcommittees at any one time.\n       The chairman and ranking member of the committee shall be \n     ex officio members, without vote, of each subcommittee.\n       (c) Meetings.--Except when funds have been specifically \n     made available by the Senate for a subcommittee purpose, no \n     subcommittee of the Committee on Foreign Relations shall hold \n     hearings involving expenses without prior approval of the \n     chairman of the full committee or by decision of the full \n     committee. Meetings of subcommittees shall be scheduled after \n     consultation with the chairman of the committee with a view \n     toward avoiding conflicts with meetings of other \n     subcommittees insofar as possible. Meetings of subcommittees \n     shall not be scheduled to conflict with meetings of the full \n     committee.\n       The proceedings of each subcommittee shall be governed by \n     the rules of the full committee, subject to such \n     authorizations or limitations as the committee may from time \n     to time prescribe.\n\n\n                            RULE 3--MEETINGS\n\n       (a) Regular Meeting Day.--The regular meeting day of the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations for the transaction of \n     committee business shall be on Tuesday of each week, unless \n     otherwise directed by the chairman.\n       (b) Additional Meetings.--Additional meetings and hearings \n     of the committee may be called by the chairman as he may deem \n     necessary. If at least three members of the committee desire \n     that a special meeting of the committee be called by the \n     chairman, those members may file in the offices of the \n     committee their written request to the chairman for that \n     special meeting. Immediately upon filing of the request, the \n     chief clerk of the committee shall notify the chairman of the \n     filing of the request. If, within three calendar days after \n     the filing of the request, the chairman does not call the \n     requested special meeting, to be held within seven calendar \n     days after the filing of the request, a majority of the \n     members of the committee may file in the offices of the \n     committee their written notice that a special meeting of the \n     committee will be held, specifying the date and hour of that \n     special meeting. The committee shall meet on that date and \n     hour. Immediately upon the filing of the notice, the clerk \n     shall notify all members of the committee that such special \n     meeting will be held and inform them of its date and hour.\n       (c) Hearings, Selection of Witnesses.--To ensure that the \n     issue which is the subject of the hearing is presented as \n     fully and fairly as possible, whenever a hearing is conducted \n     by the committee or a subcommittee upon any measure or \n     matter, the ranking member of the committee or subcommittee \n     may call an equal number of non-governmental witnesses \n     selected by the ranking member to testify at that hearing.\n       (d) Public Announcement.--The committee, or any \n     subcommittee thereof, shall make public announcement of the \n     date, place, time, and subject matter of any meeting or \n     hearing to be conducted on any measure or matter at least one \n     week in advance of such meetings or hearings, unless the \n     chairman of the committee, or subcommittee, in consultation \n     with the ranking member, determines that there is good cause \n     to begin such meeting or hearing at an earlier date.\n       (e) Procedure.--Insofar as possible, proceedings of the \n     committee will be conducted without resort to the formalities \n     of parliamentary procedure and with due regard for the views \n     of all members. Issues of procedure which may arise from time \n     to time shall be resolved by decision of the chairman, in \n     consultation with the ranking member. The chairman, in \n     consultation with the ranking member, may also propose \n     special procedures to govern the consideration of particular \n     matters by the committee.\n       (f) Closed Sessions.--Each meeting of the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations, or any subcommittee thereof, including \n     meetings to conduct hearings, shall be open to the public, \n     except that a meeting or series of meetings by the committee \n     or a subcommittee on the same subject for a period of no more \n     than 14 calendar days may be closed to the public on a motion \n     made and seconded to go into closed session to discuss only \n     whether the matters enumerated in paragraphs (1) through (6) \n     would require the meeting to be closed followed immediately \n     by a record vote in open session by a majority of the members \n     of the committee or subcommittee when it is determined that \n     the matters to be discussed or the testimony to be taken at \n     such meeting or meetings--\n          (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of the foreign relations of the United States;\n          (2) will relate solely to matters of committee staff \n     personnel or internal staff management or procedure;\n          (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct; to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise to expose an individual\n\n[[Page S2128]]\n\n     to public contempt or obloquy, or will represent a clearly \n     unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n          (4) will disclose the identity of any informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n          (5) will disclose information relating to the trade \n     secrets or financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n          (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be \n     kept confidential by government officers and employees; or\n          (B) the information has been obtained by the government \n     on a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific government financial or other \n     benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to \n     prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such \n     person, or\n          (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under other provisions of law or government regulations.\n       A closed meeting may be opened by a majority vote of the \n     committee.\n       (g) Staff Attendance.--A member of the committee may have \n     one member of his or her personal staff, for whom that member \n     assumes personal responsibility, accompany and be seated \n     nearby at committee meetings.\n       Each member of the committee may designate members of his \n     or her personal staff, who hold a top secret security \n     clearance, for the purpose of their eligibility to attend \n     closed sessions of the committee, subject to the same \n     conditions set forth for committee staff under Rules 12, 13, \n     and 14.\n       In addition, the majority leader and the minority leader of \n     the Senate, if they are not otherwise members of the \n     committee, may designate one member of their staff with a top \n     secret security clearance to attend closed sessions of the \n     committee, subject to the same conditions set forth for \n     committee staff under Rules 12, 13, and 14. Staff of other \n     Senators who are not members of the committee may not attend \n     closed sessions of the committee.\n       Attendance of committee staff at meetings shall be limited \n     to those designated by the staff director or the minority \n     staff director.\n       The committee, by majority vote, or the chairman, with the \n     concurrence of the ranking member, may limit staff attendance \n     at specified meetings.\n\n\n                            RULE 4--QUORUMS\n\n       (a) Testimony.--For the purpose of taking sworn or unsworn \n     testimony at any duly scheduled meeting a quorum of the \n     committee and each subcommittee thereof shall consist of one \n     member.\n       (b) Business.--A quorum for the transaction of committee or \n     subcommittee business, other than for reporting a measure or \n     recommendation to the Senate or the taking of testimony, \n     shall consist of one-third of the members of the committee or \n     subcommittee, including at least one member from each party.\n       (c) Reporting.--A majority of the membership of the \n     committee, including at least one member from each party, \n     shall constitute a quorum for reporting any measure or \n     recommendation to the Senate. No measure or recommendation \n     shall be ordered reported from the committee unless a \n     majority of the committee members is physically present, and \n     a majority of those present concurs.\n\n\n                            RULE 5--PROXIES\n\n       Proxies must be in writing with the signature of the absent \n     member. Subject to the requirements of Rule 4 for the \n     physical presence of a quorum to report a matter, proxy \n     voting shall be allowed on all measures and matters before \n     the committee. However, proxies shall not be voted on a \n     measure or matter except when the absent member has been \n     informed of the matter on which he is being recorded and has \n     affirmatively requested that he or she be so recorded.\n\n\n                           RULE 6--WITNESSES\n\n       (a) General.--The Committee on Foreign Relations will \n     consider requests to testify on any matter or measure pending \n     before the committee.\n       (b) Presentation.--If the chairman so determines, the oral \n     presentation of witnesses shall be limited to 10 minutes. \n     However, written statements of reasonable length may be \n     submitted by witnesses and other interested persons who are \n     unable to testify in person.\n       (c) Filing of Statements.--A witness appearing before the \n     committee, or any subcommittee thereof, shall file a written \n     statement of his proposed testimony at least 48 hours prior \n     to his appearance, unless this requirement is waived by the \n     chairman and the ranking member following their determination \n     that there is good cause for failure to file such a \n     statement. Witnesses appearing on behalf of the executive \n     branch shall provide an additional 100 copies of their \n     statement to the committee.\n       (d) Expenses.--Only the chairman may authorize expenditures \n     of funds for the expenses of witnesses appearing before the \n     committee or its subcommittees.\n       (e) Requests.--Any witness called for a hearing may submit \n     a written request to the chairman no later than 24 hours in \n     advance for his testimony to be in closed or open session, or \n     for any other unusual procedure. The chairman shall determine \n     whether to grant any such request and shall notify the \n     committee members of the request and of his decision.\n\n\n                           RULE 7--SUBPOENAS\n\n       (a) Authorization.--The chairman or any other member of the \n     committee, when authorized by a majority vote of the \n     committee at a meeting or by proxies, shall have authority to \n     subpoena the attendance of witnesses or the production of \n     memoranda, documents, records, or any other materials. At the \n     request of any member of the committee, the committee shall \n     authorize the issuance of a subpoena only at a meeting of the \n     committee. When the committee authorizes a subpoena, it may \n     be issued upon the signature of the chairman or any other \n     member designated by the committee.\n       (b) Return.--A subpoena, or a request to an agency, for \n     documents may be issued whose return shall occur at a time \n     and place other than that of a scheduled committee meeting. A \n     return on such a subpoena or request which is incomplete or \n     accompanied by an objection constitutes good cause for a \n     hearing on shortened notice. Upon such a return, the chairman \n     or any other member designated by him may convene a hearing \n     by giving 2 hours notice by telephone to all other members. \n     One member shall constitute a quorum for such a hearing. The \n     sole purpose of such a hearing shall be to elucidate further \n     information about the return and to rule on the objection.\n       (c) Depositions.--At the direction of the committee, staff \n     is authorized to take depositions from witnesses.\n\n\n                            RULE 8--REPORTS\n\n       (a) Filing.--When the committee has ordered a measure or \n     recommendation reported, the report thereon shall be filed in \n     the Senate at the earliest practicable time.\n       (b) Supplemental, Minority and Additional Views.--A member \n     of the committee who gives notice of his intentions to file \n     supplemental, minority, or additional views at the time of \n     final committee approval of a measure or matter, shall be \n     entitled to not less than 3 calendar days in which to file \n     such views, in writing, with the chief clerk of the \n     committee, with the 3 days to begin at 11:00 p.m. on the same \n     day that the committee has ordered a measure or matter \n     reported. Such views shall then be included in the committee \n     report and printed in the same volume, as a part thereof, and \n     their inclusion shall be noted on the cover of the report. In \n     the absence of timely notice, the committee report may be \n     filed and printed immediately without such views.\n       (c) Rollcall Votes.--The results of all rollcall votes \n     taken in any meeting of the committee on any measure, or \n     amendment thereto, shall be announced in the committee \n     report. The announcement shall include a tabulation of the \n     votes cast in favor and votes cast in opposition to each such \n     measure and amendment by each member of the committee.\n\n\n                            RULE 9--TREATIES\n\n       (a) The committee is the only committee of the Senate with \n     jurisdiction to review and report to the Senate on treaties \n     submitted by the President for Senate advice and consent to \n     ratification. Because the House of Representatives has no \n     role in the approval of treaties, the committee is therefore \n     the only congressional committee with responsibility for \n     treaties.\n       (b) Once submitted by the President for advice and consent, \n     each treaty is referred to the committee and remains on its \n     calendar from Congress to Congress until the committee takes \n     action to report it to the Senate or recommend its return to \n     the President, or until the committee is discharged of the \n     treaty by the Senate.\n       (c) In accordance with Senate Rule XXX.2, treaties which \n     have been reported to the Senate but not acted on before the \n     end of a Congress ``shall be resumed at the commencement of \n     the next Congress as if no proceedings had previously been \n     had thereon.''\n       (d) Insofar as possible, the committee should conduct a \n     public hearing on each treaty as soon as possible after its \n     submission by the President. Except in extraordinary \n     circumstances, treaties reported to the Senate shall be \n     accompanied by a written report.\n\n\n                          RULE 10--NOMINATIONS\n\n       (a) Waiting Requirement.--Unless otherwise directed by the \n     chairman and the ranking member, the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations shall not consider any nomination until 6 calendar \n     days after it has been formally submitted to the Senate.\n       (b) Public Consideration.--Nominees for any post who are \n     invited to appear before the committee shall be heard in \n     public session, unless a majority of the committee decrees \n     otherwise, consistent with Rule 3(f).\n       (c) Required Data.--No nomination shall be reported to the \n     Senate unless (1) the nominee has been accorded a security \n     clearance on the basis of a thorough investigation by \n     executive branch agencies; (2) the nominee has filed a \n     financial disclosure report and a related ethics undertaking \n     with the committee; (3) the committee has been assured that \n     the nominee does not have any interests which could conflict \n     with the interests of the government in the exercise of the \n     nominee's proposed responsibilities; (4) for persons \n     nominated to be chief of mission, ambassador-at-large, or \n     minister, the committee has received a complete list of any \n     contributions made by the nominee or members of his immediate \n     family to any Federal election campaign during the year of \n     his or her nomination and for the 4 preceding years; and (5) \n     for persons nominated to be chiefs of\n\n[[Page S2129]]\n\n     mission, the report required by Section 304(a)(4) of the \n     Foreign Service Act of 1980 on the demonstrated competence of \n     that nominee to perform the duties of the position to which \n     he or she has been nominated.\n\n\n                            RULE 11--TRAVEL\n\n       (a) Foreign Travel.--No member of the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations or its staff shall travel abroad on committee \n     business unless specifically authorized by the chairman, who \n     is required by law to approve vouchers and report \n     expenditures of foreign currencies, and the ranking member. \n     Requests for authorization of such travel shall state the \n     purpose and, when completed, a full substantive and financial \n     report shall be filed with the committee within 30 days. This \n     report shall be furnished to all members of the committee and \n     shall not be otherwise disseminated without authorization of \n     the chairman or the ranking member. Except in extraordinary \n     circumstances, staff travel shall not be approved unless the \n     reporting requirements have been fulfilled for all prior \n     trips. Except for travel that is strictly personal, travel \n     funded by non-U.S. Government sources is subject to the same \n     approval and substantive reporting requirements as U.S. \n     Government-funded travel. In addition, members and staff are \n     reminded to consult the Senate Code of Conduct, and, as \n     appropriate, the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, in the \n     case of travel sponsored by non-U.S. Government sources.\n       Any proposed travel by committee staff for a subcommittee \n     purpose must be approved by the subcommittee chairman and \n     ranking member prior to submission of the request to the \n     chairman and ranking member of the full committee.\n       (b) Domestic Travel.--All official travel in the United \n     States by the committee staff shall be approved in advance by \n     the staff director, or in the case of minority staff, by the \n     minority staff director.\n       (c) Personal Staff.--As a general rule, no more than one \n     member of the personal staff of a member of the committee may \n     travel with that member with the approval of the chairman and \n     the ranking member of the committee. During such travel, the \n     personal staff member shall be considered to be an employee \n     of the committee.\n       (d) Personal Representatives of the Member (PRM).--For the \n     purposes of this rule regarding staff foreign travel, the \n     officially-designated personal representative of the member \n     (PRM) shall be deemed to have the same rights, duties, and \n     responsibilities as members of the staff of the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations. Furthermore, for the purposes of this \n     section, each member of the committee may designate one \n     personal staff member as the ``Personal Representative of the \n     Member.''\n\n\n                          RULE 12--TRANSCRIPTS\n\n       (a) General.--The Committee on Foreign Relations shall keep \n     verbatim transcripts of all committee and subcommittee \n     meetings and such transcripts shall remain in the custody of \n     the committee, unless a majority of the committee decides \n     otherwise. Transcripts of public hearings by the committee \n     shall be published unless the chairman, with the concurrence \n     of the ranking member, determines otherwise.\n       (b) Classified or Restricted Transcripts.--\n          (1) The chief clerk of the committee shall have \n     responsibility for the maintenance and security of classified \n     or restricted transcripts, and shall ensure that such \n     transcripts are handled in a manner consistent with the \n     requirements of the United States Senate Security Manual.\n          (2) A record shall be maintained of each use of \n     classified or restricted transcripts as required by the \n     Senate Security Manual.\n          (3) Classified transcripts may not leave the committee \n     offices, or SVC-217 of the Capitol Vistors Center, except for \n     the purpose of declassification.\n          (4) Extreme care shall be exercised to avoid taking \n     notes or quotes from classified transcripts. Their contents \n     may not be divulged to any unauthorized person.\n          (5) Subject to any additional restrictions imposed by \n     the chairman with the concurrence of the ranking member, only \n     the following persons are authorized to have access to \n     classified or restricted transcripts.\n          (A) Members and staff of the committee in the committee \n     offices or in SVC-217 of the Capitol Vistors Center;\n          (B) Designated personal representatives of members of \n     the committee, and of the majority and minority leaders, with \n     appropriate security clearances, in the committee offices or \n     in SVC-217 of the Capitol Vistors Center;\n          (C) Senators not members of the committee, by permission \n     of the chairman, in the committee offices or in SVC-217 of \n     the Capitol Vistors Center; and\n          (D) Officials of the executive departments involved in \n     the meeting, in the committee offices or SVC-217 of the \n     Capitol Vistors Center.\n          (6) Any restrictions imposed upon access to a meeting of \n     the committee shall also apply to the transcript of such \n     meeting, except by special permission of the chairman and \n     ranking member.\n          (7) In addition to restrictions resulting from the \n     inclusion of any classified information in the transcript of \n     a committee meeting, members and staff shall not discuss with \n     anyone the proceedings of the committee in closed session or \n     reveal information conveyed or discussed in such a session \n     unless that person would have been permitted to attend the \n     session itself, or unless such communication is specifically \n     authorized by the chairman, the ranking member, or in the \n     case of staff, by the staff director or minority staff \n     director. A record shall be kept of all such authorizations.\n       (c) Declassification.--\n          (1) All noncurrent records of the committee are governed \n     by Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate and by S. Res. \n     474 (96th Congress). Any classified transcripts transferred \n     to the National Archives and Records Administration under \n     Rule XI may not be made available for public use unless they \n     have been subject to declassification review in accordance \n     with applicable laws or Executive orders.\n          (2) Any transcript or classified committee report, or \n     any portion thereof, may be declassified, in accordance with \n     applicable laws or Executive orders, sooner than the time \n     period provided for under S. Res. 474 if:\n          (A) the chairman originates such action, with the \n     concurrence of the ranking member;\n          (B) the other current members of the committee who \n     participated in such meeting or report have been notified of \n     the proposed declassification, and have not objected thereto, \n     except that the committee by majority vote may overrule any \n     objections thereby raised to early declassification; and\n          (C) the executive departments that participated in the \n     meeting or originated the classified information have been \n     consulted and consented to the declassification.\n\n\n                    RULE 13--CLASSIFIED INFORMATION\n\n       (a) The handling of classified information in the Senate is \n     governed by S. Res. 243 (100th Congress), which established \n     the Office of Senate Security. All handling of classified \n     information by the committee shall be consistent with the \n     procedures set forth in the United States Senate Security \n     Manual issued by the Office of Senate Security.\n       (b) The chief clerk is the security manager for the \n     committee. The chief clerk shall be responsible for \n     implementing the provisions of the Senate Security Manual and \n     for serving as the committee liaison to the Office of Senate \n     Security. The staff director, in consultation with the \n     minority staff director, may appoint an alternate security \n     manager as circumstances warrant.\n       (c) Classified material may only be transported between \n     Senate offices by appropriately cleared staff members who \n     have been specifically authorized to do so by the security \n     manager.\n       (d) In general, Senators and staff undertake to confine \n     their access to classified information on the basis of a \n     ``need to know'' such information related to their committee \n     responsibilities.\n       (e) The staff director is authorized to make such \n     administrative regulations as may be necessary to carry out \n     the provisions of this rule.\n\n\n                             RULE 14--STAFF\n\n       (a) Responsibilities.--\n          (1) The staff works for the committee as a whole, under \n     the general supervision of the chairman of the committee, and \n     the immediate direction of the staff director, except that \n     such part of the staff as is designated minority staff shall \n     be under the general supervision of the ranking member and \n     under the immediate direction of the minority staff director.\n          (2) Any member of the committee should feel free to call \n     upon the staff at any time for assistance in connection with \n     committee business. Members of the Senate not members of the \n     committee who call upon the staff for assistance from time to \n     time should be given assistance subject to the overriding \n     responsibility of the staff to the committee.\n          (3) The staff's primary responsibility is with respect \n     to bills, resolutions, treaties, and nominations.\n          In addition to carrying out assignments from the \n     committee and its individual members, the staff has a \n     responsibility to originate suggestions for committee or \n     subcommittee consideration. The staff also has a \n     responsibility to make suggestions to individual members \n     regarding matters of special interest to such members.\n          (4) It is part of the staff's duty to keep itself as \n     well informed as possible in regard to developments affecting \n     foreign relations and in regard to the administration of \n     foreign programs of the United States. Significant trends or \n     developments which might otherwise escape notice should be \n     called to the attention of the committee, or of individual \n     Senators with particular interests.\n          (5) The staff shall pay due regard to the constitutional \n     separation of powers between the Senate and the executive \n     branch. It therefore has a responsibility to help the \n     committee bring to bear an independent, objective judgment of \n     proposals by the executive branch and when appropriate to \n     originate sound proposals of its own. At the same time, the \n     staff shall avoid impinging upon the day-to-day conduct of \n     foreign affairs.\n          (6) In those instances when committee action requires \n     the expression of minority views, the staff shall assist the \n     minority as fully as the majority to the end that all points \n     of view may be fully considered by members of the committee \n     and of the Senate. The staff shall bear in mind that under \n     our constitutional system it is the responsibility of the \n     elected members of the Senate to determine legislative issues \n     in the light of as full and fair a presentation of the facts \n     as the staff may be able to obtain.\n       (b) Restrictions.--\n          (1) The staff shall regard its relationship to the \n     committee as a privileged one, in\n\n[[Page S2130]]\n\n     the nature of the relationship of a lawyer to a client. In \n     order to protect this relationship and the mutual confidence \n     which must prevail if the committee-staff relationship is to \n     be a satisfactory and fruitful one, the following criteria \n     shall apply:\n          (A) members of the staff shall not be identified with \n     any special interest group in the field of foreign relations \n     or allow their names to be used by any such group;\n          (B) members of the staff shall not accept public \n     speaking engagements or write for publication in the field of \n     foreign relations without specific advance permission from \n     the staff director, or, in the case of minority staff, from \n     the minority staff director. In the case of the staff \n     director and the minority staff director, such advance \n     permission shall be obtained from the chairman or the ranking \n     member, as appropriate. In any event, such public statements \n     should avoid the expression of personal views and should not \n     contain predictions of future, or interpretations of past, \n     committee action; and\n          (C) staff shall not discuss their private conversations \n     with members of the committee without specific advance \n     permission from the Senator or Senators concerned.\n          (2) The staff shall not discuss with anyone the \n     proceedings of the committee in closed session or reveal \n     information conveyed or discussed in such a session unless \n     that person would have been permitted to attend the session \n     itself, or unless such communication is specifically \n     authorized by the staff director or minority staff director. \n     Unauthorized disclosure of information from a closed session \n     or of classified information shall be cause for immediate \n     dismissal and may, in the case of some kinds of information, \n     be grounds for criminal prosecution.\n\n\n                 RULE 15--STATUS AND AMENDMENT OF RULES\n\n       (a) Status.--In addition to the foregoing, the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations is governed by the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate, which shall take precedence in the event of a clear \n     inconsistency. In addition, the jurisdiction and \n     responsibilities of the committee with respect to certain \n     matters, as well as the timing and procedure for their \n     consideration in committee, may be governed by statute.\n       (b) Amendment.--These rules may be modified, amended, or \n     repealed by a majority of the committee, provided that a \n     notice in writing of the proposed change has been given to \n     each member at least 48 hours prior to the meeting at which \n     action thereon is to be taken. However, rules of the \n     committee which are based upon Senate rules may not be \n     superseded by committee vote alone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/11/senate-section/article/S2130-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2130-S2133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS RULES OF \n                               PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs has adopted rules governing its procedures for the \n111th Congress. Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 2, of the Standing \nRules of the Senate, on behalf of myself and Senator Collins, I ask \nunanimous consent to have a copy of the committee rules printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY AND \n                          GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS\n\n      PURSUANT TO RULE XXVI, SEC. 2, STANDING RULES OF THE SENATE\n\n\n      RULE 1. MEETINGS AND MEETING PROCEDURES OTHER THAN HEARINGS\n\n       A. Meeting dates. The Committee shall hold its regular \n     meetings on the first Wednesday of each month, when the \n     Congress is in session, or at such other times as the \n     Chairman shall determine. Additional meetings may be called \n     by the Chairman as he/she deems necessary to expedite \n     Committee business. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 3, Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.)\n       B. Calling special Committee meetings. If at least three \n     Members of the Committee desire the Chairman to call a \n     special meeting, they may file in the offices of the \n     Committee a written request therefor, addressed to the \n     Chairman. Immediately thereafter, the clerk of the Committee \n     shall notify the Chairman of such request. If, within 3 \n     calendar days after the filing of such request, the Chairman \n     fails to call the requested special meeting, which is to be \n     held within 7 calendar days after the filing of such request, \n     a majority of the Committee Members may file in the offices \n     of the Committee their written notice that a special \n     Committee meeting will be held, specifying the date and hour \n     thereof, and the Committee shall meet on that date and hour. \n     Immediately upon the filing of such notice, the Committee \n     clerk shall notify all Committee Members that such special \n     meeting will be held and inform them of its date and hour. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 3, Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       C. Meeting notices and agenda. Written notices of Committee \n     meetings, accompanied by an agenda, enumerating the items of \n     business to be considered, shall be sent to all Committee \n     Members at least 3 days in advance of such meetings, \n     excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays in which the \n     Senate is not in session. The written notices required by \n     this Rule may be provided by electronic mail. In the event \n     that unforeseen requirements or Committee business prevent a \n     3-day notice of either the meeting or agenda, the Committee \n     staff shall communicate such notice and agenda, or any \n     revisions to the agenda, as soon as practicable by telephone \n     or otherwise to Members or appropriate staff assistants in \n     their offices.\n       D. Open business meetings. Meetings for the transaction of \n     Committee or Subcommittee business shall be conducted in open \n     session, except that a meeting or series of meetings on the \n     same subject for a period of no more than 14 calendar days \n     may be closed to the public on a motion made and seconded to \n     go into closed session to discuss only whether the matters \n     enumerated in clauses (1) through (6) below would require the \n     meeting to be closed, followed immediately by a record vote \n     in open session by a majority of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee Members when it is determined that the matters \n     to be discussed or the testimony to be taken at such meeting \n     or meetings--\n       (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of foreign relations of the United States;\n       (2) will relate solely to matters of Committee or \n     Subcommittee staff personnel or internal staff management or \n     procedure;\n       (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise expose an individual to public \n     contempt or obloquy or will represent a clearly unwarranted \n     invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n       (4) will disclose the identity of an informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n       (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets \n     of financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n       (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept \n     confidential by Government officers and employees; or\n       (B) the information has been obtained by the Government on \n     a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific Government financial or other \n     benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to \n     prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such \n     person; or\n       (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under other provisions of law or Government regulations. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.) \n     Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever disorder arises \n     during a Committee or Subcommittee meeting that is open to \n     the public, or any demonstration of approval or disapproval \n     is indulged in by any person in attendance at any such \n     meeting, it shall be the duty of the Chairman to enforce \n     order on his or her own initiative and without any point of \n     order being made by a Member of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee; provided, further, that when the Chairman finds \n     it necessary to maintain order, he/she shall have the power \n     to clear the room, and the Committee or Subcommittee may act \n     in closed session for so long as there is doubt of the \n     assurance of order. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(d), Standing Rules of \n     the Senate.)\n       E. Prior notice of first degree amendments. It shall not be \n     in order for the Committee, or a Subcommittee thereof, to \n     consider any amendment in the first degree proposed to any \n     measure under consideration by the Committee or Subcommittee \n     unless a written copy of such amendment has been delivered to \n     each Member of the Committee or Subcommittee, as the case may \n     be, and to the office of the Committee or Subcommittee, at \n     least 24 hours before the meeting of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee at which the amendment is to be proposed. The \n     written copy of amendments in the first degree required by \n     this Rule may be provided by electronic mail. This subsection \n     may be waived by a majority of the Members present. This \n     subsection shall apply only when at least 72 hours written \n     notice of a session to mark-up a measure is provided to \n     the Committee or Subcommittee.\n       F. Meeting transcript. The Committee or Subcommittee shall \n     prepare and keep a complete transcript or electronic \n     recording adequate to fully record the proceeding of each \n     meeting whether or not such meeting or any part thereof is \n     closed to the public, unless a majority of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee Members vote to forgo such a record. (Rule XXVI, \n     Sec. 5(e), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n\n\n                            RULE 2. QUORUMS\n\n       A. Reporting measures and matters. A majority of the \n     Members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for \n     reporting to the Senate any measures, matters or \n     recommendations. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(1), Standing Rules of \n     the Senate.)\n       B. Transaction of routine business. One-third of the \n     membership of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for the \n     transaction of routine business, provided that one Member of \n     the Minority is present. For the purpose of this paragraph, \n     the term ``routine business'' includes the convening of a \n     meeting and the consideration of any business of the \n     Committee other than reporting to the Senate any measures, \n     matters or recommendations. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(1), \n     Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n\n[[Page S2131]]\n\n       C. Taking testimony. One Member of the Committee shall \n     constitute a quorum for taking sworn or unsworn testimony. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(2) and 7(c)(2), Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.)\n       D. Subcommittee quorums. Subject to the provisions of \n     sections 7(a)(1) and (2) of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules \n     of the Senate, the Subcommittees of this Committee are \n     authorized to establish their own quorums for the transaction \n     of business and the taking of sworn testimony.\n       E. Proxies prohibited in establishment of quorum. Proxies \n     shall not be considered for the establishment of a quorum.\n\n\n                             RULE 3. VOTING\n\n       A. Quorum required. Subject to the provisions of subsection \n     (E), no vote may be taken by the Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, on any measure or matter unless a \n     quorum, as prescribed in the preceding section, is actually \n     present.\n       B. Reporting measures and matters. No measure, matter or \n     recommendation shall be reported from the Committee unless a \n     majority of the Committee Members are actually present, and \n     the vote of the Committee to report a measure or matter shall \n     require the concurrence of a majority of those Members who \n     are actually present at the time the vote is taken. (Rule \n     XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(1) and (3), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       C. Proxy voting. Proxy voting shall be allowed on all \n     measures and matters before the Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, except that, when the Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, is voting to report a measure or \n     matter, proxy votes shall be allowed solely for the purposes \n     of recording a Member's position on the pending question. \n     Proxy voting shall be allowed only if the absent Committee or \n     Subcommittee Member has been informed of the matter on which \n     he or she is being recorded and has affirmatively requested \n     that he or she be so recorded. All proxies shall be filed \n     with the chief clerk of the Committee or Subcommittee \n     thereof, as the case may be. All proxies shall be in writing \n     and shall contain sufficient reference to the pending matter \n     as is necessary to identify it and to inform the Committee or \n     Subcommittee as to how the Member establishes his or her vote \n     to be recorded thereon. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(3) and 7(c)(1), \n     Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       D. Announcement of vote. (1) Whenever the Committee by roll \n     call vote reports any measure or matter, the report of the \n     Committee upon such a measure or matter shall include a \n     tabulation of the votes cast in favor of and the votes cast \n     in opposition to such measure or matter by each Member of the \n     Committee. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(c), Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.)\n       (2) Whenever the Committee by roll call vote acts upon any \n     measure or amendment thereto, other than reporting a measure \n     or matter, the results thereof shall be announced in the \n     Committee report on that measure unless previously announced \n     by the Committee, and such announcement shall include a \n     tabulation of the votes cast in favor of and the votes cast \n     in opposition to each such measure and amendment thereto by \n     each Member of the Committee who was present at the meeting. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       (3) In any case in which a roll call vote is announced, the \n     tabulation of votes shall state separately the proxy vote \n     recorded in favor of and in opposition to that measure, \n     amendment thereto, or matter. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(b) and (c), \n     Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       E. Polling. (1) The Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, \n     may poll (a) internal Committee or Subcommittee matters \n     including the Committee's or Subcommittee's staff, records \n     and budget; (b) steps in an investigation, including issuance \n     of subpoenas, applications for immunity orders, and requests \n     for documents from agencies; and (c) other Committee or \n     Subcommittee business other than a vote on reporting to the \n     Senate any measures, matters or recommendations or a vote on \n     closing a meeting or hearing to the public.\n       (2) Only the Chairman, or a Committee Member or staff \n     officer designated by him/her, may undertake any poll of the \n     Members of the Committee. If any Member requests, any matter \n     to be polled shall be held for meeting rather than being \n     polled. The chief clerk of the Committee shall keep a record \n     of polls; if a majority of the Members of the Committee \n     determine that the polled matter is in one of the areas \n     enumerated in subsection (D) of Rule 1, the record of the \n     poll shall be confidential. Any Committee Member may move at \n     the Committee meeting following the poll for a vote on the \n     polled decision, such motion and vote to be subject to the \n     provisions of subsection (D) of Rule 1, where applicable.\n       F. Naming postal facilities. The Committee will not \n     consider any legislation that would name a postal facility \n     for a living person with the exception of bills naming \n     facilities after former Presidents and Vice Presidents of the \n     United States, former Members of Congress over 70 years of \n     age, former State or local elected officials over 70 years of \n     age, former judges over 70 years of age, or wounded veterans.\n\n\n             RULE 4. CHAIRMANSHIP OF MEETINGS AND HEARINGS\n\n       The Chairman shall preside at all Committee meetings and \n     hearings except that he or she shall designate a temporary \n     Chairman to act in his or her place if he or she is unable to \n     be present at a scheduled meeting or hearing. If the Chairman \n     (or his or her designee) is absent 10 minutes after the \n     scheduled time set for a meeting or hearing, the Ranking \n     Majority Member present shall preside until the Chairman's \n     arrival. If there is no Member of the Majority present, the \n     Ranking Minority Member present, with the prior approval of \n     the Chairman, may open and conduct the meeting or hearing \n     until such time as a Member of the Majority arrives.\n\n\n                RULE 5. HEARINGS AND HEARING PROCEDURES\n\n       A. Announcement of hearings. The Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, shall make public announcement of the \n     date, time, and subject matter of any hearing to be conducted \n     on any measure or matter at least 1 week in advance of such \n     hearing, unless the Committee, or Subcommittee, determines \n     that there is good cause to begin such hearing at an earlier \n     date. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 4(a), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       B. Open hearings. Each hearing conducted by the Committee, \n     or any Subcommittee thereof, shall be open to the public, \n     except that a hearing or series of hearings on the same \n     subject for a period of no more than 14 calendar days may be \n     closed to the public on a motion made and seconded to go into \n     closed session to discuss only whether the matters enumerated \n     in clauses (1) through (6) below would require the hearing to \n     be closed, followed immediately by a record vote in open \n     session by a majority of the Committee or Subcommittee \n     Members when it is determined that the matters to be \n     discussed or the testimony to be taken at such hearing or \n     hearings--\n       (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of foreign relations of the United States;\n       (2) will relate solely to matters of Committee or \n     Subcommittee staff personnel or internal staff management or \n     procedure;\n       (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise expose an individual to public \n     contempt or obloquy or will represent a clearly unwarranted \n     invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n       (4) will disclose the identity of an informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n       (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets \n     of financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n       (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept \n     confidential by Government officers and employees; or\n       (B) the information has been obtained by the Government on \n     a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific Government financial or other \n     benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to \n     prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such \n     person; or\n       (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under other provisions of law or Government regulations. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever disorder arises \n     during a Committee or Subcommittee meeting that is open to \n     the public, or any demonstration of approval or disapproval \n     is indulged in by any person in attendance at any such \n     meeting, it shall be the duty of the Chairman to enforce \n     order on his or her own initiative and without any point of \n     order being made by a Member of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee; provided, further, that when the Chairman finds \n     it necessary to maintain order, he or she shall have the \n     power to clear the room, and the Committee or Subcommittee \n     may act in closed session for so long as there is doubt of \n     the assurance of order. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(d), Standing Rules \n     of the Senate.)\n       C. Full Committee subpoenas. The Chairman, with the \n     approval of the Ranking Minority Member of the Committee, is \n     authorized to subpoena the attendance of witnesses or the \n     production of memoranda, documents, records, or any other \n     materials at a hearing or deposition, provided that the \n     Chairman may subpoena attendance or production without the \n     approval of the Ranking Minority Member where the Chairman or \n     a staff officer designated by him/her has not received \n     notification from the Ranking Minority Member or a staff \n     officer designated by him/her of disapproval of the subpoena \n     within 72 hours, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, of being \n     notified of the subpoena. If a subpoena is disapproved by the \n     Ranking Minority Member as provided in this subsection, the \n     subpoena may be authorized by vote of the Members of the \n     Committee. When the Committee or Chairman authorizes \n     subpoenas, subpoenas may be issued upon the signature of the \n     Chairman or any other Member of the Committee designated by \n     the Chairman.\n       D. Witness counsel. Counsel retained by any witness and \n     accompanying such witness shall be permitted to be present \n     during the testimony of such witness at any public or \n     executive hearing or deposition to advise such witness while \n     he or she is testifying, of his or her legal rights; \n     provided, however, that in the case of any witness who is an \n     officer or employee of the government, or of a corporation or \n     association, the Committee Chairman may rule that \n     representation by counsel from the government, corporation, \n     or association or by counsel representing other witnesses, \n     creates a conflict of interest, and that the witness may only \n     be represented during interrogation by staff or\n\n[[Page S2132]]\n\n     during testimony before the Committee by personal counsel not \n     from the government, corporation, or association or by \n     personal counsel not representing other witnesses. This \n     subsection shall not be construed to excuse a witness from \n     testifying in the event his or her counsel is ejected for \n     conducting himself or herself in such manner so as to \n     prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct or interfere with the \n     orderly administration of the hearings; nor shall this \n     subsection be construed as authorizing counsel to coach the \n     witness or answer for the witness. The failure of any witness \n     to secure counsel shall not excuse such witness from \n     complying with a subpoena or deposition notice.\n       E. Witness transcripts. An accurate electronic or \n     stenographic record shall be kept of the testimony of all \n     witnesses in executive and public hearings. The record of his \n     or her testimony whether in public or executive session shall \n     be made available for inspection by the witness or his or her \n     counsel under Committee supervision; a copy of any testimony \n     given in public session or that part of the testimony given \n     by the witness in executive session and subsequently quoted \n     or made part of the record in a public session shall be \n     provided to any witness at his or her expense if he or she so \n     requests. Upon inspecting his or her transcript, within a \n     time limit set by the chief clerk of the Committee, a witness \n     may request changes in the transcript to correct errors of \n     transcription and grammatical errors; the Chairman or a staff \n     officer designated by him/her shall rule on such requests.\n       F. Impugned persons. Any person whose name is mentioned or \n     is specifically identified, and who believes that evidence \n     presented, or comment made by a Member of the Committee or \n     staff officer, at a public hearing or at a closed hearing \n     concerning which there have been public reports, tends to \n     impugn his or her character or adversely affect his or her \n     reputation may:\n       (a) File a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     evidence or comment, which statement shall be considered for \n     placement in the hearing record by the Committee;\n       (b) Request the opportunity to appear personally before the \n     Committee to testify in his or her own behalf, which request \n     shall be considered by the Committee; and\n       (c) Submit questions in writing which he or she requests be \n     used for the cross-examination of other witnesses called by \n     the Committee, which questions shall be considered for use by \n     the Committee.\n       G. Radio, television, and photography. The Committee, or \n     any Subcommittee thereof, may permit the proceedings of \n     hearings which are open to the public to be photographed and \n     broadcast by radio, television or both, subject to such \n     conditions as the Committee, or Subcommittee, may impose. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(c), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       H. Advance statements of witnesses. A witness appearing \n     before the Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, shall \n     provide electronically a written statement of his or her \n     proposed testimony at least 48 hours prior to his or her \n     appearance. This requirement may be waived by the Chairman \n     and the Ranking Minority Member following their determination \n     that there is good cause for failure of compliance. (Rule \n     XXVI, Sec. 4(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       I. Minority witnesses. In any hearings conducted by the \n     Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, the Minority Members \n     of the Committee or Subcommittee shall be entitled, upon \n     request to the Chairman by a majority of the Minority \n     Members, to call witnesses of their selection during at least \n     1 day of such hearings. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 4(d), Standing Rules \n     of the Senate.)\n       J. Full Committee depositions. Depositions may be taken \n     prior to or after a hearing as provided in this subsection.\n       (1) Notices for the taking of depositions shall be \n     authorized and issued by the Chairman, with the approval of \n     the Ranking Minority Member of the Committee, provided that \n     the Chairman may initiate depositions without the approval of \n     the Ranking Minority Member where the Chairman or a staff \n     officer designated by him/her has not received notification \n     from the Ranking Minority Member or a staff officer \n     designated by him/her of disapproval of the deposition within \n     72 hours, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, of being notified \n     of the deposition notice. If a deposition notice is \n     disapproved by the Ranking Minority Member as provided in \n     this subsection, the deposition notice may be authorized by a \n     vote of the Members of the Committee. Committee deposition \n     notices shall specify a time and place for examination, and \n     the name of the Committee Member or Members or staff officer \n     or officers who will take the deposition. Unless otherwise \n     specified, the deposition shall be in private. The Committee \n     shall not initiate procedures leading to criminal or civil \n     enforcement proceedings for a witness' failure to appear or \n     produce unless the deposition notice was accompanied by a \n     Committee subpoena.\n       (2) Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition by counsel \n     to advise them of their legal rights, subject to the \n     provisions of Rule 5D.\n       (3) Oaths at depositions may be administered by an \n     individual authorized by local law to administer oaths. \n     Questions shall be propounded orally by Committee Member or \n     Members or staff. If a witness objects to a question and \n     refuses to testify, the objection shall be noted for the \n     record and the Committee Member or Members or staff may \n     proceed with the remainder of the deposition.\n       (4) The Committee shall see that the testimony is \n     transcribed or electronically recorded (which may include \n     audio or audio/video recordings). If it is transcribed, the \n     transcript shall be made available for inspection by the \n     witness or his or her counsel under Committee supervision. \n     The witness shall sign a copy of the transcript and may \n     request changes to it, which shall be handled in accordance \n     with the procedure set forth in subsection (E). If the \n     witness fails to sign a copy, the staff shall note that fact \n     on the transcript. The individual administering the oath \n     shall certify on the transcript that the witness was duly \n     sworn in his or her presence, the transcriber shall certify \n     that the transcript is a true record of the testimony, and \n     the transcript shall then be filed with the chief clerk of \n     the Committee. The Chairman or a staff officer designated by \n     him/her may stipulate with the witness to changes in the \n     procedure; deviations from this procedure which do not \n     substantially impair the reliability of the record shall not \n     relieve the witness from his or her obligation to testify \n     truthfully.\n\n\n                 RULE 6. COMMITTEE REPORTING PROCEDURES\n\n       A. Timely filing. When the Committee has ordered a measure \n     or matter reported, following final action, the report \n     thereon shall be filed in the Senate at the earliest \n     practicable time. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 10(b), Standing Rules of \n     the Senate.)\n       B. Supplemental, Minority, and additional views. A Member \n     of the Committee who gives notice of his or her intention to \n     file supplemental, Minority or additional views at the time \n     of final Committee approval of a measure or matter, shall be \n     entitled to not less than 3 calendar days in which to file \n     such views, in writing, with the chief clerk of the \n     Committee. Such views shall then be included in the Committee \n     report and printed in the same volume, as a part thereof, and \n     their inclusion shall be noted on the cover of the report. In \n     the absence of timely notice, the Committee report may be \n     filed and printed immediately without such views. (Rule XXVI, \n     Sec. 10(c), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       C. Notice by Subcommittee Chairmen. The Chairman of each \n     Subcommittee shall notify the Chairman in writing whenever \n     any measure has been ordered reported by such Subcommittee \n     and is ready for consideration by the full Committee.\n       D. Draft reports of Subcommittees. All draft reports \n     prepared by Subcommittees of this Committee on any measure or \n     matter referred to it by the Chairman, shall be in the form, \n     style, and arrangement required to conform to the applicable \n     provisions of the Standing Rules of the Senate, and shall be \n     in accordance with the established practices followed by the \n     Committee.

All Committee reports, \n     accompanying a bill or joint resolution of a public character \n     reported by the Committee, shall contain (1) an estimate, \n     made by the Committee, of the costs which would be incurred \n     in carrying out the legislation for the then current fiscal \n     year and for each of the next 5 years thereafter (or for the \n     authorized duration of the proposed legislation, if less than \n     5 years); and (2) a comparison of such cost estimates with \n     any made by a Federal agency; or (3) in lieu of such estimate \n     or comparison, or both, a statement of the reasons for \n     failure by the Committee to comply with these requirements as \n     impracticable, in the event of inability to comply therewith. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 11(a), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       Each such report shall also contain an evaluation, made by \n     the Committee, of the regulatory impact which would be \n     incurred in carrying out the bill or joint resolution. The \n     evaluation shall include (a) an estimate of the numbers of \n     individuals and businesses who would be regulated and a \n     determination of the groups and classes of such individuals \n     and businesses, (b) a determination of the economic impact of \n     such regulation on the individuals, consumers, and businesses \n     affected, (c) a determination of the impact on the personal \n     privacy of the individuals affected, and (d) a determination \n     of the amount of paperwork that will result from the \n     regulations to be promulgated pursuant to the bill or joint \n     resolution, which determination may include, but need not be \n     limited to, estimates of the amount of time and financial \n     costs required of affected parties, showing whether the \n     effects of the bill or joint resolution could be substantial, \n     as well as reasonable estimates of the recordkeeping \n     requirements that may be associated with the bill or joint \n     resolution. Or, in lieu of the forgoing evaluation, the \n     report shall include a statement of the reasons for failure \n     by the Committee to comply with these requirements as \n     impracticable, in the event of inability to comply therewith. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 11(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n\n\n           RULE 7.

Subcommittee subpoenas. Each Subcommittee is authorized \n     to adopt rules concerning subpoenas which need not be \n     consistent with the rules of the Committee; provided, \n     however, that in the event the Subcommittee authorizes the \n     issuance of a subpoena pursuant to its own rules, a written \n     notice of intent to issue the subpoena shall be provided to \n     the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Committee, or \n     staff officers designated by them, by the Subcommittee \n     Chairman or a staff officer designated by him/her immediately \n     upon such authorization, and no subpoena shall be issued for \n     at least 48 hours, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, from \n     delivery to the appropriate offices, unless the Chairman and \n     Ranking Minority Member waive the 48-hour waiting period or \n     unless the Subcommittee Chairman certifies in writing to the \n     Chairman and Ranking Minority Member that, in his or her \n     opinion, it is necessary to issue a subpoena immediately.\n       F. Subcommittee budgets. During the first year of a new \n     Congress, each Subcommittee that requires authorization for \n     the expenditure of funds for the conduct of inquiries and \n     investigations, shall file with the chief clerk of the \n     Committee, by a date and time prescribed by the Chairman, its \n     request for funds for the two (2) 12-month periods beginning \n     on March 1 and extending through and including the last day \n     of February of the 2 following years, which years comprise \n     that Congress.

The Chairman may request \n     additional reports from the Subcommittees regarding their \n     activities and budgets at any time during a Congress. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 9, Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n\n\n             RULE 8. CONFIRMATION STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES\n\n       A. Standards. In considering a nomination, the Committee \n     shall inquire into the nominee's experience, qualifications, \n     suitability, and integrity to serve in the position to which \n     he or she has been nominated. The Committee shall recommend \n     confirmation, upon finding that the nominee has the necessary \n     integrity and is affirmatively qualified by reason of \n     training, education, or experience to carry out the functions \n     of the office to which he or she was nominated.\n       B. Information concerning the Nominee. Each nominee shall \n     submit the following information to the Committee:\n       (1) A detailed biographical resume which contains \n     information relating to education, employment, and \n     achievements;\n       (2) Financial information, in such specificity as the \n     Committee deems necessary, including a list of assets and \n     liabilities of the nominee and tax returns for the 3 years \n     preceding the time of his or her nomination, and copies of \n     other relevant documents requested by the Committee, such as \n     a proposed blind trust agreement, necessary for the \n     Committee's consideration; and,\n       (3) Copies of other relevant documents the Committee may \n     request, such as responses to questions concerning the \n     policies and programs the nominee intends to pursue upon \n     taking office. At the request of the Chairman or the Ranking \n     Minority Member, a nominee shall be required to submit a \n     certified financial statement compiled by an independent \n     auditor. Information received pursuant to this subsection \n     shall be made available for public inspection; provided, \n     however, that tax returns shall, after review by persons \n     designated in subsection (C) of this rule, be placed under \n     seal to ensure confidentiality.\n       C. Procedures for Committee inquiry. The Committee shall \n     conduct an inquiry into the experience, qualifications, \n     suitability, and integrity of nominees, and shall give \n     particular attention to the following matters:\n       (1) A review of the biographical information provided by \n     the nominee, including, but not limited to, any professional \n     activities related to the duties of the office to which he or \n     she is nominated;\n       (2) A review of the financial information provided by the \n     nominee, including tax returns for the 3 years preceding the \n     time of his or her nomination;\n       (3) A review of any actions, taken or proposed by the \n     nominee, to remedy conflicts of interest; and\n       (4) A review of any personal or legal matter which may bear \n     upon the nominee's qualifications for the office to which he \n     or she is nominated. For the purpose of assisting the \n     Committee in the conduct of this inquiry, a Majority \n     investigator or investigators shall be designated by the \n     Chairman and a Minority investigator or investigators shall \n     be designated by the Ranking Minority Member. The Chairman, \n     Ranking Minority Member, other Members of the Committee, and \n     designated investigators shall have access to all \n     investigative reports on nominees prepared by any Federal \n     agency, except that only the Chairman, the Ranking Minority \n     Member, or other Members of the Committee, upon request, \n     shall have access to the report of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation. The Committee may request the assistance of \n     the General Accounting Office and any other such expert \n     opinion as may be necessary in conducting its review of \n     information provided by nominees.\n       D. Report on the Nominee. After a review of all information \n     pertinent to the nomination, a confidential report on the \n     nominee shall be made in the case of judicial nominees and \n     may be made in the case of non-judicial nominees by the \n     designated investigators to the Chairman and the Ranking \n     Minority Member and, upon request, to any other Member of the \n     Committee. The report shall summarize the steps taken by the \n     Committee during its investigation of the nominee and the \n     results of the Committee inquiry, including any unresolved \n     matters that have been raised during the course of the \n     inquiry.\n       E. Hearings. The Committee shall conduct a public hearing \n     during which the nominee shall be called to testify under \n     oath on all matters relating to his or her suitability for \n     office, including the policies and programs which he or she \n     will pursue while in that position. No hearing shall be held \n     until at least 72 hours after the following events have \n     occurred: The nominee has responded to prehearing questions \n     submitted by the Committee; and, if applicable, the report \n     described in subsection (D) has been made to the Chairman and \n     Ranking Minority Member, and is available to other Members of \n     the Committee, upon request.\n       F. Action on confirmation. A mark-up on a nomination shall \n     not occur on the same day that the hearing on the nominee is \n     held. In order to assist the Committee in reaching a \n     recommendation on confirmation, the staff may make an oral \n     presentation to the Committee at the mark-up, factually \n     summarizing the nominee's background and the steps taken \n     during the pre-hearing inquiry.\n       G. Application. The procedures contained in subsections \n     (C), (D), (E), and (F) of this rule shall apply to persons \n     nominated by the President to positions requiring their full-\n     time service. At the discretion of the Chairman and Ranking \n     Minority Member, those procedures may apply to persons \n     nominated by the President to serve on a part-time basis.\n\n\n          RULE 9.

Mr. President, today Congressman John Dingell of Michigan \nbecomes the longest serving member in the history of the United States \nHouse of Representatives. As we observe this notable milestone in time, \nhowever, John Dingell's longevity is really a footnote that does not \neven begin to tell the full story of John and his wonderful partner \nDebbie.\n  Fifty-four years from now, or 154 years from now, when historians \nlook back for models of public service, John Dingell will stand among \nthe best America has to offer. His commitment to the public good, his \nsense of fiduciary duty as a public servant and most of all the spirit, \nthe passion, and the motivation that John brings to his work day in and \nday out, year after year, are nothing short of remarkable.\n  Before John Dingell became a Member of the House, he was a son and a \nstudent of the House. His father, Congressman John Dingell Sr., was a \nNew\n\n[[Page S2135]]\n\nDealer and a passionate advocate of FDR's agenda.\n  As a House page in the late 1930s and early 1940s, John learned the \nintricacies of House procedure. He got to know his way around, and \ndeveloped a profound respect for leaders like Sam Rayburn.\n  Even in his youth, John was anything but a passive observer. When \nJapan attacked Pearl Harbor and FDR came to Congress and declared it a \n``date which will live in infamy,'' John was in the Chamber. In fact, \nJohn saw to it that one audio recorder continued to run even after \nFDR's speech ended, so thanks to him we have a fascinating record of \nthe deliberations afterward that quickly led to the declaration of war \non Japan.\n  When he was 18, John enlisted in the Army. After the war he returned \nto Washington, and, ever a student of the House, he worked as an \nelevator operator here in the Capitol while attending Georgetown, where \nhe received undergraduate and law degrees. As a young lawyer, John \nserved as a clerk for Sandy's and my uncle, Theodore Levin, a Federal \njudge in Michigan who, along with our Dad, had actually campaigned for \nJohn's Dad in the 1930s.\n  A few years later, when his father passed away, John Jr. won the \nspecial election to fill the vacant seat. The son and student became a \nMember of the institution that he had studied so closely and that he \nrespected so deeply. And over the years, the Member would become the \nChairman, and the Chairman would become the Dean--the most senior \nmember of the House of Representatives.\n  While that alone is a significant achievement, the true mark of John \nDingell is his devotion to public service that connects him to the \ngreat men and women of America's storied past whose statues grace this \nCapitol, and the legislation he has influenced that has so improved the \nlives of our people. He contributed to the creation of Medicaid and \nMedicare, to the Civil Rights bills, to the Endangered Species Act and \nthe Clean Air Act. He fought to protect Social Security--which his \nfather helped create.\n  Like all great fighters, when John Dingell is knocked down, he picks \nhimself up. For example, he has helped keep the fight for universal \nhealth care alive by introducing legislation to achieve it in each new \nCongress, just as his father did.\n  John can be tough, running procedural circles around even the most \nskilled legislative adversaries. And he can be gruff, for instance \ncomparing a proposal he thinks is foolish or unnecessary to ``side \npockets on a cow'' or ``feathers on a fish.''\n  But this tough and gruff Congressman has a softer side. His wife \nDebbie is personable and glowing and brings extraordinary energy to \neverything she touches. John and Debbie are each powerhouses in their \nown right, and their relationship is a perfect synergy.\n  While Debbie is everywhere, raising funds for great causes, creating \npersonal relationships that enrich so many lives, John is only where he \nneeds to be--focusing like a laser on legislative and policy goals.\n  There is a common thread in the Dingells' legislative maneuvers, \ncharitable endeavors and even John's unique use of language: they are \nall devoted to the goal of helping working people. People back home \nlove ``Big John'' because they know he is on their side--fighting for \ntheir jobs, their health, their children.\n  That is why, as much evidence as there is of John's influence and \nrespect in the House of Representatives, the best way to really \nunderstand John's impact on the people he represents is to make a visit \nto ``Dingell Country.'' In John's district, people have placed John's \nname on a road, a bridge, a park and a library not just to honor him \nbut to inspire others. Just talk to a few of John's fellow veterans at \nthe VA Medical Center in Detroit. Those vets feel a little better and a \nlittle stronger knowing that they live in the John Dingell VA Medical \nCenter. Or stop by the UAW Region 1a headquarters in Taylor, Michigan, \nand tell them you've stood shoulder to shoulder with John Dingell \nfighting for American workers--and you won't get a warmer welcome \nanywhere in America.\n  John is beloved in his district, and he has been a role model to me \nand to my older brother Sandy since we arrived in Congress. He has also \nbeen a wonderful mentor to us and to the entire Michigan delegation.\n  John has been a son of the House, a student of the House, a Member \nand a Chairman in the House he loves so much. On behalf of Michigan, I \noffer thanks to the now all-time Dean of the House of Representatives, \nJohn Dingell, a great institution within a great institution, for his \ndevotion to public service and to the people of Michigan and the \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/11/senate-section/article/S2135-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BELARUS IMPRISONMENT\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, as chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I \nwould like to bring to the attention of the Senate a situation which is \nliterally a matter of life and death for an American citizen, Emanuel \nZeltser, who has been imprisoned in Belarus since March 12, 2008. Mr. \nZeltser is in desperate and immediate need of serious medical \ntreatment--including a coronary bypass operation.\n  The poor human rights record of President Lukashenka's regime is well \nknown. No American--indeed no human being--should be subjected to the \nkind of treatment Mr. Zeltser has been forced to endure during his \nincarceration. Despite Mr. Zeltser's grave health condition--he suffers \nfrom heart disease, type 2 diabetes, severe arthritis, gout, and \ndangerously elevated blood pressure--Belarusian authorities have \nrepeatedly refused to provide Mr. Zeltser with his prescribed \nmedications.\n  He was initially denied two independent medical evaluations and he \nhas reported being physically assaulted and abused while incarcerated. \nAmnesty International has urged that Belarusian authorities no longer \nsubject Mr. Zeltser to ``further torture and other ill-treatment.''\n  Mr. Zeltser was convicted of ``using false official documents'' and \n``attempted economic espionage'' in a closed judicial proceeding. The \nU.S. Embassy in Minsk criticized the proceedings, noting that it was \ndenied the opportunity to observe the trial. The State Department has \nrepeatedly called for Mr. Zeltser's release on humanitarian grounds. So \nhave others in Congress, especially my colleague on the Helsinki \nCommission, cochairman Representative Alcee Hastings.\n  But now the situation appears dire. Earlier this month, Mr. Zeltser \nwas examined by an American doctor. It was only the second time an \nAmerican physician has been permitted to see Mr. Zeltser. The doctor \nconcluded that ``there is a clear and high risk of sudden death from \nheart attack unless the patient is immediately transferred to a U.S. \nhospital with the proper equipment and facilities. . . . Refusal to \ntransfer Mr. Zeltser to a U.S. hospital is equivalent to a death \nsentence.'' Specifically, Mr. Zeltser is in dire need of a coronary \nbypass procedure. The doctor also determined that because he had been \ndenied prescribed diabetes medication, Mr. Zeltser's left foot may need \nto be amputated.\n  In response to a press inquiry in December, the State Department \ncalled for ``the Belarusian authorities to release Mr. Zeltser on \nhumanitarian grounds before this situation takes an irrevocable turn.'' \nBased on the recent doctor's report it is apparent that such an \nirrevocable turn is imminent unless this American citizen can be \nbrought home promptly for the medical treatment necessary to save his \nlife.\n  Belarus has taken some tentative steps to improve its notably poor \nhuman rights record, in particular the release of several political \nprisoners last August. However, Mr. Zeltser's continued, and \npotentially terminal, imprisonment threatens to override those \ninitially encouraging signs. As such, I strongly urge the Belarusian \nauthorities to release Emanuel Zeltser on humanitarian grounds so that \nhe may obtain the immediate medical treatment his doctor has concluded \nis required if he is to live.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/11/senate-section/article/S2135-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2135-S2138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING CONGRESSMAN WENDELL WYATT\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to mark a sad occasion: the recent \ndeath of one of Oregon's most respected Members of Congress, Wendell \nWyatt, who represented the First District of Oregon from 1965 to 1975. \nHe died peacefully on January 28th at the age of 91 in Portland, OR.\n\n[[Page S2136]]\n\n  With good humor and little interest in partisanship, Wendell Wyatt's \ncongressional career began with his service on the House Interior \nCommittee. He is best known, however, for his work on the House \nInterior Appropriations Subcommittee where his working relationship \nwith its chair, distinguished Washingtonian Julia Butler Hansen, was a \nmodel of effective teamwork across party lines and--in this case--\nacross the Columbia River that separated their congressional districts.\n  The same was true of his relationship with Democratic Congresswoman \nEdith Green, who represented Oregon's Third Congressional District, \nwhich includes most of Portland and is the district I was privileged to \nrepresent in the House before coming to the Senate. In fact, my \nPortland office is housed in the Edith Green-Wendell Wyatt Federal \nBuilding. Congressman Wyatt and Congresswoman Green--known simply in \nOregon as Edith and Wendell--worked tirelessly together on many \nworthwhile civic projects that improved their city and their adjoining \ncongressional districts. Their good work helped lay the foundation for \nthe Portland we are proud of today.\n  Wendell Wyatt was an advocate for the Federal workforce in Oregon, \nGovernment workers he regarded as good civil servants dedicated to \nserving the public interest. He also loved the individual service \nelement of his work in Congress. Today, most offices call this \n``casework,'' but to Wendell Wyatt it gave him the chance to help an \nindividual constituent with his or her problem when the Federal \nGovernment was unresponsive or trying to put a square peg in a round \nhole. He never disrespected any Government official who was \nimplementing something that had an adverse impact on one of his \nconstituents, but he pressed the case strongly and effectively.\n  As a young Member of the House, I remember other House members and \nlongtime staffers talking about Wendell with great affection and \nadmiration, someone who worked hard, got results, and always with good \nhumor and without partisanship.\n  His colleagues during that era in Congress included Gerald Ford, \nMelvin Laird, George H.W. Bush, and other like-minded House Republican \nmoderates. Like them, he epitomized the saying that ``You could \ndisagree without being disagreeable.'' In Oregon, he was part of a \ngeneration of elected officials whose goals were service, not \npartisanship, including Mark Hatfield and Tom McCall.\n  When he retired from Congress in 1974, Wendell Wyatt returned to \nOregon to become a partner in what is now the State's second largest \nlaw firm, Schwabe Williamson & Wyatt, where he is remembered as someone \nwho rolled up his sleeves to help his clients, to close the deal, and \nto help add economic activity that created jobs for Oregonians.\n  The commitment to public service runs strong in Wendell Wyatt's \nfamily. His son, Bill, was a member of the Oregon Legislature as a \nyoung man, later the chief of staff to an Oregon Governor, and is now \nthe very effective executive director of the Port of Portland. Bill \nWyatt is a longtime friend of mine and of others in the economic and \npolitical leadership of our State, and we all know that the Wyatt \nbloodline for service to our State has passed from father to son.\n  I join his family, colleagues in his law firm, and his many good \nfriends in mourning his death. I join the good citizens of the First \nCongressional District of Oregon, who salute his effective voice for \nthem in Congress. And I stand with so many people throughout Oregon \nwhose lives are better because of Wendell Wyatt's commitment to service \nin Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my \nremarks a few articles about Congressman Wyatt be printed in the \nRecord. First, is the announcement of his death that appeared in the \nPortland City Club Bulletin, followed by the notice of Wyatt's death \nthat appeared in the Oregonian newspaper and the warm editorial about \nWendell. I ask that there next be printed the article in his hometown \nnewspaper, the Daily Astorian, in which local residents reflect on his \nservice to their community. The final document that I request be \nprinted in the Record is the editorial in the Daily Astorian paying \ntribute to the dignity with which Wendell Wyatt served his district, \nour State and the Congress.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From the Portland City Club Bulletin, Feb. 13, 2009]\n\n                  City Club Remembers Wendell J.

He served as an FBI \n     agent and a Marine Corps pilot before being elected to \n     Congress where he served a distinguished, decade-long career. \n     After retiring from office, Wyatt became a partner in the law \n     firm Schwabe, Williamson & Wyatt.\n       Wyatt was a Club member for almost twenty years. He made \n     notable speaking appearances at City Club with the late \n     Congresswoman Edith Green, and the Federal Building on Third \n     Street is dedicated jointly in their names.

He became a partner in the law firm of Schwabe \n     Williamson & Wyatt, and was a commissioner for the Port of \n     Portland and a lobbyist. He became inactive as an attorney in \n     2001 but continued consulting for the firm.\n       In 1975, he pleaded guilty to a technical violation of \n     federal campaign laws, admitting that as chairman of the \n     Oregon Committee to Re-Elect the President, he failed to \n     report a donation to President Richard Nixon's campaign. The \n     Oregonian defended him in an editorial:\n       ``He has had a long and honorable career both in private \n     and public life, including 10 years in Congress; and he has \n     gained the reputation of being not only an exceptionally \n     effective public servant, but one who is scrupulously honest \n     in all of his dealings. He has had both the respect and warm \n     friendship of colleagues in both parties. No one who knows \n     him well believes he intentionally violated the law.''\n       Wyatt was born June 15, 1917, in Eugene and moved to \n     Portland as a teenager. He was editor of the Jefferson High \n     School newspaper and went to the University of Oregon. He \n     dropped out and joined The Oregonian as a copy aide. After a \n     year, he applied to the University of Oregon Law School and \n     was admitted without an undergraduate degree.\n       Wayne Morse was one of his professors, and Wyatt often \n     recalled four-hour evening sessions led by the man who would \n     become the legendary ``Tiger of the Senate.'' Later, the two \n     became political adversaries.\n       After obtaining his law degree, he was an FBI agent and \n     then served as a Marine Corps pilot in the Pacific during \n     World War II.\n       He moved to Astoria after the war and joined the law firm \n     of Albin Norblad, a former Oregon governor and father of U.S. \n     Rep. Walter Norblad; after Walter Norblad died in 1964, Wyatt \n     was elected to fill his vacancy. He was re-elected four \n     times, retiring in 1975, the same year colleague and friend \n     Edith Green, a Democratic congresswoman for 20 years, stepped \n     down. The federal building in downtown Portland is named for \n     Green and Wyatt.\n       Wyatt married Anne Elizabeth Buchanan in the mid-1940s; \n     they divorced. He married Faye Hill in 1962. She predeceased \n     him. He is survived by daughters, Ann Wyatt and Jane Wyatt; \n     stepdaughter, Sandi Kinsley; son, Wendell ``Bill'' Jr., \n     executive director of the Port of Portland; stepson, Larry D. \n     Hill; four grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.\n       A memorial service will be at 1 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 21, \n     2009, in St. Anne's Chapel at Marylhurst University. The \n     family suggests remembrances to the Clatsop County Historical \n     Society.

Wendell Wyatt, R-Ore., was in Congress, from \n     1965 to 1975, you didn't hear the word bipartisan much, \n     because at many levels of American politics, it was a way of \n     life, thus taken for granted.\n       Wyatt died this week at age 91 after a life in politics, \n     law and community leadership. He should be remembered as \n     someone who\n\n[[Page S2137]]\n\n     put the problems of his individual constituents at the \n     forefront of his service in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives.\n       His congressional office was geared toward listening to \n     constituent problems, then bending every effort to solve \n     them--whether the issue was of great national or regional \n     import or simply a mishandled Social Security benefit. Wyatt \n     himself often got personally engaged in the most challenging \n     and vexing details of constituent service.\n       It would not have been useful for Wyatt or his constituents \n     for him to adopt a highly partisan stance when he was in \n     Congress.\n       He was elected to the House in the small GOP freshman class \n     of 1964, the year that Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson \n     laid a historic electoral whipping on Sen. Barry Goldwater, \n     R-Ariz., the great hope of the right wing of the Republican \n     party.\n       It was clear that Wyatt was never going to be part of the \n     majority, and he never was. Thus he had to develop the skills \n     necessary to adequately represent all of the people of \n     Oregon's 1st Congressional District.\n       ``This was more effective than sitting in the back benches \n     and throwing spitballs all day long,'' said his son Bill \n     Wyatt. Instead, the elder Wyatt developed good working \n     relationships with powerful Democrats such as Wayne Aspinall, \n     D-Colo., chairman of the House Interior Committee and Tom \n     Foley, who also entered Congress in 1964 and, much later, \n     became Speaker of the House for a short time.\n       As a congressman, Wyatt was pro-choice, pro-gun-control and \n     the driving force behind efforts to bring commerce to Oregon \n     via the Columbia River. His social views would not sit well \n     in the modern Republican Party, at least the official part of \n     it. They didn't sit that well with the party's establishment \n     back then either, but it still was possible to disagree and \n     be independent-minded and still remain in good standing \n     within the party. Today? It's not as clear. But Wyatt's views \n     then are positions that many Republicans hold privately--or \n     even not-so-privately--today, even if the right's hold on \n     party leadership is much stronger.\n       For Wyatt, though, service was a far bigger motivator than \n     political ideology. In his last campaign, Wyatt even went \n     retail with his orientation toward constituents. His campaign \n     slogan was: ``Wendell Wyatt, your door-to-door Congressman.''\n       His son Bill, of course, has been prominent in Oregon \n     political and economic circles for years, serving as chief of \n     staff for Gov. John Kitzhaber and now as executive director \n     of the Port of Portland. Bill Wyatt also tried elective \n     politics early in his career, as a Democratic candidate for \n     the Oregon Legislature. Worried about whether he would \n     somehow step on his father's political toes, the younger \n     Wyatt brought the matter up. ``He told me, `What makes you \n     happy makes me happy. You don't have to protect me from what \n     you think is the right thing to do.','' Bill Wyatt said. ``He \n     was able to separate what was most important to him and keep \n     it there.''\n       That was the key to what made Wendell Wyatt successful in \n     life--public and private.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Daily Astorian, Feb. 9, 2009]\n\n       North Coast Mourns Former Oregon Congressman Wendell Wyatt\n\n                           (By Patrick Webb)\n\n       Former Astoria Congressman Wendell Wyatt died Wednesday. He \n     was 91.\n       Wyatt, a Republican, served the 1st Congressional District \n     from 1964 until retiring in 1975.\n       Tributes to him focused on his honesty and his ability to \n     get the job done.\n       Denny Thompson of Astoria, who served as honorary Finnish \n     Consul for 35 years, worked closely with Wyatt and praised \n     his ability to reach across the aisle.\n       ``My union friends were all Democrats, but they were \n     working for Wendell Wyatt. They all respected him and he \n     respected everyone in return,'' said Thompson, whose wife, \n     Frankye, was Wyatt's campaign chairwoman for Clatsop County.\n       ``He did everything the proper way--he was completely \n     honest, and he did as much for Clatsop County as anyone.''\n       Wyatt was a well-respected Republican leader who worked \n     especially effectively with Democrat Congresswoman Edith \n     Green. The federal building in Portland was later named for \n     them.\n       Born in Eugene in 1917, Wyatt moved with his family to \n     Portland. He graduated from Jefferson High School, where he \n     had been editor of the high school newspaper, in 1935. He \n     worked briefly as a copy aide for The Oregonian newspaper, \n     earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Oregon in \n     1941 then worked briefly as an FBI agent.\n       When World War II broke out in the Pacific, he enlisted in \n     the U.S. Marine Air Corps and served as a pilot from 1942 \n     until 1946.\n       Afterward, he moved to Astoria and worked for the law firm \n     of Albin Norblad, the former Oregon governor and father of \n     U.S. Rep. Walter Norblad.\n       Tom Brownhill, of Eugene, was district attorney in Clatsop \n     County from 1952 to 1960 and regularly faced Wyatt in the \n     courtroom. ``I had a lot of cases against him,'' said \n     Brownhill, whose daughter Paula, continues the family's legal \n     tradition as a circuit court judge. ``As a lawyer, when he \n     got into a case, he was all-in.''\n       Wyatt hired longtime legal secretary Doris Hughes from \n     another firm in the 1950s--by offering her a raise from $160 \n     to $200 a month. Hughes remembered Wyatt today as a \n     ``wonderful person.''\n       ``He gave the best dictation of anyone I know,'' she \n     recalled. ``He was so smooth. The words just flowed out.''\n       Wyatt was chairman of the Oregon State Republican Central \n     Committee from 1955 until 1957. During that time, George C. \n     Fulton, of Astoria, another contemporary, worked closely with \n     him while serving as Clatsop County GOP chairman.\n       Fulton, also an attorney, described Wyatt as a hard worker. \n     ``He was a good lawyer. He worked hard and he played hard.''\n       When Walter Norblad died in 1965, Wyatt was elected to his \n     congressional seat and served five terms, retiring in 1974.\n       Ted Bugas, a Bumblebee Seafood executive and supporter of \n     Salmon For All, knew Wyatt because both had worked for the \n     FBI and their Astoria offices were in the Post Office and \n     across the street.\n       He recalled one incident as if yesterday.\n       ``One morning we woke up and thought `There's someone in \n     the house! The wife and I were still in bed. In came \n     Wendell--into our room--and said, `I might go to Congress. \n     What do you think of that?' ''\n       Bugas worked with Wyatt on fisheries issues, often \n     traveling to Washington, D.C., often for lobbying efforts. \n     His daughter, Christine, served as an intern in Wyatt's \n     Congressional office.\n       ``He was a great personality,'' said Bugas, who splits his \n     time in retirement between Astoria and California. ``He was \n     very pleasant.''\n       He worked on bills that established the Tualatin \n     Reclamation Project in Washington County and the 40-foot \n     shipping channel in the Columbia River from Astoria to \n     Portland.\n       He was also credited with bills that created Lincoln City's \n     Cascade Head Scenic Area, as well as a bill authorizing the \n     $4 million purchase of ranchlands along the Snake River for \n     public recreation.\n       U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley said, ``Wendell Wyatt truly made his \n     mark on Oregon. Everyone who has appreciated Cascade Head \n     owes Congressman Wyatt a debt of gratitude for establishing \n     this scenic area and those who visit public lands along the \n     Snake River can thank Wendell Wyatt for opening the region to \n     recreation.''\n       The Daily Astorian Publisher Steve Forrester covered \n     Wyatt's political activities in 1974 while substituting for \n     Washington columnist A. Robert Smith.\n       ``Wyatt said to me that he earned `the equivalent of a \n     master's degree' every time he took on a new issue. He was \n     the kind of Republican we no longer see--a solid, pragmatic \n     middle-of-the-road guy,'' Forrester said.\n       ``He was close to President Richard Nixon, and he was \n     unfortunately tarred with that brush when he admitted to his \n     involvement with Nixon's fund-raising--an embarrassing moment \n     in an otherwise unblemished political career.''\n       In 1975, Wyatt admitted a technical violation of campaign \n     laws for failing to report an Oregon GOP donation to Nixon.\n       He stayed active in Republican politics after retiring from \n     Congress and became a partner in the law firm of Schwabe \n     Williamson and Wyatt until his retirement.\n       He became inactive as an attorney in 2001, but continued \n     consulting for the firm. He also served as a commissioner for \n     the Port of Portland and a lobbyist.\n       Wyatt was married twice. He divorced his first wife, Anne \n     Elizabeth Buchanan. He married Faye Hill in 1962. She died \n     last year. He had two daughters, Ann and Jane, and a son, \n     Wendell ``Bill'' Wyatt Jr., who is executive director of the \n     Port of Portland and a former chief of staff for Gov. John \n     Kitzhaber, plus step son and stepdaughter, four grandchildren \n     and one great grandchild.\n       A memorial service will be held 1 p.m. Feb. 21 at St. \n     Anne's Chapel at Marylhurst University near Lake Oswego. \n     Contributions may go to the Clatsop County Historical \n     Society.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Daily Astorian, Feb. 2, 2009]\n\n                   Wendell Wyatt Served With Dignity\n\n       Wendell Wyatt, who died last week, was one of those old-\n     school, gentlemanly fellows who served his country and his \n     community without the need for a brass band playing in the \n     background.\n       A Republican, he served the 1st Congressional District, \n     which includes Astoria and the North Coast, from 1965 until \n     retiring in 1975.\n       An Oregonian through and through, he moved to Astoria to \n     practice law after serving as a U.S. Marine Air Corps pilot \n     in World War II. His buddies around the courthouse smile when \n     they remember he practiced law with what they describe as \n     ``considerable tenacity.''\n       When Congressman Walter Norblad died in office, Wyatt took \n     over.\n       In the decade that followed, he served with dignity and \n     pragmatism. Often politicians wax eloquent about bipartisan \n     efforts but don't really mean it. Wyatt talked the talk, and \n     walked the walk, working especially closely with Democrat \n     Congresswoman Edith Green, to get the job done.\n       On fisheries issues, he worked to ensure the interests of \n     the Columbia River came first.\n       Oregon U.S. Sen.

Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       We are your typical lower middle class family. My husband \n     has a good job at FedEx where we are blessed to have good \n     insurance benefits and stability; he is on the bottom of the \n     totem pole, however so the wages leave something to be \n     desired. I used to work for a local childcare center where I \n     got free daycare for our 1-year-old son and was able to \n     contribute an income. Last summer we were in a tight but good \n     place in our lives and decided to purchase our first home. It \n     is not much (it is a humble home) but it is ours. We moved in \n     a week before Christmas and though things were very tight we \n     were still doing ``ok''. We got pregnant again in January and \n     were very excited. After all we were making it. Then in March \n     I lost my job and the economy really started to hit us hard. \n     Our tax returns were spent getting my car fixed, and our \n     incentive package paid the mortgage and some bills. We were \n     thankful that that money was there when we needed it but it \n     was not spent as the government intended. We applied for \n     public assistance while I looked for work but found out that \n     we overqualify by only $60 a month. This was frustrating \n     considering most of the people in the waiting room were not \n     here on a legal basis but their children (born in the U.S.) \n     have right to the same assistance I was applying for. They \n     pay no taxes because they are not here legally and are not \n     required to report their income so of course they qualify and \n     the funny thing is that I saw several drive away in nicer \n     cars than even my parents own. I take in a child or two into \n     our home to bring in some income because I do not have a \n     degree and cannot find a job that pays more than daycare \n     costs.\n       On to gas prices: I drive a Ford Focus, an affordable \n     economical car, and my hubby has his old F-150, which is one \n     of the only assets we actually own. We do not drive big fancy \n     cars that take hundreds of dollars to fill up. My focus cost \n     $43 dollars last time I filled up (last Monday night) and my \n     hubby's truck costs around $65-$70. That may not be a lot to \n     you or anyone with a better job than we, but it is a lot more \n     than we paid last year at this time and it is almost double \n     to fill up my car from what it was when we got married (two \n     years ago in October). Honestly, Senator, we pray our way \n     through every month. It is an honest miracle that we still \n     have our home and that we have made our mortgage for the last \n     4 months. My husband works 12-hour days so the only logical \n     solution was for me to look for a second job. It took a while \n     given that no one wants to hire a lady who is 6 months \n     pregnant. But I am blessed to have found a job at Cracker \n     Barrel being a part-time waitress and working when my husband \n     gets home to take our son and, with the help of family, we \n     make it work. As you can imagine, it does not pay much \n     ($3.35/hour and then tips). I hate this arrangement, and I \n     have not been working there long enough to see the benefits \n     of having two jobs but I keep thinking that if I just keep at \n     it then maybe we can get caught up and maybe even save enough \n     money to pay the mortgage when I go on maternity leave in \n     October. This is a long shot.\n       If gas prices (among other things) were lower it would help \n     alleviate some of the strain on our family. The cost of food \n     has gone up, though, too. If both of those things could be \n     what they were, I may not have to work two jobs never seeing \n     my husband and worrying about if I am going to do something \n     bad to my unborn child by driving my body so hard. Even if it \n     were only gas that went down, we might be able to swing it \n     with just one job once we get caught up. Anything would help \n     us at this point. I work any odd jobs I can find in addition \n     my others. I went and counted votes when the elections took \n     place in May and I made $40, not much but it adds up if you \n     save it! I know we are not as bad off as a lot of other \n     people but we are not doing as well as we let people think \n     either. Who wants to tell their friends and family that they \n     are on the verge of losing everything? We are walking a tight \n     scary line and if we fall off we are screwed. We just keep \n     praying and working hard and so far God has not let us down. \n     I know he will not but I do not know what his definition of \n     ok is either. Maybe you could be the blessing we have been \n     praying for, a small piece of a very big problem but like I \n     said even a little bit can help a lot.\n       Thank you for your time,\n     Kristi, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I travel about 20 miles each direction to work. It is \n     really hurting me financially to continue paying these gas \n     prices, but what am I to do? Quit my job? Try to sell my \n     house so I can move closer to work? At this time I am going \n     to continue to commute and reluctantly put my trust in my \n     government to fix the problem. I am very skeptical that you \n     folks will do anything about it because it seems like the \n     government is more concerned about investigating professional \n     sports and finger pointing about who is to blame for our \n     nation's problems. As a citizen of Idaho and of the United \n     States of America, I can tell you that I really do not care \n     if our nation's problems are a result of Democrats, \n     Republicans, or President Bush. Somebody has to act like a \n     responsible adult, and the American public is waiting to see \n     if our leaders are going to help us. Do you know what it is \n     like to go to the gas station and see the dollar amount on \n     the pump scroll so fast that your head spins?\n       My idea to alleviate our oil problems is to drill in the \n     United States in those areas we know to contain oil. Why not? \n     Who are we saving it for? How many jobs would be created if \n     we were to drill on our own soil? Do not you think that \n     creation of those jobs just might help our economy, as well \n     as diminish our reliance on foreign countries for oil?\n       I appreciate the opportunity to share my story and ideas. \n     Thank you, Senator Crapo. You seem to be the one that is \n     stepping up.\n     Mark, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       In response to your email letter I would like to say that \n     this country must do all of the things you mentioned such as \n     developing our domestic oil and refining capacity; nuclear \n     energy; clean coal; wind; solar; hydroelectric and hamsters \n     on spinning wheels if that is what it takes. However, in \n     order to realistically achieve these goals we must first deal \n     with those forces that have been the stumbling block for many \n     years; the environmentalists and their lackeys.\n       Now is the time to expose these people and their extremist \n     hand-wringing positions for what they are. No reasonable \n     person wants to pollute the air and/or water, but observe the \n     ``sky is falling'' mentality when the Alaska pipeline was \n     proposed. Every conceivable environmental catastrophe was \n     predicted by the environmental lobby. Unfortunately for them, \n     none of it happened. In fact, wildlife flourished after the \n     pipeline went in and there has been no environmental \n     degradation. The time is right to put on the fore court press \n     against these people. Do it; do it today; and do it boldly \n     and courageously. I look forward to reading the headlines in \n     the newspaper to the affect ``Senator Crapo shouts the truth \n     from the Capitol Rotunda''.\n     Mike, Coeur d'Alene.\n                                  ____\n\n       Finally a politician that is listening to the people. Now I \n     know why I voted for you. The first few emails on this site \n     are far more astute in presenting their views than I, but I \n     think we should finally ignore the environmentalists and \n     drill ASAP. The very act of starting to drill would probably \n     bring down oil prices. Thanks for listening to your citizens \n     in Idaho.\n     AuDeane Cox.\n                                  ____\n\n       My initial reaction to the request for response was that it \n     would be a waste of time. I am very frustrated with the \n     ineffectiveness of Congress. The [partisan] in-fighting seems \n     to be more important than the welfare of the Nation. I wish I \n     could believe that the Senator would actually see/read the \n     responses sent to him instead of just a compilation of data, \n     but I do not.\n       In response to your request: One solution to saving gas, \n     which would only be a small savings per vehicle but huge \n     nationwide, would be to better manage the stoplights in every \n     town and city. During the times of day and/or at locations \n     where there is light traffic, the stoplights could be set \n     such that the busiest street would get a flashing yellow \n     caution signal and the minor street would have a flashing red \n     stop/go signal. Each intersection would have to be evaluated \n     separately for peak loads versus times of day. The largest \n     impact would be during the night time hours. Not only would \n     this save gas, it would save wear and tear on the vehicles--\n     especially the brakes. Major intersections should be \n     unaffected, day or night. What I have suggested would have a \n     minimal cost--only manpower, to re-set the timers in the \n     control boxes. Another possibility, which would be costly, \n     would be to change-out the stoplight controllers to the type \n     that senses traffic and only change the signal as needed. But \n     either way, having to sit at a red light when there is zero \n     cross traffic is foolish, especially when there is an easy \n     solution.\n       A second topic that is energy-related is the ethanol craze. \n     Too many people are getting too caught-up in the ``green'' \n     philosophy, and not enough people are looking at the real \n     costs of what they are promoting. You are taking food off of \n     people's tables just to put it into fuel tanks. It costs \n     every bit as much to process corn into gas as crude costs, \n     there is no savings at the pump and the price of food at the \n     grocer's is skyrocketing. This is a joke at this time! If the \n     use of wheat\n\n[[Page S2139]]\n\n     straw, corn stalks, hay, etc. (i.e. by-products), for ethanol \n     production can be perfected, then you would have something \n     worthwhile.\n       Further, the request also asked for a brief statement as to \n     how the energy problem was affecting people. I am somewhat \n     past the age that I expected/wanted to retire. But with the \n     problems with the stock market, banking, mortgages, inflation \n     (principally due to energy policies--or lack of same), etc., \n     I am reluctant to go into retirement. Congress could help \n     many retirees if they would rescind the income tax on Social \n     Security. One of the assurances when Social Security was \n     implemented was that it would not be taxed.\n     Don.\n                                  ____\n\n       I thank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts. Next \n     to the air we breathe and the water we drink, energy is tied \n     to everything in life we do. Our entire economy is centered \n     on affordable energy. As energy increases in cost (far too \n     fast to be able to adjust to) everything else does as well \n     since it is energy that is used for production, delivery, and \n     services. As a nation, we cannot be held hostage to a \n     dependency on other countries who hold major energy reserves \n     that they are willing to exploit and yet keep the majority of \n     their citizens uneducated and living in the stone ages. These \n     foreign energy-controlling countries know that the American \n     way of life and our infrastructure and economy is based on \n     energy and will continue to use energy to gain control over \n     our domestic and foreign politics. We as Americans must not \n     allow ourselves to be dependent on foreign energy sources and \n     not allow ourselves to be held hostage by domestic legal \n     blocks by certain environmental groups who wish to prevent \n     our country from being able to explore and produce our own \n     energy sources. What we need to be able to do is take a step \n     back to the early 60s where John Kennedy was able to spur on \n     an all out effort to put a man on the moon by the end of the \n     decade. We need to approve a measure to take emergency action \n     now to start utilizing our own resources of energy to shift \n     away from foreign dependence and at the same time take major \n     efforts to promote expansion and creation of other resources \n     as alternatives and how to make a gallon of gas go much \n     farther than it does today. We need to stop blocking nuclear \n     power plant creations with years of legal/environmental \n     suits, push for the development of affordable efficient \n     battery cells for electric vehicle conversion. For roughly \n     $5,000 a small car or truck can be converted to use DC \n     electric but current lead acid cells do not hold enough \n     charge for reasonable distance (limited to approximately \n     40 miles mile per charge) and are limited to lower speeds \n     of 35-45 mph, making impractical for interstate or longer \n     commutes, and lead acid batteries will only handle a \n     limited number of charge and discharge cycles before \n     needing replacement. I am all for and encourage wind and \n     solar alternatives as well. These alternatives need to be \n     backed and supported by state and federal incentives (tax \n     credits to offset some of the costs) to encourage resident \n     and business use and promote demand so that production \n     costs can be reduced. Prizes have been offered privately \n     to developed space vehicles that can takes passengers on \n     joy rides to the edge of space. Our government should be \n     doing the same to encourage development of alternative \n     energy. From a constituent viewpoint, congress and our \n     countries executive administration have been ignoring for \n     too long developing these alternatives. We should have \n     learned from the 1970s implied shortage of oil and effects \n     it had on our economy, but as soon as cheap oil was dumped \n     on the market we became happy and no efforts have been \n     made to move away from foreign dependence on oil. We as a \n     country did this to ourselves and now have to act \n     immediately to solve our energy issues. This was probably \n     more then you were asking for. How I am personally \n     affected by high fuel prices is no different than others. \n     I cannot afford to fly my aircrafts as often as I use to, \n     or drive to my cabin in Garden Valley as often as I like. \n     The pump is painful and it has impacted my desire to make \n     larger purchases. I am remodeling my home instead of \n     looking to move to a new one. If I were to buy new where I \n     would like to buy to have a large home or lot, it would \n     increase my commute and commute expenses. We eat out less \n     and as people who love to travel, we have three time \n     shares that are going to waste because of the rising cost \n     of airfare. So far we can still feed ourselves but as \n     large company expenses for energy goes up, cut backs will \n     be made in other areas such as employee salary and head \n     count. So rising fuel costs is going to be felt everywhere \n     and on everything.\n     Michael, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       The question seems to be whether or not the United States \n     needs to drill for our own oil. That seems a no brainer to \n     me. I believe we depend on other countries far too much as it \n     is. It is time we started developing our own method of \n     providing energy without the use of foreign oil. There seems \n     to be an argument that drilling our own oil will not help in \n     the short term. That may be right, but we need to start now \n     so that this development can get underway for the future. If \n     not now, when? We are a nation founded on the principal that \n     we can take care of ourselves and do not need others to make \n     our country self-reliant and strong. The time is now to start \n     to drill for our own oil and if need be to build more \n     refineries to develop it into usable forms. I truly believe \n     if our country does not start taking care of its own energy \n     resources, we will be putting ourselves in jeopardy as a \n     strong independent nation.\n       Personally, I will have enough gas to get to work and back. \n     However, I will no longer have enough to go visit my 3-week-\n     old grandson and my other family who live 200 miles away. I \n     teach school and even though I am at the top of the pay scale \n     I have to live on a very tight budget. I am waiting to see \n     how this gas increase affects the amount of money I have left \n     to eat on. I am afraid the old adage, ``To rob Peter to pay \n     Paul'', will be in use shortly. My whole family helps each \n     other financially. I help my son who has a hard time finding \n     a job that pays more than minimum wage. My sisters help their \n     children who also have minimum wage-paying jobs and our \n     parents help all of us. Now that these prices are so high, we \n     will not be able to help each other and who knows what will \n     happen. One of my sisters and I do not even own our own \n     homes, so we do not have the equity of a home to rely on.\n       There are many other issues I feel strongly about; \n     demanding countries pay us the money they have borrowed, \n     equal taxation for all Americans, minimum wages, the war in \n     Iraq, etc, but those are issues for other communications\n       Thanks for asking for our input. I hope this input helps \n     convince legislators that we had better start taking care of \n     our middle and lower classes if this nation is to once again \n     be strong, self-reliant, and independent.\n     Kathy, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       There are six of us living in our house.

Mr. President, today marks the 60th wedding anniversary of \nRichard and Virginia Howrigan. I am happy to have the opportunity to \ncongratulate my good friends who have given so much to the State of \nVermont.\n  The Howrigans are one of the best-known families in Franklin County; \ntheir family name has been synonymous with successful and conscientious \ndairy farming for decades. Marcelle and I value our friendship with \nthem.\n  Over the course of the past 60 years, Robert and Virginia have worked \nand grown together. They are wonderful parents, hard workers, and have \nalways remained true to their faith.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have an excerpt from a \nFebruary 8, 2009, Burlington Free Press article honoring the Howrigans \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, Feb. 8, 2009]\n\n                Couples Share Secrets of Love, Marriage\n\n                           (By Sally Pollack)\n\n       Flowers, chocolates and candlelight dinners mark \n     Valentine's Day. But what marks marriage, day after day, year \n     by year, decade upon decade? The Burlington Free Press asked \n     four couples who together have been married a combined 240 \n     years what it takes to make a marriage work. We'll let the \n     pros do the talking:\n\n\n           Virginia and Robert Howrigan, Fairfield, 60 years\n\n       Virginia and Robert Howrigan will celebrate their 60th \n     anniversary Thursday. They are retired farmers who live in \n     Fairfield. The couple worked together on their dairy farm and \n     raised nine children.\n       Robert Howrigan will turn 90 in May; Virginia is 80. They \n     met at a soda fountain in a St. Albans drugstore, where \n     Virginia scooped ice cream. For the Howrigans, who were \n     married on Lincoln's birthday, Valentine's Day was never a \n     significant event. ``Mostly we remember Lincoln,'' Virginia \n     said.\n       Robert milked cows the morning the couple were married at a \n     church in St. Albans. The work went on and on: The Howrigans \n     stopped doing farm chores four years ago. Tolerance, patience \n     and perseverance are central to the marriage's longevity, \n     Virginia said.\n       ``You make the best of what you have and keep going,'' \n     Virginia said. ``You get up in the morning and go with the \n     flow. You know what you've got to do. You don't have to look \n     around for work. There's plenty of it everywhere.'' Robert \n     and Virginia and their children ate all their meals together. \n     Together, the couple talked everything over.\n       ``We were able to keep family together,'' she said. ``All \n     our decisions were joint. We do\n\n[[Page S2140]]\n\n     our bills together.'' Robert said two things form the \n     cornerstone of his 60-year marriage: Love and understanding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/11/senate-section/article/S2140-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       REMEMBERING MILLARD FULLER\n\n Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, this week, Millard Fuller, \ncofounder of Habitat for Humanity, passed away. Millard Fuller \ndedicated his life to helping families fulfill the dream of \nhomeownership. Fuller was a selfless entrepreneur who left his fruitful \ncareer to start a nonprofit organization that used no-interest loans \nand ``sweat equity'' to give low income families the chance to own \ntheir own homes. I can tell you from firsthand experience that Fuller \nmade a huge difference in the lives of thousands of American families.\n  Millard Fuller's efforts didn't stop at our national borders. Indeed, \nHabitat for Humanity builds homes in partnership with homeowners in \nvirtually every country on the planet.\n  Fifteen years ago, I was the executive director for Habitat for \nHumanity in Portland, OR. Helping build homes for those who couldn't \notherwise afford them provides stability and gives families confidence.\n  I saw in the faces of the Habitat family members how much it meant to \nown their own homes. These homes were also important to the children. I \nremember one family with two young daughters who were so excited to be \nable to have their friends over for the very first time in their lives.\n  Millard Fuller will be missed, but his legacy and organization will \nlive on. I know that I join hundreds of thousands of families in being \nso appreciative for everything Fuller has done for so many hardworking \nAmericans and for our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/11/senate-section/article/S2140-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING BANGOR FLORAL COMPANY\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, this Saturday, we celebrate \nValentine's Day, when couples across the world take a moment to slow \ndown and show each other their appreciation and love. Along with ``Be \nMy Valentine'' cards and boxes of chocolate, one of the symbols most \nconnected with this special day is a beautiful bouquet of red roses. \nWith that in mind, I rise to recognize a small florist in my home State \nof Maine that continually provides customers with quality flowers and \ngifts--and at this time of year, makes Valentine's Day a sweet event.\n  Bangor Floral Company, founded in 1925, is a historic floral shop \nlocated in downtown Bangor. Housed in a converted, turn-of-the-century \nchurch, Bangor Floral prides itself on fresh flowers, creative \narrangements, and responsive customer service. From red and pastel \nroses, to bright lilies, chrysanthemums, and snapdragons, Bangor Floral \nexpertly prepares beautiful bouquets for any occasion. Bangor Floral \nalso organizes a variety of fresh fruit baskets and gift baskets that \ninclude cookies, candies, stuffed animals, and balloons. To keep his \nflowers fresh, Phil Frederick, owner of Bangor Floral Company, \npurchases his flowers locally whenever possible, and does not pass any \nadditional costs onto the customer. Mr. Frederick, a third generation \nflorist, also offers his clients a 50 percent discount off all cut \nflowers from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. each afternoon, fashioning this sale a \n``happy hour.''\n  Around Valentine's Day, Mr. Frederick engages in a creative and \nhumorous television and radio advertising campaign for his flowers that \nresidents from across the region will recognize. In his television ad, \nMr. Frederick dresses as a doctor and carries a stethoscope, calling \nhimself ``Doctor Valentine.'' The popular ad has run in the Bangor area \nfor several years, bringing smiles to the faces of his customers and \nincreasing Mr. Frederick's sales.\n  Mr. Frederick is also very committed to the local community. A member \nof the Bangor Rotary Club, Mr. Frederick gives flowers to fellow \nRotarians for their birthdays. He also donates flowers to various \norganizations across Bangor for fundraising purposes. Mr. Frederick is \ncurrently president of the Husson Alumni Board, as well as a board \nmember of the Oncology Support Foundation, which provides resources and \ninformation to cancer patients and their families throughout Maine. The \nlatter is a cause near and dear to Mr. Frederick, who is a cancer \nsurvivor himself. Additionally, the Bangor Rotary Club has honored Mr. \nFrederick by naming him a Paul Harris Fellow, as someone who has truly \nexhibited the creed of ``service above self'' in his everyday life.\n  In the era of online and telephone-based florists, Bangor Floral \nCompany allows customers the opportunity to see and discuss the proper \narrangement, and to truly ``smell the roses.'' My sincerest thanks to \nPhil Frederick for all of his generous efforts, and my best wishes to \neveryone at Bangor Floral for a pleasant Valentine's season and a \nsuccessful year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/11/senate-section/article/S2140-3", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/11/senate-section/article/S2140-4", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/11/senate-section/article/S2140-5", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 632.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to \nrelease restrictions on the use of certain property conveyed to the \nCity of St. George, Utah for airport purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I, along with the senior senator from \nUtah, am introducing today legislation to authorize the Secretary of \nTransportation to release restrictions on the use of certain property \nconveyed to the city of St. George, Utah for airport purposes.\n  On October 17, 2008, the City of St. George, UT, and the Federal \nAviation Administration, FAA, broke ground on the construction of a new \nreplacement airport, which will provide enhanced air service to the \nover 300,000 residents of southern Utah. The total project will cost \n$168 million and the start of operations at the replacement airport is \nscheduled for January 1, 2011.\n  The project is being funded largely through Federal grants covered by \na letter of intent from the FAA in the amount of $119 million.\n  The City of St. George is financing its $44 million local share of \nthe replacement airport through the sale of the existing airport \nproperty totaling 274 acres to Anderson Development Services Inc.\n  Recently it was discovered that 40 acres of the existing airport site \nwas acquired by the City of St. George under Section 16 of the Federal \nAirport Act of 1946 (60 Stat. 173; 49 U.S.C. 1115) and can only be used \nfor airport purposes.\n  The United States Secretary of the Interior issued a patent to the \ncity of St. George in 1951 for the 40 acres and the city signed a deed \nto the land dated August 28, 1973, which contains a reverter deed \nrestriction that if the land ceased to be used for airport purposes, \nthe title would revert back to the United States Secretary of \nTransportation.\n  Federal legislation is required to authorize the Secretary of \nTransportation to release this reverter deed restriction on the use of \nthis 40 acre parcel so the sale of the entire 274 acre airport can go \nthrough. A similar legislation (Public Law 94-244) releasing identical \ndeed restrictions was enacted for the City of Grand Junction, CO; in \n1976.\n  The legislation requires that upon release from these restrictions, \nthe City of St. George, UT, must sell the 40 acre parcel for fair \nmarket value, which is estimated at $5 million, and the proceeds must \nbe given to the FAA for the development, improvement, operation, or \nmaintenance of the replacement airport as part of St. George's local \ncontribution.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this straight-forward legislation. \nAll funds will still be directed to the FAA. However, this minor \ncorrection will go a long way in assisting one of the fastest growing \ncounties in the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 412. A bill to establish the Federal Emergency Management Agency \nas an independent agency, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a bill I had \nintroduced with then-Senator Hillary Clinton on two previous occasions. \nIt is interesting, because this bill didn't have a lot of opposition in \nthe Senate. It did, however, have some opposition from the Bush \nadministration. What we were attempting to do was to take the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency out from under where it was put, in the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, by the previous administration and \ngive it independent status. This is something that has been talked \nabout for a long period of time.\n  We can draw from our experience in Oklahoma and the fact that we had \na devastating tornado go through--as we did last night, although it was \neven worse--which killed many people. At that time, James Lee Witt was \nthe FEMA Director. He was President Clinton's appointee. I will always \nremember when that happened. A matter of a\n\n[[Page S2149]]\n\nfew short hours after it happened, I called Mr. Witt and he met me in \nOklahoma, and we got it done. At that time, FEMA was under the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. It was under the Stafford Act \nand virtually had independent status at that time.\n  Contrast that with only a few months ago when GEN Russel Honore, the \ngeneral placed in charge of the military's relief efforts following \nHurricane Katrina, said that FEMA and the Department of Homeland \nSecurity should be separate agencies. In an interview reported in \nPolitico, General Honore said of FEMA:\n\n       I just think we've had some experience that demonstrates \n     that the best thing to do is separate it and make it a \n     separate agency.\n\n  Most importantly, President Obama said in remarks he delivered in New \nOrleans in February of last year:\n\n       If catastrophe comes, the American people must be able to \n     call on a competent government . . . the Director of FEMA \n     will report to me . . . and as soon as we take office, my \n     FEMA director will work with emergency management officials \n     in all 50 States to create a National Response Plan. Because \n     we need to know--before disaster comes--who will be in \n     charge; and how the Federal, State and local governments will \n     work together to respond.\n\n  I talked to the President a few minutes ago. He still has these same \nfeelings. I think it is very appropriate now to bring up something we \nhad talked about before. I know the Democratic platform, for example, \nhas a provision which states that the FEMA Director will report \ndirectly to the President, and I couldn't agree more. I don't agree \nwith a lot of things from the Democratic platform, but I do agree with \nthat.\n  Oklahoma has had more than its share of natural disasters. Only last \nnight, three confirmed tornadoes touched down throughout Oklahoma, \nimpacting the communities of Oklahoma City, Edmond, Pawnee, and a small \ncommunity called Lone Grove. In Lone Grove, this very tiny community, \neight people were killed. There are 35 still missing, so I think the \ndeath toll, unfortunately, could rise above that. I had occasion to \ntalk to civic leaders there--Gary Hicks and city manager Marianne \nElfert--this morning, and the number of Lone Grove residents who are \nmissing right now is still not determined. So I think it is a real \ndisaster.\n  It wasn't that long ago that we had the Eagle Picher area of Oklahoma \nhit by a tornado, and that was a very similar thing there, with seven \ndeaths in that case. On May 1 of last year, I surveyed other tornado \ndamage up there with Secretary Chertoff and FEMA Director Paulison, \nGovernor Henry, and Congressman Boren. As I said, seven people were \nkilled, but that didn't go quite as smoothly as we would have hoped.\n  FEMA's integration into the Department of Homeland Security in 2003 \nadded an extra layer of bureaucracy and removed much of the autonomy \nthat once kept the agency operating efficiently. We learned in the \naftermath of Hurricane Katrina that the extra coordination required \nbetween the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency was at least partly responsible for the shortcomings \nof the Federal response. I visited the area right after Katrina, and I \nthink they did a much better job than the press portrayed, but I still \nthink that extra level of bureaucracy created a problem in getting \nthings done immediately.\n  My legislation takes the necessary steps in giving the Director of \nFEMA Cabinet level status in the event of a natural disaster and acts \nof terrorism and makes that person the principal adviser to the \nPresident, Homeland Security Council, and the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity. So we are kind of reversing it, and he is going to be in a \nCabinet-level position. Obviously, things can then be done a lot faster \nand a lot better. Perhaps most importantly, the legislation defines the \nprimary mission and specific activities of the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency and its Director, and places directly upon them the \nobligation to ensure FEMA's mission is carried out.\n  Now, that is exactly what President Obama said while he was \ncampaigning for President and what he reaffirmed to me today on the \ntelephone.\n  Let me explain some other events that originally led me to introduce \nthis legislation. Oklahoma first encountered significant problems with \nFEMA when wildfires ravaged the State in 2005 and 2006. These \ndevastating wildfires swept through the entire State, leading to \ndeclarations for public assistance, individual assistance, and hazard \nmitigation funding. In January of 2007, Oklahoma encountered severe \nwinter storms with devastating results. These storms led to prolonged \nloss of power and extensive building damage for many of my \nconstituents. One of my constituents happened to be my wife--we have \nbeen married 49 years--and she was without electricity for 9 days, so \nthat does get your attention.\n  Later this year, Oklahoma was hit by heavy rain, tornadoes, and \nflooding from May through September. The State made a number of \ndisaster declarations during each of these periods, but each and every \ntime, the process it took to obtain aid from FEMA became increasingly \ndifficult, wrought with indecisiveness and an inability of Homeland \nSecurity to communicate with each other. Prior to the placement of FEMA \nunder DHS, my State had not encountered nearly the same level of \nbureaucratic delays or communications as it has since that time.\n  Oklahoma has also struggled with FEMA regarding the determination of \ndates of incident periods, which is why I put language in my bill to \ngive deference to the State's documentation regarding the dates of such \nincidents. Now, some of you guys are not from States where you have the \nnumber of disasters we have had, so it is something you are not as \nfamiliar with. But we certainly are. I see the junior Senator from \nOklahoma on the floor here, and he knows too that we live through these \nthings on a regular basis. We have had tornadoes, ice storms, \nwindstorms, and other things people haven't had.\n  I think Senator Clinton and I were right when we introduced this the \nfirst time, and I believe it is consistent with what President Obama \nhas reaffirmed to me as recently as today. It will be a better \narrangement and I will be looking for supporters.\n  We have introduced the bill. It is S. 412. Again, this bill takes \nFEMA out from under DHS and gives it more of an independent status so \nit can respond in a more rapid way as it did prior to 2003.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Reed, Mr. \n        Akaka, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Tester, Mr. Brown, Mr. Merkley, Mr. \n        Kerry, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Harkin, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. \n        Whitehouse, and Mr. Casey):\n  S. 414. A bill to amend the Consumer Credit Protection Act, to ban \nabusive credit practices, enhance consumer disclosures, protect \nunderage consumers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be reintroducing \ncomprehensive credit card legislation that would reform credit card \npractices and prohibit card issuers from continuing policies that are \nthreatening the financial security of American consumers and their \nfamilies. The Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure \nAct, Credit CARD Act, will help to end the practices that cost American \nfamilies billions of dollars each year.\n  This is a time of serious hardship for American families. As losses \nmount as a result of the economic crisis, lenders are squeezing \nconsumers, often unfairly and without adequate notice, by raising \ncredit card rates and tightening repayment terms. Credit card \ndelinquency rates are inching higher, and repayment rates are dipping. \nAt a time when Americans are becoming increasingly reliant on credit \ncards, credit card companies are being more aggressive about finding \nways to charge their customers. Over $17 billion in credit card penalty \nfees were charged to Americans in 2006--a ten-fold increase from what \nwas charged just ten years ago. These penalties are contributing to the \navalanche of credit card debt under which many American consumers \nincreasingly find themselves buried.\n  In my travels around Connecticut, I hear frequently about the burden \nof these credit card practices from constituents. Connecticut has the \nthird-\n\n[[Page S2150]]\n\nhighest median amount of credit card debt in the country--$2,094 per \nperson. Non-business bankruptcy filings in the State are increasing, \nand in the second quarter of last year, credit card delinquencies \nincreased in 7 of the 8 counties in the State.\n  In December, the Federal Reserve, Office of Thrift Supervision, and \nNational Credit Union Administration finalized unfair and deceptive \nacts and practices rules aimed at curbing some of these practices. For \nexample, for customers in good standing the new rules will prevent \nissuers from applying interest rate increases retroactively to credit \ncard debt incurred prior to the interest rate increase. They will also \nhelp ensure that issuers apply payments fairly, and extend the time \nthat consumers have to make their credit card payments. The rules are a \ngood first step in providing needed consumer protections in some areas. \nThey fall short in other important areas, however, failing to address \nissues including universal default, ``any time any reason'' repricing, \nmultiple overlimit fees, and youth marketing, which I'll explain in a \nmoment.\n  In anticipation of rules going into effect in July of 2010, issuers \nare raising their interest rates and cutting lines of credit even on \nconsumers with a long and unblemished history of good payment, thereby \nunderscoring the need for this legislation.\n  That is why I am reintroducing the Credit CARD Act. This bill will \nhelp to reform credit card practices that drag so many American \nfamilies further and further into debt, and prevent banks from taking \nadvantage of consumers through confusing, misleading, and unfair terms \nand procedures. It strengthens regulation and oversight of the credit \ncard industry and prohibits the unfair and deceptive practices that in \nfar too many instances keep consumers mired in debt.\n\n  Among its other provisions, the CARD Act will eliminate imposition of \nexcessive fees and penalties; universal default provisions that permit \ncredit card issuers to increase interest rates on cardholders in good \nstanding for reasons unrelated to the cardholder's behavior with \nrespect to that card; ``Any time any reason'' changes to credit card \nagreements--the bill prevents issuers from unilaterally changing the \nterms of a credit card contract for the length of the card agreement; \nand retroactive interest rate increases, unfair payment allocation \npractices, and double-cycle billing.\n  The Credit Card Act also contains additional critical consumer \nprotections. Among other things, the bill would: allow customers who \nclose their accounts to pay under the terms existing at the time the \naccount is closed; ensure that cardholders receive sufficient \ninformation about the terms of their account; require issuers to lower \npenalty rates that have been imposed on a cardholder after 6 months if \nthe cardholder meets the obligations of the credit card terms; and \nenhance regulators' ability to protect consumers against unfair credit \ncard practices by giving each federal banking agency the authority to \nprescribe regulations governing unfair or deceptive practices by the \ninstitutions they regulate.\n  The bill also reins in irresponsible lending through a number of \nprovisions aimed at protecting young consumers who lack the ability to \nrepay substantial credit card debt.\n  This legislation incorporates several key concepts included in the \nlegislative proposals put forth by some of my colleagues, notably \nSenators Levin, Menendez, Akaka, and Tester. Each is a cosponsor of \nthis legislation, as are Senators Reed, Schumer, Brown, Merkley, Kerry, \nLeahy, Durbin, Harkin, McCaskill, Whitehouse, and Casey.\n  This bill has the support of a wide array of consumer advocates and \nlabor organizations, including the Center for Responsible Lending, \nConnecticut Public Interest Research Group, the Connecticut Association \nfor Human Services, Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of America, \nConsumers Union, Demos, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the \nNAACP, the National Association of Consumer Advocates, the National \nConsumer Law Center, the National Council of LaRaza, the Service \nEmployees International Union, and the U.S. Public Interest Research \nGroup. The bill also has the support of the National Small Business \nAssociation.\n  As the U.S. economy tightens, financially vulnerable families need \nthe protections of the Credit CARD Act more than ever. That is what the \nAmerican people and the people of Connecticut are demanding. For this \nreason, I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring, and eventually \nin enacting the Credit CARD Act.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my friend and \ncolleague Senator Dodd in reintroducing comprehensive legislation to \ncombat credit card abuses that have been hurting American consumers for \nfar too long. Our bill, which is supported and cosponsored by other \nSenate colleagues as well, is called the Credit Card Accountability \nResponsibility and Disclosure Act, or CARD Act of 2009. With the \neconomic hardships facing Americans today, from falling home prices to \nrising unemployment, it is more important than ever for Congress to act \nnow to stop credit card abuses and protect American families and \nbusinesses from unfair credit card practices.\n  Every day the taxpayer is being asked to foot the bill for our \nbiggest banks' irresponsible lending decisions. America's banking \ngiants can't be allowed to dig themselves out of the hole they are in \nby loading up American families with unfair fees and interest charges. \nEven as the prime rate has plummeted, some credit card companies are \nhiking interest rates on millions of customers who play by the rules. \nIn other words, the banks are punishing the very taxpayers that they \nhave come to, hat in hand, for financial rescue. It can't be allowed to \ncontinue.\n  Credit card companies regularly use a host of unfair practices. They \nhike the interest rates of cardholders who pay on time and comply with \ntheir credit card agreements. They impose interest rates as high as 32 \npercent, charge interest for debt that was paid on time, and, in some \ncases, apply higher interest rates retroactively to existing credit \ncard debt. They pile on excessive fees and then charge interest on \nthose fees. And they engage in a number of other unfair practices that \nare burying American consumers in a mountain of debt. It's long past \ntime to enact legislation to protect American consumers.\n  In December, the Federal Reserve and other bank regulators finally \nissued a regulation to stop some of the most egregiously unfair \npractices. For example, the new credit card regulation stops banks from \nretroactively raising interest rates on cardholders who meet their \nobligations, requires banks to mail credit card bills at least 21 days \nbefore the payment due date, and forces banks to more fairly apply \nconsumer payments. It is a good first step, and long overdue. But the \nregulation regrettably leaves in place many blatantly unfair credit \ncard practices that mire families in debt. It fails to stop, for \nexample, abuses such as charging interest on debt that was paid on \ntime, charging folks a fee simply to pay their bills, and hiking \ninterest rates on a credit card because of a misstep on another, \nunrelated debt, a practice known as universal default. Legislation is \nneeded not only to end those abusive practices--which are not \nprohibited by the Federal Reserve regulation--but also to provide a \nstatutory foundation for that new regulation so that it cannot be \nweakened in the future.\n  The bill we are introducing today will not only help protect \nconsumers and ensure their fair treatment, but it will also make \ncertain that credit card companies willing to do the right thing are \nnot put at a competitive disadvantage by companies continuing unfair \npractices.\n  Some argue that Congress doesn't need to ban unfair credit card \npractices; they contend that improved disclosure alone will empower \nconsumers to seek out better deals. Sunlight can be a powerful \ndisinfectant, but credit cards have become such complex financial \nproducts that even improved disclosure will frequently not be enough to \ncurb the abuses. Some practices are so confusing that consumers can't \neasily understand them. Additionally, better disclosure does not always \nlead to greater market competition, especially when essentially an \nentire industry is using and benefiting from practices that unfairly \nhurt consumers.\n  In 2006, Americans used 700 million credit cards to buy about $2 \ntrillion in\n\n[[Page S2151]]\n\ngoods and services. The average family now has 5 credit cards. Credit \ncards are being used to pay for groceries, mortgage payments, even \ntaxes. And they are saddling U.S. consumers, from college students to \nseniors, with a mountain of debt. The latest figures show that U.S. \ncredit card debt is now approaching $1 trillion. These consumers are \nroutinely being subjected to unfair practices that squeeze them for \never more money, sinking them further and further into debt.\n  Congress acted boldly and quickly to bail out the banks; now is time \nto do something for the consumer. Too many American families are being \nhurt by too many unfair credit card practices to delay action any \nlonger. I commend Senator Dodd, Chairman of the Senate Banking \nCommittee, for tackling credit card reform, and look forward to \nCongress promptly and urgently taking the steps needed to ban unfair \npractices that are causing so much pain and financial damage to \nAmerican families.\n  Abusive credit card practices are a concern that I have been tracking \nover the past several years through the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, which I chair. The Subcommittee held two investigative \nhearings in 2007, exposing those practices, and based on those \nhearings, I introduced legislation--the Stop Unfair Practices in Credit \nCards Act, S. 1395--to ban the outrageous credit card abuses we \ndocumented. I am pleased that Senators McCaskill, Leahy, Durbin, \nBingaman, Cantwell, Whitehouse, Kohl, Brown, Kennedy, and Sanders \njoined as cosponsors. The Dodd-Levin bill we are introducing today \nincorporates almost all of S. 1395, and adds other important \nprotections as well. It is the strongest credit card bill yet.\n  The Dodd-Levin bill includes, for example, the following provisions \nthat also appeared in the bill I introduced with Senator McCaskill and \nothers. It would:\n  No Interest on Debt Paid on Time. Prohibit interest charges on any \nportion of a credit card debt which the card holder paid on time during \na grace period.\n  Prohibition on Universal Default. Prohibit credit card issuers from \nincreasing interest rates on cardholders in good standing for reasons \nunrelated to the cardholder's behavior with respect to that card.\n  Apply Interest Rate Increases Only to Future Debt. Require increased \ninterest rates to apply only to future credit card debt, and not to \ndebt incurred prior to the increase.\n  No Interest on Fees. Prohibit the charging of interest on credit card \ntransaction fees, such as late fees and over-the-limit fees.\n  Restrictions on Over-Limit Fees. Prohibit the charging of repeated \nover-limit fees for a single instance of exceeding a credit card limit.\n  Prompt and Fair Crediting of Card Holder Payments. Require payments \nto be applied first to the credit card balance with the highest rate of \ninterest, and to minimize finance charges.\n  Fixed Credit Limits. Require card issuers to offer consumers the \noption of operating under a fixed credit limit that cannot be exceeded.\n  No Pay-to-Pay Fees. Prohibit charging a fee to allow a credit card \nholder to make a payment on a credit card debt, whether payment is by \nmail, telephone, electronic transfer, or otherwise.\n  The Dodd-Levin bill also includes important additional protections. \nIt would:\n  Require issuers to lower penalty rates that have been imposed on a \ncardholder after 6 months if the cardholder commits no further \nviolations.\n  Enhance protection against unfair and deceptive practices by giving \neach federal banking agency the authority to prescribe regulations \ngoverning unfair or deceptive practices by banks or savings and loan \ninstitutions.\n  Improve disclosure requirements by, for example, requiring issuers to \nprovide individual consumer account information and to disclose the \nperiod of time and total interest it will take to pay off the card \nbalance if only minimum monthly payments are made.\n  Protect young consumers from credit card solicitations.\n  To understand why these protections are needed, I would like to \nprovide a brief overview of some of the most prevalent credit card \nabuses we uncovered and some of the stories that American consumers \nshared with us during the course of the inquiries carried out by my \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations.\n  The first case history we examined illustrates the fact that major \ncredit card issuers today impose a host of fees on their cardholders, \nincluding late fees and over-the-limit fees that are not only \nsubstantial in themselves but can contribute to years of debt for \nfamilies unable to immediately pay them.\n  Wesley Wannemacher of Lima, Ohio, testified at our March 2007 \nhearing. In 2001 and 2002, Mr. Wannemacher used a new credit card to \npay for expenses mostly related to his wedding. He charged a total of \nabout $3,200, which exceeded the card's credit limit by $200. He spent \nthe next six years trying to pay off the debt, averaging payments of \nabout $1,000 per year. As of February 2007, he'd paid about $6,300 on \nhis $3,200 debt, but his billing statement showed he still owed $4,400.\n  How is it possible that a man pays $6,300 on a $3,200 credit card \ndebt, but still owes $4,400? Here's how. On top of the $3,200 debt, Mr. \nWannemacher was charged by the credit card issuer about $4,900 in \ninterest, $1,100 in late fees, and $1,500 in over-the-limit fees. He \nwas hit 47 times with over-limit fees, even though he went over the \nlimit only 3 times and exceeded the limit by only $200. Altogether, \nthese fees and the interest charges added up to $7,500, which, on top \nof the original $3,200 credit card debt, produced total charges to him \nof $10,700.\n  In other words, the interest charges and fees more than tripled the \noriginal $3,200 credit card debt, despite payments by the cardholder \naveraging $1,000 per year. Unfair? Clearly, but our investigation has \nshown that sky-high interest charges and fees are not uncommon in the \ncredit card industry. While the Wannemacher account happened to be at \nChase, penalty interest rates and fees are also employed by other major \ncredit card issuers.\n  The week before our March hearing, Chase decided to forgive the \nremaining debt on the Wannemacher account, and while that was great \nnews for the Wannemacher family, that decision didn't begin to resolve \nthe problem of excessive credit card fees and sky-high interest rates \nthat trap too many hard-working families in a downward spiral of debt.\n  These high fees are made worse by the industry-wide practice of \nincluding all fees in a consumer's outstanding balance so that they \nalso incur interest charges. Those interest charges magnify the cost of \nthe fees and can quickly drive a family's credit card debt far beyond \nthe cost of their initial purchases. It is one thing for a bank to \ncharge interest on funds lent to a consumer; charging interest on \npenalty fees goes too far.\n  A second troubling case history involves Charles McClune, a 51-year-\nold Michigan resident who is married with one child. Mr. McClune has a \ncredit card account which he closed in 1998, and has been trying to pay \noff for more than 10 years. Due to excessive fees and interest rates, \nand despite paying more than four times his original credit card debt \nof less than $4,000, Mr. McClune still owes thousands on his credit \ncard, with no end in sight.\n  Mr. McClune first opened his credit card account while in college, in \n1986, at Michigan National Bank through a student-targeted credit \npromotion. After leaving college, the credit limit on his card was \nincreased to $4,000. By 1993, although he had not exceeded the credit \nlimit through purchases, Mr. McClune had missed some payments and was \nassessed interest and fees that pushed his balance over the $4,000 \nlimit. From 1993 to 1996, he exceeded his limit again, on several \noccasions, due to interest and fee charges. He stopped making purchases \non the credit card in 1995.\n\n  In 1996, Mr. McClune's credit card account was purchased by Chase \nBank. In 1998, Mr. McClune asked Chase to close the account, and Chase \ndid so. Although he never made a single purchase on his credit card \nwhile the account was with Chase, Chase repeatedly increased the \ninterest rate on his account, including after the account was closed. \nIn 2002, for example, his interest rate was about 21 percent; by \nOctober 2005, it had climbed to 29.99 percent where it remained for \nmore than two years until March 2008; it then\n\n[[Page S2152]]\n\ndropped slightly to 29.24 percent. The higher interest rates were \napplied retroactively to Mr. McClune's closed account balance, \nincreasing the size of his minimum payments and his overall debt.\n  Chase also assessed Mr. McClune repeated over-the-limit and late \nfees, which began at $29 and increased over time to $39 per fee. Chase \ncannot locate statements for Mr. McClune's account prior to February \n2001, so there is no record of all the fees he has paid. The records in \nexistence show that, since February 2001, he has paid 64 over-the-limit \nfees totaling $2,200. Those fees stopped after the March 2007 hearing \nbefore my Subcommittee, in which Chase promised to stop charging more \nthan three over-the-limit fees for a single violation of a credit card \nlimit. In addition to the 64 over-the-limit fees, since February 2001, \nChase has charged Mr. McClune nearly $2,000 in late fees.\n  The records also show that since 2001, Mr. McClune was contacted by \ntelephone on several occasions by Chase representatives seeking payment \non his account. If he agreed to make a payment over the telephone, \nChase charged him--without notifying him at the time--a fee of $12 to \n$15 per telephone payment. When asked about these fees, Chase told the \nSubcommittee that the fees were imposed, because on each occasion Mr. \nMcClune had spoken with a ``live advisor.'' Since 2001, he has paid a \ntotal of $160 in these pay-to-pay fees.\n  Altogether, since 2001, Mr. McClune has paid nearly $4,400 in fees on \na debt of less than $4,000. If the more than four years of missing \ncredit card bills were available from 1996 to 2000, this fee total \nwould be even higher. In addition, each fee was added to Mr. McClune's \noutstanding credit card balance, and Chase charged him interest on the \nfee amounts, thereby increasing his debt by thousands of additional \ndollars.\n  In February 2001, Chase records show that Mr. McClune's credit card \ndebt totaled nearly $5,200. For the next 7 years, although he did not \npay every month, Mr. McClune paid nearly $2,000 per year toward his \ncredit card debt, but was unable to pay it off. At one time, he paid \n$150 every two weeks for several weeks. Those payments did not bring \nhis debt under the $4,000 credit limit, or reduce his interest rate.\n  In January 2007, Mr. McClune received a letter from Chase stating \nthat if he made his next payment on time, he would receive a $50 credit \non his debt. Mr. McClune cashed out his IRA and paid $4,000 on his \ncredit card debt. Because he made this payment in February, however, he \ndid not receive the $50 credit for an on-time payment. Instead, he was \nassessed a $39 late fee, a $39 over-the-limit fee, and a $14.95 payment \nfee for making the $4,000 payment over the telephone.\n  Mr. McClune was never offered a payment plan or a reduced interest \nrate by Chase to help him pay down his debt. His credit card bills show \nthat from February 2001 to June 2008, he paid Chase a total of $15,800. \nIf the four years of missing credit card bills from 1996 to 2000 were \navailable, his total payments would likely exceed $20,000. In June \n2008, his credit card bill showed he was charged 29 percent interest \nand a $39 late fee on a balance of $3,300.\n  How could Mr. McClune pay $15,000 to $20,000 on credit card purchases \nof less than $4,000, and still owe $3,300? His credit card statements \nsince 2001 show that he was socked with over $9,700 in interest \ncharges, $2,200 in over-the-limit fees, $2,000 in late fees, and $160 \nin pay-to-pay fees. All of these interest charges and fees were \nassessed by Chase while the account was closed and without a single \npurchase having been made since 1995. Despite his lack of purchases and \npayments totaling $15,800, Chase records show that, from February 2001 \nuntil June 2008, Mr. McClune was able to reduce his credit card balance \nby only about $1,850.\n  Mr. McClune is not trying to avoid his debt. He has made years of \npayments on a closed credit card account that he has not used to make a \npurchase in 13 years. He has paid thousands and thousands of dollars--\nfour and possibly five times what he originally owed--in an attempt to \npay off his credit card account. He is still paying. But his thousands \nof dollars in payments are not enough for his credit card issuer which \nis squeezing him for every cent it can, fair or not, for years on end.\n  Tragically, Mr. McClune and Mr. Wannemacher have a lot of company in \ntheir credit card experiences. The many case histories investigated by \nthe Subcommittee show that responsible cardholders across the country \nare being squeezed by unfair credit card lending practices involving \nexcessive fee and interest charges. The current regulatory regime--even \nwith the new Federal Reserve regulation--is insufficient to prevent \nthese ongoing credit card abuses. Legislation is badly needed.\n  Another galling practice featured in our March hearing involves the \nfact that credit card debt that is paid on time routinely accrues \ninterest charges, and credit card bills that are paid on time and in \nfull are routinely inflated with what I call ``trailing interest.'' \nEvery single credit card issuer contacted by the Subcommittee engaged \nin both of these unfair practices which squeeze additional interest \ncharges from responsible cardholders.\n  Here's how it works. Suppose a consumer who usually pays his account \nin full, and owes no money on December 1st, makes a lot of purchases in \nDecember, and gets a January 1 credit card bill for $5,020. That bill \nis due January 15. Suppose the consumer pays that bill on time, but \npays $5,000 instead of the full amount owed. What do you think the \nconsumer owes on the next bill?\n  If you thought the bill would be the $20 past due plus interest on \nthe $20, you would be wrong. In fact, under industry practice today, \nthe bill would likely be twice as much. That's because the consumer \nwould have to pay interest, not just on the $20 that wasn't paid on \ntime, but also on the $5,000 that was paid on time. In other words, the \nconsumer would have to pay interest on the entire $5,020 from the first \nday of the new billing month, January 1, until the day the bill was \npaid on January 15, compounded daily. So much for a grace period! In \naddition, the consumer would have to pay the $20 past due, plus \ninterest on the $20 from January 15 to January 31, again compounded \ndaily. In this example, using an interest rate of 17.99 percent (which \nis the interest rate charged to Mr. Wannamacher), the $20 debt would, \nin one month, rack up $35 in interest charges and balloon into a debt \nof $55.21.\n  You might ask--hold on--why does the consumer have to pay any \ninterest at all on the $5,000 that was paid on time? Why does anyone \nhave to pay interest on the portion of a debt that was paid by the date \nspecified in the bill--in other words, on time? The answer is, because \nthat's how the credit card industry has operated for years, and they \nhave gotten away with it.\n  There's more. You might think that once the consumer gets gouged in \nFebruary, paying $55.21 on a $20 debt, and pays that bill on time and \nin full, without making any new purchases, that would be the end of it. \nBut you would be wrong again. It's not over.\n  Even though, on February 15, the consumer paid the February bill in \nfull and on time--all $55.21--the next bill has an additional interest \ncharge on it, for what we call ``trailing interest.'' In this case, the \ntrailing interest is the interest that accumulated on the $55.21 from \nFebruary 1 to 15, which is the time period from the day when the bill \nwas sent to the day when it was paid. The total is 38 cents. While some \nissuers will waive trailing interest if the next month's bill is less \nthan $1, if a consumer makes a new purchase, a common industry practice \nis to fold the 38 cents into the end-of-month bill reflecting the new \npurchase.\n  Now 38 cents isn't much in the big scheme of things. That may be why \nmany consumers don't notice these types of extra interest charges or \ntry to fight them. Even if someone had questions about the amount of \ninterest on a bill, most consumers would be hard pressed to understand \nhow the amount was calculated, much less whether it was incorrect. But \nby nickel and diming tens of millions of consumer accounts, credit card \nissuers reap large profits. I think it is indefensible to make \nconsumers pay interest on debt which they pay on time. It is also just \nplain wrong to charge trailing interest when a bill is paid on time and \nin full.\n  My Subcommittee's second hearing focused on another set of unfair \ncredit card practices involving unfair interest\n\n[[Page S2153]]\n\nrate increases. Cardholders who had years-long records of paying their \ncredit card bills on time, staying below their credit limits, and \npaying at least the minimum amount due, were nevertheless socked with \nsubstantial interest rate increases. Some saw their credit card \ninterest rates double or even triple. At the hearing, three consumers \ndescribed this experience.\n  Janet Hard of Freeland, Michigan, had accrued over $8,000 in debt on \nher Discover card. Although she made payments on time and paid at least \nthe minimum due for over two years, Discover increased her interest \nrate from 18 percent to 24 percent in 2006. At the same time, Discover \napplied the 24 percent rate retroactively to her existing credit card \ndebt, increasing her minimum payments and increasing the amount that \nwent to finance charges instead of the principal debt. The result was \nthat, despite making steady payments totaling $2,400 in twelve months \nand keeping her purchases to less than $100 during that same year, \nJanet Hard's credit card debt went down by only $350. Sky-high interest \ncharges, inexplicably increased and unfairly applied, ate up most of \nher payments.\n  Millard Glasshof of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a retired senior citizen on \na fixed income, incurred a debt of about $5,000 on his Chase credit \ncard, closed the account, and faithfully paid down his debt with a \nregular monthly payment of $119 for years. In December 2006, Chase \nincreased his interest rate from 15 percent to 17 percent, and in \nFebruary 2007, hiked it again to 27 percent. Retroactive application of \nthe 27 percent rate to Mr. Glasshof's existing debt meant that, out of \nhis $119 payment, about $114 went to pay finance charges and only $5 \nwent to reducing his principal debt. Despite his making payments \ntotaling $1,300 over twelve months, Mr. Glasshof found that, due to \nhigh interest rates and excessive fees, his credit card debt did not go \ndown at all. Later, after the Subcommittee asked about his account, \nChase suddenly lowered the interest rate to 6 percent. That meant, over \na one year period, Chase had applied four different interest rates to \nhis closed credit card account: 15 percent, 17 percent, 27 percent, and \n6 percent, which shows how arbitrary those rates are.\n  Then there is Bonnie Rushing of Naples, Florida. For years, she had \npaid her Bank of America credit card on time, providing at least the \nminimum amount specified on her bills. Despite her record of on-time \npayments, in 2007, Bank of America nearly tripled her interest rate \nfrom 8 to 23 percent. The Bank said that it took this sudden action \nbecause Ms. Rushing's FICO credit score had dropped. When we looked \ninto why it had dropped, it was apparently because she had opened \nMacy's and J. Jill credit cards to get discounts on purchases. Despite \npaying both bills on time and in full, the automated FICO system had \nlowered her credit rating, and Bank of America had followed suit by \nraising her interest rate by a factor of three. Ms. Rushing closed her \naccount and complained to the Florida Attorney General, my \nSubcommittee, and her card sponsor, the American Automobile \nAssociation. Bank of America eventually restored the 8 percent rate on \nher closed account.\n  In addition to these three consumers who testified at the hearing, \nthe Subcommittee presented case histories for five other consumers who \nexperienced substantial interest rate increases despite complying with \ntheir credit card agreements.\n  I'd also like to note that, in each of these cases, the credit card \nissuer told our Subcommittee that the cardholder had been given a \nchance to opt out of the increased interest rate by closing their \naccount and paying off their debt at the prior rate. But each of these \ncardholders denied receiving an opt-out notice, and when several tried \nto close their account and pay their debt at the prior rate, they were \ntold they had missed the opt-out deadline and had no choice but to pay \nthe higher rate. Our Subcommittee examined copies of the opt-out \nnotices and found that some were filled with legal jargon, were hard to \nunderstand, and contained procedures that were hard to follow. When we \nasked the major credit card issuers what percentage of persons offered \nan opt-out actually took it, they told the Subcommittee that 90 percent \ndid not opt out of the higher interest rate--a percentage that is \ncontrary to all logic and strong evidence that current opt-out \nprocedures don't work.\n\n  The case histories presented at our hearings illustrate only a small \nportion of the abusive credit card practices going on today. Since \nearly 2007, the Subcommittee has received letters and emails from \nthousands of credit card cardholders describing unfair credit card \npractices and asking for help to stop them, more complaints than I have \nreceived in any investigation I've conducted in more than 25 years in \nCongress. The complaints stretch across all income levels, all ages, \nand all areas of the country. The bottom line is that these abuses have \ngone on for too long. In fact, these practices have been around for so \nmany years that they have in many cases become the industry norm, and \nour investigation has shown that many of the practices are too \nentrenched, too profitable, and too immune to consumer pressure for the \ncompanies to change them on their own.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support enactment of the \nDodd-Levin Credit CARD Act this year. Congress has already gone to bat \nfor the banks that engage in abusive credit card practices; it's time \nwe go to bat for the American family.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Mr. Brown, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Casey, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Feingold, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Merkley, \n        Mr. Sanders, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 416. A bill to limit the use of cluster munitions; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and \ncolleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, to re-introduce the Cluster \nMunitions Civilian Protection Act.\n  The bill is also co-sponsored by Senators Bingaman, Boxer, Brown, \nCardin, Casey, Durbin, Feingold, Kennedy, Mikulski, Menendez, Merkley, \nSanders, Stabenow, and Whitehouse.\n  Our legislation places common sense restrictions on the use of \ncluster bombs. It prevents any funds from being spent to use cluster \nmunitions that have a failure rate of more than one percent; and unless \nthe rules of engagement specify: the cluster munitions will only be \nused against clearly defined military targets and; will not be used \nwhere civilians are known to be present or in areas normally inhabited \nby civilians.\n  The bill also requires the President to submit a report to the \nappropriate Congressional committees on the plan to clean up unexploded \ncluster bombs.\n  Finally, the bill includes a national security waiver that allows the \nPresident to waive the prohibition on the use of cluster bombs with a \nfailure rate of more than one percent, if he determines it is vital to \nprotect the security of the United States to do so.\n  Cluster munitions are large bombs, rockets, or artillery shells that \ncontain up to hundreds of small submunitions, or individual \n``bomblets.''\n  They are intended for attacking enemy troop formations and armor \ncovering over a half mile radius.\n  Yet, in practice, they pose a real threat to the safety of civilians \nwhen used in populated areas because they leave hundreds of unexploded \nbombs over a very large area and they are often inaccurate.\n  Indeed, the human toll of these weapons has been terrible:\n  In Laos, approximately 11,000 people, 30 percent of them children, \nhave been killed or injured by U.S. cluster munitions since the Vietnam \nWar ended.\n  In Afghanistan, between October 2001 and November 2002, 127 civilians \nlost their lives due to cluster munitions, 70 percent of them under the \nage of 18.\n  An estimated 1,220 Kuwaitis and 400 Iraqi civilians have been killed \nby cluster munitions since 1991.\n  In the 2006 war in Lebanon, Israeli cluster munitions, many of them \nmanufactured in the U.S., injured and killed 200 civilians.\n  During the 2003 invasion of Baghdad, the last time the U.S. used \ncluster munitions, these weapons killed more civilians than any other \ntype of U.S. weapon.\n  The U.S. 3rd Infantry Division described cluster munitions as \n``battlefield losers'' in Iraq, because they were often forced to \nadvance through areas contaminated with unexploded duds.\n  During the 1991 Gulf War, U.S. cluster munitions caused more U.S. \ntroop casualties than any single Iraqi weapon system, killing 22 U.S. \nservicemen.\n\n[[Page S2154]]\n\n  Yet we have seen significant progress in the effort to protect \ninnocent civilians from these deadly weapons since we first introduced \nthis legislation in the 110th Congress.\n  In December, 95 countries came together to sign the Oslo Convention \non Cluster Munitions which would prohibit the production, use, and \nexport of cluster bombs and requires signatories to eliminate their \narsenals within 8 years.\n  This group includes key NATO allies such as Canada, the United \nKingdom, France, and Germany, who are fighting alongside our troops in \nAfghanistan.\n  In 2007, Congress passed and President Bush signed into law a \nprovision from our legislation contained in the fiscal year 2008 \nConsolidated Appropriations Act prohibiting the sale and transfer of \ncluster bombs with a failure rate of more than one percent.\n  In addition, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved the fiscal \nyear 2009 State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs Appropriations \nbill renewing the ban for another year.\n  I am confident this ban will be included in an fiscal year 2009 \nOmnibus appropriations bill.\n  These actions will help save lives. But much more work remains to be \ndone and significant obstacles remain.\n  For one, the United States chose not to participate in the Oslo \nprocess or sign the treaty.\n  The Pentagon continues to believe that cluster munitions are \n``legitimate weapons with clear military utility in combat.'' It would \nprefer that the United States work within the Geneva-based Convention \non Certain Conventional Weapons, CCW, to negotiate limits on the use of \ncluster munitions.\n  Yet these efforts have been going on since 2001 and it was the \ninability of the CCW to come to any meaningful agreement which prompted \nother countries, led by Norway, to pursue an alternative treaty through \nthe Oslo process.\n  A lack of U.S. leadership in this area has given cover to other major \ncluster munitions producing nations--China, Russia, India, Pakistan, \nIsrael, and Egypt--who have refused to sign the Oslo Convention as \nwell.\n  Recognizing the United States could not remain silent in the face of \ninternational efforts to restrict the use of cluster bombs, Secretary \nof Defense Robert Gates issued a new policy on cluster munitions in \nJune 2008 stating that after 2018, the use, sale and transfer of \ncluster munitions with a failure rate of more than 1 percent would be \nprohibited.\n  The policy is a step in the right direction, but under the terms of \nthis new policy, the Pentagon will still have the authority to use \ncluster bombs with high failure rates for the next ten years.\n  That is unacceptable and runs counter to our values.\n  The United States maintains an arsenal of an estimated 5.5 million \ncluster munitions containing 728 million submunitions which have an \nestimated failure rate of between 5 and 15 percent.\n  What does that say about us, that we are still prepared to use, sell \nand transfer these weapons with well known failure rates?\n  The fact is, cluster munition technologies already exist, that meet \nthe one percent standard. Why do we need to wait ten years?\n  This delay is especially troubling given that in 2001, former \nSecretary of Defense William Cohen issued his own policy on cluster \nmunitions stating that, beginning in fiscal year 2005, all new cluster \nmunitions must have a failure rate of less than one percent.\n  Unfortunately, the Pentagon was unable to meet this deadline and \nSecretary Gates' new policy essentially postpones any meaningful action \nfor another ten years.\n  That means, if we do nothing, by 2018 close to twenty years will have \npassed since the Pentagon first recognized the threat these deadly \nweapons pose to innocent civilians.\n  We can do better.\n  Our legislation simply moves up the Gates policy by ten years. For \nthose of my colleagues who are concerned that it may be too soon to \nenact a ban on the use of cluster bombs with failure rates of more than \none percent, I point out again that our bill allows the President to \nwaive this restriction if he determines it is vital to protect the \nsecurity of the United States to do so.\n  I would also remind my colleagues that the United States has not used \ncluster bombs in Iraq since 2003 and has observed a moratorium on their \nuse in Afghanistan since 2002.\n  We introduced this legislation to make this moratorium permanent for \nthe entire U.S. arsenal of cluster munitions.\n  We introduced this legislation for children like Hassan Hammade.\n  A 13-year-old Lebanese boy, Hassan lost four fingers and sustained \ninjuries to his stomach and shoulder after he picked up an unexploded \ncluster bomb in front of an orange tree.\n  He said:\n\n       I started playing with it and it blew up. I didn't know it \n     was a cluster bomb--it just looked like a burned out piece of \n     metal.\n       All the children are too scared to go out now, we just play \n     on the main roads or in our homes.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. We should do \nwhatever we can to protect more innocent children and other civilians \nfrom these dangerous weapons.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 416\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Cluster Munitions Civilian \n     Protection Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. LIMITATION ON THE USE OF CLUSTER MUNITIONS.\n\n       No funds appropriated or otherwise available to any Federal \n     department or agency may be obligated or expended to use any \n     cluster munitions unless--\n       (1) the submunitions of the cluster munitions, after \n     arming, do not result in more than 1 percent unexploded \n     ordnance across the range of intended operational \n     environments; and\n       (2) the policy applicable to the use of such cluster \n     munitions specifies that the cluster munitions will only be \n     used against clearly defined military targets and will not be \n     used where civilians are known to be present or in areas \n     normally inhabited by civilians.\n\n     SEC. 3. PRESIDENTIAL WAIVER.\n\n       The President may waive the requirement under section 2(1) \n     if, prior to the use of cluster munitions, the President--\n       (1) certifies that it is vital to protect the security of \n     the United States; and\n       (2) not later than 30 days after making such certification, \n     submits to the appropriate congressional committees a report, \n     in classified form if necessary, describing in detail--\n       (A) the steps that will be taken to protect civilians; and\n       (B) the failure rate of the cluster munitions that will be \n     used and whether such munitions are fitted with self-destruct \n     or self-deactivation devices.\n\n     SEC. 4. CLEANUP PLAN.\n\n       Not later than 90 days after any cluster munitions are used \n     by a Federal department or agency, the President shall submit \n     to the appropriate congressional committees a plan, prepared \n     by such Federal department or agency, for cleaning up any \n     such cluster munitions and submunitions which fail to explode \n     and continue to pose a hazard to civilians.\n\n     SEC. 5. APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES DEFINED.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``appropriate congressional \n     committees'' means the Committee on Foreign Relations, the \n     Committee on Armed Services, and the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign \n     Affairs, the Committee on Armed Services, and the Committee \n     on Appropriations of the House of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my friend from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein, in introducing the Cluster Munitions \nCivilian Protection Act of 2009. This is a slightly revised version of \na bill of the same name which we introduced in 2007.\n  Since December 3, 2008, when the Convention on Cluster Munitions \nopened for signature in Dublin, 96 countries have signed the treaty \nincluding Great Britain, Germany, Canada, Norway, Australia and other \nallies of the United States.\n  The treaty is the culmination of a year of negotiations, launched by \nNorway, among 107 governments that came together to prohibit the use of \ncluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians.\n  The Bush administration did not participate in the negotiations, \nwhich I believe was a mistake. As the Nation with the world's most \npowerful military we should not be on the sidelines while others are \ntrying to protect the\n\n[[Page S2155]]\n\nlives and limbs of civilians who comprise the vast majority of war \ncasualties today.\n  The Pentagon continues to insist that cluster munitions have military \nutility, and that the U.S. should retain the ability to use millions of \ncluster munitions in its arsenal which have estimated failure rates of \n5 to 20 percent.\n  Of course, any weapon, whether cluster munitions, landmines, or even \npoison gas, has some military utility. But anyone who has seen the \nindiscriminate devastation cluster munitions cause over a wide area \nunderstands the unacceptable threat they can pose to civilians. These \nare not the laser guided weapons the Pentagon showed destroying their \ntargets during the invasion of Baghdad.\n  There is the insidious problem of cluster munitions that fail to \nexplode as designed and remain as active duds, like landmines, until \nthey are triggered by whoever comes into contact with them. Often it is \nan unsuspecting child, or a farmer. We saw that recently in Lebanon, \nand in Laos people are still being killed and maimed by U.S. cluster \nmunitions left from the Vietnam War.\n  Current law prohibits U.S. sales, exports and transfers of cluster \nmunitions that have a failure rate exceeding 1 percent. That law also \nrequires any sale, export or transfer agreement to include a \nrequirement that the cluster munitions will be used only against \nmilitary targets and not in areas where civilians are known to be \npresent.\n  Last year, the Pentagon announced that it would meet the failure rate \nrequirement for U.S. use of cluster munitions in 2018. While a step \nforward, I do not believe we can justify continuing to use weapons that \nso often fail, so often kill and injure civilians, and which many of \nour allies have renounced. That is not the kind of leadership the world \nneeds and expects from the United States.\n  Senator Feinstein's and my bill would apply similar restrictions to \nthe use of cluster munitions beginning immediately on the date of \nenactment. However, the bill does permit the President to waive the 1 \npercent requirement if he certifies that it is vital to protect the \nsecurity of the United States. I urge the Pentagon to work with us by \nsupporting this reasonable step.\n  I want to express my appreciation to all nations that have signed the \ntreaty, and urge the Obama administration to review its policy on \ncluster munitions with a view toward putting the U.S. on a path to join \nthe treaty as soon as possible. In the meantime, our legislation would \ngo a long way toward putting the United States on that path.\n  There are some who dismissed the Cluster Munitions Convention as a \npointless exercise, since it does not yet have the support of the \nUnited States and other major powers such as Russia, China, Pakistan, \nIndia, and Israel. These are some of the same critics of the Ottawa \ntreaty banning antipersonnel landmines, which the U.S. and the other \ncountries I named have also refused to sign. But that treaty has \ndramatically reduced the number of landmines produced, used, sold and \nstockpiled, and the number of mine victims has fallen sharply. Any \ngovernment that contemplates using landmines today does so knowing that \nit will be condemned by the international community. I suspect it is \nonly a matter of time before the same is true for cluster munitions.\n  It is important to note that the U.S. today has the technological \nability to produce cluster munitions that would not be prohibited by \nthe treaty. What is lacking is the political will to expend the \nnecessary resources. There is no other excuse for continuing to use \ncluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians. I am \ncommitted to working in the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee to help \nsecure the resources needed to make this new technology available.\n  I want to commend Senator Feinstein who has shown real passion and \npersistence in raising this issue and seeking every opportunity to \nprotect civilians from these indiscriminate weapons.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n        Feingold, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mrs. McCaskill):\n  S. 417. A bill to enact a safe, fair, and responsible state secrets \nprivilege Act; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the bipartisan \nState Secrets Protection Act. I am pleased that Senator Kennedy, who \nhad so much to do with developing this proposal last Congress is an \noriginal cosponsor of the bill along with Senators Specter, Feingold, \nWhitehouse and McCaskill. After a lengthy debate, this bill was \nreported by the Judiciary Committee last April.\n  The State secrets privilege is a common law doctrine that the \nGovernment can claim in court to prevent evidence that could harm \nnational security from being publicly revealed. During the Bush \nadministration, the State secrets privilege was used to avoid judicial \nreview and skirt accountability by ending cases without consideration \nof the merits. It was used to stymie litigation at its very inception \nin cases alleging egregious Government misconduct, such as \nextraordinary rendition and warrantless eavesdropping on the \ncommunications of Americans.\n  The 2006 case of Khaled El-Masri, who was kidnapped and transported \nagainst his will to Afghanistan, where he was detained and tortured as \npart of the Bush administration's extraordinary rendition program, is \none such example. He sued the government alleging unlawful detention \nand treatment. A district court judge dismissed the entire lawsuit \nafter the Government invoked the State secrets privilege, solely on the \nbasis of an ex parte declaration from the Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, and despite the fact that the Government had \nadmitted that the rendition program exists. Mr. El-Masri has no other \nremedy. Our justice system is off limits to him, and no judge ever \nreviewed any of the actual evidence.\n  The State secrets privilege serves important goals where properly \ninvoked. But there are serious consequences for litigants and for the \nAmerican public when the privilege is used to terminate litigation \nalleging serious Government misconduct. For the aggrieved parties, it \nmeans that the courthouse doors are closed forever regardless of the \nseverity of their injury. They will never have their day in court. For \nthe American public, it means less accountability, because there will \nbe no judicial scrutiny of improper actions of the executive, and no \ncheck or balance.\n  The State Secrets Protection Act will help guide the courts to \nbalance the Government's interests in secrecy with accountability and \nthe rights of citizens to seek judicial redress. The bill does not \nrestrict the Government's ability to assert the privilege in \nappropriate cases. Rather, the bill would allow judges to look at the \nactual evidence the Government submits so that they, neutral judges, \nrather than self-interested executive branch officials, would render \nthe ultimate decision whether the State secrets privilege should apply. \nThis is consistent with the procedure for other privileges recognized \nin our courts.\n  We held a Committee hearing on this issue last year, and the \nappropriate use of this privilege remains an area of concern for me and \nfor the cosponsors of this bill. In light of the pending cases where \nthis privilege has been invoked, involving issues including torture, \nrendition and warrantless wiretapping, we can ill-afford to delay \nconsideration of this important legislation. I hope all Senators will \njoin us in supporting this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 417\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am proud to join Senators Leahy, \nSpecter, and Kennedy in introducing the State Secrets Protection Act of \n2009. This bill establishes uniform procedures for courts to use when \nevaluating governmental assertions of the state secrets privilege in \ncivil litigation. It takes an important step toward restoring the rule \nof law by ensuring that the privilege will be used only to protect true \nstate secrets, and not as a means for the Government to avoid \naccountability for its actions.\n  In a democracy, the public should have the right to know what its \ngovernment is doing. That should be the rule, and secrecy should be the \nrare exception, reserved for the very few cases in which the national \nsecurity is truly at stake. Unfortunately, the Bush administration \nstood that presumption on its head, cloaking its actions in secrecy \nwhenever possible and grudgingly submitting to public scrutiny only \nwhen it couldn't be avoided. The ``state secrets'' privilege was a \nfavorite weapon in that administration's arsenal of secrecy.\n  None of us disputes that information may properly be withheld as a \n``state secret'' when disclosing the information would cause grave \ndamage to national security. The problem arises when the privilege is \nabused and invoked to shield Government wrongdoing. Indeed, that is \nexactly what happened the first time the Supreme Court recognized the \nprivilege in 1953, in the case of United States v. Reynolds. The \nGovernment had been sued after a military aircraft crash killed nine \npeople, and it invoked the ``state secrets'' privilege to shield an \ninternal investigative report. Decades later, when the report was \ndeclassified, it revealed nothing that could fairly be characterized as \na ``state secret'' but it did reveal faulty maintenance of the \naircraft.\n  Abuses like these can be prevented, but only if the courts fulfill \ntheir responsibility to carefully review claims\n\n[[Page S2158]]\n\nof privilege. In the Reynolds case, no court actually looked at the \nsupposedly privileged report. That simple step would have prevented the \nmiscarriage of justice that ensued. Yet, despite the fact that courts \nhave the acknowledged authority to order in camera review of the \nevidence, fewer than one third of courts have actually exercised that \noption when the Government has asserted the ``state secrets'' \nprivilege. And a host of other tools available to the courts to \nevaluate and respond to claims of privilege have been employed \ninconsistently at best, resulting in a confused body of case law that \npreserves accountability in some cases while granting the government a \n``get out of jail free'' card in others.\n  In the last Congress, Senators Kennedy, Specter, and Leahy introduced \nthe State Secrets Protection Act to standardize the procedures courts \nuse in cases where the Government asserts the ``state secrets'' \nprivilege and to ensure adequate scrutiny of such claims. The bill was \nreported by the Judiciary Committee last April after extensive debate. \nMuch of the credit for this legislation goes to Senator Kennedy, whose \nunfailing commitment to the rule of law inspired both the concept and \nthe particulars of this bill. I had the honor of working with him to \ndevelop this legislation, and it is a pleasure now to cosponsor its \nreintroduction, with Senator Leahy as the lead sponsor.\n  The bill makes use of existing tools that are available to the courts \nwhen handling national security information. Perhaps the most \nfundamental of these is in camera review of the allegedly privileged \nevidence, which the bill requires. The idea here is simple: Determining \nwhat information the evidence contains is the threshold step in \ndetermining whether that evidence is privileged. This step is far too \nimportant to be left to a party with a built-in conflict of interest. \nJust as a court would never accept a private litigant's description of \nhis or her evidence in lieu of the evidence itself, the court should \nnot rely solely on the Government's description of the evidence when \nthe Government has a clear interest in the outcome of the case.\n  That courts may examine sensitive national security information in \ncamera is beyond any serious dispute. Since 1974, the Freedom of \nInformation Act has allowed courts to engage in in camera review of any \nrecords that the Government claims are exempt from disclosure under the \nAct. Courts have also reviewed the most sensitive national security \ninformation in criminal cases, pursuant to the Classified Information \nProcedures Act. In fact, courts handle highly classified information on \na regular basis. There is no legitimate justification for skipping this \ncrucial step.\n  The bill also requires courts to hold in camera hearings on the \nquestion of whether the evidence is privileged. Based on the court's \nprevious review of the evidence, the court may conduct the hearing ex \nparte i.e., without any participation by the plaintiff or the \nplaintiff's lawyers but only if the court finds that national security \ncannot adequately be protected through other means. For example, the \ncourt may limit attendance at the hearing to attorneys with the \nrequisite clearances, or the court may appoint a guardian ad litem to \nrepresent the plaintiff's interests at the hearing. The bill thus \npreserves the adversarial process to the maximum extent consistent with \nprotecting national security.\n  That's important, for at least two reasons. First, our justice system \nis premised on the notion of fairness, and that principle of fairness \nis undermined any time a party to litigation is excluded from the \nproceedings. But fairness isn't the only principle at stake. For all \nits complications and occasional inefficiencies, the adversarial \nprocess remains the best system for getting to the truth. If only one \nparty is present at the hearing, the court is more likely to reach the \nwrong result it's as simple as that.\n  Taken together, the requirements of in camera review of the evidence \nand an in camera hearing ensure that the Government's claim of \nprivilege is evaluated fairly and thoroughly. A fair, thorough review \nis necessary, because the bill makes absolutely clear that once \nevidence is found to be privileged, it cannot be disclosed, however \ngreat the plaintiff's need for the evidence may be. The interest of \nnational security, once the court determines that interest is truly at \nstake, is given absolute protection.\n  That may mean the end of the lawsuit but it may not. As Congress \nrecognized when it passed the Classified Information Procedures Act, \ncourts have many tools at their disposal to move litigation forward \neven when some of the evidence cannot be disclosed. For example, courts \ncan require the Government to submit non-privileged substitutes for the \nprivileged evidence, such as summaries of the evidence, redacted \nversions, or admissions of certain facts. Under the bill, where the \ncourt finds that it would be feasible for the Government to craft a \nnon-privileged substitute for privileged evidence, it may order the \nGovernment to do so. Again, however, the court can never compel the \nproduction of privileged evidence. If the Government refuses to craft a \nnon-privileged substitute, the remedy is the same one that exists in \nthe CIPA: the court may resolve the relevant issue of fact or law \nagainst the Government.\n  The bill does not allow courts to dismiss lawsuits at the pleadings \nstage based on a claim of ``subject matter privilege.'' As the Fourth \nCircuit has explained, ``subject matter privilege'' applies if the case \nis so pervaded with state secrets, it would be impossible to conduct \nthe lawsuit without revealing them. Such cases undoubtedly exist. But \nuntil all of the relevant evidence is identified and the privilege \ndeterminations are made, any conclusion that a case will be pervaded \nwith state secrets is simply a prediction. Only by proceeding through \ndiscovery and pre-trial hearings can that prediction be replaced with \ncertainty. And this can be done without revealing a single state \nsecret, since the bill allows privilege determinations to be made in \ncamera and ex parte.\n  The bill does not change the ordinary rules of summary judgment. If a \ncourt determines, after discovery and pre-trial hearings are completed, \nthat the key evidence is privileged and the plaintiff cannot prove his \nor her case using non-privileged evidence, then the Government may move \nfor summary judgment and prevail. The bill thus retains the concept of \n``subject matter privilege'' it simply requires a more thorough testing \nof the claim.\n  Nor does the bill ever put the Government to the ``Hobson's choice'' \nof either revealing privileged evidence or conceding the lawsuit. Under \nthe bill, even if the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case, the \ncourt can and must dismiss the lawsuit if the Government would need to \ndisclose privileged evidence in order to present a valid defense. The \nGovernment's interests, as well as the national security, are thus \nscrupulously protected.\n  Finally, the bill facilitates congressional oversight by requiring \nthe executive branch to share with the Judiciary and Intelligence \nCommittees the documents it makes available to the courts: the \nGovernment affidavit explaining why the evidence is privileged, the \nindex of privileged evidence, and, where requested, the evidence \nitself. This information will help Congress monitor the Government's \nuse of the privilege and assess the need for any further legislation.\n  Perhaps even more important, it will provide a means of \naccountability in those cases where the privilege prevents a court from \nruling on allegations of Government wrongdoing. The idea of simply \nletting such allegations go unaddressed should be profoundly troubling \nto anyone who respects the rule of law yet for eight years, the \nresponse of the Bush administration was little more than a shrug. This \nbill rejects such a cavalier attitude toward the rule of law. The \ncitizens of this country should never again be told that there is \nsimply no remedy for wrongs their Government has committed. In cases \nwhere the courts cannot provide that remedy, then Congress should step \nin and providing the necessary information to the relevant committees \nof Congress will enable that to happen.\n  I am pleased that both the new Attorney General, Eric Holder, and the \nnominee for Associate Attorney General, Thomas Perrelli, have indicated \na willingness to review this bill and work with us on it. I hope that \nit will be possible to fashion legislation that the Administration can \nsupport. The public\n\n[[Page S2159]]\n\ndeserves to have confidence that the state secrets privilege is not \ngoing to be used to cover up Government misconduct. This bill provides \nthe courts a system for resolving claims of privilege that will inspire \nthat confidence.\n  A country where the Government need not answer to allegations of \nwrongdoing is a country that has strayed dangerously far from the rule \nof law. We must ensure that the ``state secrets'' privilege does not \nbecome a license for the Government to evade the laws that we pass. \nThis bill accomplishes that goal, while simultaneously providing the \nstrongest of protections to those items of evidence that truly qualify \nas state secrets. I urge all of my colleagues to support the rule of \nlaw by supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. KLOBUCHAR (for herself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 418. A bill to require secondary metal recycling agents to keep \nrecords of their transactions in order to deter individuals and \nenterprises engaged in the theft and interstate sale of stolen \nsecondary metal, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with my friend \nfrom Minnesota, Senator Amy Klobuchar, the Secondary Metal Theft \nPrevention Act of 2009.\n  Once again, I am partnering with Senator Klobuchar to combat metal \ntheft in our country. Last Congress we introduced the Copper Theft \nPrevention Act of 2008, S. 3666, which focused solely on copper theft. \nSince then, after a series of meetings with industry stakeholders, we \nconcluded that the bill would be more effective if it were expanded to \naddress secondary metal thefts, including those involving copper.\n  There is no doubt that we are living in difficult economic times. As \nwe witness the unfortunate job losses spreading across the country, I \nam mindful of those who are struggling to make ends meet. Unfortunately \nsome, motivated by quick profits and a variety of vulnerable targets, \nare engaging in the fast-growing crime of metal theft.\n  On the surface, stealing precious metal, like copper, appears to be a \nrelatively small theft. However, metal thieves compromise U.S. critical \ninfrastructure by targeting electrical sub-stations, cellular towers, \ntelephone land lines, railroads, water wells, construction sites, and \nvacant homes--all for fast cash.\n  Some argue that there is no need for this legislation because metal \nis being traded at low prices. I disagree. As we know, the market \nshifts and prices will eventually increase as demand surges. Moreover, \nlaw enforcement officials confirm that thieves are only stealing more \nmetal to offset current metal prices.\n  On September 15, 2008, the Federal Bureau of Investigation released \nan unclassified intelligence assessment entitled, Copper Thefts \nThreaten U.S. Critical Infrastructure.\n  This assessment states that ``thieves are typically individuals or \norganized groups who operate independently or in loose association with \neach other and commit thefts in conjunction with fencing activities and \nthe sale of contraband. Organized groups of drug addicts, gang members, \nand metal thieves are conducting large scale thefts from electric \nutilities, warehouses, foreclosed and vacant properties, and oil well \nsites for tens of thousands of dollars in illicit proceeds per month.''\n  I am mindful of the hardworking scrap metal dealers in my home state. \nRecycling secondary metal not only generates revenue but is \nenvironmentally friendly and saves energy, it takes a lot less energy \nto melt down secondary metal and recycle it than it does to produce new \nmetal.\n  Take for example the City Creek project in downtown Salt Lake City, \nUtah. It is my understanding that when the construction contractors \ntore down the downtown malls to make way for the 20-acre retail-office-\nresidential complex, more than half of what came down was reused either \nin the City Creek development or somewhere else. Steel frames were sold \nas scrap metal, which was recycled and used for other purposes.\n  Utah metal recyclers deal with hundreds of people and thousands of \npounds of metal on a regular basis. I imagine in some cases it is \ndifficult to tell if the scrap metal is stolen, especially if a \ncustomer has, what appears to be, a legitimate story. I know that many \nof Utah's scrap metal dealers are not turning a blind eye to this \nproblem. In fact, several metal recycling companies have partnered with \nlocal law enforcement and use a theft alert system to warn and watch \nfor reported stolen items. I commend them for their efforts and hope \nthat police, prosecutors, and members of the metal recycling industry \ncontinue to communicate and work together to combat metal theft along \nthe Wasatch Front.\n  Yet on the Federal level, we need a baseline from which all states \nmust operate. This is important because many states in the Union do not \nhave metal theft laws and lure thieves across State lines. It should be \nnoted that the proposed bill does not preempt states from enacting \ntheir own laws.\n  I believe the proposed legislation will help tighten-up how secondary \nmetal transactions are performed across the country and, in return, \nsend a clear message that metal theft will be met with serious \nconsequences. The bill calls for enforcement by the Federal Trade \nCommission and gives state attorneys general the ability to bring a \ncivil action to enforce the provisions of the legislation.\n  This bill also contains a ``Do Not Buy'' provision wherein specific \nitems listed cannot be purchased by scrap metal dealers unless sellers \nestablish, by written documentation, that they are authorized to sell \nthe secondary metal in question.\n  Additionally, the bill requires scrap metal dealers to keep records \nof secondary metal purchases, including the name and address of the \nseller, the date of the transaction, the quantity and description of \nthe secondary metal being purchased, an identifying number from a \ndriver's license or other government-issued identification and, where \npossible, the make, model and tag number of the vehicle used to deliver \nthe metal to the dealer.\n  Secondary metal dealers must maintain these records for a minimum of \ntwo years from the date of the transaction and make them available to \nlaw enforcement agencies for use in tracking down and prosecuting \nsecondary metal theft crimes.\n  There is real concern about how easy it is to access cash in scrap \nmetal transactions. For this reason, the bill requires that checks will \nbe the method of payment for transactions over $75. While that may \nsound low for some, it is important to recognize that it takes a lot of \nsecondary metal to obtain even $75 in return.\n  To discourage multiple cash transactions from one seller, the bill \nlimits metal dealers from paying cash to the same seller within a 48-\nhour period. The intent of this provision is not to be a hardship on \nthe honest seller. The purpose is to dissuade some sellers from going \naround the bill's check payment requirement by making multiple cash \ntransactions. Again, we must remove the incentives for thieves to \naccess fast cash.\n  I am aware that some scrap metal dealers do not want to issue checks \nfor fear of check fraud or additional transactional costs. Senator \nKlobuchar and I have given careful consideration to these concerns and \nhave consulted law enforcement officials to determine how best to \nproceed. We believe that checks are a valuable benefit to law \nenforcement because they provide trace evidence by creating a paper \ntrail, a signature, and possibly even a fingerprint.\n  Let me conclude my remarks by saying that considering our country's \nserious economic situation, I believe we need to ensure that our \ncritical infrastructure is not viewed as a treasure trove for desperate \nmetal thieves.\n  I am committed to moving this bill forward and hope that my \ncolleagues will join me in perfecting this bill as it moves through the \nlegislative process.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the support material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Copper Thefts Threaten US Critical Infrastructure\n\n\n                               Scope Note\n\n       The assessment highlights copper theft and its impact on US \n     critical infrastructure. Copper thefts are occurring \n     throughout the United States and are perpetrated by \n     individuals and organized groups motivated by\n\n[[Page S2160]]\n\n     quick profits and a variety of vulnerable targets. \n     Information for the assessment was developed through May 2008 \n     from the following sources: FBI and Open sources.\n\n\n                    Source and Confidence Statement\n\n       Reporting relative to the impact of copper thefts on US \n     critical infrastructure was derived from the FBI and open \n     sources. The FBI has high confidence that the FBI source \n     reporting used to prepare the assessment is reliable. The FBI \n     also has high confidence in the reliability of information \n     derived from open-source reporting.\n\n\n                             Key Judgments\n\n       Copper thieves are threatening US critical infrastructure \n     by targeting electrical substations, cellular towers, \n     telephone land lines, railroads, water wells, construction \n     sites, and vacant homes for lucrative profits. The theft of \n     copper from these targets disrupts the flow of electricity, \n     telecommunications, transportation, water supply, heating, \n     and security and emergency services and presents a risk to \n     both public safety and national security.\n       Copper thieves are typically individuals or organized \n     groups who operate independently or in loose association with \n     each other and commit thefts in conjunction with fencing \n     activities and the sale of contraband. Organized groups of \n     drug addicts, gang members, and metal thieves are conducting \n     large scale thefts from electric utilities. warehouses, \n     foreclosed or vacant properties, and oil well sites for tens \n     of thousands of dollars in illicit proceeds per month.\n       The demand for copper from developing nations such as China \n     and India is creating a robust international copper trade. \n     Copper thieves are exploiting this demand and the resulting \n     price surge by stealing and selling the metal for high \n     profits to recyclers across the United States. As the global \n     supply of copper continues to tighten, the market for illicit \n     copper will likely increase.\n\n\n           Copper Thefts Threaten US Critical Infrastructure\n\n       Copper thieves are threatening US critical infrastructure \n     by targeting electrical substations, cellular towers, \n     telephone land lines, railroads, water wells, construction \n     sites, and vacant homes for lucrative profits. Copper thefts \n     from these targets have increased since 2006; and they are \n     currently disrupting the flow of electricity, \n     telecommunications, transportation, water supply, heating, \n     and security and emergency services, and present a risk to \n     both public safety and national security.\n       According to open-source reporting, on 4 April 2008, five \n     tornado warning sirens in the Jackson, Mississippi, area did \n     not warn residents of an approaching tornado because copper \n     thieves had stripped the sirens of copper wiring, thus \n     rendering them inoperable.\n       According to open-source reporting, on 20 March 2008, \n     nearly 4,000 residents in Polk County, Florida, were left \n     without power after copper wire was stripped from an active \n     transformer at a Tampa Electric Company (TECO) power \n     facility. Monetary losses to TECO were approximately \n     $500,000.\n       According to agricultural industry reporting, as of March \n     2007, farmers in Pinal County, Arizona, were experiencing a \n     copper theft epidemic as perpetrators stripped copper from \n     their water irrigation wells and pumps resulting in the loss \n     of crops and high replacement costs. Pinal County's \n     infrastructure loss due to copper theft was $10 million.\n\n\n               Criminal Groups Involved in Copper Thefts\n\n       Copper thieves are typically individuals or organized \n     groups who operate independently or in loose association with \n     each other and commit thefts in conjunction with fencing \n     activities and the sale of contraband. Organized groups of \n     drug addicts, gang members, and metal thieves are conducting \n     large scale thefts from electric utilities, warehouses, \n     foreclosed and vacant properties, and oil well sites for tens \n     of thousands of dollars in illicit proceeds per month.\n       According to open sources, as recently as April 2008, \n     highly organized theft rings specializing in copper theft \n     from houses and warehouses were operating in Minneapolis, \n     Minnesota. These rings or gangs hit several houses per day, \n     yielding more than $20,000 in profits per month. The targets \n     were most often foreclosed homes.\n       Open-source reporting from March 2008 indicates that an \n     organized copper theft ring used the Cuyahoga County \n     Sheriff's foreclosure lists to pinpoint targets in Cleveland, \n     Ohio. Perpetrators had 200 pounds of stolen copper in their \n     van, road maps, and tools. Three additional perpetrators were \n     found to be using the US Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development's list of mortgage and bank foreclosures to \n     target residences in Cleveland, South Euclid, Cleveland \n     Heights, and other cities in Ohio.\n\n\n                        Global Demand Increasing\n\n       China, India, and other developing nations are driving the \n     demand for raw materials such as copper and creating a robust \n     international trade. Copper thieves are receiving cash from \n     recyclers who often fill orders for commercial scrap dealers. \n     Recycled copper flows from these dealers to smelters, mills, \n     foundries, ingot makers, powder plants, and other industries \n     to be re-used in the United States or for supplying the \n     international raw materials demand. As the global supply of \n     copper continues to tighten, the market for illicit copper \n     will likely increase.\n       Open-source reporting from February 2007 indicates that the \n     global copper supply tightened due to a landslide at the \n     Freeport-McMoran Copper and Gold mine in Grasberg, Indonesia \n     in October 2003 and a worker's strike at the El Abra copper \n     mine in Clama, Chile in November 2004. These events \n     contributed to copper production shortfalls and led to an \n     increase in recycling, which in turn created a market for \n     copper.\n       Open-source reporting from October 2006 indicated that the \n     demand for copper from China increased substantially due to \n     the construction of facilities for the 2008 Olympics.\n       Open-source reporting indicated that from January 2001 to \n     March 2008, the price of copper increased more than 500 \n     percent. This has prompted unscrupulous and sometimes \n     unwitting independent and commercial scrap metal dealers to \n     pay record prices for copper, regardless of its origin, \n     making the material a more attractive target for theft.\n\n\n                                Outlook\n\n       The global demand for copper, combined with the economic \n     and home foreclosure crisis, is creating numerous \n     opportunities for copper-theft perpetrators to exploit \n     copper-rich targets. Organized copper theft rings may \n     increasingly target vacant or foreclosed homes as they are a \n     lucrative source of unattended copper inventory. Current \n     economic conditions, such as the rising cost of gasoline, \n     food, and consumer goods, the declining housing market, the \n     ease through which copper is exchanged for cash, and the lack \n     of a significant deterrent effect, make it likely that copper \n     thefts will remain a lucrative financial resource for \n     criminals.\n       Industry officials have taken some countermeasures to \n     address the copper theft problem. These include the \n     installment of physical and technological security measures, \n     increased collaboration among the various industry sectors, \n     and the development of law enforcement partnerships. Many \n     states are also taking countermeasures by enacting or \n     enhancing legislation regulating the scrap industry--to \n     include increased recordkeeping and penalties for copper \n     theft and noncompliant scrap dealers However, there are \n     limited resources available to enforce these laws, and a very \n     small percentage of perpetrators are arrested and convicted. \n     Additionally, as copper thefts are typically addressed as \n     misdemeanors, those individuals convicted pay relatively low \n     fines and serve short prison terms\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/11/senate-section/article/S2160-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2160-S2161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 31--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON \n                      ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN submitted the following resolution; from the Committee \non Energy and Natural-Resources; which was referred to the Committee on \nRules and Administration:\n\n                               S.

Res. 37\n\n       Whereas Sean Goldman is the son of David Goldman and Bruna \n     Goldman, and is a United States citizen and a resident of \n     Tinton Falls, New Jersey;\n       Whereas Bruna Goldman took Sean Goldman to Brazil on June \n     16, 2004;\n       Whereas, after Bruna and Sean Goldman arrived in Brazil, \n     Bruna Goldman informed David Goldman that she would remain \n     permanently in Brazil and would not return Sean Goldman to \n     David Goldman in New Jersey;\n       Whereas, on August 26, 2004, the Superior Court of New \n     Jersey issued a ruling awarding David Goldman physical and \n     legal custody of Sean Goldman and ordering that Sean Goldman \n     be immediately returned to the United States;\n       Whereas David Goldman initiated judicial proceedings in the \n     Federal Court of Rio de Janeiro, under the Convention on the \n     Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, done at the \n     Hague October 25, 1980 (TIAS 11670) (the ``Convention''), to \n     which both the United States and Brazil are parties;\n       Whereas the Convention requires that a child who is a \n     habitual resident of a country that is a party to the \n     Convention, and who has been removed from or retained in a \n     country that is also a party to the Convention in violation \n     of the custodial rights of a parent of that child, be \n     returned to the country of habitual residence;\n       Whereas, despite the petition filed in the Federal Court of \n     Rio de Janeiro by David Goldman for the return of his child, \n     less than one year after Sean Goldman was taken to Brazil, \n     David Goldman was prevented from exercising his legal custody \n     of Sean Goldman by rulings of the Federal Regional Court and \n     the 3rd Chamber of the Superior Court of Justice of Brazil;\n       Whereas Bruna Goldman passed away in August 2008, and her \n     new husband filed a petition to replace the name of David \n     Goldman with his own name on the birth certificate of Sean \n     Goldman;\n       Whereas the new husband of Bruna Goldman filed a petition \n     for custody of Sean Goldman with the 2nd Family Court of \n     Brazil on August 28, 2008;\n       Whereas the 2nd Family Court of Brazil granted temporary \n     custody to the new husband of Bruna Goldman, despite specific \n     provisions in the Convention that prohibit action by a family \n     court while a case brought under the Convention is pending;\n       Whereas Sean Goldman remains in the temporary custody of \n     the new husband of Bruna Goldman;\n       Whereas David Goldman traveled to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, \n     in October 2008 for court-approved visitation with Sean \n     Goldman;\n       Whereas the new husband of Bruna Goldman failed to present \n     Sean Goldman for such visitation;\n       Whereas the Convention requires the Government of Brazil to \n     ``take all appropriate measures to secure within [its \n     territory] the implementation of the objects of the \n     Convention'' and ``to use the most expeditious procedures \n     available'';\n       Whereas the Federal Court of Rio de Janeiro has failed to \n     comply with the obligations of the Government of Brazil under \n     article 11 of the Convention by failing to expeditiously \n     adjudicate the petition of David Goldman under the \n     Convention;\n       Whereas it is customary under international law to \n     adjudicate a petition under the Convention within six weeks;\n       Whereas the Department of State reported in the 2008 report \n     on compliance with the Convention, as required under section \n     2803 of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of \n     1998 (42 U.S.C. 11611), that the judicial authorities of \n     Brazil ``continued to demonstrate patterns of noncompliance \n     with the Convention'';\n       Whereas the Special Secretariat for Human Rights of the \n     Presidency of the Republic of Brazil, the central authority \n     for carrying out the Convention in Brazil, wrote to the \n     Office of the Attorney General of Brazil to express concern \n     with the manner in which the 2d Family Court of Brazil \n     conducted the case of Sean Goldman and to state that the \n     issuance of temporary custody rights by the 2d Family Court \n     of Brazil was a violation of the Convention;\n       Whereas Sean Goldman is being deprived of his rightful \n     opportunity to live with and be raised by his biological \n     father, David Goldman;

which was \nreferred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                             S. Con. Res. 6\n\n       Whereas women often make health care decisions for \n     themselves and their families;\n       Whereas women have expressed a desire to have affordable \n     health care on which they can depend throughout their lives \n     and through life transitions, including starting a family, \n     changing jobs, working part-time or full-time, divorce, \n     caring for an elderly or sick family member, having a major \n     disease, and retirement;\n       Whereas women with good health care coverage worry about \n     maintaining such coverage and keeping their health care \n     providers;\n       Whereas women are more likely than men to seek essential \n     preventive and routine care, to have a chronic health \n     condition, and to take a prescription drug on a daily basis;\n       Whereas women pay 68 percent more than men for out-of-\n     pocket medical costs, due in large part to reproductive \n     health care needs;\n       Whereas approximately 53 percent of underinsured \n     individuals, and 68 percent of uninsured individuals, forgo \n     needed care and approximately 45 percent of underinsured \n     individuals, and 51 percent of uninsured individuals, report \n     difficulty paying medical bills;\n       Whereas in 2004, 1 in 6 women with individual health care \n     coverage reported that they postponed, or went without, \n     needed health care because they could not afford such health \n     care;\n       Whereas high-deductible health insurance plans often are \n     marketed to young women as an inexpensive health care \n     coverage option, but such plans often fail to cover \n     pregnancy-related care, the most expensive health care event \n     most young families face and the leading cause of hospital \n     stays for young women;\n       Whereas in 2007, 42 percent of the under-65 population in \n     the United States, approximately 75,000,000 adults, had \n     either no insurance or inadequate insurance, up from 35 \n     percent in 2003;\n       Whereas nearly 16 percent of people in the United States \n     (approximately 47,000,000 people) are uninsured, including 18 \n     percent of adult women aged 18 to 64 (approximately \n     17,000,000 women) and 12 percent of children (approximately \n     9,000,000 children);\n       Whereas the Institute of Medicine estimated that, in 2000, \n     lack of health care coverage resulted in 18,000 excess deaths \n     in the United States (a number that the Urban Institute \n     estimated grew to 22,000 by 2006) and estimated that \n     acquiring health insurance reduces mortality rates for \n     previously uninsured individuals by 10 to 15 percent;\n       Whereas women rely on women's health care providers \n     throughout their lives, for comprehensive primary and \n     preventive care, surgical care, and treatment and management \n     of both acute and long-term health problems;\n       Whereas a ``medical home'' should ensure each woman direct \n     access to women's health care providers and care coordination \n     throughout her lifetime;\n       Whereas uninsured women with breast cancer are 30 to 50 \n     percent more likely than insured women with breast cancer to \n     die from the disease, and uninsured women are 3 times less \n     likely than insured women to have had a Pap test in the last \n     3 years, putting uninsured women at a 60 percent greater risk \n     of late-stage cervical cancer;\n       Whereas 13 percent of all pregnant women are uninsured, \n     making them less likely to seek prenatal care in the first \n     trimester of their pregnancies, less likely to receive the \n     optimal number of prenatal health care visits during their \n     pregnancies, and 31 percent more likely to experience an \n     adverse health outcome after giving birth;\n       Whereas the lack, or inadequate receipt, of prenatal care \n     is associated with pregnancy-related mortality 2 to 3 times \n     higher, and infant mortality 6 times higher, than that of \n     women receiving early prenatal care, and also is associated \n     with an increased risk of low birth weight and preterm birth;\n       Whereas heart disease is the leading cause of death for \n     both women and men, but women are less likely than men to \n     receive\n\n[[Page S2165]]\n\n     lifestyle counseling, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, \n     and cardiac rehabilitation and are more likely to die or have \n     a second heart attack, demonstrating inequalities between \n     women and men in access to health care;\n       Whereas persisting health care disparities also are evident \n     in that Hispanic and Native American women and children are 3 \n     times as likely, and African-American women are nearly twice \n     as likely, to be uninsured than non-Hispanic white women;\n       Whereas in 2005, nearly 80 percent of the female population \n     with HIV/AIDS was African-American or Hispanic, and HIV/AIDS \n     incidence rates are dramatically higher for African-American \n     and Hispanic women and adolescents (60.2 and 15.8 per \n     100,000, respectively) than for white women and adolescents \n     (3.0 per 100,000);\n       Whereas women are less likely than men to receive health \n     insurance through their employers and more likely than men to \n     be insured as a dependent, making them more vulnerable than \n     men to insurance loss in the event of divorce or death of a \n     spouse;\n       Whereas 64 percent of uninsured women are in families with \n     at least 1 adult working full-time;\n       Whereas health care costs are increasingly unaffordable for \n     working families and employers, with employer-sponsored \n     health insurance premiums having increased 87 percent between \n     2000 and 2006;\n       Whereas the approximately 9,100,000 women-owned businesses \n     in the United States employ 27,500,000 individuals, \n     contribute $3,600,000,000,000 to the economy, and face \n     serious obstacles in obtaining affordable health care \n     coverage for their employees;\n       Whereas the lack of affordable health care coverage creates \n     barriers for women who want to change jobs or create their \n     own small businesses;\n       Whereas health care professionals, a significant portion of \n     which are women, have a stake in achieving reform that allows \n     them to provide the highest quality of care for their \n     patients;\n       Whereas 56 percent of all health caregivers are women;\n       Whereas although the United States spends twice as much on \n     health care as the median industrialized nation, among the 30 \n     developed nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-\n     operation and Development, the health care system of the \n     United States ranks near the bottom on most measures of \n     health status and ranks 37th in overall health performance \n     among 191 nations; and\n       Whereas the Institute of Medicine estimates that the cost \n     of achieving full health insurance coverage in the United \n     States would be less than the loss in economic productivity \n     from existing coverage gaps: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) commits to passing, not later than 18 months after the \n     adoption of this resolution by Congress, legislation that \n     guarantees health care for women and all individuals and \n     establishes coverage that enables women to attain good health \n     that they can maintain during their reproductive years and \n     throughout their lives and that--\n       (A) recognizes the special role that women play as health \n     care consumers, caregivers, and providers;\n       (B) guarantees a level of benefits and care, including \n     comprehensive reproductive health care, pregnancy-related \n     care, and infant care, that is necessary to achieve and \n     maintain good health throughout a woman's lifetime and lessen \n     the burdens caused by poor health;\n       (C) promotes primary and preventive care, including family \n     planning, contraceptive equity, and care continuity;\n       (D) provides a choice of public and private health \n     insurance plans and direct access to a choice of health care \n     providers to ensure continuity of coverage and a delivery \n     system that meets the needs of women;\n       (E) eliminates health disparities in coverage, treatment, \n     and outcomes on the basis of gender, culture, race, \n     ethnicity, socioeconomic status, health status, and sexual \n     orientation;\n       (F) shares responsibility for financing among employers, \n     individuals, and the government, while taking into account \n     the needs of small businesses;\n       (G) ensures that access to health care is affordable;\n       (H) enhances health care quality and patient safety;\n       (I) ensures a sufficient supply of qualified providers \n     through expanded medical and public health education and \n     adequate reimbursement;\n       (J) ensures every woman access to a women's ``medical \n     home'', including direct access to women's health care \n     providers and care coordination, throughout each woman's \n     lifetime;\n       (K) recognizes and promotes the role of women as providers \n     of health care; and\n       (L) promotes administrative efficiency, reduces unnecessary \n     paperwork, and is easy for health care consumers and \n     providers to use; and\n       (2) urges the President to sign such legislation into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/11/senate-section/article/S2165-1", "month": "02",

Mr. President, I recently received a letter from a woman \nin Sultan, WA, that I want to share with you today as we work to \nfinalize the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. She wrote to me \nbecause her family is going through some very hard times and she \ndoesn't know where else to turn.\n  Her husband, who is a veteran who received a Purple Heart, lost his \njob in October. Her own wages have been cut and her daughter and her 3-\nyear-old granddaughter had to move in with them because they can't \nafford rent and childcare. At the end of this month, they are going to \nlose their home to foreclosure.\n  She said her family is living ``both literally and figuratively on \nthe edge.'' As she put it:\n\n       We are the textbook middle class . . . sliding into a \n     jobless, homeless, and hopeless future.\n\n  Mr. President, I come this afternoon to share her story with you \nbecause the pain she is going through is being felt by millions of \nAmericans who have lost their jobs and their homes in the last couple \nof years. Families such as hers feel as though their lives are slipping \nout from under them, and they are looking to us for help.\n  The House and the Senate have taken a critical step forward by \npassing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. It is going to give \nour economy the jolt it needs to create jobs and help our country get \nback on track. But we are not done yet. We still need to get that bill \nto the President. Every day we wait, the economy gets worse. Every day, \nmore jobs are cut, more small businesses close their doors, more homes \nare lost, and more families are forced to make new sacrifices just to \nmake ends meet. That is why I have come to the floor this evening.\n  The American people need action now. They need us to set aside our \ndifferences and put a final bill into President Obama's hands so we can \nstart the real work of getting our country moving again. So I urge my \ncolleagues in the House and the Senate to finish this job and give this \nbill final approval.\n  We know the bill that is coming out of conference is not perfect, but \nit makes tried-and-true investments that will help create jobs and get \nour country back on track. It makes a downpayment on the future by \nrebuilding our roads and bridges, our water and sewer plants--\ninvestments that will put people to work today and strengthen our \neconomy for years to come.\n  The bill expands our renewable energy options, creating good-paying \njobs in a growing industry and helping to end our addiction to oil. It \nwill also help improve health care and cut costs by computerizing \nhealth records and boosting research. It invests in education and job \ntraining that will help our laid-off workers learn new skills and find \nnew jobs.\n  Mr. President, our economy is not going to recover overnight. We \nstill have very hard times ahead. But I am confident this is the urgent \naction we need to begin moving forward again. I want to take a few \nminutes this evening to talk about what it will mean for families in my \nhome State of Washington.\n  To begin with, this bill offers a helping hand to thousands of \nfamilies in Washington State who are struggling to meet their basic \nneeds. In the last couple of months, we have seen a demand for food \nstamps, Medicaid, and other programs rise dramatically. Food stamp \napplications are up 15 percent over last year. State workers have said \nthey are having trouble keeping up with the demand. This bill is going \nto help us meet the needs of the most vulnerable families by extending \nunemployment insurance benefits, expanding food stamps, and increasing \nfunding to help with Medicaid costs.\n  This isn't just the moral thing to do, we would not be able to dig \nourselves out of this economic crisis until people have money to spend. \nSo this is the right decision economically as well. The money we spend \non unemployment and food stamps will go right back into the economy as \npeople use the benefits to pay for things they need. That is the same \nreason we are working to get money into the hands of working families \nand small business owners.\n  Like families all across the country, people in my home State are \nscared, they are struggling to make ends meet, and they aren't \nspending. So we include in this bill an income tax cut that will give \nalmost 2\\1/2\\ million Washington workers some extra money in their \npaychecks every week. Because this bill is about stabilizing our \neconomy and getting our country back on track, we are also including \nfunding to help struggling families pay for critical expenses, such as \nchildcare or health care or college tuition.\n  I was a working mom. I know that reliable childcare is what makes it \npossible for millions of parents to go to work every day. This bill \nincreases the childcare development block grant so more parents can \nafford quality daycare for their kids. It increases Pell grants and \nhigher education tax credits to help thousands of our students stay in \ncollege, get their degree, and then qualify for a good-paying job. \nImportantly, the bill also makes COBRA more affordable so people who \nhave lost their jobs can keep their health insurance while they look \nfor work.\n  So we are helping working families pay for their basic expenses, stay \nin school, and keep their jobs and their health care. That is critical \nto getting our country back on track.\n  But the biggest jolt to our economy will come from the millions of \njobs we are creating in construction, in environmental cleanup, and in \nenergy development. In my State, this bill will help put thousands of \npeople to work fixing our roads and bridges and upgrading our mass \ntransit and ferry systems. These are investments that will also make \nour communities stronger and more attractive to businesses in the long \nrun. It will help us take a big step toward energy independence and \nlower energy costs for everyone.\n  This bill expands the Bonneville Power Administration's existing \nborrowing authority, and it will help us take advantage of more \nrenewable energy sources and hire hundreds of thousands of new \nemployees who will be trained to update our energy transmission \nsystems. That will allow the new energy we hope to produce, such as \nwind, get to our homes and our businesses and save all of us money in \nthe future.\n  This bill will also help create and preserve jobs at Hanford, and it \nwill keep our legal and moral commitment to cleaning up nuclear waste \nin Washington State and across the country. It will also ensure that we \ncan fulfill our responsibility to our Nation's veterans by making \ninvestments in badly needed construction and repair projects at our VA \nhospitals and medical facilities in Washington State and across the \ncountry.\n  But we are not just creating construction jobs in this bill. We are \nhelping our local and State governments keep critical employees on the \njob--our police and our firefighters, our teachers, our university \nemployees. This economic crisis has hit State and local governments \nterribly hard. They have had to make cuts across the board, including \nin education and emergency response. Local officials have told me they \nare very worried about what that will mean for their communities. \nPolice chiefs and sheriffs have been warning me that I.D. theft, \nburglary, bank robbery, fraud, and gang activity are going to increase \nas jobs vanish and people become more desperate.\n  In this bill we provide money for Byrne and COPS grants to help keep\n\n[[Page S2168]]\n\nour police on the beat and our families safe. Just as important, this \nbill will help our schools and our colleges and our universities keep \ntheir doors open and keep the teachers in the classroom.\n  School board members from across my home State of Washington told me \nthis week they are struggling to afford everything from salaries to \ntheir light bills. Several of them have already started laying off, and \nthey are worried there is more to come. Universities in my home State \nare looking at hundreds of job cuts.\n\n  Education is critical to our communities, especially when the economy \nis bad. We need strong schools and colleges to train the workforce of \nthe future. We need to make sure they are strong so our current \nworkforce can get the skills and training they need to qualify for \nbetter jobs as well. We can't afford to take a step backward. So we are \nsending billions of critically needed dollars to schools and colleges \nacross the country to keep the lights on, the doors open, teachers on \nthe job, and to make sure we can meet the needs of students who have \nbeen hurt by this economic crisis.\n  Mr. President, let me add one other note. We aren't just helping to \nmake up for State budget cuts. We are adding incentives that make sure \nschools keep working to increase standards and improve education for \nall of our students.\n  Finally, we are also investing in our greatest resource--our \nworkers--so that our communities can stay productive and competitive in \nthe global economy. This bill includes $64 million for training and job \nresearch services that will help our laid-off workers in Washington \nState learn the skills they need so they can begin new careers and stay \nin the middle class. It also provides incentives to encourage \nbusinesses to hire homeless veterans and disadvantaged teenagers who \nare looking for jobs today.\n  Mr. President, this isn't just going to help our teens and our \nveterans find jobs, it is good for the economy too. Teenagers, in \nparticular, as we all know, are more likely to spend the money they \nearn in their own communities, and some of them also contribute to \ntheir families' incomes to help pay rent or put food on the table. So \nthis is a smart investment.\n  This bill we are going to consider in the next day or so is critical \nfor my home State. In Washington alone it will create thousands of jobs \nand make investments that will strengthen our communities for years to \ncome. It isn't perfect. It is not a silver bullet that will solve all \nof our problems, but it certainly is the first of many steps that we \nare going to have to take to get our country turned around.\n  As President Obama has outlined, getting our economy back on track is \ngoing to take an aggressive three-pronged approach. The first step is \nto recover and reinvest. We also have to stabilize our financial \ninstitutions to fix the credit and banking system. We need to address \nthe housing crisis. But I want to emphasize, we have to do all three if \nwe are going to get this economy moving again. We are starting today \nwith a bold recovery bill. While there are no guarantees with any of \nthis, we can guarantee that if we do nothing, things are going to get \nworse. As hard as it has been to write and put this bill together, it \ndoes not even compare to the pain that is being felt by millions of \nAmericans who are going to wake up tomorrow without a job.\n\n  They are watching us now, and they are expecting us to make good on \nthe promises we have made--to bring change to Washington and restore \nconfidence and security in our country. They expect us to work \ntogether. They expect us to put our differences aside and make the \ndifficult decisions that will move our country forward. They cannot \nafford to wait any longer.\n  When I was growing up, my father was diagnosed with multiple \nsclerosis and all of a sudden he couldn't work any longer. My family--\nall seven kids, my mom--had to survive on food stamps. My brothers and \nsisters and I were able to go to college because of Pell grants and \nstudent loans. So I want you to know I understand what a lot of our \nfamilies are going through today as they struggle in this economy. That \nis why I am working so hard with so many others to find ways that our \nGovernment and our country can help today.\n  President Obama made it clear Monday night that if we do not act, the \neconomic crisis we are in now could become an economic catastrophe. I \nurge my colleagues to help pass this bill out of the conference, \nthrough the Senate and House, get it signed, get Americans back to \nwork, and get our country on the road to recovery.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/11/senate-section/article/S2168-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
