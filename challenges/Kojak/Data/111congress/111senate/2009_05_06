Mr. President, it should be clear to everyone at this \npoint that the administration got ahead of itself by announcing an \narbitrary closing date for Guantanamo before it even drew up a list of \nsafe alternatives. So I rise this morning to express my continuing \nconcerns about the administration's apparent lack of a plan for \ndetainees at this facility and to press the administration for answers \non a number of important questions.\n  Over the past 2 weeks, I and others have asked the Attorney General \nto provide the American people with the assurance that closing \nGuantanamo will keep the American people as safe as Guantanamo has. We \nhave asked a series of questions. So far these questions have gone \nunanswered. But the questions remain.\n  Which detainees will be released or transferred overseas?\n  How do we know these men will not return to the battlefield?\n  Will they be tried in American courts or will we use military \ncommissions?\n\n[[Page S5170]]\n\n  Will any be sent to U.S. soil, even though the Senate voted against \nit 94 to 3?\n  Finally, what legal basis does the administration have to release \ntrained terrorists into the U.S.?\n  Americans want answers. Unfortunately, the administration seems more \ncomfortable discussing its plans for the inmates at Guantanamo with a \nEuropean audience than it is discussing these details with Americans.\n  Senator Sessions wrote a letter to the Attorney General weeks before \nhis trip to Europe asking about the legality of releasing trained \nterrorists into the U.S. He sent another one to the same effect on \nMonday. He still has not heard back.\n  During the same trip, Attorney General Holder talked specifics about \nGuantanamo with European leaders. He said that the administration has \nidentified 30 detainees at Guantanamo who are ready for release and \nthat he would ``be reaching out to specific countries with specific \ndetainees.'' And according to reports, the administration has presented \nat least one country with a list of detainees it would like that \ncountry to accept.\n  Americans want to know that on the issue of Guantanamo the \nadministration is as concerned about safety as it is about symbolism. \nThey are concerned about the administration's plans for releasing or \ntransferring some of the most dangerous terrorists alive. They want to \nknow that these terrorists will not end up back on the battlefield or \nin their backyards.\n  At the very least, they should know as much about the \nadministration's plans for these men as our European critics do.\n  So this morning I would like to ask the Attorney General to provide \nCongress with any information he has provided to foreign governments \nabout his plans for detainees at Guantanamo. If the administration will \nnot relate its plans to the American people or their representatives in \nCongress, it should at least relate the details of its conversations on \nthis issue with foreign leaders. This is not too much to ask.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/06/senate-section/article/S5170-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss some of the \nenergy issues currently facing the American economy. First among them \nis our dependence on foreign sources of energy.\n  Last summer, we all experienced the consequences of serving the \nforeign masters who control most of the oil we consume. In July, oil \nprices climbed to just under $150 per barrel. Policymakers wrung their \nhands and scrambled while Americans tried to control their frustration. \nWhat did Americans see? They saw prices rising uncontrollably on the \nglobal petroleum market. That was especially painful for families. At \nthe same time some at least started to realize that we have abundant \nreserves right here at home. But these reserves have been actively \nblocked by Federal policy for over 20 years.\n  Just how import dependent are we as a nation? Last year we imported \nabout 4.7 billion barrels of oil. Based on an average price of $100 per \nbarrel, Americans shipped about $470 billion overseas, nearly half a \ntrillion dollars. That was just for calendar year 2008 alone.\n  We need to address this problem by expanding every domestic energy \nsource in an environmentally responsible way. This strategy should \ninclude clean and renewable sources. I believe in that.\n  But one might ask: Why raise this issue now? That was last summer, \nand this year prices are down some. I raise this issue now to note to \nNebraskans and to my Senate colleagues that even though prices have \nrelented, our exposure to foreign oil markets has not changed. That \nalarms me, and it should alarm my colleagues.\n  I fear the American people are getting set up again. Unfortunately, \nUnited States policy on domestic sources of energy hasn't changed much. \nFor too long our Federal policy on domestic energy sources has \nconsisted of three words: No, no, and no. Unfortunately, since this \nadministration has taken office, we have seen evidence of more of the \nsame tired no, no, no policies. First the administration in February \ncanceled 77 leases for natural gas development in the State of Utah. \nCan we turn our backs on a domestic resource as critical as this one? \nWe know that natural gas is clean relative to other fossil fuels. We \nknow demand for natural gas is only going to increase. We need look no \nfurther than the Capitol's own power plant. The Speaker of the House \nand her own majority leader announced on Friday that we will no longer \nburn coal to heat the Capitol complex buildings and water.\n  What is the alternative? It is natural gas. Most troubling, perhaps, \nwe know that natural gas is not easily transported. So increasing \ndemand translates very quickly into increased price where additional \nsupply is not available. This is not only true for heating; it is \nespecially true for fertilizer and other industrial uses of natural \ngas. Fertilizer affects my State immensely. For the good of our \nfarmers, for the good of manufacturers, for the good of the Nation, we \nneed to find more domestic sources of natural gas.\n  If the administration says no to Utah, what about energy exploration \nin the Outer Continental Shelf, known as the OCS? Since the early \n1980s, there has been in place a Federal moratorium of one sort or \nanother on exploration in the OCS. Essentially, most of the Federal \nwaters of the Atlantic and California coasts were off limits to energy \ndevelopment. This is worth repeating. For more than 20 years, Federal \npolicy blocked energy exploration in many of the OCS areas.\n  Finally, last year, in the face of $4 gasoline and very angry \nconstituents, the moratorium on OCS exploration was lifted. \nUnfortunately, it appears to have been a short-lived victory.\n  In February, the administration announced a delay in the rules for \nexploration and utilization of the natural gas and crude oil off our \nshores. The administration assures us that the delay is only to pave \nthe way for ``wise decisions.'' But to a savvy American public, it \nsounds like more of the same. It sounds like a policy of no, no, and no \nor at least delay, delay, delay some more, especially when they hear \nthat the same script was used for oil shale leases. That is right. The \nadministration in February also withdrew leases for research and \ndevelopment of oil shale on Federal lands in Colorado and Utah where \nour oil shale resources are equivalent to 800 billion barrels of oil.\n  The reason: According to the administration, the leases had ``several \nflaws.''\n  So what is the promise? The administration would offer a new round of \noil shale leases for research and development. I will take the \nadministration at its word but, again, it does sound like a broken \nrecord: Delay, delay, delay. So Americans, Nebraskans, and this Senator \ncannot be faulted for being a bit skeptical, for thinking that the most \nrecent delays are simply more of the same. The day will return--\nunfortunately, perhaps in the not too distant future--when fuel prices \nwill shoot up. Promises that the administration is doing everything it \ncan may very well ring hollow. Americans will know that 77 leases for \nnatural gas exploration were canceled. Americans will know that OCS and \noil shale development and exploration was delayed again. Meanwhile \ntheir commutes are not getting any shorter. Their electricity bills are \nnot going down. Fertilizer and food prices are continuing to increase.\n  There has been a lot of talk from the administration about ending our \ndependence on foreign oil. I welcome that. I want to be a partner in \nthat.\n\n[[Page S5171]]\n\nBut so far the actions don't match the promises. The administration's \nonly comprehensive policy document, which would be the budget outline \nto date, contains no effort to increase domestic production of critical \noil and natural gas resources. Instead, the proposal raises taxes on \nthe consumption of energy, spends a small fraction of the revenue on \nenergy research, and claims that it is a strategy to end our dependence \non foreign oil. Again, we see a policy of saying no to domestic energy \nsources.\n  Research and development in this field--don't get me wrong--is a good \nthing. It is a great thing, as a matter of fact. But we need to be \ncandid with the American people. This should not be about bait and \nswitch. We cannot promise a plan to end our dependence on foreign oil \nbut give them the President's proposal to reach in the back pocket to \ntake control of more of their money. With an abundant, largely untapped \nsupply here at home, surely the administration can do better than to \nsay their best idea is to restrict demand through an energy tax. That \nis essentially telling the Americans, your best bet is to buy a sweater \nbecause it is going to be costly to heat your home.\n  I am going to end my comments where I started. I am worried. \nNebraskans are frustrated by a policy of saying no to American energy. \nI am in favor of the expansion of domestic sources of energy of all \nsorts--wind and solar, wave and tidal and geothermal, alternative \nbiofuels and nuclear--a policy of doing all we can to end our \ndependence on foreign oil. But I am also for expanding domestic sources \nof natural gas and crude oil. We need them. It simply makes no sense to \nbuy from abroad, indeed to beg for more oil at times, when we have made \nit a matter of Federal policy to place our resources off limits. I, as \none Senator, will be watchful. The President will send up his budget \nthis week. We will see if the President demonstrates a commitment to \nbringing on line American natural gas and oil resources. I hope he \ndoes. I will be anxious to support that. We will watch and see if the \nadministration continues, though, the policy of no when it comes to \nenergy that is right here at home.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to talk about a very \nimportant and very moving exhibit I am proud to host in the Capitol \ncomplex; in particular, specifically in the Russell Building. The name \nof the exhibit is called ``Witness to Hunger.'' It is a project created \nby Dr. Mariana Chilton at Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA, and it \nis currently on display not far from here in the Russell Building.\n  To create this exhibit, Dr. Chilton gave cameras--cameras--to 40 \nwomen living in Philadelphia so they could document their lives, their \nstruggles with hunger and poverty and so many other challenges. The \nresult is a powerful exhibit of photographs giving us an insight--not \nthe whole picture but an insight--into the lives of these women and the \nlives they lead and their children's lives and their struggles living \ntoday in Philadelphia.\n  Women who are living in this city--part of this exhibit--try every \nday to provide a safe and nurturing home for their children, while \nfinding a job that pays a living wage. They labor every day to provide \nfood and medicine for their children. These are women fighting to make \nsure their children, their families, can have the health care they \nneed. I will have the opportunity today to meet with several of the \nwomen who participated in the ``Witness to Hunger'' exhibit and this \nproject. I wish to thank them for their bravery and rare courage to be \nable to open themselves, open part of their lives to all of us, and for \nmaking the trip to Washington so we can hear about their experiences \nfirsthand.\n  I have always believed that at its best, when it is doing the right \nthing, Government is about people. It is not, in the end, about budgets \nand data and information and numbers. That is important, but that is \nthe means to the end. It should be about not every day do we meet this \nobjective, but it should be about and must be about people. Today, we \nhave a real example of that, a real living example of real people's \nlives. ``Witness to Hunger'' reminds us that the programs we advocate \nfor and work on and new initiatives in Washington that affect people's \nlives are what we must be about. There is no better investment, in my \njudgment, than in the future of our children.\n  I also believe every child in America--every single child--is born \nwith a light inside them. For some, that light will be boundless or \nscintillating or incandescent. Pick your word. There are no limits to \nthe potential some children have; because of intellect or circumstance \nor otherwise, their future is indeed boundless. For other children, \nthat light is a little more limited because of those same \ncircumstances. But I also believe, at the same time, no matter whether \nthat light inside a child is boundless or much more limited, it is our \nobligation to do everything we can to make sure that child's \npotential--that bright light--is given the opportunity to shine as \nbrightly as possible.\n  Kids in school right now will be the workforce that will help us \nbuild new industries and jobs and transform our economy into the \nfuture. The good news is we have already passed some important pieces \nof legislation that are improving children's lives. Last year, the farm \nbill included a very strong nutrition section to increase access and \nbenefits for people who use food stamps, now called by the acronym \nSNAP, but food stamps and other nutrition programs. The Children's \nHealth Insurance Program is another example which will bring the number \nof children in America who have the benefit of this good program--this \ntime-tested, effective program--to almost 11 million American children. \nWe will have an opportunity to do more because, despite the \nadvancements we have made in children's health insurance, there are \nstill 5 million more children, even when we get to the 10.5 million, 11 \nmillion children, 5 million more with no health insurance.\n  I have a bill on prekindergarten education, and I will be working on \nthat to make sure children have an opportunity for early learning; \nnutrition programs which also include not just food stamps, as I \nmentioned before, but the school lunch program, the Women, Infants, and \nChildren Program, and on and on. One of the most important endeavors we \nwill be working on in the near term is the Child Nutrition Act, \ncritically important to make sure children get a healthy start in life.\n  When we talk about that light inside a child, I do believe we have--\nall of us in both parties, in both Houses of Congress, and in the \nadministration--all of us have an obligation to make sure that light \nshines as brightly as possible for each and every child. We do that by \ndoing a number of things. One is to make sure the children have access \nto early learning, that they have nutrition in the early years of their \nlife, and that they also have health care. If we at least provide that \nopportunity for every child--nutrition, health care, and early \nlearning--not only will that child be better off, we are all going to \nbe better off in terms of the kind of economy and, therefore, the kind \nof workforce that is the foundation of that economy we build into the \nfuture.\n  I hope my colleagues and their staffs have a chance to view this \nexhibit ``Witness to Hunger.'' I also believe it is in keeping with and \nis consistent with that commitment to make sure the light in every \nchild burns as brightly as possible for each and every child in his or \nher family. I know that is my obligation as a Senator from \nPennsylvania, and I believe it is all our obligations as Senators.\n  Mr. President, thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, is the vote at 10:30?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

In fact, \ninstead of getting a brandnew car, the taxpayer is going to let a \nlemon.\n  What is being proposed by the administration--or what was proposed \nprior to the bankruptcy being filed and which is now being pushed by \nthe administration into bankruptcy, as I understand it--is that the \nthree different classes of basic players, relative to the \nreorganization of Chrysler, would get significantly different \ntreatment. For example, the taxpayer, who has already put $4 billion \ninto Chrysler--the American taxpayer--would have to forgive all of \nthat; all $4 billion would be lost, 100 percent lost under the \nadministration's proposal, and then they would be asked to put another \n$8 billion into the pot as Chrysler comes out of bankruptcy. In \nexchange for forgiving the first $4 billion, the taxpayer would get 8 \npercent of the new Chrysler, the Chrysler that came out of bankruptcy. \nThis was the proposal. I don't think that sounds like a great deal for \nthe taxpayer, to have put $4 billion in and get none of it back--and \nremember, we just put the $4 billion in--and then to be asked to put \nanother $8 billion in and get an 8-percent stake. It especially doesn't \nmake a lot of sense when you look at what is proposed--well, let's go \nto the bondholders next, though.\n  The bondholders would be asked to essentially take an even more \nsignificant reduction in their position, which may be legitimate. They \nwould be asked to forgive, I believe--well, I am not absolutely sure of \nthe number they would be asked to forgive, but I think it would be in \nthe multiple-billion-dollar range, and they would be asked to forgive \nit, even though they may be secured bondholders. So they would be \nbasically wiped out in this process or their interests would be reduced \ndramatically.\n  The practical implications of that are that the bondholders had \ninvested poorly, obviously, and specifically, they would have to \nforgive, I believe, $4 billion of their $6.8 billion of debt, and they \nwould get $2 billion back. But that would be a big haircut, and that is \nprobably reasonable. They made a bad investment. But interestingly \nenough, even though they are secured creditors, in many instances, or \nhave a higher priority of bond debt than, for example, the UAW debt or \nmaybe even the taxpayer debt, their position would be treated more \ndetrimentally than the taxpayer or the UAW. That doesn't bother me all \nthat much, from the standpoint of the taxpayer. Obviously, we should be \ntreated better than anybody else in this process.\n  It does bother me a little bit from the standpoint of how you \nprioritize debt. If we look at what is happening with the UAW in the \ndeal, as proposed by the administration, they would have to forgive, I \nbelieve, approximately $6 billion of their outstanding responsibility--\noutstanding debt--which is about 57 percent of the obligation of \nChrysler to the UAW. But in exchange for forgiving that $6 billion, \nthey would get a 55-percent stake in the new company.\n  So to review this situation, the UAW would forgive 57 percent of \ntheir debt owed them by the company--or $6 billion--and they would get \n55 percent of the new company. The taxpayer would have to forgive 100 \npercent of what was just put into Chrysler and would get 8 percent of \nthe new company. The senior bondholders would have to forgive all of \ntheir debt, and in exchange they would get $2 billion back. That \ndoesn't make a lot of sense.\n  Basically, what is happening is, the UAW, the union, is being put in \na far superior position than the bondholders, who are secure, or the \nAmerican taxpayer, who basically was asked to put up $4 billion, and \nthen has that wiped out in exchange for 8 percent of the new company, \nand then is being asked to put in another $8 billion.\n  This has two fairly significant implications. First, the taxpayer is \nbuying a lemon, getting a bad deal. We, the taxpayers, are getting a \nbad deal. Second, the unions are getting a great deal. They are getting \na higher status as secured debtors. They are getting a significantly \nhigher return--which is 55 percent versus 8 percent of the new \ncompany--than the taxpayer. The process is basically turning on its \nhead the traditional legal order under which people are repaid out of a \nbankruptcy estate. The taxpayer usually comes first out of a bankruptcy \nestate. Usually, it is the IRS in that case, then comes senior debt, \nthen comes the issue of debt owed to pension funds, obligations which \nthe unions have, and then comes the common equity. In this structure, \nit is just the opposite. Well, that change sends a very serious signal \nto the marketplace that is not good because if people don't know the \nprioritization of debt, then they don't know how to lend money and what \nthe cost of the money they lend should be.\n  That is going to affect interest rates and create uncertainty and \nbasically undermine what is an established rule of law that we have in \nthis Nation relative to the prioritization of how people get paid off \nwhen somebody goes into bankruptcy. It is a very important issue, one \nof the things that makes our commercial system different than, say, a \nplace like Russia, where you have no idea what is going to happen when \nyou go into a court system because it is totally arbitrary. In ours, we \nhave a structured proposal, an orderly way of approaching things. \nEverybody knows what is going to happen if an investment should go \nsouth. Everybody knows what their order of priority is in being paid \nout. In a bankruptcy situation, it is pretty clear.\n  Yet now comes the administration, and for what appears to be purely \npolitical reasons, not economic reasons, because the economic issue is \nhow you basically take a company such as Chrysler and make it \ncompetitive again so it can produce cars that people want to buy at a \nprice people can afford--that is the economic issue--and keep it viable \nto the extent that it is viable. No, this is a political decision to \nreorder who the winners and losers are in a structure--what amounts to \nan attempt to structure a bankruptcy before it occurs. That was the \nadministration's initiative.\n  This is a serious issue. When we start putting politics in place of \nthe law in any area in our Nation, but obviously in the area of \ncommercial activity--when we start picking winners and losers based on \nthe political party's implied interest or interest in seeing a certain \nsegment of the society be the winner versus another segment they see as \nbeing less deserving, then we undermine the essence of our commercial \nactivity in this Nation, which is to have knowable, identifiable, \nascertainable results, as a result of having a legal system that \ndefines people's property rights.\n  Yet this administration, in a very cavalier way, has suggested that \nthe UAW should be a huge winner compared to the taxpayers and the \nbondholders in a manner which has no relationship to what has been the \nhistorical priority of status relative to distributing and reorganizing \na company--distributing a bankruptcy estate and reorganizing a company.\n  Why would it occur that this administration would, in a very \narbitrary way, try to set aside the rules of priority of ownership and \nproperty rights to benefit one group over another group outside of what \nhas been the historical and legal way things have been structured? It \nis obvious. It doesn't take much to recognize that. The UAW has a huge \npolitical influence in this administration and in this Congress. They \nused that political influence to make sure this deal was structured in \na way that most significantly benefitted them. But who is the loser? \nThe loser is the real stakeholders and people to whom we are supposed \nto have primary responsibility as a government, and that is the \ntaxpayers. The taxpayers are the losers on the face of it, when we\n\n[[Page S5173]]\n\nonly get 8 percent and the unions get 55 percent of the new company, \nand we are paying $4 billion and they are paying $6 billion, and then \nwe are putting in another $8 billion on top of our $4 billion. So it \nends up being $12 billion, and we only get 8 percent. The unions will \nput in $6 billion to get 55 percent.\n  That is not right. It is not appropriate, and it is not fair to the \ntaxpayers of America. But that was the proposal and what is trying to \nbe strong-armed through this system. It is not fair to the taxpayers. \nIt also sets a dangerous precedent of trying to reorganize the stated \npriority of status relative to the right to recover under a bankruptcy \nsituation or pursuant to secure property issues in a way that could be \ntranslated into, significantly, other parts of the economy.\n  People will now question the status of their debt and inevitably have \nto charge more in order to try to ensure over the unpredictable \nconsequences of the Government coming in and reordering the priority of \nthe debt. That is dangerous in a commercial society that depends on law \nin order to set an established order of property rights.\n  This is a big issue. It hasn't been discussed much. Obviously, the \nbankruptcy courts have now stepped in because some of the secured \nparties have said they wouldn't accept the deal. But still the \nadministration pushes this concept of having the taxpayer take a vastly \nsignificant, reduced position compared to the UAW, while putting in \nmuch more money than the UAW and, at the same time, reordering the \npriority of property rights.\n  I hope people will begin to focus on this issue, and I hope our \nbankruptcy courts will stick with what is the order of the law and not \nthe order of politics.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk (Adam Gottlieb) proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am going to read a unanimous consent \nrequest which will list a lot of numbers, but these numbers relate to \nMembers and the various amendments being offered and the sequencing of \nthem. I say to my colleagues, Senator Reed from Rhode Island, Senator \nBoxer, Senator Casey, and Senator Grassley, that if they would like a \nminute to be heard, this consent request includes giving them a minute \nto address their amendment. That order is: Senator Reed, Senator Boxer, \nSenator Casey, and Senator Grassley.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for votes be \nchanged as follows and that votes occur in relation to the amendments \ncovered under the previous agreement; that it be in order to consider \nand agree to the following amendments, en bloc, and that the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, en bloc: amendment No. 1039, as \nmodified, amendment No. 1035, amendment No. 1033, and amendment No. \n1020; that a Member with an amendment being accepted be accorded a \nminute; further, that the vote sequence now be amendment No. 1036, as \nmodified, amendment No. 1031, as modified, amendment No. 1042, \namendment No. 1040, and amendment No. 1021, as modified; further, that \nthe remaining provisions of the previous order remain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Rhode Island is entitled to 1 \nminute.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1039, as Modified\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank the chairman.\n  My amendment makes it very clear that when financial institutions \nrepay their TARP funds, the Secretary of the Treasury is not required \nto liquidate or surrender the warrants. Warrants were issued to the \nDepartment of Treasury in conjunction with the capital injections under \nTARP. They are valuable financial instruments. They are separate from \nthe TARP funds. I think it is the responsibility of the Secretary of \nthe Treasury to balance many factors, but one factor they must consider \nis obtaining a substantial return for the taxpayers because of their \ninvestment of funds. This will allow him the discretion to do that. It \nwill be an important way in which the Treasury Department can recoup \nsome of the investments of the taxpayers in this program.\n  I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I strongly endorse the Reed amendment. It is \na very strong contribution to the bill. I commend him for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1035\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I say thank you, particularly to Chairman \nDodd but also to Senator Shelby, with whom I have discussed this \namendment. It is very simple. It just says that if you have a mortgage \non your home, you ought to know who holds that mortgage note. We say \nthat if your mortgage is sold to someone else, the new party has to let \nyou know who they are and how they can be contacted. This is very \nimportant. We have read stories where people cannot find out who holds \ntheir mortgage. Frankly, if you are in trouble and you want to \nrenegotiate your mortgage, you need to sit down with the company that \nholds your note. That is all we do in this amendment.\n  I am very pleased. It seems like a no-brainer to me. Clearly, the law \nneeds to be made explicit because, frankly, the people who hold the \nmortgages seem to go into hiding and you cannot find them when you want \nto find them.\n  Again, my deepest thanks. I appreciate it.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Boxer of California for this \namendment. It is so reasonable, and yet so many people have had \ndifficulty. Today, with the securitization of mortgages, that mortgage \nno longer stays at your bank for the length of that mortgage. Today, it \nis sold off very quickly. When homeowners want to\n\n[[Page S5174]]\n\nfind out who actually has that mortgage, it is almost impossible to \ndiscover that. Senator Boxer's amendment makes that possible once \nagain, and it is a very valuable contribution to the bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a letter signed by several consumer organizations supporting \nthis amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      May 4, 2009.\n     Chairman Christopher Dodd,\n     Senate Banking Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd: The undersigned representatives of \n     homeowners strongly urge you to support the amendment offered \n     by Senator Boxer which would only require that homeowners be \n     informed of who owns their mortgage loans. This simple \n     disclosure bill mandates that when a mortgage loan is \n     transferred, the homeowner be informed of how to reach an \n     agent of the new owner with the authority to act on its \n     behalf.\n       There are many examples of homeowners who were unable to \n     exercise their federal rights, unable to work out a \n     reasonable solution to all parties, unable to avoid a \n     foreclosure, even when the foreclosure will cost the investor \n     money, just because the homeowner did not know, and could not \n     find out the identity of the owner of their home mortgage.\n       A recent reported case in Pennsylvania illustrates the need \n     for this straightforward amendment (Meyer v. Argent Mortgage \n     Co. (In re Meyer), 379 B.R. 529 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 2007).) \n     James and Mary Meyer took out a high-rate home loan with \n     Argent Mortgage in 2004. However, when they later attempted \n     to exercise their rights under TILA to rescind that loan, \n     their servicer, Countrywide, refused to identify the current \n     holder. By the time the Meyers discovered that the current \n     holder was Deutsche Bank, the deadline for rescinding the \n     loan had passed. As a result, the court dismissed their \n     claim, even though it found that there were grounds to \n     rescind the loan. Had the Meyers known who their note holder \n     was, they could have exercised their rights under TILA to \n     rescind the loan and cancel the lien against their home.\n       Current law does require that homeowners be informed when \n     the servicer is changed. Yet, servicers too often refuse to \n     modify loans, because their remuneration will be greater if \n     there is a foreclosure. And, federal law requires that \n     servicers tell the homeowner the identity of the note holder. \n     Yet this provision--15 U.S.C. 1641(f)(2)--has completely \n     failed to protect homeowners because there is no private \n     right of action, and no specific requirement to name a \n     particular party with authority to act on behalf of the \n     owner.\n       Senator Boxer's simple amendment provides borrowers with \n     the basic right to know who owns their loan by requiring that \n     within 30 days after a mortgage loan is transferred, the new \n     owner would be required to provide the following information: \n     the identity, address, and telephone number of the new \n     creditor; the date of transfer; how to reach an agent or \n     party having authority to act on behalf of the new creditor; \n     the location of the place where the transfer is recorded; and \n     any other relevant information regarding the new creditor.\n       This is merely a disclosure requirement--to bring a bit of \n     clarity and transparency to the opaque mortgage market. The \n     cost to the industry is small. The benefit to homeowners and \n     communities would be tremendous.\n       Thank you for your consideration. Please contact Margot \n     Saunders at the National Consumer Law Center with any \n     questions--(202) 452 6252, ext. 104.\n           Sincerely,\n     Consumer Action.\n     Consumer Federation of America.\n     Consumers Union.\n     National Association of Consumer Advocates.\n     National Association of Neighborhoods.\n     National Consumer Law Center.\n     National Council of La Raza.\n     National Fair Housing Alliance.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 1 minute.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1033\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Dodd and Senator Shelby, \nas well, and so many others who made it possible for a lot of these \namendments to come together.\n  Our amendment is very simple. It sets aside up to 10 percent of the \ndollars allocated for the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, a very \ngood program. We wanted to have some of those dollars used for \ncounseling or for foreclosure prevention and mitigation. This allows \nthat to happen. It is a very good result for people struggling with the \nterrible problem of foreclosure.\n  I thank the chairman for his work.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator. Having authored the neighborhood \nstabilization bill, those dollars going back to the communities have \nbeen a great asset in order to deal with foreclosed properties and to \nmitigate. Bridgeport, CT, in my State, is one example. I think all of \nour colleagues can cite examples. Allowing for the allocation of some \nof these resources along the lines the Senator from Pennsylvania \nsuggests is a terrific contribution as well. I thank him for it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1020\n\n  Senator Grassley was the other admendment. I commend Senator Grassley \nfor his amendment. It is a good amendment, in my view, and one worthy \nof our support. I am not sure he is going to be able to be here to make \na comment. It is a good amendment. I urge my colleagues to support it. \nWe worked on it yesterday, and Senator Grassley is to be commended for \nhis efforts.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1036, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 1036, as modified, offered by the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kerry.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we have taken a lot of effort to try to \nhelp troubled borrowers in communities that have foreclosed properties. \nHere is the problem that exists. If you are a renter and living in a \nproperty that has been foreclosed on, you have nothing to do with the \nforeclosure, you are paying rent, you have a lease, but a lot of these \npeople are getting kicked out of their apartments, out of their homes.\n  What we want to do is provide them with a provision where they will \nhave 90 days--if the people who foreclosed are going to use that \nresidence as a primary residence. If the residence is going to continue \nto be a multiple-party residence where they have a number of people \nrenting and they will continue to use it as such, we want to leave \nthose leases in effect until the end of the lease. We are protecting \nlegitimate, low- to moderate-income folks in America who do not get \nprotections otherwise from being just booted out on the street, which \nis literally what has happened in the absence of this protection.\n  This provision will sunset in the year 2012 and only applies to \nproperties with legitimate leases.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. I know colleagues will support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I believe this is not a good proposal. \nThis changes the law, as we understand it. It has been working a long \ntime. It will cause all kinds of problems. Once a property is \nforeclosed, what do you do with it next? It delays it.\n  I ask my colleagues to oppose the Kerry amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.

Mr. President, I rise to salute an outstanding woman \nwho spent the final days of her life in Michigan and will be buried in \nBattle Creek, MI. It is appropriate that my partner and colleague and \nfriend, Senator Levin, is on the floor as well.\n  I rise to salute a woman who was a pioneer, a patriot, a champion for \nequal rights, and a proud citizen of Michigan for the last 26 years of \nher life, Sojourner Truth. Last week she was honored with a bronze \nbust, a beautiful sculpture by Artis Lane, in Emancipation Hall in the \nCapitol Visitor Center.\n  Sojourner Truth was an activist, someone we might call today a \ncommunity organizer. She was active for civil rights and for women's \nrights. She was also a mother and a proud American.\n  Born into slavery, as a young girl she learned only Dutch because \nthat was the language that was spoken by her plantation owner. When she \nwas only 9 years old, she was sold with a flock of sheep for $100 at an \nauction. Her new owner did not speak Dutch and beat her severely until \nshe learned English. She did learn English, and quickly, but carried a \nsubtle Dutch accent for the rest of her life.\n  Eventually, she was married, not the man of her choice but the man of \nher master's choice, and had several children. Sojourner had secured a \ncommitment from the plantation owner that if she worked hard and \nfaithfully, she would be freed. When the State of New York, where she \nwas at the time, began the process of emancipation, she approached the \nowner and asked him to honor her agreement. He refused.\n  Infuriated, she went to work. She worked hard until she felt she had \nupheld her end of the bargain and then she walked away. She said: ``I \ndid not run off, for I thought that wicked, but I walked off, believing \nthat to be all right.''\n  She began working to free the rest of her family from slavery. When \nNew York finally emancipated all of the slaves, Sojourner found, to her \nhorror, that her 5-year-old son Peter had been illegally sold to a \nplantation in Alabama. She turned to her faith in God, as she had done \nwhen she endured the lash and as she would do as she continued her \nfight for equal rights.\n  She turned to her friends in the religious community, especially the \nQuakers, who offered her comfort and counsel. She turned to the law, to \nthat great promise of America, that liberty and justice are accessible \nto everyone.\n  When her son, this little 5-year-old boy, her precious child, walked \ninto the courtroom, Sojourner was stunned. Her tiny son had been abused \nwith such cruelty; he had scars from head to toe. She cried out:\n\n       See my poor child. Oh, Lord, render unto them double for \n     all of this!\n\n  She won her case, a Black woman against a wealthy White man, a rare \noccurrence. Less than a year later, that same slaveholder, apparently \nwithout little Peter to beat up on, beat and killed his wife. On \nhearing the news, Sojourner was devastated. She realized her prayer had \nbeen answered, but she did not rejoice. She said: ``I did not mean \nquite so much, God.''\n  Such character in this woman. Sojourner Truth stands out as someone \nwho has been devoted to values we hold dear today: liberty, equality, \njustice, and also a deep compassion and sympathy for the suffering of \nothers.\n  She truly embodied the Christian principles of hope, love, and \ncharity. She eventually came to live in a small religious community \ncalled Harmonia, located just outside Battle Creek, MI. There she \npreached the gospel and traveled around the country, giving speeches \nand fighting for the abolition of slavery and the rights of women.\n  Sojourner helped recruit Black troops for the Union Army to end the \nscourge of slavery. She was a leader in her community, an elder, and a \nsource of inspiration. She was a humanitarian, traveling to Kansas in \nher eighties to help the refugees who were fleeing discrimination in \nthe South.\n\n[[Page S5176]]\n\n  She never lost her faith in God or in the inherent goodness of all \npeople, no matter how awful they acted, no matter what terrible things \nthey had done to her. In these trying times, she is truly an example of \nthe kind of person we should all wish to be.\n  I am proud she chose to make Michigan her home for the last 26 years \nof her life and her final resting place. We are a State full of \nfighters, with a spirit that gets us through tough times, which we \ncertainly are facing today.\n  I am pleased that as visitors come to the Capitol, as they enter \nEmancipation Hall, they can see Sojourner Truth as she was: A fighter, \na spirited woman, a passionate civil rights leader, and a mother filled \nwith compassion, a patriot, and the embodiment of the American ideal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Madam President, there was a debate last week on the \nfloor of the Senate about the mortgage foreclosure crisis facing \nAmerica. It was estimated a year ago we were going to lose 2 million \nhomes to mortgage foreclosure.\n  The new estimate from Moody's is 8 million homes. What does that \nmean? It means one out of every six home mortgages will face \nforeclosure. That is a national crisis. It is at the heart of this \nrecession.\n  The problem, of course, is that those people who have loaned money on \nthese mortgages are content to see them go all the way through \nforeclosure and become vacant eyesores in neighborhoods across America.\n  That is not good for the family who lost the home, it is certainly \nnot good for the neighbors next door who watch their real estate values \nplummet. It turns out, it is not good for the bank. A bank in \nforeclosure will lose some $50,000 in the process, with all the fees \nthat are associated with it, and then end up with an empty house.\n  Some 99 percent of homes in foreclosure go back to the bank, and they \nsit there as eyesores because banks are not landlords; they do not cut \nthe grass, they do not worry about whether the flowers are going to be \nplanted in the spring. They are waiting for something to change \neconomically. While they are waiting, that neighborhood is changing \nbecause of that foreclosed home.\n  A foreclosed home in your neighborhood is going to bring down your \nproperty values. We offered the banks this option: We said to the banks \nand those who hold the mortgages: If you will invite in the borrowers \nat least 45 days before they would file for bankruptcy, have them bring \nthe legal documents in and calculate what it would take to offer them a \nmortgage to stay in the home, if you make them the offer of a \nrenegotiated mortgage and they turn it down, then they go to bankruptcy \ncourt and, frankly, have no recourse there to turn to, because, you \nsee, bankruptcy courts will not change the mortgage on your home, even \nif you are in bankruptcy facing foreclosure.\n  They will change the mortgage on your vacation home, your farm or \nyour ranch but not your primary residence. I literally negotiated with \nbanks for months to try to find out some way we could protect these \nhomeowners to give them a second chance, if, in fact, they had an \nincome and they could, in fact, pay a mortgage, and say to the banks: \nYou have the last word if someone ends up in bankruptcy.\n  Well, we went through months of negotiations. In the end, virtually \nall the banks, all the banks except Citigroup, picked up and walked out \nof the negotiation. They said: We are not interested in negotiating. So \nthe amendment was defeated last week.\n  I did not receive a single vote on the other side of the aisle and \nlost several votes on the Democratic side. Some of the people who \nwatched this debate said: Well, why did you call up this measure? It \nwas not going to pass. I called it up for the same reason this year as \nI did last year. This crisis is getting worse. I have met these people \nwho have lost their homes in foreclosure. I feel a responsibility to \nthem to make an effort so they have a chance to save their homes.\n  Three of them came to a press conference in Chicago on Monday, each \none of them telling a heartbreaking story of a home they worked hard \nfor, and because of some deception in their mortgage or being misled by \na mortgage broker or being given a stack of papers they could not \npossibly absorb and understand, these people were going to lose their \nhomes, many of them in tears after being in these homes for years. \nTheir neighbors came and talked about the same problem. What is it \ngoing to mean with this empty house in foreclosure?\n  So now we find that many of the same people who opposed the idea of \ndealing directly with mortgage foreclosure are now coming forward when \nit comes to the bankruptcy of the Chrysler Automobile Corporation.\n  This morning in the Washington Post, Harold Meyerson had an article \nentitled: ``What's Good for Chrysler.'' He tells the story of a court \nhearing. The court hearing is over the potential bankruptcy of \nChrysler. The attorneys representing the hedge funds have come out in \nopposition to the Chrysler bankruptcy workout.\n  Judge Arthur Gonzalez noted, and I quote from the story, in denying \nthe request of the attorneys for the hedge funds:\n\n       Blocking the loan--\n\n  Which is being asked for--\n\n     would force Chrysler (and, he could have added, many of its \n     suppliers and dealers) to liquidate--throwing tens (perhaps \n     hundreds) of thousands of Americans out of work during the \n     most serious recession since the 1930s and terminating \n     medical benefits to tens of thousands of Chrysler retirees.\n       Liquidation--\n\n  Which is what the hedge fund attorneys are asking for in Court--\n\n     would also compel the American public [the taxpayers] to \n     write off the loans the government has made to the company, \n     rather than become shareholders in the slimmed-down Chrysler, \n     as the Treasury's plan suggests.\n\n  What the Department of the Treasury and the workers are trying to do \nis to save the car company. They understand they have to make massive \nconcessions. They have to change the way they do business. But their \nultimate goal is to see Chrysler survive so that jobs will be protected \nand so that retirees' health benefits will not disappear. So, \nultimately, the taxpayers of America who loaned money to Chrysler will \nbe paid back. The hedge funds, many of them also involved in the \nmortgage crisis, have turned the same deaf ear to Chrysler's situation \nas they did to mortgage foreclosures. They are in it for one reason--to \nmake a buck, take the profit and go home. They don't care about the \nultimate consequence.\n  The ultimate consequence of Chrysler liquidating is, of course, \nmisfortune for the workers and retirees, but more burdens on taxpayers. \nWhat happens to workers who lose their jobs at Chrysler? They draw \nunemployment benefits, benefits paid for, some by the company and \nothers by taxpayers. What happens to retirees who lose health care \nbenefits? They become more dependent on government programs to help \nthem survive.\n  Once again, this part of our economy, the financial industry, has \nshown an insensitivity to the reality of the recession. Whether it is \nmortgages in Albany Park in the city of Chicago foreclosed upon, \nchanging that neighborhood, or whether it is the Chrysler employees and \nretirees fighting for their economic lives, the hedge funds on Wall \nStreet have said: We are going to turn a blind eye. We are not going to \nget involved. We will not make a commitment.\n  There will come a time, and I hope soon, when there will be a \nreckoning--it didn't happen last week; it may happen soon--when the \nSenate stands up for a lot of people who need a voice in this Chamber, \nmany of whom can't afford a lobbyist in the hallway, many of whom are \njust struggling, hardworking families. Whether they are in Michigan, \nwhere Senator Levin represents the State, as does Senator Stabenow, or \nin the State of Illinois which I represent, these people need folks who \nwill stand up and fight for them. It won't be easy.\n  For those who are prepared to stand up and fight, also be prepared to \nlose. I\n\n[[Page S5177]]\n\nlost on my amendment last week. But I am not going to give up. The \ndefeat of the amendment on mortgage foreclosure is postponing the \ninevitable. The inevitable is that we are going to have to reckon with \nthe financial institutions in this country and the fact that they do \nnot have the national interest in their hearts when it comes to some of \nthese basic decisions that need to be made.\n  It is time for us to work with the will of the people of this country \nand to establish some order that gives working families and homeowners \nacross America a fighting chance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, before the Senator from Illinois leaves \nthe floor, I thank him. He has been a voice, indeed, for people who \ndon't have a voice. He has done that throughout his career both here \nand in the House. It is a pleasure listening to him.\n  I believe I asked unanimous consent to have my statement on S. 454 \nprinted in the Record immediately after our legislation is called up \nthis afternoon, and with the permission of Senator McCain, I ask \nunanimous consent to have his statement also printed in the Record at \nthat time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to talk about a bill \nthat I will be introducing called the Elimination of the Single Parent \nTax Act.\n  When I came to the Senate, I reflected often on some of the work I \ndid in the House. As a Congresswoman, I spent a lot of time in my \ncommunity doing ``Congress on York corner.'' I would go to a local book \nshop or a senior center or a grocery store and meet with folks and \nlisten to their concerns. I would try very hard to turn those concerns \ninto legislative ideas.\n  One of the last ones I did as a House Member was in Warren County. A \nwoman said to me:\n\n       Congresswoman, I received a bill from the Federal \n     Government and I need you to do something about it.\n\n  She was very visibly upset. She also said to me:\n\n       This is a bill for $25. I am a single mom and I earn about \n     $20,000 a year. I have 3 boys. The Federal Government is \n     billing me because I receive child support. I cannot handle \n     another bill, and while $25 may not seem like a lot to you, \n     it is to me, because $25 is what I spend for my boys for \n     lunch for a week. Please do something about this.\n\n  I looked into the issue, and I found out it was part of the Bush \nadministration's Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. It occurred to me, why \nin the world are we trying to balance the Federal budget on the backs \nof single parents, particularly those who need that money to provide \nfor their kids? On average, 30 percent of the income that single \nparents receive is from their child support. So it goes a long way to \nproviding basic needs for their kids, whether it is for diapers, baby \nformula, food, education, or health care. So I wrote this bill to \naddress this problem. I think it should not be paid by the single \nparents, or the States, and that, in fact, the overhead should be \ncovered.\n  This penalty raises only $65 million per year. That is a cost I think \nwe should include as we begin to look at the Deficit Reduction Act this \nyear.\n  Interestingly enough, in the Deficit Reduction Act, under the Bush \nadministration, they also cut more than $4 billion of incentive \npayments the Federal Government had made to States to help encourage \nthem to improve child support programs. This funding is crucial to how \nour single parents provide for their kids.\n\n  As we begin to look at Mother's Day, which is right around the corner \nand it is a time when we all reflect on how much our mothers have done \nfor us and how much we love them, I think we as Federal legislators \nshould do what we can do to protect our mothers and to stand up for \nthem and help them take care of their kids.\n  If we can pass this bill, it will make a difference for many families \nin New York State. There are more than 200,000 families who are \naffected by this tax. For example, over 13,000 single parents in \nwestern New York; over 14,000 single parents in Rochester and the \nFinger Lakes region; over 11,000 single parents in central New York; \nover 8,000 single parents in the southern tier; over 18,000 single \nparents in the capital region; over 7,000 single parents in the north \ncountry; and over 25,000 single parents in the Hudson Valley.\n  Right now there are 27 States across the country that are charging \nthis single parent penalty tax. This could make a difference all across \nour great Nation.\n  I am going to work very hard with the Finance Committee chairman to \nstrike this fee from the Deficit Reduction Act when it is reviewed by \nthe committee in the coming months.\n  As we reflect on Mother's Day, we have to do our part to make a \ndifference for our mothers. One other issue that is near and dear to my \nheart that will make a difference for our moms is the Paycheck Fairness \nAct. If we look at the statistics, it is pretty unbelievable. For every \ndollar a man earns, a woman earns only 78 cents. If you are a woman of \ncolor, it is even worse. If you are an African-American woman, you will \nearn 62 cents. If you are Latino, you will earn 53 cents. That is \nunacceptable and unfair because when women earn more money, they can \nbring more money home to their families and better provide for their \nkids. All the statistics show when women earn their fair share, \nchildren have better access to education, health care, and \nopportunities.\n  As we celebrate Mother's Day, let's do something for our mothers and \nfight for them so they can protect and provide for their children.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to honor the leaders, \nvisionaries, students, faculty, and the parents at West Prep in North \nLas Vegas, NV. At a time when disappointing and depressing news seems \nto fill our days, there is a light of promise beaming from a very \nunlikely place in my State.\n  Just a few short years ago, the writing was on the chalkboard for \nWest Middle School. The school was persistently dangerous and \nconsistently the lowest performing middle school in southern Nevada. \nMadam President, 100 percent of the students are from low-income \nhouseholds, and 92 percent of them are Hispanic or Black. These \nchildren had not just been left behind, their futures were sort of \nswept under the rug for someone else to deal with at another time.\n  Fortunately, there are educators who will never settle for that. \nAssociate superintendent Dr. Ed Goldman asked if he could take the \nschool over. He hired a young, brash, hungry principal named Dr. Mike \nBarton and made sure the school had empowerment-level funding. He also \ngave Dr. Barton tremendous reign over the school. That was in April \n2006.\n  Today, West Prep is a study in education innovation. They extended \nthe school day and provided a third semester as summer school. Forty \npercent of the children have voluntarily signed up for this summer \nschool. Now they have begun a transition to a full K-12 campus. There \nis afterschool tutoring. The students wear uniforms. There is a \nnewcomer track for students new to the United States. Science and math \nclasses are divided by gender. There is a law enforcement class that \ncollaborates with the FBI and a Men Mentoring Men program, both of \nwhich are keeping kids out of the dean's office. Students feel safe now \nwhen they go to this school. Most importantly, they are finally \nlearning.\n\n[[Page S5178]]\n\n  I had the opportunity to visit this school and observe the students \nthroughout the school. When an adult walks into the classrooms, all of \nthe children stand, say good morning, sit back down, and continue their \nlesson. They are taught to respect elders.\n  When I visited that school, I had the opportunity to observe a \nchemistry class. They were performing a chemistry experiment. I asked \none of the students--she was an African-American young lady who had \nattended the school before Dr. Barton took over: What is the biggest \ndifference between then and now? What was happening now, as opposed to \nbefore educators shook things up? She had a very simple reply. She \nsaid: Now I get to learn.\n  It seems like such a simple thing, to be able to learn, almost \nshocking that those kinds of words would come out of her mouth. But \nthese students had been robbed of that opportunity. We are the greatest \nNation on earth, and we have not figured out how to make it so all our \nkids can learn. Give a child an education--an education that teaches \nand inspires--and there is no limit to their potential. The test \nresults at West Prep are proof.\n  This school has seen phenomenal test score growth. Recently, we \nlearned how phenomenal that growth is. Three years ago, only 17 percent \nat what was then West Middle School could read or perform math at grade \nlevel. Only 17 percent. Today, 97 percent of juniors are proficient in \nreading, 73 percent are proficient in math, and 64 percent are \nproficient in science. About 80 percent of the juniors were enrolled at \nthe school 3 years ago when Dr. Barton took over. Isn't that amazing?\n  I am so proud of what Dr. Goldman and Dr. Barton have done, but I am \nespecially proud of the students, the teachers, and the parents at West \nPrep. Together they have turned the tide. Every day we see at West Prep \nwhat quality education can accomplish.\n  There is still work to do, but there is a can-do feeling that has \nspread throughout the community, and you feel it when you walk onto the \ncampus. See, Dr. Barton was given freedom to lead that school. He isn't \ntied down by bureaucracy. He spends most of his time in the school, \nwhen a lot of the other principals today go to school district \nmeetings, spend time on bureaucracy. The other thing is, he can fire \nteachers who are not performing. In fact, when he came onboard, he \nreplaced a majority of the teachers. Remember, he is recruiting \nteachers into one of, what most people would describe in southern \nNevada, the least desirable places to live or teach in southern Nevada. \nBut now he has a team in place that he knows will motivate his students \nand help them reach their potential. This formula is working.\n  In 2006, nobody imagined this school could ever reach the level of \nsuccess it has in such a short period of time. Instead, the school will \ngraduate its first senior class next year. It is raising the bar every \nday as it shakes up traditional education. Most importantly, the \nstudents of West Prep are learning and reaching their full potential.\n  Congratulations, West Prep. We are all so proud of you and what you \nhave accomplished.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/06/senate-section/article/S5178-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5178-S5179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXPRESSIONS OF APPRECIATION\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I am going to read a unanimous consent \nrequest in a moment, but before then, because I don't have any time at \nthe conclusion of the last vote before the vote on final passage, I \nwish to take a minute to thank the majority leader, Senator Reid, for \nmaking it possible for this bill to be before the Senate this week. I \nam grateful to him and his staff.\n  I thank my staff, who have done a terrific job: Jonathan Miller, \nprincipally, from my Banking Committee staff, as well as many others \nfrom the Banking Committee staff who worked very hard to bring this \nbill together and to create the opportunity for our colleagues to offer \nas many as 20 different amendments, most of them in direct relation to \nthe bill but others to add items which will strengthen the bill. I want \nto specifically thank Colin McGinnis, Beth Cooper, Dean Shahinian, \nJulie Chon, Brian Filipowich, Misha Mintz-Roth, Deborah Katz, Matt \nGreen, Amy Widestrom, Ella Humphry, and James Bair.\n  I thank Senator Shelby and his staff as well--Bill Duhnke, Mark \nOesterle, Andrew Olmem, Peggy Kuhn, Hester Pierce, and Jim Johnson. We \nworked very cooperatively. While there were some differences of opinion \non a couple matters involved with this legislation, overall we had \ngreat cooperation, as we have had over the past 2 years I have been \nchairman of the committee. I am grateful to him and his staff for the \ncooperation they have with my office.\n  We have a strong committee of some 23 members. Almost a quarter of \nthis body serves on the Banking Committee. They add great value to the \nprocess. I am grateful to them.\n  This is an important matter, not just for financial institutions but, \nmore importantly--I say that with some caution--to open up lines of \ncredit. We need to have an increase in deposit insurance. We need to \nhave an increase in the borrowing authority. Sheila Bair, for whom most \nof us have great respect, is Chairperson of the Federal Department \nInsurance Corporation and is doing a wonderful job. This bill includes \nthat.\n  We have provisions in here to provide a safe harbor for servicers--a \nkey component of the legislation designed to get servicers to pursue \nloan modifications more aggressively. I thank Senator Martinez of \nFlorida for his contribution to this provision.\n  I see Senator Ensign in the Chamber, who, working with Senator Boxer, \nadded value to this bill as well, making it possible for homeowners to \ndetermine who actually holds their mortgages.\n  Senator Grassley added contributions, as well, to accountability and \ntransparency. Senator Reed of Rhode Island has done a great deal in \nproviding greater flexibility in terms of warrants, which I think is \ngoing to strengthen the bill as well. Senator Reed also contributed \ngroundbreaking legislation to fight homelessness along with Senator \nBond.\n  Invariably, when I start doing this without a note in front of me, I \nam going to forget some Member and their contribution to the bill. So I \nwill reserve the ability to amend these remarks to make sure I include \nothers who have contributed to this legislation.\n  But this bill includes the kinds of steps we need to be taking in \norder to get our economy moving, to increase that confidence and \noptimism so critical to economic recovery.\n  Madam President, 10,000 foreclosures a day is unacceptable. This bill \nwill now provide the opportunity for us to be able to reduce that \nnumber. Some estimates are that as many as 1.7 million to 2 million \nhomeowners could be positively affected by what we are doing today with \nthis legislation. That is no small number when you consider the total \nnumbers that could be adversely affected. Our hope is that will do just \nthat, to make that kind of a difference, in addition to the other \nmatters I have already mentioned that were added by amendment or \nincluded in the underlying bill. So while this is not going to change \neverything, it is not going to solve every problem, it is a major step \nin the right direction in terms of this economic recovery we are all \ninterested in.\n  There is not a Member in this Chamber--regardless of the differences \nwe may have on how to get there--who does not want to do everything in \ntheir power to see to it that our country once again has that sense of \nconfidence that has been the hallmark of America for more than two \ncenturies. Certainly, we are going through a difficult time. \nIndividually, people understand it; they know it. We have an \nadministration under President Obama that is working hard to do \neverything possible to see to it that we move in the right direction.\n  So I am grateful to my colleagues who have shown a lot of patience \nover the last several days to get to this point. I thank them for that. \nSenator Kerry, Senator Casey, Senator Feingold--I mentioned Senator \nEnsign--\n\n[[Page S5179]]\n\nSenator Snowe, Senator Bond, and Senator Pryor have all either been \nsponsors or cosponsors of major amendments on this bill, and I express \nmy gratitude to all of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/06/senate-section/article/S5179-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Madam President, what is the pending business before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending bill is S. 896.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 1031, as modified, offered by the Senator from New York, \nMr. Schumer.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, before we get to that, I would like to \nreport to Members that we are inching closer to completing action on \nthis legislation. Four amendments remain in order, and votes with \nrespect to these amendments will occur shortly. Those that remain are \nSchumer amendment No. 1031, as modified; Coburn second-degree amendment \nNo. 1042; Reed of Rhode Island amendment No. 1040, as amended, if \namended; and Grassley amendment No. 1021, as modified. Once we have \ndisposed of these four amendments, then the only matter remaining is \nadoption of the substitute, as amended, and, finally, passage of S. \n896. Since there is no time in between, I have given my closing remarks \non the value of the legislation.\n  With that, I guess we turn to Senator Schumer.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1031, as Modified\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I wish to salute, praise the \nchairman of our Banking Committee, Chairman Dodd, for doing a great job \non this bill. I thank him for the good work he has done, and so many \nothers who have worked long and hard on this legislation; Senator \nShelby as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be modified \nwith the changes at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we are asking for a simple change that in \nno way affects the amendment, in no way affects whether it is going to \ncost anything. The purpose of the underlying amendment is to ensure \nthat tenants of multifamily housing across the country benefit from the \nsame attention and support of this Government as single-family \nhomeowners will.\n  We have literally millions of tenants--millions--who, because the \nhomes which they rent are foreclosed, are in very bad shape. They can \nbe removed from their homes. Their homes can deteriorate. Once a home \nis in foreclosure, often it is not kept up. This is not just in big \ncities such as New York but around the country. In fact, States such as \nTennessee and so many others are on the list which I listed of 15 \nStates that are most affected because it affects not only big multiple \ndwellings but garden apartments and other residential units. It is \nunfortunate that the objection is going to stand in the way of helping \nthese tenants.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 1031, as Modified, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, I wish to commend my colleague from New York. I say this \nthrough the Chair. We will come back to this issue. I understand an \nobjection has been voiced, but I want to thank our colleague from New \nYork. He raises a very important issue and one that needs to be \naddressed. I commend him for it. There will be other opportunities, I \nhope, shortly to come back to this issue.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I appreciate that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1042\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I believe the next item is the amendment \noffered by our colleague, Senator Coburn, from Oklahoma.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have a second-degree amendment to the \nReed amendment. What it says is we create a pilot study. We have 69,000 \npieces of property we cannot get rid of. It represents $83 billion in \nassets to us as a government and to the American people. It is $83 \nbillion we would not have.\n  What we set up is a pilot program that manages 150 pieces of property \na year to dispose of them. It gives 20 percent to the agency, 80 \npercent back to the Government. It creates a way, in a pilot project, \nfor us to do real property reform.\n  We have gone through and we have created 250 homeless shelters out of \n30,000 properties at a cost of $300 million. We are spending over $8 \nbillion a year just maintaining properties we do not want, do not need, \nyet we cannot get rid of.\n  This is a simple, straightforward amendment that is common sense. \nThere is no reason why we should not accept this amendment.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Jack Reed of Rhode \nIsland, in a moment I will make a point of order. But Senator Coburn \nand I, last night, had a short colloquy. He raises a very legitimate \npoint on a larger issue, and he talked about it last evening at some \nlength. I expressed to him then--and I am very sincere about it--that I \nwould like to work with him. We have a lot of properties out there for \nwhich it takes too much money to care for them each year. A lot of them \nprobably ought to be destroyed, as the Senator has pointed out. So I \nwant him to know that the point of order being raised here should not \nreflect the underlying issue he has raised, and I am committed to work \nwith him on that. I think it is a very good idea and one we ought to be \naggressive about.\n  But having said that, Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Jack Reed, \nI raise a point of order that the pending amendment violates section \n201 of S. Con. Res. 21, the concurrent resolution on the budget for \nfiscal year 2008.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I move to waive the budget point of order, \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, what is the pending business before the \nSenate?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment of the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  Mr. DODD. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. No.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this is a bipartisan effort to reform our \nhomeless programs. This amendment would simplify the application \nprocess, give greater flexibility and accountability at the local \nlevel. It would also provide additional resources to prevent \nhomelessness. We are in the midst of a huge crisis in terms of people \nwho literally cannot find housing. We have pictures in newspapers of \ntent cities sprouting up all across the country. We need to act.\n  This amendment is bipartisan and is supported by Senator Bond and, \nbefore him, Senator Allard, and Senators Boxer, Collins, Durbin, Kerry, \nLautenberg, Lieberman, Schumer, and Whitehouse. It is good, sensible \nreform legislation that will make our programs more effective and, \nhopefully, prevent people from losing their homes and keep them away \nfrom these tent cities that are sprouting up. I urge its passage.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I strongly endorse this amendment. The \nSenator deserves a lot of credit, along with Senator Bond.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1040\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong support of the \nReed-Bond amendment No. 1040. This amendment provides critical and \ncost-effective tools to reform federal programs that address \nhomelessness. It is identical to S. 808, the Homeless Emergency \nAssistance and Rapid Transition to Housing Act or HEARTH Act, which I \nwas very proud to cosponsor. The HEARTH Act is a bipartisan bill that \nbuilds on and expands programs that have been demonstrated to end and \nprevent the tragedy of homelessness that afflicts many American \nindividuals and families.\n  Before I offer some comments on the amendment, I praise Senator Jack \nReed for his long-term commitment and hard work on addressing \nhomelessness. Senator Reed has been a long-time leader in housing \nissues and I value the strong partnership we have had over the past \nseveral years. I also recognize the work of our former colleague, \nSenator Wayne Allard, who also was heavily involved in this legislation \nbefore he retired from this Chamber.\n  Over 20 years ago, the Federal Government took its first major step \nin addressing the plight of homelessness through the enactment of the \nStewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act. But despite billions of \nprivate and public dollars spent on the homeless, millions of veterans, \nfamilies, disabled, and children have and continue to experience the \nsad tragedy of homelessness.\n  Fortunately, through innovative efforts that focused on permanent \nsupportive housing, we have learned that being homeless is no longer a \nhopeless situation. As the former chair and current ranking member of \nthe Senate Appropriations subcommittee that funds most of the Federal \nhomeless programs through the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, I have worked with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle--especially Senators Barbara Mikulski and Patty Murray--to ensure \nresources were being provided to the appropriate programs. Through this \nbipartisan partnership, we have protected affordable housing units, \nboosted resources to help homeless veterans through the HUD-VASH \nprogram, and revitalized distressed public housing through the HOPE VI \nprogram.\n  In terms of HUD's homeless assistance grant programs, I can \nconfidently say that these funds have been well-spent as demonstrated \nby the dramatic drop in homelessness. HUD's national data found that \nbetween 2005 and 2007 the number of homeless people experiencing \nchronic homelessness--our most vulnerable and disabled neighbors--\ndropped from nearly 176,000 to fewer than 124,000, a decrease of 52,000 \nor 30 percent. This is clear evidence that through this tried-and-true \napproach of permanent supportive housing, we can stop the cycle of \nhomelessness.\n  Under the ``housing first'' approach, we learned that providing \npermanent supportive housing was the key component in solving \nhomelessness, especially those considered to be chronically homeless. \nBefore we implemented the housing first approach, many homeless people \nwere served through the revolving door of local emergency systems, \nwhich interfered with their treatment regimen and resulted in costly \nhospital and jail stays.\n  Local emergency systems became clogged with permanent users, reducing \ntheir ability to address the more temporary problems of families and \nindividuals. Putting a greater emphasis and resources on permanent \nsupportive housing has become the most critical change over the past \nseveral years. Based on recent studies and results I have seen in my \nhome State of Missouri, it has worked.\n  To implement this approach, I worked with Senator Mikulski to include \na provision, beginning in the fiscal year 1999 VA-HUD Appropriations \nAct and carried every year thereafter, to require that at least 30 \npercent of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's--HUD--\nhomeless assistance grants be used for permanent housing. Focusing a \nsignificant amount of funds towards permanent housing helped reverse \nthe revolving door for the homeless using local emergency systems.\n  We also learned the importance of gathering data and analyzing the \ncharacteristics of our homeless population to design and target funds \nto programs needed to serve the homeless. That is why we established \nthe homeless management information systems or HMIS through \nappropriations. This not only ensures that local providers have the \ninformation to address their particular homeless populations; it \nensures that taxpayer funds are being spent effectively and \nefficiently.\n  Finally, we learned that despite the involvement of several Federal \nagencies in serving the homeless, there were gaps in services and \ncoordination was lacking. To address this issue, the U.S. Interagency \nCouncil on Homelessness was reactivated to improve Federal, State, and \nlocal coordination of homeless programs.\n  The HEARTH Act codifies these important provisions that have been \ncarried in appropriations and builds on our work over the past several \nyears. It also includes a number of other important provisions that \nassist rural communities help the homeless, increase local flexibility \nby combining HUD's competitive grant programs, and provide incentives \nto house rapidly homeless families.\n  Homelessness is a national walking around Washington, DC, St. Louis, \nand other towns and cities across the Nation. But by working together \nwith advocates, the private sector, and government, we can solve \nhomelessness. The HEARTH Act is a prime example of that partnership and \ngreatly advances our ability to end homelessness.\n  Updating and improving our homeless programs is even more critical as \nmore Americans face the prospects of homelessness due to the economic \ndownturn. The housing crisis has already displaced many families and \nindividuals creating more strain on our social safety net and homeless \nprograms.\n  Before closing, I offer some concerns about the Federal Housing \nAdministration, FHA. As I have repeatedly stated, the FHA is a powder \nkeg that may explode, leaving taxpayers on the hook if Congress and the \nadministration continue to overburden the government agency.\n\n[[Page S5181]]\n\n  That is why I have strong reservations about provisions in the \nHelping Families Save Their Homes Act that loosen the eligibility \nrequirements for the FHA Hope for Homeowners program.\n  FHA is already showing signs of stress as defaults and foreclosures \nhave been increasing endangering homeowners and communities across the \nNation. I also am alarmed by the increasing signs of fraud, which is \nreportedly rising and at levels comparable or higher than during the \nsubprime boom.\n  With an agency that is understaffed and challenged by long-standing \nmanagement and oversight problems, the combination of these factors \nalong with a struggling housing market and economy is a recipe for \ndisaster.\n  It is critical that the Congress and the administration recognize \nthese problems and not make HUD Secretary Donovan's job harder by \nplacing more risk on FHA until the problems are fixed or the agency \nwill crash and taxpayers will be footing another multibillion-dollar \nbailout. While I understand the importance of FHA in many markets where \nlending is tight, an overburdened FHA does not benefit borrowers, \nneighbors, and communities if FHA continues to be provide poorly \nunderwritten loans or loans serviced by bad actors.\n  I urge my colleagues, especially Banking Committee Chairman Dodd and \nRanking Member Shelby, to conduct vigorous oversight of FHA and take \nadditional legislative actions to address the agency's weaknesses.\n  Let me say that again--because this is important--if we continue to \noverburden FHA this powder keg will explode!\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I urge that we move to the vote and yield \nback the time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask for a voice vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1040) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1021, as modified\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the pending matter is the Grassley \namendment, is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Who yields time on the Grassley amendment?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Grassley, the Senator \nfrom Iowa, has offered a very good amendment. I strongly support the \nGrassley amendment. It increases accountability of transparency at the \nFederal Reserve. Let me defer to my colleague to explain the amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Before we do that, if the Senator is for it, can we \nadopt it on a voice vote?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will use my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, then let me speak off the cuff. What we \nhave here is following on the President's promise for more transparency \nin Government--a promise to put everything dealing with bailouts on the \nInternet. There is more money involved with Federal Reserve and \nbailouts and stabilizing the economy than even in what we appropriate. \nSo this is to bring transparency to what the Federal Reserve is doing, \nwithout affecting monetary policy whatsoever.\n  I ask us to agree to this amendment to bring transparency because the \npublic's business ought to be public, including taxpayers' money spent \nby the Federal Reserve.\n  In March, the Finance Committee held a hearing on the progress and \noversight of the Troubled Assets Relief Program, TARP. At that hearing \nthe Government Accountability Office--GAO--testified that it is not \njust firms that take taxpayer money under TARP who can say ``no'' to \nGAO's requests for information, prior to my other amendment on this \nbill. The Federal Reserve can also refuse to cooperate.\n  The GAO's ability to audit the Federal Reserve is restricted by law. \nPerhaps those restrictions could be defended back when the Federal \nReserve focused only on monetary policy. However, today it is routinely \nexercising extraordinary emergency powers to subsidize financial firms \nfar above the levels Congress is willing to authorize through \nlegislation. The Federal Reserve is taking on more and more risk in \ncomplicated and unprecedented ways. That risk is ultimately borne by \nthe American taxpayer.\n  Congress authorized $700 billion in funds under TARP. However, the \ntotal projected assistance in various initiatives by the Federal \nReserve could be up to $3.4 trillion by GAO estimates.\n  This modified version of the amendment does not give GAO authority to \nlook at all of that additional taxpayer risk. It is much narrower than \nthe one I originally filed, but it is a reasonable step in the right \ndirection, and it does not threaten monetary policy independence.\n  Although I would have preferred to include all of the Fed's emergency \nactions under 13(3), in consultation with Senator Shelby I agreed to \nlimit my amendment to actions aimed at specific companies. I will ask \nto submit for the Record a list of those actions currently covered by \nthe new language, according to Federal Reserve staff. Future actions of \nthe same sort would also be subject to GAO audit.\n  The goal of this amendment is extend GAO authority to cover the \nFederal Reserve's emergency actions that are most similar to the TARP--\nin other words actions aimed at specific companies like Bear Stearns \nand AIG.\n  I appreciate the support of Senators Shelby and Dorgan who are \ncosponsoring this amendment. I urge my colleagues to support amendment \nNo. 1021. Let's not give GAO an important mission to do with a \nblindfold on. Let's take off the blindfold get a good hard look at what \nthe Federal Reserve is doing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the actions currently covered by the new \nlanguage to which I referred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       According to Federal Reserve staff, the following is a list \n     of 13(3) emergency actions covered by the ``single and \n     specific'' language of amendment No. 1021 to S. 896:\n       Actions related to Bear Stearns and its acquisition by JP \n     Morgan Chase, including:\n       a. Loan To Facilitate the Acquisition of The Bear Stearns \n     Companies, Inc. by JPMorgan Chase & Co. (Maiden Lane I)\n       b. Bridge Loan to The Bear Stearns Companies Inc. Through \n     JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\n       2. Bank of America--Authorization to Provide Residual \n     Financing to Bank of America Corporation Relating to a \n     Designated Asset Pool (taken in conjunction with FDIC and \n     Treasury)\n       3. Citigroup--Authorization to Provide Residual Financing \n     to Citigroup, Inc., for a Designated Asset Pool (taken in \n     conjunction with FDIC and Treasury)\n       4. Various actions to stabilize American International \n     Group (AIG), including a revolving line of credit provided by \n     the Federal Reserve as well as several credit facilities \n     (listed below). AIG has also received equity from Treasury, \n     through the TARP, which would also be captured in amendment \n     #1020.\n       a. Secured Credit Facility Authorized for American \n     International Group, Inc., on September 16, 2008\n       b. Restructuring of the Government's Financial Support to \n     American International Group, Inc., on November 10, 2008 \n     (Maiden Lane II and Maiden Lane III)\n       c. Restructuring of the Government's Financial Support to \n     American International Group, Inc., on March 2, 2009\n       5. TALF--finally, amendment No. 1020 would expand GAO's \n     authority to oversee the TARP, including the joint Federal \n     Reserve-Treasury Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility \n     (TALF)\n       *Neither* amendment No. 1021 nor No. 1020 would include \n     short-term liquidity facilities:\n       1. Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund \n     Liquidity Facility\n       2. (AMLF)\n       3. Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF)\n\n[[Page S5182]]\n\n       4.

I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nsubstitute amendment is agreed to and the motion to reconsider is \nconsidered made and laid upon the table.\n  The amendment (No. 1018), as amended, was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Predatory Lending\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Dodd for \nhis efforts to provide solutions to our neighborhoods and middle-class \nfamilies to address the subprime and foreclosure crisis.\n  As the Nation struggles to deal with the fallout from subprime \nlending and the credit crunch, it is critical that families have access \nto safe, fair and affordable mortgages. Borrower protections, like \nthose we have in Minnesota, should be national policy to help safeguard \nfamilies across the country.\n  A decade ago, just 5 percent of mortgage loan originations were \nsubprime--meaning that they were made to borrowers who would not \nqualify for regular mortgages. By 2005, 20 percent of new mortgages \nwere subprime. This may have expanded access to home ownership, at \nleast temporarily, for some people; but it also greatly increased the \nrisk our system. In Minnesota, in 2000, there were 8,347 subprime \nmortgages issued. By 2005, it had increased more than fivefold to more \nthan 47,000 subprime mortgages.\n  However, we now know that between 60 percent-65 percent of people who \nended up with subprime mortgages actually qualified for traditional \nmortgages. We need to make sure this doesn't happen again.\n  That is why I have introduced the Homeowner Fairness Act, which is \ncomprehensive housing reform legislation that proposes tough new \nnational standards based on the successes of the Minnesota mortgage \nlending law passed in 2007.\n  The bill would put in place a number of key reforms. It would require \nall mortgage originators to verify a borrower's ability to repay a \nmortgage before giving loan approval. In addition, the bill would \nrequire mortgage brokers to have a minimum net worth of $500,000 while \nalso subjecting them to fiduciary duties obligating them to act in the \nbest interest of their clients. It further bans prepayment penalties \nand limits up-front fees to no more than 5 percent of the initial \nprincipal of the loan. Importantly, the bill prohibits ``steering,'' \nwhich is the act of approving a loan at a higher rate than that for \nwhich a borrower qualifies.\n  We need to make sure that abusive and exploitative mortgage practices \ncome to an end. For far too long, subprime lenders have put the homes \nand home equity of Americans at unnecessary risk. These commons sense \nprotections, modeled after Minnesota law, are essential to restoring \nour economy and preventing a future crisis in the housing market.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Minnesota for raising this very \nimportant issue. I point out that home ownership rates for African \nAmericans, who were disproportionately steered into subprime loans, \nhave actually dropped to levels below where they were prior to the \nexplosion of subprime lending. While I agree that subprime lending can \nbe helpful to borrowers with some credit problems, this lending must be \nproperly regulated, as it so clearly has not been over the past decade.\n  I appreciate the work Senator Klobuchar has done on this issue. Her \nbill is based on the Minnesota law, which I understand is one of the \nmore progressive laws in the Nation. I look forward to working with her \non this issue as we move forward.\n\n\n                     Foreclosure Scam notification\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with my \ncolleague from Connecticut and the chairman of the Banking Committee, \nSenator Dodd. As the chairman is aware, I have offered an amendment to \nS. 896, the helping families save their homes, which would require \nmortgage servicing companies to issue warnings to homeowners about \nforeclosure rescue scams. Foreclosure rescue scams have become more \nprevalent as more and more homeowners lose their homes. These financial \npredators claim to help desperate homeowners and often, walk away with \ntheir home and money.\n  The issuing of a simple disclosure from a mortgage servicing company \nwould make it easier for people to identify the difference between scam \nartists and legitimate help. The disclosure requirement would provide \nthe homeowner with a HUD hotline identifying the counseling agencies in \ntheir area and would give them a phone number in order to contact their \nlender. A simple disclosure will provide homeowners with relevant \ncontact information so they can better understand their options and \navoid scam artists. I hope that I can work with the chairman on this \nimportant issue as the Banking Committee moves forward with future \nlegislation on financial reform.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator for raising this important issue. I \nwill work with him to address this issue in future legislation so we \ncan help homeowners avoid foreclosure rescue scams and make sure they \nget the necessary information to find real help.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the chairman of the Banking Committee for all his \nhelp and engaging in this colloquy.\n\n\n                       DEFINITION OF HOMELESSNESS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague Senator Reed for his \nhard work on this bill. Unfortunately, our homeless shelters and our \nschools are seeing an increasing number of families and children \nexperiencing homelessness and seeking services. This bill comes at an \nimportant time. And I am particularly pleased with the emphasis placed \non prevention and rapid rehousing, and efforts to better serve homeless \nindividuals, such as victims of domestic violence.\n  Mr. President, I would like to inquire of my colleagues Senator Reed \nand\n\n[[Page S5183]]\n\nChairman Dodd regarding the definition of homelessness in HEARTH Act \nand amendment No. 1040.\n  Mr. REED. Certainly, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator. As you know, this amendment \ncontains a new definition of homelessness. Homelessness is an issue I \nhave long been concerned about both the immediate consequences of not \nhaving housing, as well as the adverse effects it can have on the \nbroader success of children and families. For example, children that \nexperience homelessness are more likely to fall behind in school and to \nexperience social and emotional difficulties that hinder their academic \nand workplace success. Therefore, the Federal Government not only helps \nprovide housing services for youth and families, but also education \nservices through the McKinney-Vento Education for Homeless Children and \nYouths program at the Department of Education.\n  I appreciate the efforts to broaden the definition of homelessness in \nthe HEARTH Act. It is an important step forward. However, I want to \nensure that this new definition of homelessness does not inadvertently \ncause a lapse in services or cause confusion with the definition of \nhomelessness included in the McKinney Vento Education of Homeless \nChildren and Youth program.\n  Is it the Senators' intent that the definition of homelessness in the \nHEARTH Act, which covers homeless youth as well as families, should \never replace or change the definition of homelessness under the \nMcKinney-Vento Education for Homeless Children and Youths program at \nthe U.S. Department of Education?\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator for her important question. The \ndefinition of homelessness in the HEARTH Act in no way seeks to replace \nor change the definition of homelessness in any other statute. The \ndefinition of homelessness in the Education for Homeless Children and \nYouths program is critical to ensuring that homeless students have \naccess to supports and services for their success in school. The \ndefinition of homelessness in the HEARTH Act does not and should not \nchange or replace that education definition.\n  Mr. DODD. I would concur with my colleague, Mr. Reed. The definition \nof homelessness in the HEARTH Act is to apply to matters of housing \nunder the Department of Housing and Urban Development. In fact, the \namendment expressly states that the HUD homelessness definition is in \nno way meant to replace or change the definition of homelessness under \nthe McKinney-Vento Education for Homeless Children and Youths program.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senators. I have also worked hard on helping \nto encourage collaboration between the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment and the Department of Education to ensure the best services \npossible for homeless youth. Is it the Senators' intent that the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development should do everything in its \npower to coordinate with the Department of Education on serving \nhomeless youth, and to ensure that no lapse in services under the \nEducation of Homeless Children and Youths program occurs for students \nas any new HEARTH Act definition of homelessness is implemented?\n  Mr. REED. Yes, that is my intent, and it is the intent of the \namendment. We continue to work on, particularly with your leadership, \nencouraging strong communication and coordination between the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of \nEducation on the issue of serving homeless youth. It is my intent to \ncontinue to encourage that collaboration and to work to the utmost \ndegree, not just to prevent lapses, but to strengthen education \nservices for homeless students while implementing the HEARTH Act.\n  Mr. DODD. It is also our intent that the Interagency Council on \nHomelessness provide increased leadership, coordination, and \ninformation on this growing issue of children, youth, and families \nthreatened with homelessness. The amendment requires the Interagency \nCouncil to develop a government-wide plan to end homelessness, promote \nState planning efforts, and of course promote interagency cooperation. \nWe will continue to work with the Council to ensure that the needs of \nfamilies, children, and youth figure prominently in their efforts.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. This amendment will broaden HUD's definition of \nhomelessness to include a subset of children and youth who meet the \ndefinition of homelessness used by other federal statutes. I appreciate \nthe inclusion of these children and believe it is a step in the right \ndirection. In particular, it covers those children and youth who: (1) \nhave experienced a long-term period without living stably or \nindependently in permanent housing; (2) have experienced persistent \ninstability; and (3) who are likely to continue to do so because of \ndisability or other barriers.\n  Since these concepts, such as the term ``long term period,'' are open \nto interpretation, is it the Senators' intent that HUD should consider \nthe needs of children and the effects of instability on their \ndevelopmental and academic progress when developing the regulations for \nthis provision?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes, the committee recognizes that the expansion of the \ndefinition of homelessness to include these children and families was \ncarried out with the intent of addressing the housing needs and \nchallenges of children and youth who are homeless.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, by including language that acknowledges \nthe various definitions of homeless in other Federal statutes, is it \nthe Senators' intention that HUD funded homeless providers should be \nencouraged to engage with homeless providers receiving funds from other \nFederal agencies to utilize their assessments and counsel in making \neligibility determinations.\n  Mr. DODD. Yes. Federal programs must work together to meet the needs \nof families and unaccompanied youth, and that collaboration should \ninclude information needed for eligibility decisions.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I look forward to working with my colleagues and the \ncommittee on improving services for students. Lastly, I understand that \nthis amendment prohibits the Secretary from requiring that communities \nconduct actual counts of families and youth who are newly added to the \nHUD definition in HUD-mandated homelessness counts. Am I correct that \nthis provision does not prohibit the Secretary from requiring \ncommunities to provide estimates of those who are newly added to the \ndefinition, so that communities may have a better sense of the shelter \nand housing needs of all families, children, and youth who will be \nconsidered homeless by HUD under this legislation?\n  Mr. REED. Yes, that is the case. We are open to finding ways to \nquantify the number of individuals and families experiencing housing \ninstability and look forward to working with the Senator and the \nadministration to do so.\n  I thank the Senator for her questions, and I look forward to working \ntogether on improving the prevention of homelessness and the provision \nof services to homeless individuals and families in order to break the \ncycle of homelessness.\n  Mr. DODD. I also thank the Senator for her questions, and I would be \nhappy to continue working on to address the issue of homelessness with \nher.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senators, and I look forward to continuing \nto work on these issues.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I received recently a letter from Linda \nFrazier, a single mom who lives in Las Vegas with her three teen-aged \nchildren and at times has had to work two jobs that paid hourly wages.\n  Linda told me how in recent years, both her income and the value of \nher house have plummeted. She now fears hers will become the latest \nNevada family swallowed up by this devastating housing crisis.\n  Her story is distressing. It is unacceptable that a hardworking \nAmerican like Linda wakes up worried every morning about whether she \ncan put a roof over her children's heads. But what struck me most is \nthat she wrote to me: ``I'm about to lose my house, which is the way it \nis.''\n  It doesn't have to be the way it is. In a Nation this great and this \nstrong, a family shouldn't have to lose its home when it plays by the \nrules. And that family certainly shouldn't surrender to thinking that \nhaving the American dream vanish is simply ``the way it is.''\n  But stories like hers happen every day, in every State. The victims \nof foreclosure include families who did everything right--they put \nmoney down\n\n[[Page S5184]]\n\non their new home and took out a responsible mortgage, not one of those \ninterest-only gimmicks.\n  Nevadans like Linda Frazier have endured an appalling number of \nforeclosures over the past few years. Just last month, about 20,000 \nNevada families received a foreclosure notice. Last year, not a single \nstate had a worse foreclosure rate than Nevada's--this crisis hit one \nin 14 households.\n  One of the most underappreciated side effects of this crisis is that \nthe victims of foreclosure aren't just those who live in the \nforeclosed-upon house.\n  Vacant homes drive crime up and property values down. Just try \nputting up a sign that says ``for sale'' next to one that says \n``foreclosed.'' The average price of a home in Las Vegas went down more \nthan 31 percent between last February and this February, and more than \n40 percent since prices peaked in 2006.\n  Last fall I walked with Mayor Oscar Goodman of Las Vegas through the \nhardest-hit neighborhood in the hardest-hit city in the hardest-hit \nstate in the country. A resident there came up to us and told us that \nthe value of her home dropped more than $100,000. She will never get \nback what she paid for it.\n  Unfortunately, her situation is now the rule, not the exception. The \nnumbers are shocking: Two out of every three homeowners in Las Vegas \nowe more on their home than it's worth. The same is true for more than \nhalf of homeowners in Nevada, and for one in five across the country.\n  American homeowners are underwater, and it is our job to help them to \ndry land.\n  Last year, after a long struggle, we passed legislation that will \nhelp those at risk of losing their homes and prevent foreclosures from \nhappening. We reformed the mortgage-finance industry and helped \nhomeowners get mortgage counseling. We had to file cloture on 7 \nfilibusters. I wish we could have done more.\n  Democrats insisted that last fall's rescue legislation gave the \nadministration the authority to design other ways to help families, \nwhich led to the Obama Administration's Making Home Affordable program. \nThat program continues to be improved, and I am hopeful that many \nNevadans will take advantage of it.\n  Last week, we passed a bill to prevent and prosecute scam artists \nfrom preying on homeowners desperate for help. The Nevada Bureau of \nConsumer Protection receives nearly 100 complaints each month from \nconsumers complaining of possible mortgage scams. The number of fraud \ncases reported nationwide has almost quadrupled in the past seven \nyears: in 2001 there were 18,000; last year there were 65,000. In the \nHispanic community, the number of fraud victims has been \ndisproportionately high.\n  We will continue to do more to protect the victims of these scams and \nall struggling homeowners.\n  I want to thank Chairman Dodd for his tireless work in leading the \nSenate's response to the housing crisis. He shepherded major \nlegislation through the Congress last year, and has done so again with \nthe important bill we are about to pass.\n  So far, very few have participated in the Hope for Homeowners \nprogram, but thanks to Chairman Dodd's leadership, this bill improves \nit by lowering fees for home owners and lenders alike. It also gives \nlenders greater incentives to encourage their participation. More home \nowners whose mortgages are underwater could be placed in FHA-guaranteed \nmortgages.\n  This bill also gives the Department of Housing and Urban Development \nthe resources it needs to help vulnerable and at-risk home owners. I am \ngrateful to Chairman Dodd for incorporating into the underlying bill an \namendment I authored that will stop mortgage scams.\n  I wish more Senators would have followed Senator Durbin's \nextraordinary lead and stood up to the banking industry so that we \ncould have done more to help homeowners get relief through bankruptcy. \nIt is simply unfair that struggling homeowners cannot access a \nbankruptcy court to climb out of a housing crisis like this, but owners \nof vacation properties can.\n  Just as our Nation's housing crisis is the root of our nation's \neconomic crisis, these problems in Nevada have inflamed economic \nchallenges in the State.\n  It is important that we be realistic. Neither these proposals nor any \nother piece of legislation will solve all of our problems. Forces \noutside the control of any legislature--whether State or Federal--will \nalways combine to affect housing supply, prices and foreclosures.\n  Given the size and scope of the struggles too many Nevadans and \nAmericans endure, it will take more time before housing normalizes \nagain. But with this bill, we are working to hasten that day so that no \nfamily will ever accept losing its home as ``the way it is.''\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the Helping Families Save Their \nHomes Act of 2009.\n  The foreclosure situation in my State of Michigan continues to be \ndire. According to data released by real estate firm RealtyTrac, even \nthough there are less foreclosure filings than this time last year, \nthere were still over 11,000 Michigan foreclosure filings in January \n2009 alone. That is 1 foreclosure filing for every 397 households in \njust 1 month, which puts Michigan's foreclosure rate at the seventh \nhighest in the Nation. Nationwide, foreclosure filings are up 18 \npercent compared to this time last year.\n  Unfortunately, homeowners facing foreclosure are not the only ones \nbeing impacted by this crisis. Property values have dropped \nsignificantly in many areas, due in large part to the increased number \nof abandoned and foreclosed homes. These losses in property values also \ndecrease State and local revenue from property taxes, creating \nshortfalls in revenues and reducing funding for important State and \nlocal programs and services.\n  Over the past year, Congress has taken a number of steps to help \nreduce the effects of this crisis. Today, the Senate is set to pass \nlegislation that will further expand the tools available to homeowners \nfacing foreclosure and increase access to these important programs. \nThis legislation will expand access to the hope for homeowners program \nby providing incentives for servicers and lenders who participate in \nthe program and streamlining borrower certification requirements. It \nwill also expand the ability of FHA and Rural Housing to modify loans \nin order to help a homeowner avoid foreclosure and authorize additional \nfunding for foreclosure prevention activities, including housing \ncounseling and additional fair housing field workers.\n  Importantly, this act also creates additional enforcement tools to \nensure the Department of Housing and Urban Development--HUD--is able to \ngo after bad lenders who break the rules or misuse these programs.\n  In addition to these improvements, the act makes a number of changes \nto ensure the safety of depositors' savings, and improve the health of \nthe banks and credit unions that are essential to our economic \nrecovery.\n  Last year, we increased deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 to \n$250,000. That provision is set to expire at the end of this year. This \nact will extend the additional coverage for another 4 years. The act \nwill also increase the borrowing authority of the FDIC to $100 billion \nand of the National Credit Union Administration to $6 billion. \nCollectively, these changes will help ensure the security of deposits \nfor years to come.\n  The act also helps banks and credit unions that may be struggling to \npay special assessments for their deposit insurance coverage. Due to \nthe economic downturn, the insurance funds for these institutions are \nseeking additional funding through special assessments. And for many of \nthese institutions, these assessments are at the absolute worst time--\nwhile they are trying to stabilize their capital positions. The act \nresponsibly spreads out the period over which the insurance funds may \nseek these assessments, thereby giving the banks and credit unions the \nability to preserve and more effectively use their precious capital. \nLastly, the act creates a temporary corporate credit union \nstabilization fund to help ensure the stability and security of those \nwho rely upon corporate credit unions.\n  This bill includes many improvements to current programs that will \nhelp the country dig out of this foreclosure crisis. To do so will \nrequire the efforts of Federal, State, and local governments, as well \nas community and neighborhood organizations, lenders,\n\n[[Page S5185]]\n\nbrokers, and borrowers. This act will bring much-needed help to many of \nour homeowners who are trying desperately to save their homes as well \nas ensure that their savings are protected, and it deserves my support.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I commend Senators Reed and Bond for \nbringing up the HEARTH Act in the form of their amendment, and for all \nthe commitment they have shown to addressing homelessness in our \nNation. While this amendment seeks to protect the homeless by expanding \nthe definition of homelessness used by the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development, HUD, to a certain degree, it also places many \nunfortunate limitations on people living in several circumstances \ncommon to those who find themselves or their families temporarily \nwithout permanent lodging.\n  For instance, the definition proposed by my colleagues, Senators Reed \nand Bond, would seem to exclude those who are sharing the housing of \nothers due to loss of housing, economic hardship, or similar reasons, \nand those who are staying in motels due to the lack of adequate \nalternative accommodations. It would include people staying in motels \nif they only have enough money to stay for 14 days, and people in \ndoubled-up situations only if there is ``credible evidence'' that the \nowner/renter of the housing will not then stay for more than 14 days. \nMore troubling is the fact that children, youth, and families who meet \nother federal definitions of homelessness are included in the HUD \ndefinition only if they have been without permanent housing for a long \nperiod of time, and have moved frequently over that time, and can be \nexpected to stay without permanent housing due to numerous barriers.\n  Over 70 percent of the homeless children and youth identified by \npublic schools across the country last year--more than 500,000 \nstudents--were doubled-up or in motels, and therefore ineligible for \nHUD Homeless Assistance. In my home State of Alaska, the Anchorage \nSchool District, the largest in our State, has seen a quantum leap this \nschool year in one category for which no school superintendent or \nresident can be proud: The number of school children in this State of \nbeing ``doubled-up'' numbers have increased 100 percent over last \nschool year. Don't think for a moment that doubled-up families have \nmore stable housing than those in shelters. Doubled-up families change \nlocations 3-12 times in the course of a school year. Families are in \nshelters generally for 30-90 days.\n  The Reed-Bond amendment would have the unfortunate effect of \ncontinuing to exclude most of these children and youth from HUD \nservices and attention. The failure of the HUD definition to include \nthese families and youth compounds educational problems and makes the \ntask of providing a stable education much more difficult. I hope we can \ncontinue to work on this issue to ensure that HUD adopts a definition \nof homelessness that matches the reality of homelessness among families \nand youth, and is similar to definitions used by the U.S. Department of \nEducation, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the \nU.S. Department of Justice.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment \nand third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) a lack of affordable housing and limited scale of \n     housing assistance programs are the primary causes of \n     homelessness; and\n       (2) homelessness affects all types of communities in the \n     United States, including rural, urban, and suburban areas.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this division are--\n       (1) to consolidate the separate homeless assistance \n     programs carried out under title IV of the McKinney-Vento \n     Homeless Assistance Act (consisting of the supportive housing \n     program and related innovative programs, the safe havens \n     program, the section 8 assistance program for single-room \n     occupancy dwellings, and the shelter plus care program) into \n     a single program with specific eligible activities;\n       (2) to codify in Federal law the continuum of care planning \n     process as a required and integral local function necessary \n     to generate the local strategies for ending homelessness; and\n       (3) to establish a Federal goal of ensuring that \n     individuals and families who become homeless return to \n     permanent housing within 30 days.\n\n     SEC. 1003.

Mr. President, on behalf of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, we are pleased to bring S. 454, the Weapon Systems \nAcquisition Reform Act of 2009 to the Senate floor. I introduced this \nbill with Senator McCain on February 23 to address problems in the \nperformance of the major defense acquisition programs of the Department \nof Defense at a time when the cost growth on these programs has reached \nlevels we simply cannot afford.\n  Five weeks later, the bill was unanimously approved by the Armed \nServices Committee, and just last week the President called on Congress \nto act quickly on the bill. Report after report has shown that there \nare fundamental problems with the way we buy major weapons systems. In \nthe last month alone, we received three major reports documenting \nproblems with the acquisition system.\n  First, the Government Accountability Office reported that the cost \noverruns of the Department's 97 largest acquisition programs now total \nalmost $300 billion over the original program estimates, and the \nprograms are an average of 22 months behind schedule. That is true even \nthough the Department has cut unit quantities and reduced performance \nexpectations on many programs in an effort to expedite production and \nhold costs down.\n  Second, we got a report from the Business Executives for National \nSecurity, BENS. They reported:\n\n       We have an acquisition system at odds with the best \n     practices in the business world: insufficient systems \n     engineering capability [and] unrealistic cost estimating that \n     injects too much optimism in early program execution. . . .\n\n  Then, thirdly, there was a Defense Science Board report that said:\n\n       Today, the defense acquisition process takes too long to \n     produce weapons that are too expensive. . . .\n\n  As Secretary Gates pointed out in his testimony before our committee \nearlier this year:\n\n       The list of big-ticket weapons systems that have \n     experienced contract or program performance problems spans \n     the services.\n       Here are just a few examples of the kind of problems the \n     Department of Defense's major acquisition programs have \n     encountered. The Navy initially established a goal of $220 \n     million and a 2-year construction cycle for the two lead \n     ships on the Littoral Combat Ship, the LCS program. Those \n     goals ran counter to the Navy's historic experience in \n     building new ships and were inconsistent with the complexity \n     of the design required to make the program successful. As a \n     result, program costs have tripled and the program is almost \n     4 years behind schedule.\n\n  Next, the Air Force initially estimated that commonality between the \nthree variants, threat varieties, of the Joint Strike Fighter would \nsignificantly reduce development costs. However, that level of \ncommonality has proven impossible to achieve. Twelve years after the \nprogram started, three of the JSF's eight critical technologies are \nstill not mature. Its production processes are not mature, and its \ndesigns are still not fully proven and tested.\n  As a result, the program is now expected to exceed its original \nbudget by almost 40 percent. That is $40 billion. The Army \nunderestimated the lines of code needed to support the Future Combat \nSystem's software development by a factor of three. That led to an \nincrease in software development costs that now approaches $8 billion. \nSo 8 years after the program started, only three of the Future Combat \nSystem's 44 critical technologies are fully mature. GAO tells us that \nthe Army has not advanced the maturity of 11 critical technologies \nsince 2003, and that 2 other technologies, which are central to the \nArmy's plans, are now rated less mature than when the program began. As \na result, the program is now expected to exceed its original budget by \nabout 45 percent or $40 billion. It is as much as 5 years behind \nschedule and is likely to be substantially restructured.\n  There is a set of common problems underlying all these program \nfailures. As a general rule, when the Department of Defense acquisition \nprogram fails, it is because the Department relies on unreasonable \ncosts and schedule estimates; establishes unrealistic performance \nexpectations; insists on the use of immature technologies; and adopts \ncostly changes to program requirements, production quantities and \nfunding levels in the middle of ongoing programs.\n  The bill we bring before the Senate today is designed to address \nthese problems and to help put major defense acquisition programs on a \nsound footing from the outset by addressing program shortcomings in the \nearly phases of the acquisition process. Our bill is going to address \nproblems with unreasonable performance requirements and immature \ntechnologies by requiring the Department of Defense to reestablish \nsystems engineering organizations and developmental testing \ncapabilities that were downsized or eliminated as a result of \nreductions in the acquisition workforce in the late 1990s; periodically \nreview and assess the maturity of critical technologies; and make \ngreater use of prototypes, including competitive prototypes, to prove \nthat new\n\n[[Page S5210]]\n\ntechnologies work before trying to produce them.\n  Our bill will address problems with unreasonable cost and schedule \nestimates by establishing an independent cost estimating office headed \nby a Senate-confirmed director of independent cost assessment in an \neffort to ensure that the budget assumptions underlying acquisition \nprograms are sound.\n  We deal with a similar problem in the Congress by using an \nindependent office, the Congressional Budget Office, to tell us how \nmuch direct spending programs are really going to cost. Those of us who \nhave tangled with the CBO over the years know how tough and independent \nthat office can be in insisting on its estimates. We can decide to \nspend the money anyway, but we do so with our eyes wide open because \nthe cost estimator is not going to back down.\n  The Department of Defense itself has a model for this type of \nindependence in the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, the \nDOT For the last 25 years, that Director, who is appointed by the \nPresident, confirmed by the Senate, and reports directly to the \nSecretary of Defense, has ensured that weapons systems are adequately \ntested before they are deployed by providing independent certifications \nas to whether new military systems are effective and suitable for \ncombat. Program officials and contractors may disagree with the \nDirector, but they have discovered they cannot go around him.\n  Section 104 of our bill would ensure comparable discipline when it \ncomes to cost estimating by establishing a new director of independent \ncost assessment. Like the DOT, a new director will be appointed by \nthe President, confirmed by the Senate, and will report directly to the \nSecretary of Defense. Like the Director of Test and Evaluation, this \nofficial would have the independence and the clout within the \nDepartment to make objective determinations and stick to them. A truly \nindependent cost estimating director will not be popular within the \nDepartment, as the DOT is not popular often, but he will make our \nacquisition system work better by forcing the Department to recognize \nthe real cost of what our Secretary of Defense has called ``exquisite \nrequirements.''\n  Only when the Department faces up to these costs will it become more \nrealistic in its requirements and start to make the necessary tradeoffs \nbetween cost, schedule, and performance.\n  Section 104 makes the Director responsible for all cost estimates and \ncost analyses conducted in connection with major defense acquisition \nprograms and major automated systems programs in the Department of \nDefense. Under section 104, the Director is required to perform his own \ncost estimates at four separate points in the life of each program for \nwhich the Under Secretary is the milestone decision authority. On other \nprograms, he may rely on an independent cost estimate produced by one \nof the military departments but only if he determines that the \nservice's independent estimate is unbiased, fair, and reliable.\n  Our bill would also address problems with costly changes in the \nmiddle of a program by putting teeth in the Nunn-McCurdy requirements \nthat currently exist for troubled acquisition programs.\n  We will establish a presumption that any program that exceeds its \noriginal baseline by more than 50 percent will be terminated unless it \ncan be justified--be ``justified;'' and this is critically important--\nfrom the ground up.\n  Finally, our bill would address an inherent conflict of interest we \nsee on a number of programs today, when a contractor hired to give us \nan independent assessment of an acquisition program is participating in \nthe development or construction side of the same program.\n  We held a hearing back in March on S. 454, at which four witnesses, \nincluding two former Under Secretaries of Defense for Acquisition, \nTechnology, and Logistics, endorsed the committee's acquisition reform \neffort. The new Under Secretary for Acquisition, Technology, and \nLogistics added his support at his March 26 nomination hearing. In \naddition, we have since received extensive comments on the bill from \nthe Department of Defense, from the defense industry, and from \nindependent experts on the acquisition system.\n  Senator McCain and I took those comments into consideration and we \noffered a number of modifications to the bill, which were adopted by \nthe Armed Services Committee at our April 2 markup. We did not make all \nof the changes requested by the Department or the contractor community. \nFor example, the Department would like to eliminate the provision on \nthe Director of Independent Cost Assessment. Many contractors would \nprefer we not tighten the rules for organizational conflicts of \ninterest. And both the Department and industry would like us to drop \nour Nunn-McCurdy amendments, which place tough new requirements on \nfailing programs. We have not done that. These provisions are tough \nmedicine, but the acquisition system needs tough medicine.\n  In January, Secretary Gates told our committee that we must work \ntogether to address the ``repeated--and unacceptable--problems with \nrequirements, schedule, cost, and performance'' from which too many of \nour defense acquisition programs suffer. On March 4, the President \nendorsed the goals of the bill, telling the press that ``It's time to \nend the extra costs and long delays that are all too common in our \ndefense contracting.'' Last week, the President reiterated his position \nthat the bill has his full support, and he urged us to act quickly.\n  I hope our colleagues will join us. Senator McCain has been \ninstrumental in making this happen, and we and the Nation are \nappreciative to him for so many things, but we can add this now to the \nlist. Also, our full committee endorsed this bill. It was adopted \nunanimously in committee. It is a bipartisan bill.\n  We look forward to beginning consideration of this legislation. And \nto those Senators who have amendments, we hope they will let us know \nabout them to see if we can work them out, and, if not, arrange a time \nfor their consideration.\n  Again, I thank my friend from Arizona for all his work on this \nmatter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to begin by thanking my friend from \nMichigan, the distinguished chairman of the committee, whom I have had \nthe great honor of working with for many years. Senator Levin and I \nhave not always agreed on every issue; we are of different parties. But \nwe have had, in my view, a great opportunity to work together for the \ngood of this Nation and its security and the men and women who serve \nit.\n  I again thank Senator Levin for his leadership in bringing this \nlegislation quickly through our committee in a unanimous, bipartisan \nfashion, and bringing it to the floor.\n  As Senator Levin has mentioned, there may be some amendments or some \nmodifications that our colleagues want to make, but I am confident we \ncan get this bill done, into conference, and on the desk of the \nPresident. I am happy to say the President is very supportive. A \nmeeting he and Senator Levin and I had with the leaders in the House \nArmed Services Committee indicates the President and the \nadministration's commitment.\n  I also want to say Secretary Gates--a man who I believe is one of the \noutstanding Secretaries of Defense in the history of our country--has \nalways been forcefully in support of this legislation. There obviously \nis more to do because we have a broken system, a system that is broken \nso badly that in our attempt to provide a replacement for the \nPresident's helicopter--which is some 30 years old, known as Marine \nOne--we came to a point where the helicopter costs more than Air Force \nOne.\n  You cannot make it up--where we have a future combat system with cost \noverruns of tens of billions of dollars; a joint strike fighter program \nthat is completely out of control; and contracts--and there are many \nareas to place the blame and responsibility--but contracts that are let \nat certain cost estimates and then lose all touch with the original \nrealities.\n  Is there anybody who is an expert on defense acquisition, weapons \nsystems acquisition, who believes the final cost will be anything near \nwhat the initial cost was as presented to Congress and the American \npeople? Of course not. Of course not.\n  So the title of this legislation is the ``Weapon Systems Acquisition \nReform Act of 2009''--perhaps not a very exciting title. But the fact \nis, we have out-\n\n[[Page S5211]]\n\nof-control costs of our weapons systems, which we cannot afford. We are \nexpanding our Army and Marine Corps. We have increased obligations in \nAfghanistan, which has certainly been highlighted by the recent events \nin Pakistan, as well as Afghanistan. We cannot afford it.\n  We cannot afford to take care of our obligations in at least two \nwars, and potential flashpoints all over the world, and continue the \nspending spree we are on on weapons systems acquisition. This is \ntimely. It is needed.\n  I again thank the chairman of the committee, Senator Levin, for his \nleadership in seeing this bill from introduction through floor \nconsideration today. It shows, I think--and I do not want to make too \nmuch of it, but it does show when there is an issue that cries out for \nbipartisan action, this one can be an example now and in the future.\n  I do not want to get into a lot of the details of how all this came \nabout. But I would remind my colleagues that back some years ago, we \nused to have a thing called fixed-cost contracts. Those were the \nmajority of the contracts that were let when we wanted to build a new \nweapons system: a new airplane, a new ship, a new tank. For many years, \nwe were almost able to stay within those costs.\n  There were some dramatic exceptions. I can remember back in the 1970s \nthe cost escalation associated with new nuclear submarines. And I can \nremember some others. But, generally speaking, we built weapons systems \nand gave them to the military at very close to their original cost \nestimates. That is not the case today.\n  Some will argue--as I have heard in the industry--well, there are \ntechnical changes that are ordered by the military which increase the \ncost. I think Secretary Gates pointed out some months ago: Are we \nallowing the perfect to be the enemy of the good? Are we getting a \nweapon system which achieves 80 to 90 percent of what we want--which, \nit seems to me, is under reasonable costs--or are we making all these \ntechnical changes, which cause the cost of these systems to go up in \nthe most dramatic fashion?\n  We cannot afford to continue to do it. We cannot. I think this is an \nimportant step. I know the chairman would agree with me. This is not \nthe only step that needs to be taken to bring an out-of-control system \nunder some kind of control and accountability to the American taxpayer.\n  In its most recent assessment of the Department of Defense's major \nweapons systems, the General Accountability Office observed that ``the \noverall performance of weapon system programs is poor [and] the time \nfor change is now.''\n  So I say to my colleagues, as they come to the floor with amendments \nand debate--and we need to discuss this--we should keep in mind the \nGeneral Accountability Office's observation that ``the time for change \nis now.''\n  I would also remind my colleagues and the American people this \nlegislation has to pass through the House. We have to then go to \nconference. We then have to have the President sign it. And then the \nchanges have to be implemented. So we are not seeing even an immediate \nturnaround with the rapid consideration of this legislation, as I think \nwe can achieve today.\n  I would ask my colleagues on this side of the aisle, if they have \namendments, if they would notify the cloakroom, and we will make time \nfor them. I know the chairman and I can enter into time agreements so \nwe can dispense with the legislation in an expeditious way as possible, \nbut also taking into consideration any concerns, amendments, our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle have.\n  The chairman has described, I think, this bill very well, and I do \nnot want to repeat his assessment. But I do want to point out a couple \nthings or emphasize a couple points the chairman made.\n  The bill improves how the Department of Defense manages probably the \nsingle most significant driver of cost growth in our largest weapons \nprocurement programs: technology risk. Basically, it does so by \nstarting programs off right--with sound systems engineering, \ndevelopmental testing, and independent cost estimates early in the \nprogram. We have seen these cost estimates particularly being \nunrealistic because we have not done the proper sound systems \nengineering and developmental testing that is necessary to get a \ncorrect assessment of costs.\n  The bill, among many other things, requires the Department of Defense \nto assess each department's ability to conduct early stage systems \nengineering and fill in any gaps in that important capability.\n  The bill provides for the creation or resumption of key oversight \npositions, including a Director of Independent Cost Assessment and a \nDirector of Developmental Testing and Evaluation. I am not one who \nbelieves in creating new positions. I think our bureaucracy over on the \nother side of the river is big enough. But I do believe we need to \ncreate and resume key oversight functions, and those do require a \nDirector of Independent Cost Assessment and a Director of Developmental \nTesting and Evaluation.\n  The relationship between those who are doing the contracting, other \ncontractors, and the awardee is way too close today for us to get truly \nindependent assessments and cost controls.\n  The bill requires that preliminary design and critical design reviews \nare completed early in a program's acquisition cycle so as to inform \ngo/no-go purchase decisions on major weapons systems.\n  The bill requires that the Department's budget, requirements, and \nacquisitions community consult with each other and make tradeoffs \nbetween cost, schedule, and performance early in the procurement \nprocess, and get combatant commanders more involved in the requirements \nprocess.\n  I want to emphasize that last point. The combatant commanders are the \nend users of the equipment we provide them with. Unfortunately, on many \noccasions, the combatant commanders have not been involved in the \nrequirements process early enough on or too late, to the point where \nthey cannot make significant changes. What we want to do is give the \nDepartment, under the leadership of our great Secretary of Defense and \nthe Congress, a big stick--bigger than anything available under current \nlaw--to wield against the very worst performing programs.\n  On the broadest level, this bill recognizes that only when a program \nis predictable; that is, when milestones are being met, estimated costs \nare actual costs, and performance-to-contract specifications and ``key \nperformance parameters'' are achieved, only then can we rely on the \nacquisition process to provide the joint warfighter with timely optimal \ncapability at the most reasonable cost to the taxpayer.\n\n  The approach provided for in this bill, which allows the Department \nof Defense to manage technology risks effectively, should help it move \naway from cost-reimbursable contracts and instead maximize its use of \nfixed price-type contracts. When coupled with initiatives that subject \nprograms to full and open competition, this approach could save \ntaxpayers billions of dollars.\n  While we do not intend this bill as a panacea that will cure all that \nails the defense procurement process, as it is, it constitutes an \nimportant next step in Congress's continuing effort to help the \nDepartment reform itself.\n  Two final points.\n  Since the chairman and I originally introduced the bill, the \nDepartment of Defense and others have raised various concerns about \ndiscrete elements of the bill. The bill now under consideration has \nbenefited from that dialog as it addresses their reasonable concerns, \nwithout undermining the underlying intent of the bill, to put in place \nan evolutionary, knowledge-based acquisition process that metes out \ntechnology risks early in a program.\n  I note for the record that we received testimony on this bill in our \nMarch 3, 2009, hearing. A day later, the President came out in support \nof the bill's underlying principles. Just a few days ago, he offered an \nunqualified endorsement. In addition, Secretary Gates and Dr. Ashton \nCarter, the new Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology \nand Logistics, have spoken approvingly of the bill. Also, the General \nAccountability Office, two former Defense acquisition chiefs, and \nvarious taxpayer advocacy and think tank organizations, including the \nCenter for American Progress, Business Executives for National \nSecurity, the Project on Government Oversight, known as POGO, the \nNational Taxpayers Union, NTU, the U.S. Public Interest Research\n\n[[Page S5212]]\n\nGroup, PIRG, and Taxpayers for Common Sense, have also weighed in in \nsupport of the bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have their statements printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain, The \n     undersigned groups applaud your commitment to reforming and \n     improving the Department of Defense's (DoD's) acquisition \n     system through the Weapons Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 (S. \n     454) and the Weapons Acquisition System Reform Through \n     Enhancing Technical Knowledge and Oversight (WASTE TKO) Act \n     of 2009 (H.R. 2101). Both pieces of legislation include \n     important provisions to restore discipline to DoD's \n     procurement process. As the final legislation is worked out \n     in conference, we believe that the following principles \n     should be preserved:\n       Ensuring only programs with design maturity move forward--\n     Programs that enter production before their designs are \n     mature are vulnerable to gross schedule and cost overruns. \n     The Senate bill advocates a strategy that would significantly \n     improve programs by requiring design reviews to certify that \n     programs have attained an appropriate level of design \n     maturity before a program is approved for System Capability \n     and Manufacturing Process Development. As a result of this \n     reform, program and cost risk could be significantly reduced.\n       Elevating independent cost estimates--We support the \n     establishment of a Director of Independent Cost Assessment to \n     provide oversight and implement policies and procedures to \n     make sure that the cost estimation process is reliable and \n     objective. Creating this new, independent position is \n     important to prevent the cycle of costs that exceed estimates \n     due to insufficient knowledge of accurate requirements.\n       Increasing accountability for programs that experience \n     critical cost growth--Both bills propose language that place \n     additional and needed scrutiny on programs that experience \n     critical cost growth. The House bill seeks to increase \n     accountability by asking for an assessment of the root cause \n     of growth, program validity, the viability of program \n     strategy, and the quality of program management to determine \n     whether a program should be terminated. But we believe the \n     more aggressive strategy advocated by the Senate will do more \n     to increase program discipline by requiring that a program be \n     terminated unless the Secretary determines that it is \n     essential to national security, and includes documentation \n     that also states that 1) there are no alternatives to the \n     acquisition program ``which will provide equal or greater \n     capability to meet a joint military requirement''; 2) the new \n     acquisition cost or procurement unit costs are reasonable; \n     and 3) the management structure for the acquisition program \n     is adequate to manage and control program acquisition unit \n     cost or procurement unit cost. By also rescinding the most \n     recent Milestone approval and requiring a new approval, we \n     believe program management for programs that experience \n     critical cost growth will be improved.\n       Reducing organizational conflicts of interest--Independent \n     analysis is key to ensuring that DoD decision makers are \n     given unbiased, accurate information upon which to base \n     program decisions. While we applaud the House for calling for \n     a study to examine how to eliminate or mitigate \n     organizational conflicts of interest, we also strongly \n     support preventing organizational conflicts. The Senate \n     version of this bill would decrease conflicts of interest by \n     mandating that DoD seek independent advice on systems \n     architecture and systems engineering for major weapon \n     systems. We also support the language initially proposed in \n     S. 454 that would require that a contract for the performance \n     of systems engineering and technical assistance (SETA) \n     functions for major weapons systems contain a provision \n     prohibiting the contractor or any affiliate of the contractor \n     from having a direct financial interest in the development or \n     construction of the weapon system or any component thereof. \n     We urge you to include the ``Organizational Conflict of \n     Interest'' provision that explicitly defines the minimum \n     regulations to be enacted that will preclude contractors from \n     advising the Department of Defense on weapons systems and \n     then developing them.\n       Increasing competition in major weapons systems--Both bills \n     enhance competition in the procurement process that will \n     translate into the best value for taxpayers and also serves \n     as an important tool to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. We \n     support language that would encourage programs to utilize \n     methods such as competitive prototyping, periodic \n     competitions for subsystem upgrades, licensing of additional \n     suppliers, and periodic system or program reviews to address \n     long-term competitive effects of program decisions. But we \n     believe that competition, and with it benefits to taxpayers, \n     will only be further enhanced by measures in the Senate bill \n     to increase the use of government oversight or approval in \n     make or buy decisions at every system level.\n       Increasing transparency in the waiver process--The answer \n     to solving the problems with DoD's procurement process is not \n     simply a matter of making new rules. We believe that many of \n     the rules and controls are already in place for responsible \n     procurement of weapons systems, but that these rules are too \n     frequently ignored or otherwise not followed, resulting in a \n     system that has been plagued by cost and schedule overruns. \n     The House adopts an important strategy for this effort by \n     forcing DoD to supply Congress with explanations for waivers \n     to key provisions for Milestone decisions and follow-up \n     annual reviews of these programs. This significantly \n     increases Congress's ability to oversee DoD and make sure \n     that taxpayers are getting the national security capabilities \n     they need at a reasonable price.\n       We also support the proposed reforms to increase the \n     emphasis on systems engineering, developmental testing, and \n     technology maturity assessments, along with confidence levels \n     for cost estimates. All of these principles help programs to \n     have a strong foundation.\n       As important as all of these provisions are, it's important \n     to recognize that this legislation is only one step in \n     reforming weapons acquisition. The defense procurement \n     process is also in desperate need of discipline. Standards \n     for appropriate levels of design maturity should be clearly \n     defined to meet missions and requirements. Waivers from \n     procurement rules should be used rarely, should be the \n     exception, not the rule, and should be made available to both \n     Congress and the public. Additionally, spiral acquisition \n     contracts should not be used to push immature technologies \n     back in the production process, where they can still endanger \n     the program's cost and schedule. All technologies should be \n     mature before committing to production.\n       In the short term, Defense Secretary Robert Gates has \n     demonstrated his commitment to restoring discipline to the \n     Pentagon's weapons acquisition by his aggressive program \n     cuts, and Congress should follow his lead in putting the \n     public good ahead of their parochial interests. But in order \n     to achieve lasting, meaningful change, the Pentagon must \n     follow the rules and controls in place, and Congress must \n     conduct oversight to make sure that they do so. We look \n     forward to working with you in the future to implement these \n     changes.\n     Danielle Brian,\n       Project on Government Oversight.\n     Pete Sepp,\n       Vice President, National Taxpayers Union, U.S. Public \n     Interest Research Group.\n     Ryan Alexander,\n       Taxpayers for Common Sense.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Business Executives\n\n\n                                        for National Security,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 31, 2009.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator McCain: We note with pleasure the introduction \n     of your bill targeted towards improvement of the Defense \n     Department's acquisition management process. At Business \n     Executives for National Security (BENS), we believe--and have \n     asserted for some time--that acquisition reform is one of the \n     most important areas for achieving efficiencies and savings \n     that can be redirected to the warfighter. In line with your \n     proposals, research shows the keys to successful acquisition \n     are to start programs with sound systems engineering, realism \n     in cost-estimating and subsequent funding, and ensuring \n     appropriate technology maturation before entry into the \n     program. Your proposal takes steps in the appropriate \n     direction toward ensuring increased attention to these \n     important areas.\n       For over twenty five years BENS has been the nation's pre-\n     eminent conduit for bringing the best business practices and \n     advice from the private sector to the world of national \n     security. Through this engagement BENS has come to recognize \n     that the Department of Defense and the Military Services are \n     not businesses; they are organizations with an ethos and \n     culture unique to their members and mission. Recognizing the \n     difference has allowed BENS to help the Defense Department \n     adopt relevant, proven practices that slash bureaucracy, \n     streamline operations, and cut waste without violating those \n     non-business characteristics which cannot be changed.\n       Therefore, we are particularly supportive of the Senate \n     bill, Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 (S. 454). \n     We believe this bill, as good as it is, could go further in \n     addressing many of the embedded processes that continue to \n     detract from the overall effectiveness of the process. We \n     fail sometimes in the basic recognition that the defense \n     acquisition system is a national enterprise comprised of \n     branches and agencies of the federal government on both sides \n     of the Potomac River, and in the defense and private sectors \n     nationally and globally. Based on the research of our Task \n     Force on Acquisition Law and Oversight, BENS has concluded \n     that it is time to fundamentally reset the expectations for \n     what our nation wants from the defense acquisition enterprise \n     and its processes. Congress is best suited to define and \n     advocate these expectations. Too many studies and too many \n     good recommendations have gone unheeded. If we are to reform, \n     only Congress can lead it.\n\n[[Page S5213]]\n\n       Your attention to this important issue is heartening. BENS \n     recommends that Congress, as it continues to fashion this \n     legislation, give careful consideration to the \n     recommendations we make in our report, which is expected to \n     be issued by April 30, 2009. We look forward to a successful \n     outcome on the acquisition management issue, and to providing \n     any further help as you negotiate the final bill. Please \n     contact Chuck Boyd should you have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n     Joseph E. Robert, Jr.\n       Chairman, BENS Board of Directors,\n       Chairman and CEO, J.E. Robert Companies.\n     Charles G. Boyd,\n       President & CEO, BENS.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Finally, I wish to say that there is another ongoing \nbattle I will continue to engage in for as long as I am here, and that \nis the earmarking and porkbarreling that goes on in the Defense \nappropriations bill.\n  I am proud to have served for many years on the authorizing committee \nof the Armed Services Committee of the Senate. I see year after year, \ntime after time, billions of dollars of unwanted, unnecessary \nporkbarrel-earmark spending, many of it having nothing to do with the \ndefense of this Nation and the men and women who serve it. I see \nearmark-porkbarrel projects highlighted even as short a time ago as \nyesterday in the Washington Post, and the outrageous abuse of the \ntaxpayers' dollars. When Members of Congress were put in Federal \nprison, it was the Defense appropriations bill that was the source of \nsome of the corruption.\n  So I look forward to passing this to help reform the Pentagon. We \nstill need to reform the way the Congress of the United States does \nbusiness in porkbarreling and earmarking scarce taxpayers' dollars that \nshould be used to defend this Nation and not for the sources of \nporkbarrel and earmark spending that has become rampant. The last \nOmnibus appropriations bill had 9,000 earmark-porkbarrel projects in \nit, thousands of them on the defense side of the appropriations. It is \nunacceptable. It is outrageous. The American people are sick and tired \nof it. I will continue that fight.\n  Again, I thank the distinguished chairman, Senator Levin, for his \nleadership on this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me again thank Senator McCain for all \nhe has done to bring us to the floor today. This is a bipartisan bill. \nIt is a major reform of the acquisition system. It is long overdue. It \nis genuinely and desperately needed.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to take just a couple minutes to \ndiscuss the kinds of overruns we are talking about.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this report by the GAO of 2009 on major \nweapons programs, changes in costs and quantities for 10 of the highest \ncost acquisition programs, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               2009 GAO Report on Major Weapons Programs\n\n            TABLE 2: CHANGES IN COSTS AND QUANTITIES FOR 10 OF THE HIGHEST-COST ACQUISITION PROGRAMS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  Total cost (fiscal year       Total quantity       Acquisition\n                                                      2009 dollars in     --------------------------  unit cost\n                                                         millions)                                  ------------\n                    Program                     --------------------------  First full    Current\n                                                  First full    Current      estimate     estimate    Percentage\n                                                   estimate     estimate                                change\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJoint Strike Fighter...........................      206,410      244,772        2,866        2,456          *38\nFuture Combat System...........................       89,776      129,731           15           15          *45\nVirginia Class Submarine.......................       58,378       81,556           30           30          *40\nF-22A Raptor...................................       88,134       73,723          648          184         *195\nC-17 Globemaster III...........................       51,733       73,571          210          190           57\nV-22 Joint Services Advanced Vertical Lift            38,726       55,544          913          458         *186\n Aircraft......................................\nF/A-18E/F Super Hornet.........................       78,925       51,787        1,000          493           33\nTrident II Missile.............................       49,939       49,614          845          561           50\nCVN 21 Nuclear Aircraft Class Carrier..........       34,360       29,914            3            3          -13\nP-8A Poseidon Multi-mission Maritime Aircraft..       29,974       29,622          115          113            1\n \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Enormous cost growth.\n \nSource: GAO analysis of DOD data.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. For the Joint Strike Fighter, the first full estimate was \nthat the cost would be $2.866 billion. The current estimate and \npercentage change is a 38-percent increase.\n  The Future Combat System was first estimated to cost $89-and-some \nbillion. It is now up to $129 billion, a 45-percent increase in cost.\n  The Virginia class submarine was originally estimated to be around \n$58 billion. It is now $81 billion, a 40-percent increase.\n  The F-22, which will be the subject of debate on the floor of the \nSenate, original cost estimate was $88 billion, and the cost has \nincreased by 195 percent.\n  The Globemaster has a 57-percent increase, the C-17.\n  The V-22 Joint Services Advanced Vertical Lift Aircraft, a 186-\npercent increase in cost.\n  The list goes on and on, with the exception of the nuclear aircraft \ncarrier, which has a 13-percent decrease in cost. We ought to see what \nthey are doing.\n  The programs GAO reviewed in 2008, the most used initial cost \nestimates from sources previously found to be unreliable, many still \nbegan with low levels of technical maturity. The promised capabilities \ncontinued to be delivered later than planned, and 10 of the Pentagon's \nlargest programs equaling half of the Department's overall acquisition \ndollars are significantly over budget and under delivery in capability.\n  So these are the reasons we are absolutely in need of addressing \nweapons acquisition reform as early and quickly as possible.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, our staffs have worked hard to try to clear \nsome amendments. We have been able to do so. But in order for us to \nmove these amendments be adopted, they are going to have to have their \nsponsors come to the floor.\n  The nine amendments which have been cleared on both sides and which \nwe can accept if we can get the sponsors here would be three amendments \nof Senator McCaskill, one of Senator Collins, one of Senator Coburn, \none of Senator Whitehouse, one of Senator Carper, one of Senator \nInhofe, and one of Senator Chambliss.\n  These amendments have not been filed yet. We have cleared them but \nthey need to be filed by the Senators, and that is the reason we need \nthem to come to the floor.\n  I will be happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Chairman explained what is necessary. \nI urge my colleagues to come to the floor, if they have additional \namendments, so we can finish the bill. It seems to be remarkably free \nof controversy.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on a bipartisan basis our committee \napproved this bill unanimously, the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform \nAct of 2009. We have a few minutes so I will just make a few points \nhighlighting this bill.\n  The Government Accountability Office reported last month, as both \nSenator McCain and I mentioned earlier, the cost overruns on the \nDepartment's 97 largest acquisition programs alone totaled almost $300 \nbillion over the original program estimates. That is true, even though \nthe Department of Defense cut the quantities being purchased and they \nreduced the performance expectations on many of the programs in order \nto hold down costs.\n  Second, we know what the underlying problems are at the Department of \nDefense. The Department of Defense acquisition programs fail because \nthe\n\n[[Page S5214]]\n\nDepartment continues to rely on unreasonable cost and schedule \nestimates. They continue to establish unrealistic performance \nexpectations. The Department continues to use immature technologies and \nto adopt costly changes to program requirements, to production \nquantities, and to funding levels right in the middle of these \nprograms. When we do that we have unstable programs and costs that are \ngoing to rise.\n  Third, this bill contains a number of specific measures to address \nthe problems I have just identified. The bill has the support of the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, the Government Accountability Office, \nmany independent experts on acquisition policy, and a number of public \ninterest groups. There are many important provisions in this bill, but \nI want to highlight one of them this afternoon.\n  We are waiting for sponsors of amendments we have cleared, and those \nthat we have not cleared, to come to the floor. We are open for \nbusiness.\n  One of the most important provisions that is in this bill is the \nprovision which establishes a director of independent cost assessment. \nIt is the way to bring real discipline to the DOD's cost estimating \nprocess. At present, there is an entity called Cost Assessment \nImprovement Group, or CAIG, for short. They are supposed to be \nproducing independent cost estimates on DOD acquisition programs. That \nis their responsibility. However, the CAIG operation is too low down in \nthe bureaucracy. It is not directly accountable and reporting to the \nSecretary of Defense. It is a committee and includes representatives of \neach of the Under Secretaries and a number of other senior officials in \nthe Department, chaired by a civil servant in the Senior Executive \nService who is the Deputy Director for Resource Analysis in the Office \nof Program Analysis and Evaluation.\n  Just almost by saying those words one can understand why it does not \nhave the direct clout we need this person to have. We are going to \nestablish an individual who is responsible, a person who directly \nreports to the Secretary of Defense just the way in which another \ncritically important office now does, the one that evaluates the \ntechnologies.\n  We are also going to have this person be Senate confirmed. The person \nwho now is Senate confirmed, who does this for a different role, is the \nDirector of Program Analysis and Evaluation. That person, that \nDirector, is--I misspoke. It is the Director of Operational Testing and \nEvaluation who now is directly accountable to the Secretary of Defense \nand is Senate confirmed. We want this person who is going to be \nresponsible for cost analysis to be also in that same position and to \nhave that same kind of clout.\n  Now, the CAIG staff does a terrific job at what they do. I am not, in \nany way, disparaging the work of the CAIG staff. But a career official \nin the Senior Executive Service who serves as the Deputy Director of an \noffice that is not even headed by a Presidential appointee simply does \nnot have the independence and the clout that is essential if the cost \nof these programs is going to be put under control.\n  By establishing a tough and an independent cost estimator who is \nSenate confirmed and reports directly to the Secretary of Defense, we \nbelieve our bill is going to go a long way toward ending the \nunrealistic, the overly optimistic cost assessments that are too often \nused in order to sell the new acquisition programs.\n  We have to reduce the unnecessary ``gold plating'' of weapon systems. \nWe have to bring the Department of Defense undisciplined requirements \nsystem under control.\n  As I indicated, we are ready to begin addressing amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                     Republic of Georgia Situation\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the distinguished \nchairman of the Committee. I hope we can get these amendments filed as \nquickly as possible. In the meantime, I would like to make a comment \nabout the recent situation in the Republic of Georgia.\n  It has been just 8 months since the world's attention was riveted by \nRussia's invasion of neighboring Georgia. In the midst of the fighting, \nthe United States, the European Union, and the international community \ndecried the violence and called on Russia to withdraw its troops from \nsovereign Georgian soil. There was talk of sanctions against Moscow, \nthe Bush administration withdrew its submission to Congress of a \nnuclear cooperation agreement with Russia, and NATO suspended meetings \nof the NATO-Russia Council.\n  The outrage quickly subsided, however, and it seems that the events \nof last August have been all but forgotten in some quarters. A casual \nobserver might guess that things have returned to normal in this part \nof the world, that the war in Georgia was a brief and tragic \ncircumstance that has since been reversed.\n  But in fact this is not the case. While the stories have faded from \nthe headlines, Russia remains in violation of the terms of the \nceasefire to which it agreed last year, and Russian troops continue to \nbe stationed on sovereign Georgian territory. I would like to spend a \nfew moments addressing this issue. It bears remembering.\n  Last August, following months of escalating tension in the breakaway \nGeorgian province of South Ossetia, the Russian military sent tanks and \ntroops across the internationally recognized border into South Ossetia. \nIt did not stop there, and Moscow also sent troops into Abkhazia, \nanother breakaway province, dispatched its Black Sea Fleet to take up \npositions along the Georgian coastline, barred access to the port at \nPoti, and commenced bombing raids deep into Georgian territory. Despite \nan appeal from Georgian officials on August 10, noting the Georgian \nwithdrawal from nearly all of South Ossetia and requesting a ceasefire, \nthe Russian attacks continued.\n  Two days later, the Russian president met with French President \nNicolas Sarkozy, and ultimately agreed to a six-point ceasefire \nrequiring, among other things, that all parties to the conflict cease \nhostilities and pull back their troops to the positions they had \noccupied before the conflict began. Despite this agreement, the Russian \nmilitary continued its operations throughout Georgia, targeting the \ncountry's military infrastructure and reportedly engaging in widespread \nlooting.\n  A follow-on ceasefire agreement signed on September 8 by French \nPresident Sarkozy and Russian President Medvedev required that all \nRussian forces would withdraw from areas adjoining South Ossetia and \nAbkhazia by October 10, but it took just 1 day for Moscow to announce \nthat, while it would withdraw its troops to the two provinces, it \nintended to station thousands of Russian soldiers there, in violation \nof its commitment to return those numbers to preconflict levels. Russia \nalso recognized the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, the \nonly country in the world to do so other than Nicaragua. The leaders of \nboth provinces have suggested publicly that they may seek eventual \nunification with Russia.\n  Despite the initial international reaction to these moves, the will \nto impose consequences on Russia for its aggression quickly faded. To \ncite one example, the European Parliament agreed on September 3 to \npostpone its talks with Russia on a new partnership agreement until \nRussian troops had withdrawn from Georgia. Just 2 months later, the \nEuropean Union decided to restart those talks. The U.N. Security \nCouncil attempted to move forward a resolution embracing the terms of \nthe ceasefire, but Russia blocked action. The NATO allies suspended \nmeetings of the NATO-Russia Council, then decided in March to resume \nthem.\n  Yet today, Russia remains in violation of its obligations of the \nceasefire agreement. Thousands of Russian troops remain in South \nOssetia and Abkhazia, greatly in excess of the preconflict levels. \nRather than abide by the ceasefire's requirement to engage in \ninternational talks on the future of the two provinces, Russia has \nrecognized their independence, signed friendship agreements with them \nthat effectively render them Russian dependencies, and taken over their \nborder controls.\n  All of this suggests tangible results to Russia's desire to maintain \na sphere of influence in neighboring countries, dominate their \npolitics, and circumscribe their freedom of action in\n\n[[Page S5215]]\n\ninternational affairs. Just last week, President Medvedev denounced \nNATO exercises currently taking place in Georgia, describing them as \n``provocative.'' These ``provocative'' exercises do not involve heavy \nequipment or arms and focus on disaster response, search and rescue, \nand the like. Russia was even invited to participate in the exercises, \nan invitation Moscow declined.\n  We must not revert to an era in which the countries on Russia's \nperiphery were not permitted to make their own decisions, control their \nown political futures, and decide their own alliances. Whether in \nKyrgyzstan, where Moscow seems to have exerted pressure for the \neviction of U.S. forces from the Manas base, to Estonia, which suffered \na serious cyberattack some time ago, to Georgia and elsewhere, Russia \ncontinues its attempts to reestablish a sphere of influence. Yet such \nmoves are in direct contravention to the free and open, rules-based \ninternational system that the United States and its partners have spent \nso many decades to uphold.\n  So let us not forget what has happened in Georgia, and what is \nhappening there today. I would urge the Europeans, including the French \nPresident who brokered the ceasefire, to help hold the Russians to its \nterms. And in the United States, where there remain areas of potential \ncooperation with Moscow, from nuclear issues to ending the Iranian \nnuclear program, let us not sacrifice the full independence and \nsovereignty of countries we have been proud to call friends.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1045\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act \nof 2009, authored by Senators Levin and McCain, would strengthen and \nreform the Department of Defense acquisition process.\n  The bill would bring increased accountability, more transparency, and \ncost savings to major defense acquisition programs. Simply put, the \nbill would build discipline into the planning and requirements process, \nkeep projects focused, help to prevent cost overruns and schedule \ndelays and ultimately save taxpayers' dollars.\n  I am very proud to join the chairman and ranking member of the Armed \nServices Committee in cosponsoring this important initiative. I applaud \ntheir continued efforts to improve procurement at the Pentagon.\n  In fiscal year 2008, DOD spending reached $396 billion, approximately \n74 percent of total Federal contract spending. The scope of the \nDepartment's contract spending is particularly startling when one \nexamines closely Army procurement. The number of Army contract actions \nhas grown by more than 600 percent since 2001, and contract dollars \nhave increased by more than 500 percent.\n  In 2007, the Army put on contract one out of every four Federal \ncontracting dollars. These figures alone are overwhelming. But they \nactually understate the scope of the procurement challenges at the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  Research, development, testing, evaluation, and procurement of \nincreasingly complex weapon systems challenge the Department's ability \nto ensure that taxpayer dollars are wisely spent. Let me give you an \nexample: The National Polar Orbiting Operational Environmental \nSatellite System--there is a mouthful--is just one of several Defense \nprograms that have been undermined by cost overruns and schedule \ndelays.\n  This is a complicated program that is required to promote and provide \na remote sensing capability that is used by the Department of Defense \nand by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n  A 2006 report by an inspector general indicated that this one program \nwas more than $3 billion over the initial life cycle cost estimates and \nnearly 17 months behind schedule. So here we have an essential program \nthat is $3 billion over the initial life cycle cost estimates and it is \nabout a year and a half behind schedule. Unfortunately, this is not an \nisolated example. It is but one of many examples of defense \nprocurements that have suffered from soaring cost increases and \nunacceptable delays.\n  The legislation introduced by Senators Levin and McCain, which I am \npleased to cosponsor, would improve the Defense Department's planning \nand program oversight in many ways.\n  First, the bill would create a new director of independent cost \nassessment to be the principal cost estimation official at the \nDepartment. The director would be responsible for monitoring and \nreviewing all cost estimates and cost analyses conducted in connection \nwith the major defense acquisition programs. Having this set of \nindependent eyes on critical but expensive programs would help to \nprevent wasteful spending. It would help to ensure that when we embark \non a new defense acquisition, we truly have confidence in the cost \nestimates.\n  The bill also mandates that the Department carefully balance cost, \nschedule, and performance as part of the requirements development \nprocess. These reforms would build important discipline into the \nprocurement process long before a request for proposals is issued and a \ncontract is awarded. By carefully considering the needs of the program \noffice, the associated requirements and estimated cost of a program, \nand the risks inherent in system development and deployment, the \nDepartment will be able to make much more rational decisions about its \ninvestments and use more effective contracting vehicles for \nprocurements long before taxpayer dollars are committed to the project.\n  I also applaud the bright lines this legislation would establish \nregarding organizational conflicts of interest by defense contractors. \nThese reforms would strengthen the wall between Government employees \nand contractors, helping to ensure that ethical boundaries are \nrespected. While certainly private sector contractors are vital \npartners with military and civilian employees at the Department of \nDefense, their roles and responsibilities must be well defined and free \nof conflicts of interest as they undertake their critical work \nsupporting our Nation's military.\n  What we are finding--and we have had oversight hearings in the \nHomeland Security Committee on this issue--is that in the Department of \nHomeland Security and the Department of Defense, in some cases we have \ndefense contractors involved in setting requirements, defining \nrequirements for projects on which subsidiaries of those defense \ncontractors may well be bidding. We want to avoid those kinds of \nconflicts of interest which impair confidence in the integrity of the \nprocess.\n  We also want to make sure we are following current law as far as \nactivities that should be done in-house because they are inherently \ngovernmental.\n  I note, too, that this legislation encourages the Department to \nreinvest personnel resources in systems engineers--a necessary element \nfor any successful acquisition reform of the Department's major weapon \nsystems programs. Without experienced, well-trained engineers, the \nDepartment will be unable to set definitive requirements during the \nplanning process, incapable of effectively testing and evaluating the \ndevelopment of these systems, and ineffective in addressing systems \ndefects in the incredibly complex programs in which the Department, of \nnecessity, invests. The lack of systems engineers also prevents strong \nprogram oversight, as the limited number of engineers available simply \ncannot focus sufficient time and attention on the programs as they are \nconstantly pulled in multiple directions.\n  Adding systems engineers is only one part of the overall personnel \nreforms necessary to improve the acquisition process. DOD must also \ninvest significantly in its undermanned acquisition workforce.\n  The dramatic downsizing of the defense acquisition workforce during \nthe 1990s was followed by an even more dramatic increase in workload. \nSo at the time that the Defense Department's acquisition workforce was \ndeclining, the workload was increasing. In fiscal year 2001, the \nDepartment spent $138 billion on contracts. Seven years later, DOD\n\n[[Page S5216]]\n\nspending reached $396 billion--a 187-percent increase. Of that amount, \n$202 billion was for the procurement of services. That requires labor-\nintensive acquisition management and oversight. Needless to say, these \nfactors have greatly strained the defense acquisition workforce and \ngreatly increased the risk of acquisition failure. At the same time, a \nsignificant increase in the use of contractor acquisition support \npersonnel has added another layer of complexity as the Department must \nmanage both organizational and personal conflicts of interest.\n  I commend Secretary Gates for recognizing just how important these \nworkforce issues are. Under his leadership, the Department has set \nforth an aggressive program for strengthening the acquisition \nworkforce, including increasing the number of acquisition personnel and \nimproving their training. The Secretary has proposed increasing the \nworkforce by 15 percent through 2015. That amounts to approximately \n20,000 new employees. I also praise the Secretary for not only adding \nadditional personnel but for thinking about what they should be doing. \nFor example, he has proposed that some of these new employees take over \ntasks that are currently being performed by defense contractors. That \nis that conflict-of-interest issue I mentioned earlier. If the \nSecretary's plan goes through--and I am going to support him strongly \nin this regard--the acquisition workforce would increase to numbers not \nseen in a decade. That will save money and improve acquisition \noutcomes.\n  But this isn't just a numbers game. In addition to having a \nsufficient number of personnel, the Department must have the right mix. \nI am pleased that the Secretary has proposed 600 additional auditors \nfor DCAA, the Defense Contract Audit Agency, and additional engineers \nand technical experts.\n  These acquisition changes will help to prevent contracting waste, \nfraud, abuse, and mismanagement. Most of all, they are absolutely \nessential to the effective implementation of the procurement reforms in \nthis bill. We can write the best laws. We can impose the strongest \nreforms. But if we do not have sufficient personnel, well-trained \nemployees to carry out these reforms, our efforts will be for naught.\n  I now call up an amendment I have at the desk. It is amendment No. \n1045.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for herself and Mrs. \n     McCaskill, proposes an amendment numbered 1045.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1045\n\n (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Defense to apply uniform earned \n    value management standards to reliably and consistently measure \ncontract performance, and to ensure that contractors establish and use \n               approved earned value management systems)\n\n       On page 69, after line 2, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 207. EARNED VALUE MANAGEMENT.\n\n       (a) Enhanced Tracking of Contractor Performance.--Not later \n     than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, \n     the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, \n     and Logistics shall review the existing guidance and, as \n     necessary, prescribe additional guidance governing the \n     implementation of the Earned Value Management (EVM) \n     requirements and reporting for contracts to ensure that the \n     Department of Defense--\n       (1) applies uniform EVM standards to reliably and \n     consistently measure contract or project performance;\n       (2) applies such standards to establish appropriate \n     baselines at the award of a contract or commencement of a \n     program, whichever is earlier;\n       (3) ensures that personnel responsible for administering \n     and overseeing EVM systems have the training and \n     qualifications needed to perform this function; and\n       (4) has appropriate mechanisms in place to ensure that \n     contractors establish and use approved EVM systems.\n       (b) Enforcement Mechanisms.--For the purposes of subsection \n     (a)(4), mechanisms to ensure that contractors establish and \n     use approved EVM systems shall include--\n       (1) consideration of the quality of the contractors' EVM \n     systems and the timeliness of the contractors' EVM reporting \n     in any past performance evaluation for a contract that \n     includes an EVM requirement; and\n       (2) increased government oversight of the cost, schedule, \n     scope, and performance of contractors that do not have \n     approved EVM systems in place.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this amendment, which I am offering along \nwith my distinguished colleague, Senator McCaskill, who has brought \ngreat auditing skills to this body, would help to ensure that the \nDepartment is supplying certain critical principles consistently and \nreliably to all projects that use a specific management tool that is \nknown as EVM, earned value management. The Department currently \nrequires EVM tracking for all contracts that exceed $20 million. This \nprovides important visibility into the scope, schedule, and cost in a \nsingle integrated system. When properly applied, this system can \nprovide an early warning of performance problems. The Government \nAccountability Office has observed, however, that contractor reporting \non EVM often lacks consistency, leading to inaccurate data and faulty \napplication of this metric. In other words, this is a garbage-in/\ngarbage-out problem that we need to correct.\n  To address this challenge, our amendment would provide enforcement \nmechanisms to ensure that contractors establish and use approved EVM \nsystems, and we would require the Department of Defense to consider the \nquality of the contractor's EVM systems and reporting in the past \nperformance evaluation for a contract. When a contractor is bidding, \nthe contracting official looks at any past performance. With improved \ndata quality, both the Government and the contractor will be able to \nimprove program oversight, leading to better acquisition outcomes.\n  This is so important. Some of the provisions that are particularly \nimportant in the Levin-McCain bill would increase transparency and \noversight so that if an acquisition process is going in the wrong \ndirection, we know about it and are able to take action. We are able to \ndecide whether the Nunn-McCurdy breaches, for example, warrant halting \nthe project. We are improving the cost estimate system for weapons \nacquisition projects. We have a lot of reforms. This would increase our \ntransparency, our ability to flag problems.\n  I believe this amendment Senator McCaskill and I offer would help to \nstrengthen the Department's acquisition planning, increase and improve \nprogram oversight, and help to prevent contracting waste, fraud, and \nmismanagement.\n  Let me end my comments by reminding all of us why this bill and our \namendment are so important.\n  Ultimately, these procurement reforms will help ensure that our brave \nmen and women in uniform--our military personnel--have the equipment \nthey need when they need it, that it performs as promised, and that our \ntax dollars are not wasted on programs that are doomed to fail.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, before the Senator from Maine leaves the \nfloor, let me congratulate her on this amendment. She has put her \nfinger on a very significant point. There is a weakness in this system \nof contract oversight that the Department of Defense has not \nsatisfactorily addressed.\n  As frequently happens, the Senator from Maine is willing to take on \nissues which are not necessarily the most glamorous and do not \nnecessarily get the headlines but really get to the inside of what \nneeds to be delved into, needs to be looked at, needs to be analyzed, \nand needs to be addressed.\n  This is an amendment which will require the Department of Defense to \nuse a management tool which is called earned value management. They \nacknowledge it is an important tool, but they also acknowledge too \noften contractors are not using it and that Government officials who \nare responsible for overseeing this system and this management tool are \ninadequately trained, not qualified. There are inadequate mechanisms to \nenforce contractor compliance.\n  So the Senator from Maine, as she so often does, has put her finger \non a critical issue and is willing to tackle it and make it \nunderstandable for the rest of us. I commend her and Senator McCaskill \nfor this amendment, and we are delighted to support it.\n\n[[Page S5217]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his thoughtful \ncomments and for working with us on this amendment. I hope at the \nappropriate time it can be adopted. I believe it is acceptable to \nSenator McCain. But I am unclear whether there is further clearance \nthat needs to be done.\n  But, again, while the Senator is on the floor, I want to once again \npraise Senator Levin and Senator McCain for tackling this critical \nissue. It is complex. And it is important that the reforms make a \ndifference to our military--to those who need these weapon systems, who \nneed the material and the supplies that the contracting is procuring. \nIt is also important that taxpayers be protected. There have been far \ntoo many cost overruns and schedule delays that hurt those who are on \nthe front lines, quite literally.\n  I praise and thank the chairman again for his leadership in this \narea.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am informed that the amendment I have \noffered with Senator McCaskill, which is the pending amendment, No. \n1045, has been cleared on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we very strongly support the amendment and \nhope it will be acted upon immediately.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1045) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President. And I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to speak about a \ncouple of issues that relate to the Department of Defense and to \ndefense issues, but I want to especially today talk about the work that \nhas been done by my colleague, Senator Levin, and my colleague from \nArizona. The work they have done on procurement reform is very \nimportant.\n  I listened to some of the presentations earlier today by Senator \nLevin and Senator McCain about the overruns in various weapons \nprograms, the cost overruns, and the significant dislocations with \nrespect to decisions that have been made or not made with certain \nweapons programs.\n  I think there is real need for reform, and the bill they have brought \nto the floor of the Senate is a great service to the American taxpayer. \nI think it is also a great service to our defense structure. We have \nlimited funds. We have to use them effectively. We have to fund weapons \nprograms that are essential to the defense strength of this country. \nThat is what both of my colleagues are saying. And they are saying, \nwhen we have a program that has outlived its usefulness, a program that \nhas cost overruns that never stop and seem completely out of control, \nwe have to address that and deal with it and respond to it.\n  So we have been going through a long period here of unbelievable cost \noverruns in some programs without much notice and without much action \nattending to it. I think my two colleagues are doing a great service. I \nhope, as I know the chairman does, we will be able to move quickly to \naddress this legislation, perhaps without even amendments, and go \nforward and get it through the Senate. We will have done, I think, a \ngreat service to strengthen our defense capability and protect the \nAmerican taxpayer at the same time.\n\n\n                          Defense Duplication\n\n  Mr. President, I want to raise an issue that does not directly relate \nto this bill but relates to all the considerations of this bill because \nit is a follow-on and one I think we will deal with in the next bill, \ndefense authorization. That bill will also be chaired on the floor of \nthe Senate by my colleague, Senator Levin. It deals with the issue of \nduplication.\n\n  In addition to contract and procurement reform--in this case \nprocurement reform--the issue of duplication of our services at the \nDepartment of Defense is a very important issue. Every service wants to \ndo everything. That is just the way it is. I wish to give an example of \nsomething I have been working on, so far unsuccessfully, but I am going \nto raise it and push it during Defense authorization because it relates \nto the very same things that my colleagues have talked about today.\n  These are pictures of unmanned aerial vehicles; UAVs they are called. \nIt is sort of the new way to fly, particularly over a battlefield for \nreconnaissance purposes and so on. Many of us are familiar with what is \ncalled the Predator B, which the Air Force refers to as the Reaper. \nThat is this airplane. The Predator B is used extensively and has been \nused extensively in the war theater in Afghanistan and in Iraq and in \nthat region. It is an unmanned aerial vehicle, unmanned aerial aircraft \nwithout a pilot. The pilot sits on the ground someplace in a little \nthing that looks almost like a trailer house, and they are flying this \naircraft. In some cases, the pilot is 6,000, 8,000 miles away from \nwhere the aircraft is, flying it at a duty station perhaps at a \nNational Guard base or somewhere else.\n  But, anyway, the Air Force has what is called the Predator. That is \nbuilt by General Atomics, and it is a worthwhile program that has \nprovided great service to us and to our country in terms of our defense \ncapability.\n  This, by the way, is called the Sky Warrior. This is the Reaper. It \nis owned by the Air Force. This is the Sky Warrior. That is the U.S. \nArmy.\n  Why does it look alike? Well, it is because it is made by the same \ncompany. It is made to different specifications because the Army wants \na slightly different vehicle, but the Air Force has the Predator B, and \nthe Army has the Sky Warrior.\n  Why does the Army have a Sky Warrior? Well, because they want to run \ntheir own reconnaissance. So what we have in these circumstances is, \nthe Army, in the next 5 years, wants to spend $800 million to buy more \nthan 100 of the Sky Warriors, and eventually they want to have 500 Sky \nWarriors. The Air Force wants to spend $1.5 billion to buy 150 more \nPredators, Predator Bs.\n  Here is what the Predator B and the Sky Warrior look like. As you can \nsee, they are nearly identical. Both carry intelligence, surveillance, \nand reconnaissance sensors so they can find and track targets on the \nground. Both can fire missiles so they can hit a target they might \nfind, both can fly over 25,000 feet high for more than 30 hours which \ngives them range and endurance, but it seems to me a complete \nduplication of effort.\n  We are not talking about just the UAV mission itself; we are talking \nabout the duplication of acquisition programs--engineering, \ncontracting. I don't understand it.\n  For years, the Air Force used U-2s, F-15s, F-16s, even B-52s from \ntime to time to provide surveillance, intelligence, reconnaissance, and \nclose air support for the Army. They used manned aircraft to provide \nall of those services for the U.S. Army. It is not clear why that ought \nto be different just because we are using unmanned aircraft.\n  The Army says they plan to assign each set of 12 Sky Warriors to a \nspecific combat unit. Of course, since most combat units in the Army \nare at their home base at any given time, most Sky Warriors will be \nbased in the United States or perhaps Europe at any given time. The Air \nForce has a different approach. They have a streamlined operation \nconcept. They have been working nearly 8 years in almost constant \ncombat operations, and almost every single\n\n[[Page S5218]]\n\nAir Force Predator is at this point in the Central Command of \nOperations--CENTCOM.\n  It seems to me the services ought to do what they do best. What the \nArmy does best is fight a war on the ground. What the Air Force does \nbest is to provide timely intelligence, surveillance, and \nreconnaissance for the troops on the ground and to attack ground \ntargets from the air. That is what each does best.\n  However, the Army wants to do exactly what the Air Force does and \nhave a separate acquisition program to do so.\n  So we ought to be asking the question: Does this make sense to send \nthousands of airmen to Iraq and Afghanistan to be truck drivers in Army \nconvoys while the Army plans to have thousands of troops operating \nunmanned aircraft? Yes, that is happening. Putting all of our large \nUAVs under the Air Force will result, in my judgment, in streamlined \nand more efficient acquisition of UAVs and allow the Army to \nconcentrate its manpower on Army tasks.\n  Let me be clear. There are some surveillance--at low-altitude, over-\nthe-battlefield surveillance with unmanned aircraft--that are just fine \nat 500 feet, 1,000 feet with various kinds of unmanned devices. I \nunderstand why the Army would want to operate that, and should. \nHowever, I don't understand the Army flying at 25,000 or 30,000 feet, a \nduplicate mission for which the Air Force exists.\n  So given the budget problems we face, with nondiscretionary and \ndiscretionary spending, we can't afford duplication of effort.\n  A few years ago, the Air Force proposed that it be designated as the \nexecutive agent for all medium- and high-altitude unmanned aerial \nvehicles. That made sense to me. The Air Force is the logical choice. \nThey already have the infrastructure to deliver that combat power.\n  In 2007, by the way, the Pentagon's Joint Requirements Oversight \nCouncil endorsed that proposal, but the proposal didn't go anywhere \nbecause of intense opposition from the Army and those who support the \nArmy in this Congress.\n  I don't think this should be an intramural debate between supporting \nthe Army and supporting the Air Force. I support both. I want the Army \nto be equipped in an unbelievably important way to do its mission, and \nI want the Air Force to be similarly equipped. I just don't want the \ntaxpayer to be paying for duplication of effort, and I don't want every \nservice to believe it should do everything because that clearly is a \nduplication of effort.\n  The legislation that is before us today is about procurement reform, \nprocurement reform itself. It does not address this specific issue of \nduplication, but this issue is certainly the second cousin to it. We \nwill be discussing this when we get to the Defense authorization bill, \nand that, too, is a very important part of how we can strengthen our \ndefense; how do we make certain the taxpayers are getting their money's \nworth; and how do we make certain the men and women who serve in \ndefense of this country are equipped to do what they do best.\n  I raise this issue of duplication because I think it is so important \nthat we find a way to begin to unravel the unmistakable duplication \nthat exists in so many areas within the Pentagon. This is one that \nshould be self-evident to virtually everyone.\n  I wish to mention as well today the issue that will also come up in \nDefense authorization that is the first or second cousin to procurement \nreform, and that is contracting reform. I know my colleague from \nMichigan and my colleague from Arizona are very concerned about this as \nwell, and I look forward to working with them on the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  A couple of points about contract reform: I have held, I believe, 18 \nhearings in the Democratic Policy Committee that I chair on contracting \nissues over a good number of years now. I wish to show a couple of \nphotographs that describe some of the unbelievable circumstances that \nhave existed and that we must take steps to correct, and I know my \ncolleagues, the chairman and ranking member, are already doing so.\n  This, by the way, deals with contracting. I understand during wartime \nthere are going to be contracts sometimes that are let without a lot of \nscrutiny and somebody is going to make a lot of money, or perhaps \nsomebody doesn't quite measure up, but this is different. I think we \nhave seen some of the greatest waste, fraud, and abuse in the history \nof this country in contracting.\n  This is a picture of a couple million dollars wrapped in Saran wrap, \na couple of million dollars in cash. Franklin Willis is the guy with \nthe white shirt. He is holding one of these. This happens to be in a \npalace in Iraq, one of Saddam's palaces. I assume the chairman of the \ncommittee has been in one of Saddam's palaces. I have been in one of \nSaddam's palaces in Baghdad. So we took over all of those palaces for \nheadquarters, or a good many of them. This happens to be a couple of \nmillion dollars in cash put on a table because the contractor was \ncoming to pick up the cash. Franklin Willis--a very respected guy, by \nthe way, who went over from the Federal Government to work on these \nissues and testified in one of my hearings--said the word was to \ncontractors: Bring a bag because we pay cash.\n\n  We were contracting for everything in Iraq. Just all kinds--they had \nover 130,000 contractors, I believe, at one point. So the company who \nwas going to pick up this cash, by the way, was later indicted in \ncriminal court. But Franklin Willis was showing us how reimbursements \nwere made in Iraq. This is bills wrapped in Saran wrap. He would say \nfrom time to time he would see people playing football catch with 100-\ndollar bills wrapped in Saran wrap waiting for the contractors to bring \na bag, to pick up a couple million dollars on this day.\n  It is not an isolated problem that the contractor that was going to \nshow up to pick up this money was later convicted--indicted and \nconvicted--in a U.S. court for stealing millions of taxpayers' dollars. \nFranklin Willis said it was just like the old Wild West. That is what \nhe said to us: It was like the Wild West. Bring a bag. We have cash.\n  So during this period of time, in Baghdad, as they began to try to \nset up a provisional government--which was the U.S. Government trying \nto set up a government, and we sent Ambassador Bremer over to set up a \ngovernment--during that time, we know that pallets of cash were shipped \nto Iraq. This cash left the Federal Reserve Bank in New York. This \npallet, each pallet, contains 640 bundles of 1,000-dollar bills and \nweighs 1,500 pounds. They sent 484 of these pallets to Iraq on C-130s. \nThat is more than 363 tons of cash that was sent to Iraq in C-130s, \ntotaling $12 billion. Think of that: $12 billion with reports of \ndistributing cash onto the back of pickup trucks. Do you wonder why we \nwere stolen blind?\n  A woman who has had a substantial amount of experience who has never \ngotten her due, but one of the most courageous women I have met in \nWashington, DC, Bunny Greenhouse, and for her testimony and for her \ncourage she lost her job. Here is what she said. She was the former \nchief contracting officer at the Corps of Engineers. She was the top \ncivilian working for the Army Corps of Engineers, and she was in the \nroom when the logcap project was negotiated.\n  Let me describe to you what she said. This is the top civilian \nofficial in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. She had 25 years of great \nservice to our country with two masters degrees, unbelievable \nqualifications, and performance appraisals that said she was \noutstanding every single time--until she spoke publicly.\n  Here is what she said:\n\n       I can unequivocally state that the abuse related to the \n     contracts awarded to Kellogg, Brown & Root--\n\n  A subsidiary of Halliburton--\n\n     represents the most blatant and improper contract abuse I \n     have witnessed during the course of my professional career.\n\n  For that, this woman was demoted and lost her job; for the courage to \nspeak out, she lost her job. Pretty unbelievable. This is an \nextraordinary woman.\n  We have seen from all of these circumstances unbelievable waste in \ncontracting. It is not just--it is what Bunnatine Greenhouse said, the \nway the contracts were negotiated. She said they were illegal and so \non.\n  Let me give an example, and I could give 100 examples. This shows $40 \nmillion spent on a prison in Iraq they\n\n[[Page S5219]]\n\ncalled the whale. This is when most of the money had already been \nspent. You can see there is virtually nothing done. The Parsons \nCorporation got that money. This now sits empty, never having been \nused. A top floor was never finished. The U.S. Government says: Well, \nwe gave it to the Iraqis.\n  The Iraqi Government says: Are you kidding me? We wouldn't take that \nin a million years. We don't want the prison. We would not use the \nprison. It was never given to us.\n  So $40 million was spent of the taxpayers' money. Procurement reform \nand contractor reform are all related. I don't want to come and provide \na message that steps in any way on anything that the chairman is doing \non procurement reform because that is critically important.\n  We have to follow it with its first cousin, contract reform. The \nstories are so legend. In this photo is a young man who was killed. He \nwas a Ranger and a Green Beret. He was electrocuted while taking a \nshower. This is his mother Cheryl. He was electrocuted because KBR got \nthe contract for wiring facilities in Iraq and didn't do a good job. He \nwas killed in a shower. Another man was power washing a Jeep or humvee \nand got electrocuted. The Army said: We think he took a radio or an \nelectrical device into the shower. But he didn't.\n  It is not just this, but it is providing water to military bases that \nwas more contaminated than the Euphrates River.\n  I will be on the floor when we come to defense authorization with a \ngood number of amendments on contracting reform because we have to put \na stop to this. It has gone on way too long.\n  Let me finish by coming back to where I started, and that is the \nissue of procurement reform. Our colleagues on the Defense \nAuthorization Committee are trying to deal with virtually unlimited \nwants and resources. That is not new. We understand the problems that \ncreates. So they have decided they have to put together procurement \nreform legislation. It is so important to this country to get this done \nand to get it right. Procurement reform is essential. It is the \nfoundation of fixing the problems that exist with respect to these \nmajor weapons programs.\n  Then, I hope we can segue into contracting reform and the issues of \nduplication, on which I wish to work with the chairman and ranking \nmember. I thank Senators Levin and McCain for their leadership. I \nrequested that I be made a cosponsor of the procurement reform \nlegislation. I look forward to visiting and working with them on \namendments on contracting reform in the coming month or two, when we \nget to the defense authorization.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me very quickly thank Senator Dorgan \nfor his extraordinary commitment to the issues he has outlined. I don't \nknow of anybody in this body who has devoted anywhere near the time he \nhas to these issues. He has a passion second to none, and I commend him \nfor it. We look forward to working with him on amendments on the \nauthorization bill, and we also more than welcome his cosponsorship of \nthe pending bill. I thank him for the effort he made.\n  I assume all the materials he has produced will go to the Commission \non Contracting Reform, which has been created on wartime contracting. \nThat will probably give us an opportunity, with the power they have, to \ntake some concrete steps. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, my amendment was one of the eight\n\n[[Page S5221]]\n\namendments agreed to. I will be brief. I wish to get on record as to \nwhat it is I am trying to do.\n  First of all, though, I think my name may be on there as a cosponsor; \nif not, I ask unanimous consent that I be added at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, section 2094 of the bill requires the \nSecretary to submit written certification if a program is not \nterminated that states the acquisition program is essential to the \nnational security, that no alternatives meet the joint military \nrequirement, the new estimates are reasonable, and the management \nstructure is adequate to manage and control the program acquisition \ncost. I concur with the certification process, but no similar \nrequirement is there for the termination of an acquisition program. \nThat is an area in which oversight is required and information critical \nas we continue to improve the acquisition process, which I believe this \nlegislation will do.\n  My amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a written \nreport explaining the reasons for terminating the program, alternatives \nconsidered to address any problems in the program, and the course of \naction the Department of Defense plans to pursue to meet continuing \njoint military requirements intended to be met by the program being \ncanceled. This report will provide Congress with historical \ndocumentation of the terminated or failed programs and why they are \nterminated.\n  Essentially, the language of the amendment is simply the requirement \nthat if a program is terminated, submit to Congress a written report \nsetting forth three things: One, an explanation of the reason for \nterminating the program; two, the alternatives considered to address \nany problems in the program; three, the course the Department plans to \npursue to meet any continuing joint military requirements otherwise \nintended to be met by the program.\n  In other words, it makes the same requirement on terminated programs \nas others. This has already been adopted en bloc, and I have no motion \nto make.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Amendments Nos. 1049, 1050, and 1051\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I rise to thank Chairman Levin and \nRanking Member McCain on a good bill to address a serious and expensive \nproblem in our military. We have costs that have ballooned. As Senator \nLevin explained earlier today, in 2008 alone the portfolio of DOD's 97 \nmajor defense acquisition programs was nearly $300 billion over cost \nand the average delay in terms of delivering these capabilities to the \nwarfighter was 22 months. That is unacceptable to our warfighters and \nunacceptable to taxpayers.\n  There are obviously many examples of these systems that have been \nunderestimated both on time of delivery and costs, but a good one is \nthe Joint Strike Fighter. Right now, the JSF continues to rely on \nimmature technologies and unrealistic cost schedules. We have a \nsituation where DOD might actually procure these aircraft, these F-35s, \ncosting $57 billion, before we have even completed the developmental \nflight testing. That is just one, but it is a very good example of a \nprogram that is underperforming for the warfighter and for the \ntaxpayer.\n  There are three amendments that have been added to this bill at my \nrequest, and I thank the Armed Services staff and particularly Senator \nLevin and Senator McCain for accepting these three amendments. I would \nlike to briefly explain the three amendments we have added.\n  The first is one that will provide some more teeth in a very critical \narea that is of huge importance in this process; that is, tightening up \nthe process and procedures at JROC.\n  JROC is the military's Joint Requirements Oversight Council. Now, \nthat sounds pretty good. JROC sounds like a place where you are going \nto get oversight. But unfortunately, invariably, JROC has become a \nplace where one branch of the military gets what it wants, and in \nreturn the other branch of the military gets what it wants, and in \nreturn the other branch of the military gets what it wants. It has been \nkind of a murky process. Based on hearings we have had and testimony \nand questions I have asked, it is clear to me that JROC has not been \nproviding a lot of oversight--maybe a little too much back-scratching \nand not enough oversight. So two of these amendments are to deal with \nthe JROC situation and hopefully improve it.\n  One is going to bring more input from combatant commands to the JROC \nprocess. The warfighter's perspective is very important, as this \ncouncil makes decisions about requirements on systems the U.S. taxpayer \nis going to purchase. It is very important that the warfighters have \ninput because they are the end user. Maybe what they are saying in that \nroom is what is needed or it turns out that maybe it is not what is \nneeded. We have had examples of where we have failed our warfighters in \nnot anticipating what the needs actually are on the ground. The Iraq \nwar is full of examples where we underestimated what we needed in some \nregards and overestimated what we needed in others. The warfighter \nbeing in the process is very important.\n  The other amendment that deals with the JROC--the Joint Requirements \nOversight Council--is bringing another voice to this process. The Under \nSecretary of Defense for Acquisitions, Technology and Logistics will \nnow be required to concur on the JROC requirements with an eye toward \ncost, utility, and policy considerations. So we have now added a \nreferee of sorts--another voice. So it isn't just going to be about the \nAir Force or the Navy or the Army keeping each other happy but, rather, \nsomeone in a responsible position to look and concur that what they are \ndoing is in the best interest of cost, utility, and overall policy \nconsiderations.\n  That critical layer of the Under Secretary of Defense for \nAcquisitions, Technology and Logistics will also bring into the process \nthe Secretary of Defense, if necessary, because if there is not an \nagreement, then the Secretary of Defense will have to come in and \nprovide that ultimate decisionmaking with an eye toward cost, utility, \nand policy. This will allow the kind of leadership from the top to make \nsure these decisions are in the best interests of all of the military \nas opposed to everybody getting what they want.\n  The final amendment that has been accepted that I believe will help \nis a little bit of looking over the shoulder on cost waivers. We have \nput into this bill a number of situations where certain safeguards can \nbe waived if they are going to be too expensive. The best example is \nthe prototype. There is going to be no need for them to do a \ncompetitive prototype if they decide they need to waive that \nrequirement based on the cost of producing that prototype. I don't \ndisagree that there may be some circumstances where costs are going to \nbe too high to do a prototype, but what I want to make sure is that we \ndon't abuse the cost waiver. In order to avoid abusing the cost waiver, \nwe need an auditor looking over their shoulders. So this amendment \nmandates the reporting of cost waivers to GAO--the Government \nAccountability Office, the overall auditor in the Federal Government--\nand it requires the GAO to provide a written review to the Senate Armed \nServices Committee and the House Armed Services Committee within 60 \ndays of the receipt of that waiver. This will allow the GAO to look \nover the shoulder and make sure the cost waiver is one based on \nreliable, objective, and reasonable information. I don't think it is \ngoing to be necessary for GAO to do a lot of these analyses if the \nmilitary knows that it can. Sometimes, just knowing somebody is looking \nover your shoulder brings about better behavior. That is the goal of \nthis amendment, to make sure we don't abuse cost waivers because this \nbill is not going to do a lot of good if the military has the \nopportunity to drive in, around, and through it without appropriate \noversight.\n  So I believe these amendments improve the bill. They are going to be \nhelpful as we try to get a handle on the acquisition process.\n\n[[Page S5222]]\n\n  I will continue to work with the chairman and the ranking member in \nany way I can, particularly on the Subcommittee on Contracting \nOversight, which I chair, which is now part of the Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committee. We on that subcommittee are going \nto continue to look at contracting in DOD, particularly keeping an eye \nnot just on the weapons acquisition but the acquisition of services at \nDOD. That has also has been a huge growth industry as we have entered \ninto contracting for support services such as never before in the \nAmerican military, with, frankly, boxes and boxes of examples of waste, \nabuse, and fraud.\n  So I am pleased this bill is moving as quickly as it has, and I am \nparticularly pleased there has been such a bipartisan effort in this \nbody. It is refreshing when we can all come together and do the right \nthing, as we are doing on this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support \nof an amendment to this important bill, offered by my colleague Senator \nMcCaskill. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment, which adds \nto good language in the bill requiring competitive prototyping. At its \nheart, this amendment is about our government wisely using taxpayer \ndollars.\n  Last year, the U.S. Department of Defense announced a new policy that \nDOD development programs in their early stages must involve at least \ntwo prototypes--to be developed by competing industry teams--before DOD \ncan move forward into the system design and development phase, the \nlongest and costliest part of the process.\n  The idea behind this policy makes sense: Technologies should be \nproven before contracts are awarded. Paper proposals alone do not \nalways provide sufficient information on technical risk and cost \nestimates. But an investment in prototyping up-front can result in \ngreater knowledge up-front, which in turn can lead to better cost and \nschedule assessments.\n  It seems to me that DOD had the right idea to resurrect competitive \nprototyping. The sponsors of this bill--Senators Levin and McCain--\nagreed. The bill we are considering today would codify DOD's policy.\n  The bill would also authorize a waiver for competitive prototyping in \nthe event of excessive cost. This was a change we made in the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, on which I sit. This change reflects DOD's \nconcerns that it can sometimes be cost prohibitive to produce two or \nmore prototypes of a system.\n  One of the goals of competitive prototyping is to try to reduce \ncosts, not increase them. So I believe DOD should have authority to \nwaive this requirement when producing two or more prototypes of a \nsystem would be cost prohibitive. However, we should ensure that this \nwaiver authority is not abused, or casually used as a way to avoid \nprototyping.\n  So I support this amendment offered by my colleague today, which will \nadd a layer of fiscal oversight to the sole-source nature of \nprototyping that can result from these waivers. It would require DOD to \nreport cost waivers both to the Government Accountability Office and to \ncongressional defense committees and require GAO to provide a written \nreview to the congressional defense committees. This amendment is about \ngood government, and I would hope that my colleagues in both parties \nwould support it.\n  I want to close by addressing the larger issue we are considering \ntoday--acquisition reform. As a member of the Armed Services Committee \nand as a taxpayer, this issue concerns me greatly. There seems to be \nuniversal agreement that reform is necessary. The GAO reported this \nyear that DOD's major defense acquisition programs are nearly $300 \nbillion over budget. At a time of economic crisis and uncertainty, we \nneed to work much harder to get these costs under control.\n  But DOD's acquisition system is complex and there is no shortage of \nideas on how to fix it. I am a cosponsor of this bill because I believe \nit takes important steps in the right direction. It does not try to fix \nthe whole system, but instead focuses mainly on the early phases of the \nacquisition process, which can often start with ``inadequate \nfoundations.'' As Chairman Levin stated in our committee, the ``bill is \ndesigned to help put major defense acquisition programs on a sound \nfooting from the outset.'' I believe this bill will do that. I commend \nthe authors of this bill for their important work and for building \nbipartisan support for this bill.\n  I urge support of this bill and of the McCaskill amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me thank Senator McCaskill for her \ngreat work on the amendments she has just described. These are \nsignificant amendments, important amendments. They reflect the kind of \ndogged determination the good Senator from Missouri shows every day.\n  These amendments are so important to the procurement process.\n  I thank Senator McCaskill for her three amendments, which have \nstrengthened the bill by, No. 1, reinforcing requirements to make \ntrade-offs between cost, schedule, and performance, by directing the \nUnder Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics to \nreview requirements and ensure that such trade-offs have been made; No. \n2, enhancing the role of combatant commanders in developing \nrequirements by spelling out issues on which their input should be \nsolicited and considered; and No. 3, reinforcing competitive \nprototyping requirements in the bill by requiring a GAO review and \nassessment of any waiver on the requirement on the basis of excessive \ncost.\n  These amendments improve the bill and reflect Senator McCaskill's \nconsistent dedication to acquisition reform in the best interests of \nthe taxpayers.\n  I commend the Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I also would express my appreciation to \nthe Senator from Missouri for her hard work, not only on this amendment \nbut on the committee. I thank her and I think it has improved the \nlegislation.\n  In consultation, I think the chairman is going to talk about what we \nintend to do. I understand there are a couple of amendments that may \nrequire recorded votes, but we really need to have all amendments in so \nwe can wrap up this legislation either tonight or tomorrow, depending \non the wishes of the respective leaders.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona. What we \nare trying to do is see if we can't limit amendments. We think we know \nthe amendments that are still out there, but we need people who want to \npursue amendments to let us know that and give us an opportunity to \nlook at them, to discuss the amendments with folks.\n  I have not had an opportunity to talk with the majority leader about \nwhether there will be an opportunity to have votes tonight if we can't \nwork out amendments, but I better not say anything until I have that \nopportunity to check it out with the majority leader. I know Senator \nChambliss is here to be recognized.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 1053 and 1054\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to call up two amendments that \nhave been filed at the desk, No. 1053 and No. 1054. I want to start by \nrecognizing the great work Senators Levin and McCain have done on this \nissue. I have been extremely concerned about the acquisition process at \nthe Department of Defense for years--during my House years as well as \nmy Senate years. There have been no two greater champions on the issue \nthan Senators Levin and McCain.\n  They put together a piece of legislation that I think really does \nmove us down the road in the right direction. We are dealing with less \nmoney in the defense budget than we have ever had. Yet the needs are \ngreater. So I commend them for the great work they have done.\n  One of the amendments I am going to talk about has already been \naccepted. I am very appreciative of their support of that amendment.\n  Both of these amendments relate to the organizational conflict of \ninterest--OCI--area of the bill.\n  The first amendment, No. 1053, deals with the ways in which \ncontractors\n\n[[Page S5223]]\n\nthat have affiliates that provide systems engineering and technical \nassistance, or ``SETA'' services, must organize their SETA affiliates \nin order to mitigate conflict of interest.\n  In relation to large contractors having affiliates that perform SETA \nfunctions, this amendment would allow for a closer modeling of the \narrangements that large U.S. companies that are foreign-owned or \ncontrolled currently have for their defense-related operations in order \nto protect classified information.\n  One aspect of these arrangements relates to how the corporate board \nfor the U.S. company, or SETA affiliate in this case, is organized.\n  One model is ``proxy board'' which cannot communicate in any way with \nthe parent company and prohibits any board member for the affiliate \nfrom serving on the board of or having other responsibilities within \nthe parent company.\n  The proxy board model requires all outside board members and removes \nall prerogatives of ownership for the parent company. It does not allow \nthe parent company to exercise any management control or oversight over \nthe separate entity and, as such, is a huge liability for the parent \ncompany. As such, it is not an attractive model in many cases.\n  The other approach is a ``special security agreement'' which is what \nBAE, Rolls Royce, and other large defense contractors who have a \nreputation for responsibility and trustworthiness use for their U.S. \naffiliates. This approach requires some board members to be totally \nindependent of the parent company but also permits some communication \nbetween the board of the affiliate and the parent company.\n  This model allows for regulated discussions between the affiliate and \nthe parent and protects sensitive--versus routine--information from \nbeing shared.\n  This model has other aspects to it that provide for independence and \nsecurity, and it makes sense and is less onerous for the parent \ncompany.\n  My amendment specifies that the arrangements between large \ncontractors and their SETA affiliates should be similar to the \n``special security agreement'' I have discussed above.\n  I am pleased that the managers have agreed to accept the amendment. I \nthank them for that.\n  The second amendment which I have filed, No. 1054, relates to prime \ncontractor ``make-buy'' decisions. These decisions relate to which \naspects of a contract the prime contractor chooses to either make \nthemselves or contract out to another company.\n  The current bill prescribes what I believe to be onerous procedures \nfor regulating the prime contractors' decisions in this regard and \nprovides for ``government oversight of the process by which prime \ncontractors consider such sources'' and authorizes ``program managers \nto disapprove the determination by a prime contractor to conduct \ndevelopment or construction in-house rather than through a \nsubcontract.''\n\n  In my opinion, this is an example of the Government interfering in a \nprivate company's legitimate business decisions and adds little value \nto the process.\n  Current acquisition regulations already provide for oversight of \n``make-buy'' decisions by the Government. The ``Acquisition Reform \nWorking Group'' composed of industry associations has strong language \nin their recent report on this bill opposing further Government \nintervention in ``make-buy'' decisions.\n  Prime contractors are already incentivized through the market to make \nwise choices in this area and are held accountable to the Government \nfor their choices, both through the terms of the contract in question \nand through future competitions for which past performance is always a \nconsideration.\n  My amendment strikes much of the provision in the bill and is \nintended to account for the fact that there are already procedures in \nplace to address this issue. My amendment also attempts to prohibit \nexcessive Government involvement in private sector business decisions.\n  I would like to quote from the Acquisition Reform Working Group's, \nposition paper they issued on this bill in relation to this issue.\n\n       The acquisition regulations already grant the government \n     oversight of contractors' make/buy programs . . . The \n     government has an appropriate oversight role, but that role \n     must be managed to assure that the government is able to hold \n     a contractor accountable for results. If the government is to \n     determine which subcontractors will be part of a major \n     program, the government will necessarily assume \n     responsibility for that choice which will result in a \n     corresponding reduction in the prime contractor 's \n     responsibility for the program.\n       Make-buy decisions are critical to program success. The \n     prime contractor must consider the selection of a major \n     subcontractor much as the government considers the selection \n     of the prime contractor in the source selection process. The \n     selection of the major subcontractors is made early in the \n     proposal process . . . To have the government substitute an \n     agency decision concerning these selections after award would \n     likely put the prime contractor's performance against the \n     contract awarded base-line at risk. Any additional emphasis \n     on the make-buy process should take into account the program \n     risk created by Government direction for contractor source \n     selection decisions.\n       There is a fine balance that must be maintained to hold \n     contractors accountable for performance and results while \n     affording the government an appropriate oversight role. It is \n     unreasonable to expect a contractor to be held accountable \n     for results if the government does not both provide the \n     responsibility and the right incentives for that performance. \n     Better and earlier planning and program management by the \n     Government will mitigate a contractor's performance risks \n     more effectively than taking away a contractor's intellectual \n     property rights, innovation incentives, and accountability. \n     Taking away such rights will also render the Defense market \n     less attractive for new companies, especially commercial \n     companies, with high risk and little chance of reward.\n\n  That is a rather extensive quote from that report by the Acquisition \nReform Working Group, but I thought it was important to rationalize the \nway of thinking related to how we look at this issue. Basically, what \nwe are proposing is, not to change the way the situation works today \nwith respect to make-buy contracts.\n  So if you have a major weapons system contractor that is awarded a \ncontract, and under that contract, let's say for an automobile that \nobviously requires a steering wheel, then the contractor ought to have \nthe ability to decide whether to make that steering wheel themselves or \nwhether to subcontract that steering wheel out to another contractor. \nIf the contractor has a right to make those decisions then the numbers \nthat were contained in their bid are going to reflect that and \naccurately reflect the ultimate price the Government pays. But if the \nGovernment has the right, as the bill says, to step in after the award \nand tell the prime contractor: You are not going to subcontract out, we \nare going to mandate that you make that steering wheel, then I think it \ndoes take away some of the flexibility and the ability on the part of \nthe prime contractor to be able to adhere to the numbers and pricing \nthat their bid contains.\n  This is a situation where, if we think contractors in the defense \ncommunity are taking advantage of the system, the language in the bill \nis the direction in which we ought to go. But there are safeguards in \nevery contract that the Department of Defense awards. I think what we \nneed to do is focus more on making sure contractors are giving us the \nbest possible buy we can get and the best quality of product we can \nget, and not hamstring those contractors who are making these bids. \nThis will allow us to take the most advantage of taxpayer dollars that \nwe have to use in equipping our men and women who wear the uniform of \nthe United States.\n  I understand the committee may have issues with this amendment, but I \nthink it is a good amendment. I urge its adoption.\n  I want to close by saying again that Senator McCain and I have talked \nabout this issue of acquisition reform a number of times during my \nyears in the Senate. There is no stronger advocate for doing what is \nright related to proper expenditure of taxpayer money than Senator \nMcCain. I applaud him and Senator Levin for taking this on, getting in \nthe weeds on it, because the contracts for which the Pentagon solicits \nbids and that they award on a daily basis are extremely complex, they \nare very large in the amount of money they spend, and this type of \nreform is not easy to put together.\n  But I think Senators Levin and McCain have done an excellent job of \ncoming up with what I think is a good product. I think with some of the \namendments that have come forward\n\n[[Page S5224]]\n\ntoday it is going to be an even better product.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let me commend the Senator from \nGeorgia for the amendment which we have adopted, amendment No. 1053, \nthat makes a very useful clarification of the standard for the separate \nbusiness unit definition on this original conflict-of-interest \nprovision we have.\n  I wish to commend my friend from Georgia for doing that, for catching \nthat, and for making that suggested change which we have now adopted in \namendment No. 1053.\n  We would oppose amendment No. 1054, if it were offered, for the \nfollowing reasons: There has been a report from the Defense Science \nBoard Task Force that, because of consolidation in the defense \nindustry, there has been a substantial reduction in innovation and \ncompetition.\n  In order to stimulate that, to make sure the avenues are open for \nsmall business, we have a provision in this bill which basically adopts \nthe approach of the Defense Science Board Task Force and is consistent \nwith the concerns they raise about the lack of competition resulting \nfrom consolidation.\n  But, equally important, we hear from small business owners \nconsistently that they have been excluded by prime contractors from \ncompeting for subcontract work. When they do that, they, of course, are \nreserving the business for themselves, for the prime contractors \nthemselves.\n  As the Senator from Georgia mentions, there is now some oversight. \nBut the problem is, there is no ability to veto, in effect, the \ndecision to keep the work in-house. We would not take over the \ncompetition or the contracting bidding process. But what we do provide \nfor is the veto of a decision to keep work in-house, where we think it \nis anticompetitive or unfair.\n  It is kind of an in-between position. The Defense Science Board \nactually suggested we go further than we have. What we do in this bill \nis say that if a decision is made that the contractor is keeping work \nin-house, which should be put up to competition to allow small \nbusinesses to bid on it, the discretion would be available for the \nDepartment to override that decision.\n  We think that is kind of an appropriate thing to do to protect small \nbusinesses, to protect competition, and to make sure there is \nreasonable oversight of that decision of any prime contractor to keep \nthe work for themselves instead of bidding it out, which, of course, \nwould open it to smaller businesses and greater innovation.\n  So we would oppose this amendment should it be called up. On the \nother hand, we want to, again, commend the Senator from Georgia because \nhe has gotten into issues such as this. While we disagree with him on \nthis one, we do want to note he has been very deeply involved in this \nbill. He has worked with us on this bill, and we greatly appreciate his \nsupport for our bill.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, as has always been the case when our Nation \nattempts to improve its health care system, some people and some groups \ntry to scare Americans into believing it would be better to cling to \nwhat we have than to strive for something better--the same old story, \nthe same old song.\n  Those who are using anti-reform scare tactics are typically people \nwho are doing just fine, thank you, under the current system and, \nfrankly, could not care less about those who are not doing so well, \nalong with industry groups that want to make sure they can keep \nsqueezing as much profit out of the health care system as possible.\n  It is that lust for profits--not a desire to honestly inform the \npublic--that leads industry groups to demonize any reform proposals \nthey themselves did not write.\n  In this case, conservative pundits, who I would guess have excellent \nhealth care coverage for themselves--the people you see on TV, the \nwriters you see in the newspapers, the commentators you hear on the \nradio--conservative pundits, who probably have excellent health \ncoverage for themselves, are trying to convince Americans that the only \nalternative to the status quo is ``socialized medicine.'' And the \nhealth insurance industry is trying to convince Americans that if it \nhas to coexist with a federally backed insurance plan; that is, as an \noption for people, the insurance industry will disappear.\n  The private insurance industry did not disappear when Medicare was \nestablished. The private insurance industry did not disappear when \nMedicaid was established, even though many insurance companies said \nthey would. Why would it disappear when a federally backed option is \ncreated for working-age adults?\n  Improving our health care system is too important a topic to be co-\nopted by inflammatory, unfounded rhetoric--rhetoric about ``socialized \nmedicine,'' rhetoric about ``Medicare for all,'' rhetoric about \n``single-payer systems,'' rhetoric that at the end of the day is \nnothing more than a bunch of hot air coming from a bunch of hotheads.\n  The truth is, Congress is contemplating health care reform that would \nincrease consumer choice--increase consumer choice--by improving access \nto private and public insurance alike.\n  We are not eliminating private plans. We are saying: OK, the private \nplans will be here. They will have rules. The public plan will be here \nas an option--only as an option. It will have the same rules. Let them \ncompete. If the private plans are so good, they will do well. The \npublic plan is there, frankly, to keep the private plans honest so the \nprivate plans do not eliminate people because of community rating, do \nnot eliminate people because they might have a preexisting medical \ncondition.\n  As I said, the truth is, the Congress is contemplating health care \nreforms that would increase consumer choice. There are zero--count \nthem, zero--health care proposals under consideration in this Senate \nthat would eliminate the private insurance system. In fact, every \nsingle one of them embraces and strengthens the private health \ninsurance system.\n  If you have employer-sponsored coverage, the reforms under \nconsideration are designed to help you keep it. So understand, if you \nhave insurance today, you can keep what you have. Under the legislation \nwe will look at, if you want to choose a new insurance plan, you should \nhave the full complement of choices: several private plans and a public \nplan, if you want to choose it. It is simply an option. It makes sense. \nIt is not socialized medicine. It is simply good government. It is good \nhealth care.\n  What we have done in the past simply has not worked. It is time for a \ndifferent approach. It is time for a public option for the American \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1055\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would call up, on behalf of Senator \nBingaman, amendment No. 1055. I understand this has been cleared now. \nIt is a useful clarification of the relationship between the \ndevelopmental testing requirements in the bill and the testing reforms \nthat were enacted 6 years ago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for Mr. Bingaman, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1055.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To clarify the submittal of certifications of the adequacy of \n  budgets by the Director of the Department of Defense Test Resource \n                           Management Center)\n\n       At the end of title I, add the following:\n\n[[Page S5225]]\n\n     SEC. 106. CLARIFICATION OF SUBMITTAL OF CERTIFICATION OF \n                   ADEQUACY OF BUDGETS BY THE DIRECTOR OF THE \n                   DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TEST RESOURCE MANAGEMENT \n                   CENTER.\n\n       Section 196(e)(2) of title 10, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subparagraph (B) as subparagraph (C); \n     and\n       (2) by inserting after subparagraph (A) the following new \n     subparagraph (B):\n       ``(B) If the Director of the Center is not serving \n     concurrently as the Director of Developmental Test and \n     Evaluation under subsection (b)(2) of section 139c of this \n     title, the certification of the Director of the Center under \n     subparagraph (A) shall, notwithstanding subsection (c)(4) of \n     such section, be submitted directly and independently to the \n     Secretary of Defense.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1055) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nbe the only first-degree amendments in order to S. 454, other than the \ncommittee-reported substitute amendment, that the listed first-degree \namendments be subject to second-degree amendments which are relevant to \nthe amendment to which offered; that with respect to any subsequent \nagreement which provides for a limitation of debate regarding an \namendment on the list, then that time be equally divided and controlled \nin the usual form; that if there is a sequence of votes with respect to \nthese amendments, then there be 2 minutes equally divided and \ncontrolled prior to a vote in relation thereto; that upon disposition \nof the listed amendments, the substitute amendment, as amended, be \nagreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time, and the Senate \nproceed to vote on passage of the bill.\n  The amendments I am including in this unanimous consent proposal are \nas follows:\n  The Snowe amendment No. 1056 regarding small business contracting; a \nThune amendment regarding weapons systems; a Coburn amendment regarding \nfinancial management, which we think we may have worked out, by the \nway; the Chambliss amendment No. 1054 regarding ``make buy;'' the \nBingaman amendment, which we have already adopted so I will not refer \nto that; and the Murray amendment No. 1052 regarding national security \nobjectives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair, and I thank my friend from Arizona and \nthe staffs who worked this out. I think these amendments then would be \nconsidered probably tomorrow morning, although I don't know that we \nhave final word on that. We ought to probably doublecheck that with our \nleaders, and I would note the absence of a quorum while we do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there is no question that our country's \ndefense procurement process is broken. At a time when the American \npeople are tightening their personal budgets, making sacrifices, and \nfocusing on essentials, our defense acquisition program continues to \nrun up huge bills.\n  Just this year, the GAO reported that the major defense procurement \nprogram is $296 billion over budget. Not only are they over budget, \nthey are behind schedule. In fact, 95 percent of DOD's largest \nacquisition programs are now an average of 2 years behind schedule. \nEvery extra day, every additional dollar spent on these systems is a \nstep backward for our Nation's other priorities.\n  As we tackle the big challenges by getting our economy back on track \nor our health care system working again for all Americans or \nestablishing a clean energy future, it is time that we focused on \ntrimming the fat in our defense budget.\n  I applaud our Armed Services chairman, Senator Levin, and the ranking \nmember, Senator McCain, for introducing the bold plan that is now \nbefore the Senate, which will bring about reform. Their bill recognizes \nthat making changes to acquisition starts at the beginning of the \nprocess, with the proper testing and the cost calculating and \ndevelopment procedures. It also returns discipline to the process by \nmaking sure the rules limiting cost are enforced. Those and other badly \nneeded steps are going to help reform our system and return Federal \ndollars to meet the challenges we have on the horizon.\n  Mr. President, that should be only the first step because the truth \nis that, while today's debate has been delayed for far too long, there \nis another hard conversation surrounding procurement that we have not \nyet even started, and that is the conversation about the future of the \nmen and women who produce our tanks, our planes, and our boats. The \nskilled workforce our military depends on is a workforce that is \ndisappearing today before our eyes.\n  Our Government depends on our highly skilled industries, our \nmanufacturers, our engineers, our researchers, and our development and \nscience base to keep the U.S. military stocked with the best and most \nadvanced equipment and tools available. Whether it is scientists who \nare designing the next generation of military satellites or engineers \nwho are improving our radar system or machinists who are assembling \nwarplanes, these industries and their workers are one of our greatest \nstrategic assets today. What if those weren't available? What if we \nmade budgetary and policy decisions without talking about the future \nneeds of our domestic workforce? It is not impossible. It is not even \nunthinkable. It is actually what is happening.\n  We need to have a real dialog about the ramifications of these \ndecisions before we lose the capability to provide our military with \nthe tools and equipment they need because once our plants shut down, \nonce our skilled workforce and workers move to other fields, and once \nthat infrastructure is gone, it is not going to be rebuilt overnight if \nwe need it.\n  As a Senator from the State of Washington, representing five major \nmilitary bases and many military contractors, I am very aware of the \nimportant relationship between our military and the producers that keep \nthem protected with the latest technological advances. I have also seen \nthe ramifications of the Pentagon's decisions on communities, workers, \nand families. As many here know, I have been sounding the alarm about a \ndeclining domestic aerospace industry for years.\n  This isn't just about one company or one State or one industry. This \nis about our Nation's economic stability. It is about our skill base. \nIt is about our future military capability. We have watched as the \ndomestic base has shrunk. We have watched as competition has \ndisappeared and as our military has looked overseas for the products \nthat we have the capability to produce right here at home.\n  Many in the Senate have spent a lot of time talking about how many \nAmerican jobs are being shipped overseas in search of cheaper labor. \nBut we haven't focused nearly enough attention on the high-wage, high-\nskilled careers being lost to the realities of our procurement system. \nThat is why, today, I am going to be introducing an amendment that will \nrequire the Pentagon to explain to\n\n[[Page S5226]]\n\nus in Congress and to the American people how their decisions affect \ngood-paying jobs and the long-term strength of our industrial base.\n  My amendment will help to ensure that our industrial base is capable \nof meeting our national security objectives. It took us a very long \ntime to build our industrial base. We have machinists who have past \nexperience and know-how down the ranks for more than 50 years. We have \nengineers who know our mission, know the needs of our soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines. We have a reputation for delivering for \nour military. But once those plants shut down, those industries are \ngone. We not only lose the jobs, but we lose the skills and the \npotential ability to provide our military with the equipment to defend \nour Nation and project our might worldwide. Preserving a healthy \ndomestic base also breeds competition. That is good for innovation and, \nultimately, for our taxpayers.\n  So today, as we begin this very serious and necessary conversation on \nprocurement reform, we cannot afford to forget the needs of our \nindustrial base. We have to consider how we achieve reform while \ncontinuing to support the development of our industrial base here at \nhome.\n  It calls for thoughtful planning and projection about who our future \nenemies might possibly be and how they might possibly try to defeat us \nin this Nation. It is critical that our country and our military \nmaintain a nimble and dynamic base. Once a new threat is identified, a \nsolution has to be close at hand.\n  The discussion we are having on procurement reform in the Senate is \nhappening as our country faces two difficult but not unrelated \nchallenges: winning an international war on terror and rebuilding a \nfaltering economy. It would be irresponsible not to include the needs \nof our industrial base as we move forward because unless we begin to \naddress this issue now, we are not only going to continue to lose some \nof our best paying American jobs, we are going to lose the backbone of \nour military might.\n  I will be offering this amendment, and I would love to have the \nsupport of our colleagues to make sure we have a strong nation in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/06/senate-section/article/S5226-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ACADEMIC EXCHANGE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in early April of 2003, a professor of \nengineering at United Arab Emirates University contacted an American \nprofessor at the Worcester, MA, Polytechnic Institute about spending \nthe summer in Worcester as a visiting professor. By late May his visit \nhad been arranged--he would come for the months of July and August, the \ntime when he was not teaching in the UAE, and they would collaborate on \nresearch on axiomatic design and fractal analysis of manufactured \nsurfaces.\n  On June 7 the UAE professor applied for a nonimmigrant visa for June \n27--August 26. Apart from being called back to the consulate for \nfingerprinting on June 22 and told that he would receive an answer in \nthe next 2 to 3 weeks, he heard nothing in response to his inquiries \nother than a reminder to check his visa application status on the \nembassy Web site. On August 9, with still no sign of his record on the \nWeb site and the beginning of his fall semester approaching, he \ncancelled his plans and stayed at home in the UAE.\n  Without any information about the reason for the delay it is \nimpossible to determine whether it was due to some legitimate concern \nor more likely the result of a bureaucratic logjam. But at a minimum, \nthe professor should have received a response informing him of the \nstatus of his application before June 27. Instead, he and his American \ncolleague were left in the dark to wonder, and had no choice but to \ncancel their research plans which would have been mutually beneficial, \nas well as for their students.\n  This is one incident; however, it is illustrative of the larger \nproblem of foreign scholars and teachers being denied entry into the \nUnited States not because of travel bans, but because of delays and \ninefficiencies in the visa application process, particularly in \ngeographical regions of concern for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  Transnational academic collaboration is, if not politically blind, \npolitically myopic. Diplomats sit across from each other, even when \nmeeting in friendship, to resolve differences. To study, the parties \nsit on the same side of the table and, irrespective of national, \nreligious, ethnic or political backgrounds, focus on what they have in \ncommon. Some fields of study are so universal that they transcend \nlanguage--mathematics does not need a common tongue for collaboration \nto happen.\n  This is in no way meant to disparage diplomacy, which has been and \nwill continue to be the keystone of how governments interact. It \nemphasizes differences because it addresses them--academic \ncollaboration will never negotiate an arms reduction treaty. But \nneither should we be limited by thinking that diplomacy is the only way \nof working towards understanding between two societies.\n  Nor is this type of academic exchange limited to technical or \nscientific work. I am reminded of when, after Robert Frost's visit to \nthe Soviet Union in 1962, Siberian poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko wrote to \nhim ``I have read your poems again and again today, and I am glad you \nlive on Earth.'' I picture Frost and Yevtushenko talking about the \nrural beauties of their homeland, Frost of Ripton, VT and Yevtushenko \nof Stantsiya Zima, Siberia.\n  It is not only relations that we damage and the resentment we create \nby limiting these partnerships. The United States and the world also \nlose the body of scholarship that would have been produced. In no \nacademic discipline is anyone so bold as to suggest that knowledge lies \nonly on one side of a fence or of an ocean.\n  To the foreign scholars who would study and do research here, I would \nsay that in the post-9/11 world our immigration laws and procedures \nhave indeed become more stringent, burdensome and time consuming. But \ndo not interpret that as a sign that you are not welcome or that your \npresence is not desired. To the contrary, it is valuable--indispensable \nto you, to us and to the rest of the world.\n  It is also undeniable that during the Bush administration some of the \nimmigration laws and regulations, enacted in haste to respond to 9/11, \ncrossed the line between keeping a vigilant watch over our borders and \ncreating unnecessary and illogical barriers to entry for those who pose \nno danger. The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of \nState deserve credit for their efforts to keep our borders secure, but \nI also urge them to continually review their policies and procedures to \nmake sure they are keeping out those who need to be kept out, but \nfacilitating the entry of those whose presence we want and need.\n  The case of the UAE professor is, again, one example. But it did not \nonly inconvenience the two professors; such cases can have a \ncompounding, ripple effect as family members, friends and colleagues \nconclude that it is pointless, and potentially humiliating, to apply \nfor a visa to study, teach or conduct academic research in the United \nStates. At a time when we should be doing everything possible to \nrebuild our image abroad, particularly in predominantly Muslim \ncountries, this is not the message we should be sending.\n  As the Departments of Homeland Security, State and Justice continue \nto review their policies they should look closely at these issues. If \nexisting laws regarding who and what constitute legitimate security \nrisks need to be clarified, then the administration should come to \nCongress with a recommendation. If the problem is a lack of staff or \nother resources to process visa applications in a timely manner, we can \nallocate the funds necessary to ensure that legitimate visa applicants \nget the prompt and fair consideration they are due. But whatever the \ncause of the problem, it needs to be fixed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/06/senate-section/article/S5226-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5226-S5228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me\n\n[[Page S5227]]\n\nthrough an address set up specifically for this purpose to the \nCongressional Record. This is not an issue that will be easily \nresolved, but it is one that deserves immediate and serious attention, \nand Idahoans deserve to be heard. Their stories not only detail their \nstruggles to meet everyday expenses, but also have suggestions and \nrecommendations as to what Congress can do now to tackle this problem \nand find solutions that last beyond today. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave today's letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Do not you think it is time to do something about the \n     current price gouging on gasoline, even if it means leaning \n     on the refiners in Utah? The price of oil has dropped about \n     27% off of the high point as of just a few moments ago, and \n     has been hovering around the 23-25% drop for some time now, \n     yet we do not see even a 10% drop in price at the pumps. I \n     know that the retailers have taken advantage of the holiday \n     weekend to make extra money, and hopefully now they will have \n     the heart to drop the prices to levels that are fair.\n       Please move our country forward in domestic drilling so we \n     may be less dependent on foreign oil. It would also help to \n     curtail some of the terrorist activities, as we are funding \n     some of that with each purchase of oil, maybe indirectly but \n     funding just the same. I do not wish to finance terrorism or \n     gold and diamond encrusted planes and autos for some Sheik. I \n     would rather create jobs in America for Americans by \n     utilizing our own resources. Thank you for reading this.\n     Mona.\n                                  ____\n\n       I was employed [by a printing company] in Idaho Falls. I \n     greatly enjoyed my job, and it helped give us the opportunity \n     to purchase our first home in January 2008, which is located \n     in the Ammon, Idaho area. We have been married for 15 years \n     and have been working and saving for the day when we could \n     purchase our first home. This has been my wife's dream to \n     have a home of her own with a small garden. When we purchased \n     this home, the first thing we did after the snow of winter \n     had gone was to erect a 22-foot flag pole in the front yard. \n     You see this has always been my dream to have a home of my \n     own where I could display and show my love for this great \n     country and its beautiful flag. It is also my way of paying \n     respect and saying thank you to the many men and women that \n     have fought to protect the freedoms I have been privileged to \n     enjoy as a citizen of The United States of America.\n       On July 9, 2008, I was laid off from my employment because \n     of slow business due to high-energy cost. One of their main \n     customers is [a meat packing company], which has in the past \n     ordered thousands of labels for their meat packing lines and \n     international markets. I have been searching for other \n     employment, but it is hard if not impossible to find a \n     company or business that has not been affected by the out-of-\n     control gas and energy prices.\n       I am now 55 years old and have worked my whole life to have \n     the so-called American Dream. I know from personal experience \n     what it is like to go hungry or to have no place to lay your \n     head at night or shelter from the cold of a January night. \n     These were very hard times and I do not wish to repeat them. \n     It is upsetting to realize that we could lose it all just \n     because of the greed of a few and the unwillingness of [our \n     leaders] to intervene on behalf of the American people. \n     Instead it is like watching a bunch of kids fighting over a \n     toy in a sandbox, [our elected leaders] need to stop fighting \n     and start working together for the good of the American \n     people. In the Williston oil basin which covers Montana, the \n     Dakotas and Wyoming, there are oil wells that were capped in \n     the 1970s. From studies, this oil could carry the U.S. for \n     the next 100 years or more--that is if we used it to supply \n     only the U.S. and not other nations. So I ask you just what \n     are we waiting for, a rainy day? I find it most interesting \n     that the United States is the greatest super power in the \n     world, but yet we cannot work together in Congress to resolve \n     the issues facing our nation for fear the other political \n     party may take or get credit for it. As an American citizen \n     and taxpayer my message is to forget political lines and \n     yourselves and just go to work together. I, for one, am tired \n     of losing everything we have worked so hard for including our \n     future just because [partisan politics prevent solutions from \n     being found.]\n       I now ask all the members of Congress to work to save this \n     great nation and our economy from total collapse and to \n     restore the United States of America to that grandeur this \n     nation once enjoyed. A house, nation, government, or people, \n     divided against itself cannot stand or long endure. Ladies \n     and Gentlemen of the U.S. Congress, the Constitution of the \n     United States of America and the future of this great nation \n     and its citizens are now in your hands. Please respect the \n     sacred trust you have been given and honor the integrity of \n     the office in which you now stand.\n     Walter.\n                                  ____\n\n       I have been an Idahoan all my life. I would not want to \n     live anywhere else, and I love my state. I saw on the news \n     awhile back about you wanting input on the gas prices and \n     such. Well, I have more than that that concerns me.\n       First, I cannot believe the prices of gas. I use a lot of \n     gas. I am a caregiver and I drive to my work two times a day, \n     five days a week. I have had to borrow money just to get \n     there and back. I should let you know I make an average of \n     $400 a month; my husband makes around $1,200 a month. I \n     receive a mere $6 in food stamps. The DHW say we make too \n     much. We do not make enough to pay all our expenses. We \n     cannot seem to get ahead of anything. I just got a ticket for \n     no insurance. I cannot afford it. What am I to do? I have so \n     many things to pay for. I could burden you with all my \n     problems but I am not going to. Tell me, is there a low-\n     income insurance agency around for people like me? I read \n     about grants, but you have to pay just to get a little \n     information. There are so many families that are in the same \n     situation as I am; we try to do right, but get punished in \n     other ways. We should not have to worry about how to get back \n     and forth to work. How am I going to feed my family? How am I \n     going to pay for everything so I do not lose it! I want to go \n     to school to get my GED so I can become a nurse of some kind. \n     I really want to be a doctor's assistant but I cannot because \n     I have to support my family with what little I make. I cannot \n     afford to lose any hours. I have a lot more I can complain \n     about but it would take me all day. But this sums it up to \n     the shortest degree. Thank you for listening to me.\n     Chrystalynn, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       As crude oil begins to express its omnipresence amongst the \n     consumers of this nation as a relevant component, that has \n     raised a multitude of concern as transportation energy is now \n     being brought forth--even with the expectations of food \n     consumption as mentioned and expressed. As Americans are \n     being brought to maintain and conserve what is left of this \n     planet, transportation energy assumptions are now being \n     presented to becoming a considerable difference when \n     considering crop production rather for the purpose of food or \n     a new found energy material. It seems that we as a consumer \n     nation are stuck at a losing crossroad when the expectation \n     of cost efficiency is approached and considered. Will the \n     current crop land begin to be used for this process as new \n     innovative responses towards transportation energy is \n     expressed amongst this nation of consumers?\n       I do not think that this question has been asked by any \n     consumer as the efforts are being presented to align this \n     nation into a position to have safe and environmental \n     friendly responses to all considerations that may arise as \n     trends and new found provisions are being considered and met.\n       What are the responses expected from bringing forth a \n     theory that fuel for the purpose of energy with the regards \n     of transportation is expressed, what other questions and \n     responses will arise from what seems to be a Third World \n     theory of effective enterprising?\n     Aaron.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for this opportunity to voice my opinion about \n     the rising energy costs. We are seeing the effects of the \n     escalating gas prices in every aspect of our family finances. \n     We feel like the high price of gas has made me more cautious \n     about how we spend money in all areas of our life from \n     groceries, to activities we choose to let our children \n     participate in, vacation, entertainment, and home repair/new \n     home purchases. Our family is thrifty, we look for deals, we \n     are conservative in our spending and we are consistently \n     building our savings, yet we are still seeing a constant and \n     steady increase in prices that are causing us to be \n     concerned.\n       We appreciate your efforts to vote on issues that will \n     lower our energy costs. We support the idea of drilling here \n     in the United States and would like to see that starting so \n     that the benefits of on shore drilling can begin sooner than \n     later. Thank you for representing Idaho well.\n     Bob and Charlynn.\n                                  ____\n\n       As you requested I am responding to your request to itemize \n     some ways that my family and I are adversely affected by the \n     extreme increases in the cost of energy. I live in a rural \n     area of southeast Idaho. We are about fifteen miles south of \n     Idaho Falls. As you accurately mentioned, there is no public \n     transportation available in this area. We are suffering with \n     the cost of gas especially but not just that. We heat our \n     home, and water with propane, and the cost of that has gone \n     through the roof also. The cost of electricity has doubled \n     too. The bottom line is my income is not increasing at the \n     rate the utility costs are increasing. This is becoming a \n     real burden on my family.\n     Dave, Firth.\n                                  ____\n\n       You guys have got it all wrong: the problem is the \n     consumption not the supply. We are not getting out of this \n     mess by drilling for more oil. The only way is to use less \n     oil. We need more hydro electric, solar power, nuclear \n     energy, Stop building coal and gas power plants that only \n     make our air worse. The air is getting so bad we are soon \n     going to have air filtration systems for our homes and for \n     our gas-guzzling cars so we can leave our homes. We will \n     never have cheap gas again, so let us get on with something \n     that makes sense for a change. I am amazed that the people of \n     this country have not [protested], demanding some action. I \n     do think there are enough concerned voters to crush\n\n[[Page S5228]]\n\n     the stalemate in Washington. The biggest problem is no one is \n     listening to any of the experts on our problems. Everyone \n     just blunders ahead whether anything makes sense or not. We \n     are going to keep spending like there is no tomorrow and then \n     turn around and give people tax refunds. Where did we find \n     the math that makes that work? I could go on and on for days, \n     [but it does not appear to make any difference to our \n     political leaders.]\n     Dave.\n                                  ____\n\n       If it is not already in the works, please consider \n     sponsoring a bill to raise the IRS mileage deduction. It is \n     now at 50\\1/2\\ cents/per mile, which is inadequate given the \n     increases in gas, oil, tires, and other related auto \n     products. I am a small business owner in Bonner County, and I \n     travel nearly seven days per week to service clients. Some \n     days I am all over this very large county! Though I usually \n     drive a Honda Civic, even it is becoming expensive to drive. \n     If I raise my prices, I will surely lose some business. Many \n     other business owners are suffering, too.\n     Lexie.\n                                  ____\n\n       First, as for fuel prices. I am sure you have heard most \n     all opinions on how to attempt to solve this issue. I believe \n     there needs to be both short-term and long-range solutions. \n     For the short term, off-shore and North Slope oil drilling \n     needs to be allowed to provide some near-term relief on fuel \n     prices. In addition, new refineries need to be allowed/\n     encouraged in the U.S. as soon as possible. Long term--there \n     needs to be an all-out funding of R to provide renewable \n     energy for both transportation and to sustain our homes. I \n     believe in this great nation we can harness the energy of the \n     sun, etc. to provide unlimited renewable energy.\n       Also another issue close to home is jobs. It is very \n     disturbing the rate at which we are losing jobs to India, \n     etc. due to outsourcing. The corporate environment today is \n     to save a buck at any cost, even sending jobs to under-\n     developed countries. At my place of business, we have seen \n     over the last seven years, many, many technology jobs go out \n     of the country. In addition, just recently, it was announced \n     that many clerical jobs are also to be outsourced. What is \n     happening is that the better-paying jobs are being sent out \n     of the country, and we are left with the lower-paying service \n     industry jobs and are very quickly lowering the American \n     standard of living. Also, this is also happening during tough \n     economic times along with the rising energy costs.\n       It seems that Congress and our countries leadership is more \n     concerned with everyone else around the world except our own \n     citizens. In this area, there needs to be some kind of tax \n     penalty/incentive to keep these jobs here, in America. If \n     there is no economic benefit to outsource, the jobs will come \n     back.\n     Ben, Parma.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thanks for being interested in energy; our family sees the \n     future as pretty bleak. Return to the Carter years, high \n     energy prices, stagflation, no raises, general depression. We \n     have upped our level pay on natural gas, expecting the price \n     to double. We have rearranged our budget, less food and \n     entertainment, etc. Far less travel. But I have to ask [if \n     there are not some of our political leaders who want the U.S. \n     economy to slow down. They view this as a way to stop \n     lifestyles they consider wasteful.]\n     Dave and Mieke, Pocatello.\n                                  ____\n\n       My biggest [worry is] fuel that we cannot afford. It is \n     nice for our salary to go up, too. But if you only make $8 an \n     hour or less, it is really tough to go anywhere and even \n     going to work, and if you have a gas-eating vehicle, the pay \n     is gone. How can we afford to live and a smile on your face \n     when you put all your paycheck for the gas? Our country has \n     to do something about this situation. When my kids asked me \n     to go to practice for tennis, I say no, I could not afford \n     the gas. It is very sad to see the face of my kids. And I \n     know that it is not just me suffering for this issue. There \n     are many more that cannot afford to even get groceries for \n     their families. I hope that our government will do something \n     to help our country, too.\n     Edith, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       I began my professional career as a Forester in 1961 and \n     have witnessed a massive change in Forest management and the \n     timber industry. Currently my closest job involves driving \n     100 miles roundtrip to my closest job. I must drive a four-\n     wheel drive pickup due to forest roads and occasional \n     seedlings, tools etc. I would love to drive a more fuel \n     economic vehicle but as you can see this is not an option. In \n     terms of my business, transportation is extremely costly and \n     typically log and pulpwood haulers charge in excess of $2/\n     mile to haul their product. Today it is not uncommon for a \n     surcharge to be added.\n       The big push in my business today is to remove forest waste \n     as biomass to be used as an energy source and the biggest \n     obstacle is the cost of transporting this material out of the \n     woods economically.\n       The American people with the help of Congress must address \n     this energy crisis immediately. The answer in my opinion is \n     to commence exploration and oil recovery (drilling) \n     immediately, build new refining capacity, and develop and \n     utilize alternative sources such as nuclear, hydroelectric, \n     wind, solar, tidal, etc. I do not see this as an ``either/\n     or'' situation. We need a blend of all of the aforementioned \n     to keep our ever-expanding population and economy healthy and \n     vibrant.\n       I am involved with an invention that converts forest slash \n     into a fine powder. This machine/process reduces weight and \n     volume by roughly 40%, has fertilizer value, food value, and \n     appears to be the breakthrough for the cellulosic production \n     of ethanol. I have a report describing this invention that I \n     would be willing and eager to share with you or your \n     representative in Boise at your convenience.\n     Lewis, Eagle.\n                                  ____\n\n       My wife and I have recently started a small business in \n     Idaho. Outrageous gas prices are making it hard to get this \n     young company off the ground. My wife has quit her job of six \n     years to finish school full-time at BSU. We figured we could \n     live comfortably without her income but with the gas prices \n     constantly rising we are getting a little uncomfortable about \n     our decision. We feel that Congress needs to do something \n     immediately to help the working people of this country.\n     Sam, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       I work in southern Idaho at the Idaho National Lab and the \n     lab workers who work way out in the desert work a four-day \n     work week. This helps keep the price to commute low. We here \n     in town work a 9X80 schedule. It would behoove us to look at \n     making the standard work week four days, possibly. I had seen \n     on the news that a couple of the other states have enacted \n     that legislation. Here in Idaho, where we have such wide open \n     expanses and so far to drive in many cases, it could \n     potentially save a lot of money.\n     Melissa, Ammon.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a 68-year-old taxpaying American citizen, and military \n     veteran. I work in Spokane, Washington. It is getting \n     increasingly more difficult to afford the gas to drive to and \n     from work. Carpooling or the use of public transportation is \n     out of the question as I work in the construction industry on \n     various jobs throughout the Spokane area. It appears that \n     some elected people in Congress are letting the environmental \n     lobbyists and their corrupt judges run our country.\n       The time has come to start drilling for oil in Alaska, \n     Colorado, Wyoming, and offshore. From what has been in the \n     news and from what we read in various publications, all from \n     very intelligent engineers and scientists, we know the oil is \n     there. We have shale deposits in several states that we could \n     be using. We need to work harder on wind and nuclear power. \n     The states want to drill, and we need to lift the federal \n     bans.\n       We should either sell or give the abandoned military bases \n     to companies willing to build refineries on them. The time \n     has come to quit asking--it is time to demand that this be \n     done. We have the resources, let us use them. The United \n     States of America should not have to go begging to other \n     countries for oil when we have it within our own shores.\n       We, the people, should not be suffering these exorbitant \n     prices due to the incompetence in all areas of our \n     government, and speculators in the stock market.\n     Wayne, Coeur d'Alene.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/06/senate-section/article/S5228-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5228-S5229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            RECOGNIZING WEST ANCHORAGE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS\n\n Mr. BEGICH.

These outstanding students, through their \nknowledge of the U.S. Constitution, won Alaska's statewide competition \nand earned the chance to come to our Nation's Capital and compete at \nthe national level.\n  This competition involved a 3-day academic competition simulating a \ncongressional hearing in which students demonstrate their knowledge and \nskills as they evaluate, take, and defend positions on historical and \ncontemporary constitutional issues.\n  The students from West Anchorage High School were the Nation's top \nperformers in the competition's unit on How the Values and Principles \nEmbodied in the Constitution Shaped American Institutions and \nPractices. This year is the 50th year of Alaska's statehood and while \nwe may be one of the youngest States, the performance of these students \nis indicative of the unique contributions Alaska has made to America's \ninstitutions and practices.\n  I had the distinction of meeting these students so it makes me even \nmore proud to recognize them on behalf of the State of Alaska. The \nnames of these outstanding students from West Anchorage High School \nare: Grace Abbott, Sinivevela Aho, Spencer Bailly, Gizelle Baylon, \nColby Bleicher, Blake Young, Jacqueline Braden, Santina\n\n[[Page S5229]]\n\nChamberlain, Caitlin Cheely, Jon Derman Harris, Christa Eussen, \nChristina Hendrickson, Ryan Hunte, Terra Laughton, Logan Miller, \nJasmine Neeno, Madeleine Overturf, Luke Park, Kassandra Smith, Krista \nSoderlund, Chelsea Thompson, Luicia Valencia, Stacy Wheeler, Sophie \nWiepking-Brown, Amanda Xayasane, and Ethan Zinck.\n  I also commend the teacher of the class, Pamela Orme, who is \nresponsible for preparing these young constitutional experts for the \nnational finals.

Mr. President, I am proud to honor a group of \n120 World War II veterans from all over Louisiana who will travel to \nWashington, DC, on May 9 to visit the various memorials and monuments \nthat recognize the sacrifices of our Nation's invaluable \nservicemembers.\n  Louisiana HonorAir, a group based in Lafayette, LA, sponsored this \ntrip to the Nation's Capital. The organization is honoring each \nsurviving World War II Louisiana veteran by giving them an opportunity \nto see the memorials dedicated to their service. The veterans will \nvisit the World War II, Korea, Vietnam and Iwo Jima memorials. They \nwill also travel to Arlington National Cemetery.\n  This is the third of four flights Louisiana HonorAir is making to \nWashington, DC, this spring. It is the 16th flight to depart from \nLouisiana, which has sent more HonorAir flights than any other state to \nthe Nation's Capital.\n  World War II was one of America's greatest triumphs but was also a \nconflict rife with individual sacrifice and tragedy. More than 60 \nmillion people worldwide were killed, including 40 million civilians, \nand more than 400,000 American servicemembers were slain during the \nlong war. The ultimate victory over enemies in the Pacific and in \nEurope is a testament to the valor of American soldiers, sailors, \nairmen and marines. The years 1941 to 1945 also witnessed an \nunprecedented mobilization of domestic industry, which supplied our \nmilitary on two distant fronts.\n  In Louisiana, there remain today more than 33,000 living WWII \nveterans, and each one has a heroic tale of achieving the noble victory \nof freedom over tyranny. This group had 44 veterans who served in the \nU.S. Army, 27 in the U.S. Air Force, 42 in the Navy, 3 in the Coast \nGuard and 4 in the Marines.\n  Our heroes trekked the world for their country. They fought in \nGermany, France, Italy, Africa, Japan, Guam, Guadalcanal, China, \nOkinawa, the Philippines, New Guinea, Korea, Thailand, and Saipan. \nTheir journeys included the invasions of North Africa, Sicily and \nNormandy, and the Battle of the Bulge. Their fight for freedom extended \nto New Caledonia and the Solomon Islands.\n  One of our Army Airborne veterans navigated a glider plane and became \na prisoner of war. He also lost a brother during the D-day invasion and \nearned many awards, including the Purple Heart. One of our Army Air \nCorps veterans flew 50 European missions in a B-24 bomber as a flight \nengineer. Another of our Army Air Corps heroes flew 20 missions as a \ntail gunner in a B-17 Flying Fortress. And one of our Navy veterans \nfought at Pearl Harbor.\n  I ask the Senate to join me in honoring these 120 veterans, all \nLouisiana heroes, who will visit Washington, and Louisiana HonorAir for \nmaking these trips a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/06/senate-section/article/S5229-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO CADILLAC MOUNTAIN SPORTS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, with the weather beginning to warm \nup, Mainers and tourists alike are preparing to once again head \noutdoors and enjoy the beauty that our State has to offer. I rise this \nweek to highlight the work one small business--Cadillac Mountain \nSports--is doing to ensure that outdoorsmen and women have the gear and \ntools they need to make the most of their outings.\n  Cadillac Mountain Sports was founded in May 1989 by Matthew Curtis. \nMr. Curtis set up his small shop in busy downtown Bar Harbor, a summer \nhaven for those visiting Acadia National Park. His intention, however, \nwas to build a year-round sports store that served both members of the \nlocal community and the region's seasonal visitors. The store initially \ncarried a wide variety of equipment for a host of individual sports and \nfitness activities, from swimming and tennis to running and aerobics. \nIt soon widened its product line to include hiking, rock climbing, and \nbackpacking equipment.\n  Immensely popular from the outset, the business soon needed to \nsignificantly increase its space. Mr. Curtis moved his business to a \nlarger location across the street after just 2 years, doubling its size \nand allowing the company to grow its product line. Since then, the \ncompany has undergone several expansions and renovations. Additionally, \nover the years, Cadillac has expanded to become a five-store chain, \nwith four locations in downtown Bar Harbor, and one in nearby \nEllsworth. Its line includes Cadillac's Patagonia, Cadillac's The North \nFace, and Cadillac's Nike, which all sell those particular brands' \nproducts. Cadillac now employs 30 people during the slow season, a \nnumber that rises to 100 people during the summer months.\n  Cadillac Mountain Sports is grounded in the communities where it is \nlocated, and strives to improve the quality of living in those towns. \nCadillac was recently instrumental in supporting the Ellsworth High \nStreet Beautification Program to revamp its downtown area. \nAdditionally, Cadillac utilizes a number of ``green'' business \npractices, including recycling programs. As a result of its \nconsiderable efforts to improve the town's well being, Cadillac \nMountain Sports will be presented with the 2009 ``Top Drawer'' Award by \nthe Ellsworth Area Chamber of Commerce at the organization's 54th \nannual meeting on Thursday, May 14, 2009.\n  The ``Top Drawer'' Award is presented annually to either a business \nor person that makes a lasting contribution to the development and \nimprovement of the greater Ellsworth region. The award was founded in \n1980 to commemorate the late Tom Caruso, who established Bar Harbor \nAirlines to ``Link Maine With The World.''\n  It is clear that Cadillac Mountain Sports, with its solid and \nintelligent commitment to the customer and the community, is highly \nworthy of this recognition. A small business that has grown to become a \nregional leader in the sale of sports equipment, Cadillac is a prime \nexample of the success that comes with hard work, community \ninvolvement, and customer responsiveness. Congratulations to Matthew \nCurtis and everyone at Cadillac Mountain Sports for winning the 2009 \n``Top Drawer'' Award, and best wishes for continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/06/senate-section/article/S5229-3", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5229-S5230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MATT GIRAUD\n\n Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today I pay tribute, on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Levin, to Matt Giraud of Kalamazoo, MI.\n  Each week on ``American Idol,'' Matt sang his heart out and inspired \nmany throughout Michigan. Early on, the judges recognized his \nincredible talent. Despite nearly being eliminated in the early stages \nof the competition, Matt rebounded with grace, confidence, and poise. \nHis songs were a moving reminder of the toughness and resilience of our \nState.\n  Matt was born and raised in Michigan. He went to high school in \nYpsilanti and graduated from Western Michigan University. Before he \nwent on ``American Idol,'', he performed at a dueling piano bar in \nKalamazoo. And on the show, he never forgot his roots.\n  He got the opportunity to work with Smokey Robinson, the ``King of \nMotown,'' during the show's Motown episode. His rendition of ``Let's \nGet it On'' deeply impressed Robinson, the show's judges, and the \naudience.\n  When he was faced with elimination in April, the judges, for the \nfirst time in the show's history, intervened to save a contestant. He \ncame back strong the next week, singing ``Stayin' Alive.'' His \nenthusiasm in spite of adversity was a real inspiration to his fans \nacross Michigan.\n\n[[Page S5230]]\n\n  After his elimination, Matt remained graceful and thanked his fans \nback home for all of their support.\n  On behalf of myself and Senator Levin, and all the people of the \ngreat State of Michigan, we want to return the favor. We want to thank \nMatt for reaching for the stars, for pushing himself to the limit, and \nfor showing America Michigan's creative and resilient spirit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/06/senate-section/article/S5230-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/06/senate-section/article/S5230-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/06/senate-section/article/S5230-3", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:26 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Zapata, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following resolutions, in which it requests the concurrence \nof the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to reform the essential air service program, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n[[Page S5234]]\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, Senator \nBingaman, to introduce the bipartisan Rural Aviation Improvement Act. I \nam proud to join the senior Senator from New Mexico, a steadfast and \nresolute guardian of commercial aviation service to all communities, \nparticularly rural areas that would otherwise be deprived of any air \nservice.\n  It has always been true that reliable air service to our Nation's \nrural areas is not simply a luxury or a convenience. It is an \nimperative. Ask any town manager or mayor of a small community how \ncritical aviation is to economic development. All of us in the Senate \nwho come from rural states understand the vital role aviation plays in \nthe moving of people and goods to and from areas that would otherwise \nface a paucity of transportation options. Quite frankly, I have long \nheld serious concerns about the impact deregulation of the airline \nindustry has had on small cities and smaller towns in rural areas, like \nthose in my home State of Maine. That fact is, since deregulation, many \nof these communities across the country have experienced a decline in \nflights and size of aircraft while seeing an increase in fares. More \nthan 300 have lost air service altogether.\n  This legislation will serve to improve the long-underfunded Essential \nAir Service program. The additional commitment of resources will \naugment the ability of the program to achieve its desired goals, \nreducing the impact on the general fund while providing small \ncommunities with a greater degree of certainty when planning future \nimprovements or bringing enhanced service to their airports. The bill \nalso gives those same communities a greater role in retaining and \ndetermining the sort of air service which they receive, and assists in \nmaking that service sustainable.\n  Increasingly, the Essential Air Service program has been plagued with \na decline in the number of airlines willing to provide this critical \nlink to the national transportation network. Not only have we lost a \nrash of participants in the program due to wildly fluctuating fuel \ncosts and the omnipresent economic downturn, but in addition, a few \n`bad actors' have jeopardized commercial aviation for entire regions by \nsubmitting low-ball contracts to the Department of Transportation and \nthen reneging on their commitment to the extent and quality of their \nservice. Our bill will not only establish a system of minimum \nrequirements for contracts to protect these small cities that rely on \nEAS, but it will also extend those contracts to 4 years from the \ncurrent 2. This gives a heightened degree of stability in terms of air \nservice, rather than having communities negotiating new contracts or \nreceiving service from entirely new carriers every 18 months. Actively \nencouraging communities to get involved in the process, and build \nrelationships with the carriers who serve them, can only bolster the \nquality of the program.\n  In the final analysis, everyone benefits when our Nation is at its \nstrongest economically. Most importantly in this case, greater \nprosperity everywhere will, in the long run, mean more passengers for \nthe airlines. We cannot afford to ignore rural America--which contains \nnearly a quarter of the population--as we move forward with aviation \npolicy and the next generation air traffic system. Therefore, it is \nvery much in our national interests to ensure that every region has \nreasonable, consistent access to commercial air service. That is why I \nstrongly believe the federal government has an obligation to fulfill \nthe commitment it made to these communities when Congress deregulated \nthe airlines in 1978; to safeguard their ability to continue commercial \nair service.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. Bond, and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 984. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \narthritis research and public health, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senator Kennedy \nand Senator Bond in introducing the Arthritis Prevention, Control and \nCure Act, which makes a national commitment to find new ways to prevent \nand treat arthritis, and care for the patients that suffer from it.\n  Many people do not know that arthritis is the leading cause of \ndisability in the U.S. As many as 46 million Americans, including \nalmost 300,000 children, live every day with the pain of arthritis. Not \nonly does this disease affect the health and quality of life of \nmillions of Americans, arthritis also costs our Nation's economy an \nestimated $128 billion annually in visits to physicians, surgeries and \nmissed work days.\n  By the year 2030, an estimated 67 million Americans will suffer from \nthe debilitating pain and limited mobility caused by arthritis. It is \npast time that we came together to find a cure for arthritis and invest \nin the scientific research needed to conquer this disease.\n  Specifically, the Arthritis Prevention, Control and Cure Act would \nauthorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services, HHS, to implement \na National Arthritis Action Plan that includes grants for the \ncoordination of research and training, education and outreach, and \ngrants to States and Indian tribes to support comprehensive arthritis \ncontrol and prevention programs.\n  I am especially pleased that this legislation would also increase \nsupport for efforts to address juvenile arthritis. While there are \nalmost 300,000 children suffering from pediatric arthritis in the U.S., \nthere are only 200 pediatric rheumatologists in the country to treat \nthem. There are 9 States that do not have even one doctor trained \nspecifically to treat these children.\n  This legislation will provide loan repayment to physicians who agree \nto practice pediatric rheumatology in underserved areas--so children do \nnot have to travel to another state just to see a doctor.\n  The bill would also allow the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention to coordinate and expand programs related to juvenile \narthritis, collect data and develop a National Juvenile Arthritis \nPatient Registry.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me, Senator Bond and Senator \nKennedy, as well as the Arthritis Foundation, the American College of \nRheumatology, and the American Academy of Pediatrics in support of the \nArthritis Prevention, Control and Cure Act, to take a critical step \nforward in helping millions of Americans living with this devastating \ndisease.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Brown, \n        and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 987. A bill to protect girls in developing countries through the \nprevention of child marriage, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 987\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``International Protecting \n     Girls by Preventing Child Marriage Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Child marriage, also known as ``forced marriage'' or \n     ``early marriage'', is a harmful traditional practice that \n     deprives girls of their dignity and human rights.\n       (2) Child marriage as a traditional practice, as well as \n     through coercion or force, is a violation of article 16 of \n     the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states, \n     ``Marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full \n     consent of intending spouses.''.\n       (3) According to the United Nations Children's Fund \n     (UNICEF), an estimated 60,000,000 girls in developing \n     countries now ages 20-24 were married under the age of 18, \n     and if present trends continue more than 100,000,000 more \n     girls in developing countries will be married as children \n     over the next decade, according to the Population Council.\n       (4) Child marriage ``treats young girls as property'' and \n     ``poses grave risks not only to women's basic rights but also \n     their health, economic independence, education, and status in \n     society'', according to the Department of State in 2005.\n       (5) In 2005, the Department of State conducted a world-wide \n     survey and found child marriage to be a concern in 64 out of \n     182 countries surveyed, with child marriage most common in \n     sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South Asia.\n       (6) In Ethiopia's Amhara region, about \\1/2\\ of all girls \n     are married by age 14, with 95 percent not knowing their \n     husbands before marriage, 85 percent unaware they were to be\n\n[[Page S5235]]\n\n     married, and 70 percent reporting their first sexual \n     initiation within marriage taking place before their first \n     menstrual period, according to a 2004 Population Council \n     survey.\n       (7) In some areas of northern Nigeria, 45 percent of girls \n     are married by age 15 and 73 percent by age 18, with age gaps \n     between girls and the husbands averaging between 12 and 18 \n     years.\n       (8) Between \\1/2\\ and \\3/4\\ of all girls are married before \n     the age of 18 in Niger, Chad, Mali, Bangladesh, Guinea, the \n     Central African Republic, Mozambique, Burkina Faso, and \n     Nepal, according to Demographic Health Survey data.\n       (9) Factors perpetuating child marriage include poverty, a \n     lack of educational or employment opportunities for girls, \n     parental concerns to ensure sexual relations within marriage, \n     the dowry system, and the perceived lack of value of girls.\n       (10) Child marriage has negative effects on the health of \n     girls, including significantly increased risk of maternal \n     death and morbidity, infant mortality and morbidity, \n     obstetric fistula, and sexually transmitted diseases, \n     including HIV/AIDS.\n       (11) According to the United States Agency for \n     International Development (USAID), increasing the age at \n     first birth for a woman will increase her chances of \n     survival. Currently, pregnancy and childbirth complications \n     are the leading cause of death for women 15 to 19 years old \n     in developing countries.\n       (12) In developing countries, girls 15 years of age are 5 \n     times more likely to die in childbirth than women in their \n     20s.\n       (13) Child marriage can result in bonded labor or \n     enslavement, commercial sexual exploitation, and violence \n     against the victims, according to UNICEF.\n       (14) Out-of-school or unschooled girls are at greater risk \n     of child marriage while girls in school face pressure to \n     withdraw from school when secondary school requires monetary \n     costs, travel, or other social costs, including lack of \n     lavatories and supplies for menstruating girls and increased \n     risk of sexual violence.\n       (15) In Mozambique 60 percent of girls with no education \n     are married by age 18, compared to 10 percent of girls with \n     secondary schooling and less than 1 percent of girls with \n     higher education.\n       (16) According to UNICEF, in 2005 it was estimated that \n     ``about half of girls in Sub-Saharan Africa who drop out of \n     primary school do so because of poor water and sanitation \n     facilities''.\n       (17) UNICEF reports that investments in improving school \n     sanitation resulted in a 17 percent increase in school \n     enrollment for girls in Guinea and an 11 percent increase for \n     girls in Bangladesh.\n       (18) Investments in girls' schooling, creating safe \n     community spaces for girls, and programs for skills building \n     for out-of-school girls are all effective and demonstrated \n     strategies for preventing child marriage and creating a \n     pathway to empower girls by addressing conditions of poverty, \n     low status, and norms that contribute to child marriage.\n       (19) Most countries with high rates of child marriage have \n     a legally-established minimum age of marriage, yet child \n     marriage persists due to strong traditional norms and the \n     failure to enforce existing laws.\n       (20) In Afghanistan, where the legal age of marriage for \n     girls is 16 years, 57 percent of marriages involve girls \n     below the age of 16, including girls younger than 10 years, \n     according to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).\n       (21) Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has stated that \n     ``child marriage is a clear and unacceptable violation of \n     human rights, and that the Department of State denounces all \n     cases of child marriage as child abuse''.\n\n     SEC. 3. CHILD MARRIAGE DEFINED.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``child marriage'' means the marriage \n     of a girl or boy, not yet the minimum age for marriage \n     stipulated in law in the country in which the girl or boy is \n     a resident.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) child marriage is a violation of human rights and the \n     prevention, and elimination of child marriage should be a \n     foreign policy goal of the United States;\n       (2) the practice of child marriage undermines United States \n     investments in foreign assistance to promote education and \n     skills building for girls, reduce maternal and child \n     mortality, reduce maternal illness, halt the transmission of \n     HIV/AIDS, prevent gender-based violence, and reduce poverty; \n     and\n       (3) expanding educational opportunities for girls, economic \n     opportunities for women, and reducing maternal and child \n     mortality are critical to achieving the Millennium \n     Development Goals and the global health and development \n     objectives of the United States, including efforts to prevent \n     HIV/AIDS.\n\n     SEC. 5.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nsmall businesses to set up simple cafeteria plans to provide nontaxable \nemployee benefits to their employees, to make changes in the \nrequirements for cafeteria plans, flexible spending accounts, and \nbenefits provided under such plans or accounts, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the SIMPLE \nCafeteria Plan Act of 2009, which will increase the access to quality, \naffordable health care for millions of small business owners and their \nemployees. I am pleased that my good friends, Senator Bond from \nMissouri and Senator Bingaman from New Mexico, have agreed to cosponsor \nthis critical, bipartisan piece of legislation. We have introduced this \nlegislation together since 2005.\n  In order to help small businesses increase their employees' access to \nhealth insurance and other benefits, and help them compete for talented \nworkers, we are introducing the SIMPLE Cafeteria Plan Act. This bill \nwill enable small business employees to purchase health insurance with \ntax-free dollars in the same way that many employees of large companies \nalready do--in their cafeteria plans. This legislation is modeled after \nthe Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees SIMPLE, Pension Plan \nenacted in 1996.\n  As former Chair and now Ranking Member of the Senate Small Business \nCommittee, if there's one concern I've heard time and again--from small \nbusinesses in Maine and across the country--it's the exorbitant cost to \nsmall businesses of providing health insurance to their employees. \nThroughout America, health insurance premiums have increased by a \nstaggering 89 percent since 2000--far outpacing inflation and wage \ngains. In Maine, the annual premium for the most heavily subscribed \npolicy in the small group insurance market is $5,400 for individual \ncoverage, and over $16,000 for a family plan.\n  Clearly our Nation's health care system is terribly broken--and the \nmajority of the uninsured--52 percent--are either self-employed, work \nfor a small business with 100 or fewer employees, or are dependent upon \nsomeone who does. I am pleased that the Congress is now in the midst of \na serious reform effort that will result in a much better system of \ndelivering health care. In order to address the problem of the working \nuninsured, we must address access and affordability in small \nbusinesses. The bill we are introducing today will do just that.\n  So why are our Nation's small businesses, which are our country's job \ncreators and the true engine of our economic growth, not offering \nhealth insurance? Survey after survey tells us that the main reason is \nthat they cannot afford to offer it, or other benefits. Still other \nsmall firms can only afford to pay a portion of their employees' health \ninsurance premiums. As a result, countless employees of small business \nmust try to obtain health insurance from the individual market rather \nthan through their work place. As we debate reforming health insurance, \nwe must consider cafeteria plans--Section 125 plans, as they are often \nknown--which are a proven vehicle for access, and should be a key \ncomponent to reform. I would like to add that another component to \nreform that must be considered is the SHOP Act, which I reintroduced \nyesterday with Senators Durbin and Lincoln, which would also help to \nreverse the pernicious problems of access and affordability of health \ninsurance.\n  Currently, many large employers, and even the Federal Government, \nallow employees to purchase health insurance, and other qualified \nbenefits, with tax-free dollars. Cafeteria plans allow employers to \noffer health benefits with pre-tax dollars. As the name suggests, \ncafeteria plans are programs where employees can purchase a variety of \nqualified benefits. Specifically, cafeteria plans offer employees great \nflexibility in selecting their desired benefits while allowing them to \ndisregard those benefits that do not fit their particular needs. \nMoreover, the employees are usually purchasing benefits at a lower cost \nbecause their employers are often able to obtain a reduced group rate \nprices.\n  Typically, in cafeteria plans, a combination of employer \ncontributions and employee contributions are used to fund the accounts \nthat employees used to buy specific benefits. Under current law, \nqualified benefits include health insurance, dependent-care \nreimbursement, life and disability insurance. Unfortunately, long term \ncare insurance is not currently a qualified benefit available for \npurchase in cafeteria plans. I will come back to long term care \ninsurance in a moment.\n  Again, cafeteria plans already have a proven record of providing good \nbenefits to a wide group of employees. However, in order for companies \nto qualify for cafeteria plans they must satisfy the tax code's strict \nnon-discrimination rules and these rules are a major impediment to \nsmall employers being able to offer benefits to employees. These rules \nexist to ensure that companies offer the same benefits to their low-\nwage employees along with their highly compensated employees.\n  Now, I want to be clear. I believe that these non-discrimination \nrules serve a legitimate purpose and are necessary employee \nprotections. Indeed, we need to ensure that employers are not able to \ngame the tax system to benefit only upper income employees or the \nbusiness owners. As with the SIMPLE pension plan, a small business \nemployer that is willing to make a minimum contribution for all \nemployees, or who is willing to match contributions, will be permitted \nto waive the non-discrimination rules that currently prevent them from \notherwise offering these benefits. This structure has worked \nextraordinarily well in the pension area with little risk of abuse. I \nam confident that it will be just as successful when it comes to broad-\nbased benefits offered through cafeteria plans. The SIMPLE Cafeteria \nPlan Act requires the employer to either match contributions of 3 \npercent of an employee's income or contribute 2 percent without the \nemployee's contribution.\n  An essential change allows small business owners themselves to \nparticipate in cafeteria plans generally. Current law punitively \nprohibits the owners of small businesses from participating in these \nbenefit plans. As a result, if a business owner is unable to obtain any \nbenefit for himself or his own family he is unlikely to undertake the \ntime and financial commitment of offering the benefit. It is time to \nremove this punitive prohibition which I believe will expand access to \nthis flexible platform for employee benefits.\n  Another improvement generally applicable to all cafeteria plan law \nupdates the rules regarding depended care flexible spending accounts, \nDCFSA. The bill increases the amount that can be excluded to $7,500 for \none dependent or $10,000 for two or more dependents. Had the original \n$5,000 limit for DCFSA been indexed for inflation when it was created \nin 1986, it would have risen to $9,692. The bill also indexes these \namounts for future inflation so that families will not see an erosion \nof their benefit in the future. In order for millions of working moms \nto be able to\n\n[[Page S5237]]\n\nwork outside of the home, they must have help in addressing child care \ncosts. It is critical to note that it is not just working parents but \nan increasing number of baby-boom adults who need help caring for aging \ndependent parents. Increasing the dependent care exclusion in flexible \nspending accounts is an essential update to cafeteria plan law for \nworking families.\n  Another provision of the bill generally revises the use it or lose it \nrule under current law, and permits participants to carry over up to \n$500 left in a health-care or dependent-care flexible spending account \nto the next plan year. Such unused contributions could also be carried \nover to the employee's retirement account, such as a 401(k) plan, or to \na Health Savings Account. In either case, any carried over \ncontributions will reduce the amount that the employee could contribute \nto the flexible spending account or pension plan in the subsequent \nyear. The bill indexes the carry-over amount for inflation.\n  Finally, the bill also works to address our aging populations' need \nfor long-term care insurance which is also a probable component to the \ndebate on health care reform. In the U.S., nearly half of all seniors \nage 65 or older will need long-term care at some point in their life. \nUnfortunately, most seniors have not adequately prepared for this \npossibility, just as many working age individuals have not given much \nthought to their eventual long-term care needs. With the cost of a \nprivate room in a nursing home averaging more than $74,000 annually, \nmany Americans risk losing their life savings--and jeopardizing their \nchildren's inheritance--by failing to properly plan for the long-term \ncare services they will need as they grow older.\n  To address this problem, this bill would allow employees to purchase \nlong-term care insurance coverage through their cafeteria plans and \nflexible spending arrangements. Expanding eligibility of these benefits \nwill make long-term care insurance more affordable and help Americans \nprepare for their future long-term care needs.\n  If more small business owners are able to offer their employees the \nchance to enjoy a variety of employee benefits these firms will be more \nlikely to attract, recruit, and retain talented workers. This will \nultimately make small enterprises more competitive. Therefore, I urge \nmy colleagues to join Senator Bond and Senator Bingaman and me in \ncosponsoring this important legislation as we work together to achieve \nbroader health care reform.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na bill summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 988\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Of the working uninsured, who make up a majority \n     of the uninsured--52 percent--are either self-employed or \n     work for a small business with 100 or fewer employees or are \n     dependent upon someone who does. The SIMPLE Cafeteria Plan \n     Act is modeled after the Savings Incentive Match Plan for \n     Employees (SIMPLE) pension plan enacted in 1996 and it will \n     address access and affordability for health insurance \n     coverage and for other employee benefits. The legislation \n     also updates current law for all cafeteria plans for \n     dependent care flexible spending accounts (DCFSA) and long-\n     term care insurance.\n       First, the SIMPLE Cafeteria Plan Act will increase access \n     to quality, affordable health care for millions of small \n     business owners and their employees by amending the non-\n     discrimination rules so that the employer must either: (1) \n     make a minimum 3% matching contribution to amounts \n     contributed by non-highly compensated employees to the SIMPLE \n     Cafeteria Plan; or (2) contribute a minimum of 2% of \n     compensation on behalf of each non-highly compensated \n     employee eligible to participate in the plan. The bill \n     eliminates the prohibition against small business owners' \n     participation in cafeteria plans.\n       For all flexible spending accounts, the bill revises the \n     ``use it or lose it'' rule under current law, and permits \n     participants to carry over up to $500 left in a health-care \n     or dependent-care flexible spending account to the next plan \n     year. Such unused contributions could also be carried over to \n     the employee's retirement account, such as a 401(k) plan, or \n     to a Health Savings Account. In either case, any carried over \n     contributions will reduce the amount that the employee could \n     contribute to the flexible spending account or pension plan \n     in the subsequent year. The bill indexes the carry-over \n     amount for inflation.\n       The SIMPLE Cafeteria Act also updates DCFSA limits for any \n     cafeteria plan by increasing the amount that can be excluded \n     to $7,500 for one dependent or $10,000 for two or more \n     dependents. Had the original $5,000 limit for DCFSA been \n     indexed for inflation when it was created in 1986, it would \n     have risen to $9,692. The bill also indexes these amounts for \n     future inflation so that families will not see an erosion of \n     their benefit in the future.\n       Finally, the bill allows long-term care benefits to be \n     provided under a cafeteria plan, thereby reversing the \n     current law prohibition against such benefits.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 991. A bill to declare English as the official language of the \nUnited States, to establish a uniform English language rule for \nnaturalization, and to avoid misconstructions of the English language \ntexts of the laws of the United States, pursuant to Congress' powers to \nprovide for the general welfare of the United States and to establish a \nrule of naturalization under article I, section 8, of the Constitution; \nto the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I would like to introduce two pieces \nof legislation that I believe are of great importance to the unity of \nthe American people--the National Language Act, S. 992, and the English \nLanguage Unity Act, S. 991.\n  The National Language Act recognizes the practical reality of the \nrole of English as our national language and makes English the national \nlanguage of the U.S. Government, a status in law it has not had before, \nand calls on government to preserve and enhance the role of English as \nthe national language. It clarifies that there is no entitlement to \nreceive Federal documents and services in languages other than English, \nunless required by statutory law, recognizing decades of unbroken court \nopinions that civil rights laws protecting against national origin \ndiscrimination do not create rights to Government services and \nmaterials in languages other than English. This is especially important \nconsidering the Office of Management and Budget has estimated that the \nannual cost of providing multilingual assistance required by Clinton \nExecutive Order 13166 is $1-$2 billion annually.\n\n[[Page S5240]]\n\n  The National Language Act is an attempt to legislate a common sense \nlanguage policy that a nation of immigrants needs one national \nlanguage. Our Nation was settled by a group of people with a common \nvision. When members of our society cannot speak a common language, \nindividuals miss out on many opportunities to advance in society and \nachieve the American Dream. By establishing that there is no \nentitlement to receive documents or services in languages other than \nEnglish, we set the precedent that English is a common to us all in the \npublic forum of Government.\n  The Language Unity Act of 2009, the second piece of legislation that \nI am introducing today, incorporates all the ideas of the National \nLanguage Act, and requires the establishment of a uniform language \nrequirement for naturalization and sets the framework for uniform \ntesting of English language ability for candidates for naturalization.\n  I want to empower new immigrants coming to our Nation by helping them \nunderstand and become successful in their new home. I believe that one \nof the most important ways immigrants can achieve success is by \nlearning English.\n  There is enormous popular support for English as the National \nLanguage, according to polling that has taken place over the last few \nyears. In polling reported only a few days ago, 86 percent of \nOklahomans favor making English the official language; 87 percent of \nAmericans support making English the official language of the U.S.; 77 \npercent of Hispanics believe English should be the official language of \ngovernment operations; 82 percent of Americans support legislation that \nwould require the Federal Government to conduct business solely in \nEnglish; 74 percent of Americans support all election ballots and other \ngovernment documents be printed in English. This polling data refers to \nmaking English an official language of the U.S., or further creating an \naffirmative responsibility on the part of Government to conduct its \noperations in English.\n  My colleagues who have followed this debate will remember that the \nNational Language Act of 2009 is identical to S. 2715, legislation I \nintroduced in the 110th Congress. Most importantly, this language is \nidentical to the English amendments I authored which passed the Senate \nin 2007 as Senate Amendment 1151, and in 2006 as Senate Amendment 4064, \neach being part of the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of each \nrespective Congress. Senate Amendment 1151 was agreed to in the Senate \nby a vote of 64-33. Senate Amendment 4064 was agreed to in the Senate \nby a vote of 62-35. As you can see, there is widespread and bipartisan \nsupport for legislation that empowers this nation's immigrants to learn \nEnglish,\n  I am especially pleased to be introducing these bills today because \njust hours ago in my home State the Oklahoma State Legislature passed a \njoint resolution in support of English as the official language. This \nresolution, which passed the Oklahoma House of Representatives by an \noverwhelming vote of 89 to 8 and the Senate by a vote of 44 to 2, will \nallow the people of Oklahoma to vote on a statewide ballot for a \nconstitutional amendment to make English the official language of \nOklahoma. I am encouraged by the State Legislature's tireless efforts \nto affirm the importance of English as the unifying language in our \nsociety. I hope that the U.S. Congress will follow their lead and let \nthe voice of the people be heard--a voice that overwhelmingly supports \nEnglish as the official language.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 991\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
