The organization Rabbi Harlig founded has taught so \nmany children and adults and has done so many mitzvot--or good deeds--\nfor so many people.\n  As Rabbi Harlig mentioned in his invocation, today is significant for \nthe Chabad community because it is the day of the passing of The \nLubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, one of the great \nJewish leaders of our time.\n  So thank you, Rabbi Harlig, for joining us in the Senate today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/25/senate-section/article/S7025-7", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7025-S7026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, Americans are insisting that Members \nof Congress work together on reforms which make health care more \naffordable and accessible but which don't force people off their \ncurrent plans or add to an already staggering national debt. Yet the \nDemocratic plan now being rushed through the Senate would do just the \nopposite. It would force millions of Americans off their health care \nplans and bury our Nation deeper and deeper in debt.\n  Democrats have repeatedly and incorrectly declared that under their \nplan Americans who like their current insurance will be able to keep \nit. This morning, I would like to explain why that is, unfortunately, \nnot the case.\n  Just last week, the independent Congressional Budget Office said that \nthe incomplete Democratic HELP Committee proposal would cause 10 \nmillion Americans who currently have employer-based insurance to lose \nthat coverage. Let me repeat that. Before the Democratic bill is even \ncomplete, we know that it will cause 10 million Americans to lose their \nhealth care insurance they currently have. But 10 million would just be \nthe beginning. One key section missing from the HELP bill is the \ngovernment plan Democrats say they want, and according to one study, \n119 million Americans could lose their private coverage if a government \nplan is enacted.\n  Here is why this so-called government option would lead to Americans \nlosing their current plans and why it would soon become the only \noption.\n  First, a government-run plan would have unlimited access to taxpayer \ndollars and could operate at a loss indefinitely, which could force \nprivate insurers out of business. Private health plans simply wouldn't \nbe able to compete, and millions of Americans could be forced off their \nhealth plans whether they like it or not. At that point, people would \nhave to enroll in a government plan or any surviving private health \ncare plan, if they could afford it. I say if they could afford it \nbecause another unintended consequence of creating a government plan is \nthat it would cause rates for private health plans to skyrocket, \nleaving most Americans unable to afford them. They would simply be too \nexpensive. Right now, government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid \npay hospitals and doctors less than private insurers do, and hospitals \nand doctors then pass on the difference to private insurers. If a \ngovernment plan was established, doctors and hospitals would shift more \nof their cost onto private health plans, making them even more \nexpensive and making it even harder for them to compete with a \ngovernment plan. In the end, only the wealthiest would be able to \nafford private health plans and the kind of care most Americans \ncurrently enjoy.\n  Some say safeguards could be put in place to create a level playing \nfield. But the very nature of the government running a health insurance \nplan in the private market is the problem. Any safeguard could easily \nbe eliminated, and one look at the government takeovers in the \ninsurance and auto industries shows that when the government is \ninvolved, there is really no such thing as a fair playing field.\n  Let's take a look at the auto industry. The government has given \nbillions of dollars to the financing arms of Chrysler and GM, allowing \nthem to offer interest rates that Ford, a major manufacturer in my \nState, and other private companies struggle to compete with. This means \nthe only major U.S. automaker that did not take a bailout is at a big \ndisadvantage as it struggles to compete with government-run auto \ncompanies. When Ford needed money, it had to raise it in the open \nmarket and pay an 8-percent interest rate. But GM could just call up \nthe Treasury--just call up the Treasury--and have them wire over some \ntaxpayer money. No company can compete with that.\n  So contrary to their claims, if the Democratic plan is enacted, \nmillions of Americans will lose the health insurance they have and that \nthey like. Again, that is not what I say, it is what the Congressional \nBudget Office says, it is what independent analysts say, it is what \nAmerica's doctors say, and it is even what President Obama now says. \nThe President now acknowledges that under a government plan, some \npeople might be shifted off of their current insurance.\n  This isn't the only Democratic claim about health care that is \nincreasingly suspect. Democrats have also promised their health plan \nwill be paid for and won't add to the deficit. But the facts just don't \nadd up. Right now, just one section--one section--of the HELP bill \nwould spend $1.3 trillion. It is not plausible that this won't add to \nthe deficit, which has already swelled by more than $1 trillion thanks \nto bailouts and the stimulus money.\n  So when Democrats predict their health care plan won't cause people \nto lose their current insurance and won't add to the national debt, \nAmericans are certainly right to be skeptical. They made the same kinds \nof predictions about the stimulus bill. They said the money wouldn't be \nwasted. Yet we are already hearing about a $3.4 million turtle tunnel \nand $40,000 to pay the salary of someone whose job is to apply for more \nstimulus money. The administration also predicted that if we passed the \nstimulus, the unemployment rate wouldn't rise above 8 percent. Now they \nsay unemployment will likely rise to 10 percent.\n  Americans, indeed, want health care reform, but they do not want a \nso-called reform that takes away the care they have and stands in the \nway of their relationships with their doctors or that buries their \nchildren and grandchildren deeper and deeper in debt. I think we can do \na lot better than that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/25/senate-section/article/S7026-4", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7026-S7027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, one-sixth of every dollar that is spent in \nAmerica goes to health care today. If we do nothing with health care, \nby the year 2020 it will be 35 percent. Think about that. That is just \n11 years from now. So it is obvious that crushing health care costs \nleave many families uninsured and underinsured and drive far too many \ninto bankruptcy or foreclosure.\n  When we discuss our country's health care crisis with our \nconstituents next week when we go home for the July 4th break and when \nwe debate it with our colleagues in this Chamber in the coming months, \nthey will talk about how best to relieve that burden. There are a lot \nof good ideas, but one of the best ways to bring down the cost is by \npreventing disease and illness in the first place.\n  Prevention and wellness are based on a simple premise: The less you \nget sick today, the less you will have to pay tomorrow. Part of \nreforming health care means making it easier for Americans to make \nhealthier choices and live healthier lives. We are far from that goal \nand need to do a better job of making that possible. More than half of \nall Americans live with at least one chronic condition, and those \nconditions cause 70 percent of all deaths in America. So doesn't it \nmake sense to stop them before they start? The obvious answer is yes.\n  It is not just a health issue, it is also an economic issue. \nPrevention isn't\n\n[[Page S7027]]\n\nfree, but it is a lot cheaper to invest in health before it is too \nlate. Unfortunately, that investment is peanuts right now. We spend \nonly 4 cents out of every health care dollar toward preventing disease. \nThat is far too little. Although we spend only 4 cents of every dollar \ntoward preventing disease, we spend 75 cents of every health care \ndollar caring for people with chronic conditions. It isn't enough just \nto treat and cure disease, we must also prevent disease and help people \nstay healthy. Reducing the number of us who suffer from chronic \ndiseases will cut costs and help more Americans lead healthier and more \nproductive lives. It is the same principle we bring to health care \nreform overall. Reform isn't free, but it is a lot cheaper to invest in \nour citizens' health, our country's health, and our economy's health \nbefore it is too late.\n\n  Everyone needs to listen, especially based on my colleague's \nstatement he just gave. We Democrats are committed to lowering the high \ncost of health care. We Democrats want to ensure every American has \naccess to that quality, affordable care, and letting people choose \ntheir own doctors, hospitals, and health plans. We are committed to \nprotecting existing coverage when it is good, improving it when it is \nnot, and guaranteeing health care to the millions--including 9 million \nchildren--who have no health care.\n  We are committed to a plan that says: If you like the coverage you \nhave, you can keep it. We are committed to reducing health disparities \nand encouraging early detection and effective treatment that saves \nlives. Just a small investment in prevention and wellness can make a \nbig difference for American families. Reforming health care, doing so \nin the right way, and making that investment will help people get sick \nless often--and even when they do get sick, it will cost them less to \nget back on their feet. Benjamin Franklin famously said: ``An ounce of \nprevention is worth a pound of cure.'' For Americans' physical health \nand America's fiscal health it may be worth much more.\n  Madam President, I believe it is time to announce morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/25/senate-section/article/S7027-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Johanns pertaining to the submission of S. Res. \n206 are located in today's Record under ``Submission of Concurrent and \nSenate Resolutions.'')\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, how much time is remaining on \nRepublican time?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 18 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Madam President. Will you please let me \nknow when 4 minutes remain?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, let me talk about a threat to the \nmiddle-class family's budget, and that is health insurance. How do we \npay for health care? I do not have to explain to anyone who might be \nlistening or reading these remarks that health care, for most \nAmericans, is a cost that is difficult to afford.\n  It is difficult for most small businesses. We have many large \nbusinesses who are having a difficult time competing in the world \nmarketplace because of health care costs. We think of the auto industry \nin Detroit which has claimed that the legacy costs of health care have \nput them out of business, unable to compete, even with car companies \nthat locate in the United States and make cars here employing American \nworkers.\n  So we on the Republican side, like our friends on the Democratic \nside, want health care reform this year. President Obama is going to \ntown meetings and saying what he is for. He is saying: Let's do it this \nyear. He is saying: Let's make sure we cover the 47 million Americans \nwho are uninsured. He is saying: Let's make sure we can afford it.\n  ``We do not want more debt,'' the President is saying. We certainly \nagree with that. He already has proposed, over the next 10 years, more \nnew debt than it cost to wage all of World War II according to the \nWashington Post. So we agree with him, we do not want any health care \nbill that creates more new debt. We do not want a health care bill that \nputs more new taxes on States as they pay for State-operated health \ncare programs such as Medicaid.\n  We want to make sure that Americans who like their insurance are able \nto keep the insurance they have. About 177 million Americans have \nemployer-sponsored health insurance which they like. They like the \nquality of the health care they get. We do not want to think about the \n47 million who are uninsured, we want to think about all 300 million \nAmericans.\n  We Republicans agree with the President. We want health care reform \nthis year. We want a health care plan that you can afford. We want a \nhealth care plan your Government can afford, so your children do not \nget a big debt piled on top of them, and we want to make sure all of \nthe uninsured are covered as well.\n  We want to make sure, on this side, that Washington does not come in \nbetween you and your doctor. In other words, you and your doctor make \nthe health care choices, not some Washington bureaucrat who might cause \nyou to wait in line or deny treatment that you and your doctor think is \nneeded.\n  So how does the Senate bill that we are working on stack up with the \nPresident's ideas that we should cover everybody, be able to pay for \nit, and allow people to keep their insurance? Well, I am very \ndisappointed to report that, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, which is the nonpartisan agency in the Congress--and the \nCongress, of course, is majority Democratic, by a large margin--has \ngiven us some very disturbing information about the bill we are working \non in the HELP Committee, a place that I am about to go in a few \nminutes to continue considering parts of the bill, since we only have a \nlittle bit of the bill that we are being asked to consider.\n  Here is what we know about cost: The Congressional Budget Office has \nsaid that in the first 10 years of the partial Kennedy bill which has \nbeen presented to us, it would add over $1 trillion to the debt, the \nnational debt, $1 trillion.\n  Senator Gregg of New Hampshire, who is the ranking Republican on the \nBudget Committee, has pointed out that once the health care program \nenvisioned in the Kennedy bill is up and going, that over a 10-year \nperiod, say years 5 through 14, it would be $2.3 trillion added to the \ndebt, a debt that already has more new debt in the next 10 years, \naccording to the Washington Post, than we spent in all of World War II \nin today's dollars.\n  People in Tennessee and across this country are saying: Whoa. Wait a \nminute. This is getting out of control. We need some limits. We know \nyou have got a printing press there in Washington, DC, but our children \nand grandchildren and even we are going to pay the consequences if we \ndo not have some limits on the amount of debt.\n  I would think the President would say to the Senators who are working \non this: Wait a minute, Senators, I said this needs to be something \nthat pays for itself. We cannot add $2.3 trillion.\n  That is not all. We do not even have all the Kennedy bill. Some of \nthe most important parts are yet to come. Some of the most expensive \nparts are yet to come. The assumptions that we are left to work with--\nbecause we hear them discussed--is that there will be a big expansion \nof the Medicaid Program that States help to operate and help to pay \nfor, usually about 40 percent of the cost, and an increase in the \nreimbursement rates that go to doctors and hospitals who participate in \nthe Medicaid Program.\n\n[[Page S7028]]\n\n  What would that cost? Well, in the State of Tennessee, if we increase \nMedicaid eligibility to 150 percent of the poverty level, which sounds \npretty good, that adds about $600 million to the State cost of Medicaid \nin Tennessee.\n  If we increase the Medicaid reimbursement rates, that adds another \n$600 million to the State costs of Medicaid. When the stimulus funding \ngoes away after 2 years, which was sent to the States to help pay for \nMedicaid costs, that is another $600 million.\n  Now we throw so many dollars around up here that it is hard to say \nwhat is important. But to give you one idea of what would happen if a \nSenator went home to be Governor and had to manage a Medicaid Program \nthat expanded that much and were faced with a $1.2, $1.5, $1.8 billion \nnew State cost about 2015, where would he or she get that money? A 10-\npercent income tax in our State would raise about $1.2 or $1.3 billion. \nSo the costs we are talking about adding to States are astronomical. \nMost States are having a difficult time even balancing their budgets \nthis year, some nearly bankrupt--think of California--and add to that \nhuge new Medicaid costs, as well as a Federal addition to the debt of \n$2 or $3 trillion. It is an unimaginable prospect and totally \ninconsistent with what President Obama has said, who said very sternly \nto Congress 2 or 3 weeks ago: We need pay as we go. If we are going to \nspend a dollar, we need to save a dollar or we need to tax a dollar. So \nwe would have to raise or save $2 or $3 trillion to pay for the Kennedy \nbill, as we know it, and if you live in a State that has increased \nMedicaid costs, you could have, depending upon what these provisions \nsay, huge new State taxes to pay for it.\n  That bill gets an ``F'' on the first aspect of the President's \nrequest, cost, and debt.\n  The second is that we cover the 47 million uninsured. Unfortunately, \neven though we add perhaps $2 to $3 trillion to the Federal debt, and a \nlot of new State taxes, the bill we are considering in the Senate HELP \nCommittee will only cover 16 million more people who are not now \ninsured.\n  In other words, we would reduce the uninsured from 47 to 30 million. \nWe would have 30 million people left even though we added $2 or $3 \ntrillion to the Federal debt and a lot of new State taxes. I think that \nis a flunking grade as well for this bill.\n  Then what about allowing you to keep your insurance if you like it? \nWell, the Congressional Budget Office also had something to say about \nthat. It said: If the Kennedy bill, as it is presently, were enacted, \nabout 15 million people would go from private insurance that they now \nhave to an existing or a new government-run health care plan.\n  You might do that because you choose to, or you might do that because \nyour employer says: I think I will quit offering the insurance you now \nhave.\n  So this does not seem to fit what the President is suggesting we do. \nWith all respect, I know that there has been a lot of hard work done on \nthis bill, but we need to stop and start over even to get close to the \nPresident's own objectives.\n  Let's take the 46 or 47 million uninsured Americans. We need to be \nrealistic about what we are dealing with here. Some 11 million of those \nare non-citizens, and about half of those are illegally here. So we \ndeal with those in one way or another. About one-third of the \nuninsured, about 15 or 20 million, have incomes of over $75,000 a year. \nIn other words, they could afford health insurance but do not have it. \nAbout 13 million are young and believe they are invincible and would \nonly buy health insurance on their way to the hospital.\n  So the question is, do we raise costs for everybody else in a failed \nattempt to try to pass a ``one size fits all'' for all of those 46 \nmillion uninsured Americans, or do we come up with different ways of \ntrying to entice them or require them to have an insurance policy, at \nleast a catastrophic insurance policy, so we all are not paying $1,000 \nmore in insurance so you cannot have insurance and go to the emergency \nroom when you have a problem?\n\n  That is who the uninsured are.\n  Then let us think about the approach the Kennedy bill and other bills \nare making to the so-called government-run programs. There are some \ncompeting polls in newspapers, depending on how you ask the question. \nThe New York Times, the other day, had a huge headline: Everybody likes \nthe government-run health care program. But the Wall Street Journal and \nother polls that have presented questions in different ways said that \nby a 2-to-1 margin most people preferred a private insurance policy \nthat they choose themselves, which is what 120 or 140 million Americans \nhave chosen today.\n  Why do we need a government program? Let's think about that. The \nPresident said: Well, we need to keep the insurance companies honest. \nThat is a little bit like saying: We need a government drugstore to \nkeep the drugstores honest, or we need a government car company--\nactually we have almost got one with GM--to keep the other auto \ncompanies honest, or a government anything. That is not the way this \ncountry is supposed to work. We have a big free market system. We are \nentrepreneurs in this country. We want limited Federal Government.\n  We ought to get out of the car and banking business and out of the \ninsurance business and stop these Washington takeovers. Yet the most \nimposing feature of the health care proposals proposed by our \nDemocratic friends is a big, new government-run program to keep \neverybody honest.\n  I do not see that we need such a program under the proposals that \nRepublicans have offered. I think we agree that whatever plan we have \nshould require that everybody have a chance to be a part of it, that a \npreexisting condition you might have does not disqualify you, and that \nyour rates need to be reasonable.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 4 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair.\n  We agree on that. We think competition is what helps keep prices low. \nThe President says you need a government-run program for competition. \nBut that is like putting an elephant, the government, in a room with a \nlot of mice and saying: All right, fellows, compete. After a while, \nthere would not be any mice left. Your only choice would be big \ngovernment, because it has the power to lower prices and subsidize \nitself to make sure it succeeds.\n  What is wrong with that? Most Medicaid patients can tell you what is \nwrong with that. Some 40 percent of doctors restrict access to Medicaid \npatients. Why? Mostly because the reimbursement rates are so low. The \ngovernment program is cheaper, but it does not allow you to get any \nhealth care. It is like giving you a bus ticket, but there is no bus to \ncatch.\n  So if what we chose to do in our plans is to expand the Medicaid \nProgram, at enormous cost to State taxpayers, and have big increases in \nthe Federal debt, we will be dumping low-income Americans into \ngovernment programs that exist, and new government programs we create \nto which they might not gain admission.\n  So we think we have better ideas. They are in the Wyden-Bennett bill, \nwhich is bipartisan. They are in the Burr-Coburn bill. They are in the \nlegislation introduced by Senator Gregg of New Hampshire. They are in \nthe legislation Senator Hatch and Senator Cornyn are working on.\n  We would like to give dollars to low-income Americans so they can \nchoose to buy an insurance policy and have the same kind of coverage \nthat most of the rest of us can buy. We would rather give them choices \nin the private market, which is what, by far, most Americans have and \nchoose today. We can do that without adding debt to the national debt. \nThe Wyden-Bennett bill is scored at no extra debt. And we can do that \nin a way that reduces the number of uninsured more than the Kennedy \nbill does.\n  So, Madam President, with respect, I suggest we start over, we do it \nin a bipartisan way, that we take some suggestions actually from the \nRepublican side, which has not been done at all. That is another thing \nthe President said. He said he wanted a bipartisan bill. We have had a \ncompletely partisan bill in the Senate. We do not like that. We came \nhere to be a part of solving this big problem. We have our ideas on the \ntable. They are not being considered. Everyone is being polite to us, \nbut it is: We have the votes. We won the election. We will write the \nbill.\n  I am afraid America will not be better off, and the President's goals \nwill\n\n[[Page S7029]]\n\nnot be met because we will have added $2 or $3 trillion to the Federal \ndebt, have a big new tax for states and locally, stuff low-income \npeople into government programs, and we will still have 30 million \npeople uninsured.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I rise to speak about the urgent need \nfor health care reform. I wish to thank both the Finance and HELP \nCommittees for the enormous amount of effort they are both putting into \nthis monumental task.\n  When it comes to health care, if you talk with Coloradans, they will \npoint you in the right direction. They want us to end double-digit \npremium increases on the middle class and small businesses. They want \nus to leave alone the parts of the system that are not broken. They \nagree that all Americans should have access to affordable and secure \nhealth care coverage.\n  But they are skeptical that Washington can get this done without \nbreaking the bank. They want us to find a way to pay for these reforms \nnow and not just pass on the cost to the next generation in the form of \nincreased deficits and debt.\n  That is a tall order, but it is the right one and simple common \nsense. We will be tempted throughout this process to settle for half-\nfixes and easier political victories that help a few people but do not \ndeliver real reform for all families. We have to work hard across party \nlines and avoid these temptations.\n  Showing resolve means not giving in to the usual political posturing \nthat has characterized the debate on health care for 30 years and has \ngotten us nowhere. Failing to act responsibly now will result in yet \nanother lost decade of soaring health care costs for families and small \nbusinesses.\n  Working families with good health insurance are now spending over \n$3,700 of their own annual income just on premiums, drug copays, and \nother out-of-pocket costs. The amount a family has to pay before health \ninsurance coverage kicks in has gone up by over 30 percent in the last \n2 years alone.\n  Even the amount all of us pay to cover the uninsured as a part of our \nhealth care premium--a hidden tax on every family in the country who \nhas health insurance--has increased to over $1,000 a year. This hidden \ntax will only continue to increase for all families if we keep walking \ndown this path.\n  Our top priority must be to stop this ever-increasing spiral of \nhealth care costs that create such a struggle for families and small \nbusinesses. But we do not have the luxury of spending recklessly to \naccomplish these goals.\n  I agree with the President that reforming the health care system is \nthe most pressing fiscal challenge our Nation faces right now. That is \nright, fiscal challenge.\n  Fail to reduce costs and health reform will not work. Fail to pass \nmeaningful reform and we will face a worsening fiscal mess. Americans \nspend over $2 trillion on health care each year. Yet premiums continue \nto skyrocket, and our coverage is not keeping up with what we are \npaying for it.\n  Coloradans know this is a bad deal, and it is getting worse every day \nwe do not act.\n  We do not have to look very hard for enormous cost savings. The \npotential savings in Medicare and Medicaid are right in front of us. We \nmust look at inefficiencies and perverse incentives in the system and \naddress those first. Medicare's payment incentives spur doctors and \nnurses to recommend procedures instead of spending more quality time \nwith patients.\n  We can empower medical professionals to do the best job possible by \nfixing this incentive structure. It starts with Medicare. If we want a \nculture change in health care, we must start with our largest health \ncare spending program, Medicare.\n  If nothing changes in the next 8 years, the cost of health insurance \nfor families covered by their employer will rise by 124 percent. The \naverage annual cost to cover a family will increase from $11,000 to \n$25,000.\n  As you can see, increases in the growth of health care costs have \nrapidly outpaced increases in family income. Median income has risen by \n$11,300 in the last decade, and it is projected to increase by $10,600 \nin the next decade. Income growth will stay relatively stable.\n  Let's look at the growth of health care costs in this same time. In \nthe last decade, health care insurance to cover a family rose by \n$5,400, and now the cost of health insurance for a family will increase \nby $14,000 in this next decade. This rapid increase in growth is \nclearly unsustainable.\n  What you can see from this chart is that median income, in real \ndollars--the increase--remains essentially flat over these decades. \nFrom 1996 to 2006, the growth was $11,300. From 2006 to 2016, we see \n$10,600. But look at the growth in median health care premium costs at \nthe same time: $5,400 over the first period; $14,000 over the second \nperiod. It is clearly unsustainable.\n  We have just come out of a decade when median family income in the \nUnited States, in real dollars, actually declined by $300, and over the \ncourse of this same time, health care costs went up by 80 percent and \nthe cost of higher education went up by 60 percent. These are not \n``nice to haves.'' These are essential things if our middle class is to \nremain intact and we are to preserve the American dream for the next \ngeneration of Americans.\n  Our revenues as consumers have been far outstripped by the costs of \nthat which is essential to all of us, and it is one of the reasons we \nfind ourselves in the fiscal mess we are in. Because in order to \nfinance that gap, we piled on credit card debt, we had home mortgage \nloans we could not afford--all to try to finance this gap. It is \nunsustainable. It has been a house of cards, and we are dealing with \nthe consequences now.\n  Already, some Coloradans are seeing cutbacks on the benefits in their \ncoverage, and some businesses are no longer able to afford coverage for \ntheir workers. Faced with these unchecked increases, health coverage \nbecomes a luxury few families and small businesses can afford. Many \npeople are cutting back on other essentials, visiting the doctor less \nfrequently, even when they know they need care.\n  We must meet this economic challenge head on. The first goal is \nfixing health care. But we cannot forget the second goal. It is just as \nimportant: fiscal responsibility. A more efficient health care system \ncan save taxpayers money in the long run.\n  A study from the White House Council of Economic Advisers shows that \nsmart reform will slow the rapid rise in health care costs by a percent \nand a half or more. Slowing health care costs by just a percent and a \nhalf will have a significant impact on our Federal budget.\n  If we were to look at how much we will save by reforming our health \ncare, economists have shown us our Federal deficit will decrease. By \n2040, we would have saved enough money to reduce our Federal budget \ndeficit by 6 percent from health care cost savings alone.\n  Just this point and a half would increase the income of the average \nfamily in this country by $2,600 in the next decade, growing our \neconomy and improving our ability to get a handle on the deficit. \nColorado families will use $2,600 to make purchases, put away for \ncollege tuition and retirement, and obtain new employment skills to \nimprove their earning potential. Part of fiscal responsibility is \nempowering middle-class families. The current health care system is \nholding them back.\n  If nothing changes, employers will see about a 10-percent increase in \ntheir health care costs next year. Businesses are straining to pay \nsalaries already and remain competitive because health care costs are \nso high. Every day, they are making tough decisions about what kind of \nbenefits they can afford to offer and whether they can even offer \nhealth coverage at all.\n  Coloradan Jean Butler is the clerk and treasurer for the small town \nof Blanca in Costilla County. The town has about 400 people and employs \n6 people in its government. Two of those town employees, the town \npolice officer and the head of maintenance--who oversees roads, water, \nand sewer--get health benefits provided with their employment.\n  The town pays the full premium for the two employees, though they do \nhave to pay some out-of-pocket costs. The cost of maintaining a plan \nthat covers just these two employees has become an increased burden on \nthe small town. The coverage has been in place for about 10 years and \nhas increased in cost almost every single year.\n\n[[Page S7030]]\n\n  Jeannie said the town budgets for a significant increase every year, \nwith the hope it has budgeted enough. In 2008, the increase was 25 \npercent; the year before, it was 15 percent--40 percent in 2 years. No \nother town expense requires such a big year-to-year increase. Most \nothers are budgeted to increase with the inflation rate.\n  The current plan with San Luis Valley HMO costs the town $804 a month \nand the employees $750 in out-of-pocket expenses. But that plan is no \nlonger available. Jean said that similar plans from other providers \nwould increase the cost premium anywhere from 33 percent to 235 \npercent. Even with the smallest cost increase, the total annual cost to \nthe town will be close to $12,000.\n  Jeannie said--Jeannie told me her official name is Jean but that I \ncould call her Jeannie; and she said everybody else does--Jeannie said:\n\n       My [town] board now has to decide whether to accept the \n     higher rates, reduce the coverage, require the employee to \n     pay a much larger share of the premium, or try something \n     else. It is not an easy decision.\n\n  Jeannie may have summed up the problem we face as well as anyone. She \npointed out that:\n\n       They should call it sick care not health care because the \n     insurance companies do not pay to keep anyone healthy.\n\n  Because Jeannie cannot find another plan, hard decisions are being \nmade about employees. We cannot continue down this path when we know \nhealth care costs are overwhelming businesses and working families.\n  Ann Brown and her husband Gordon run New Vista Image, a large-format \ndigital design and printing company in Golden. The business has nine \nemployees and provides health care benefits, covering 60 percent of \neach employee's premium but not that of their dependents.\n  Ann said she is happy with the choices available in Colorado for \ndifferent types of plans, and she believes in the employer-provided \nbenefits model. She and her husband built in the cost of health care \nwhen they began their business because she knew it would help attract \nthe best employees.\n  Ann said she understands how important a healthy workforce is and \nsupports wellness programs, so employees can prevent major medical \nconditions. Whenever she brings someone in, she knows the first \nquestion asked will be: Do you have a health care plan?\n  Nevertheless, the business has been forced to offer less and less \ncoverage in order to keep premiums within its budget. Health care is \none of the biggest ticket items they worry about. Ann said that in \nrecent years, the percent cost increase over the previous year has been \nin the double digits. As a result, they have had to offer less \ncoverage, with higher deductibles and more out-of-pocket costs.\n  The plan's deductible has gone from $1,500 to $3,000, and Ann said it \nis likely the next step they will have to take is a $5,000 deductible. \nShe knows how hard those out-of-pocket costs can be for employees to \nabsorb. A few years ago, when an employee was facing a serious health \ncondition, the business covered the deductible so the employee would \nnot be saddled with the medical bills.\n  ``I would do it again,'' Ann said, although she knows higher \ndeductibles mean a less generous plan to offer to her employees and \nless of a competitive edge for the business overall.\n  Teresa Trujillo of Pueblo, CO, has employer-based coverage. For 7 \nyears, Teresa saved up money to buy a home, and then learned she had \nbreast cancer. After 14 months of treatment, the money ran out and \nTeresa had to take a loan out to finish paying for the rest of her \ntreatment.\n  For Teresa, her health insurance coverage only took her so far. While \nshe has been cancer-free for 4 years, she constantly worries that her \ncancer will come back, and with it, the huge financial strain it would \nbring. All she wants is health care she can count on.\n  These are people who have done everything right, played by the rules, \nlooked out for their fellow employees and fellow citizens. Our health \ncare system is failing them. People should not have to wait until they \nget sick to learn their health insurance will not cover the cost of \ntheir treatments. Families should not have to watch their loved ones go \nthrough sickness and also deal with the anxiety of paying for medical \nbills that are increasingly becoming completely unaffordable.\n  We know health care reform will not be easy. As the President has \nsaid, if it were easy, we would have done it a long time ago. But for \nthese Coloradans--for their families and for their businesses--the \nsystem must change. For our Nation's long-term prosperity, the system \nmust change. We cannot burden future generations with responsibility \nfor the reform we need today. If we make the hard choices, we will \ncreate a better health care system, a better economy, and a better \nfuture for our children and our grandchildren.\n\n  I thank my colleagues for listening this morning.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/25/senate-section/article/S7030-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7030-S7031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SOTOMAYOR NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to comment \nbriefly on the pending nomination of Judge Sotomayor to be an Associate \nJustice on the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  I have made it a practice to write to nominees in advance of the \nhearings in order to give advance notice to the nominee so that the \nnominee will be in a position to respond to questions raised without \ngoing back to read cases or consider the issues and facilitate the \nproceeding. I commented to Judge Sotomayor, when she had the so-called \ncourtesy call with me, that I would be doing that.\n  In a letter dated June 15, I wrote her and commented about it in a \nfloor statement, discussing in some detail the qualifications of Judge \nSotomayor for the Supreme Court.\n  To briefly recapitulate, I noted in my earlier floor statement her \nexcellent academic record and highest rankings in Princeton \nundergraduate and Yale Law School, her work as an assistant district \nattorney, her professional experience with a major law firm, her tenure \non the Federal trial court, and her current tenure on the Court of \nAppeals for the Second Circuit.\n  Today, I am writing to Judge Sotomayor to give her advance notice \nthat I will be inquiring into her views on televising the Supreme \nCourt. I have long advocated televising the proceedings of the Supreme \nCourt and have introduced legislation to require that, subject to a \ndecision by the Court on a particular case if they thought the Court \nought not to be televised. I think the analogy is very apt to \ntelevising proceedings of the Senate or the House of Representatives so \nthat the public may be informed as to what is going on with these \npublic matters.\n  The arguments in the Supreme Court are open to the public. Only a \nvery few people have an opportunity to see them. First, it is not easy \nto come to Washington and, second, there are so many people who do come \nto Washington, but they are only allowed to be in there but a few \nminutes. With the marvel of television, this proceeding appears in the \nhomes of many Americans on C-SPAN2, the House is televised on C-SPAN1, \nand many of our hearings are similarly televised. That is a great \neducational tool, and also it shows what is going on.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States, in a 1980 decision, Richmond \nNewspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, noted that a public trial belongs not \njust to the accused but to the public and the press as well. The \nSupreme Court noted that such openness has ``long been recognized as an \nindisputable attribute of an Anglo-American trial.''\n  Chief Justice William Howard Taft put the issue into perspective, \nstating:\n\n       Nothing tends more to render judges careful in their \n     decisions and anxiously solicitous to do exact justice than \n     the consciousness that every act of theirs is subject to the \n     intelligent scrutiny of their fellow men and to candid \n     criticism.\n\n  In the same vein, Justice Felix Frankfurter said:\n\n       If the news media would cover the Supreme Court as \n     thoroughly as it did the World Series, it would be very \n     important since ``public confidence in the judiciary hinges \n     on the public's perception of it.''\n\n\n[[Page S7031]]\n\n\n  The term ``press'' used in Richmond Newspapers would comprehend \ntelevision in modern days. And certainly Justice Frankfurter's use of \nthe term ``media'' would comprehend television as well.\n  It is worth noting that Justices have frequently appeared on \ntelevision. Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Stevens appeared on \n``Prime Time,'' ABC TV. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's interview on CBS \nby Mike Wallace was televised. Justice Breyer participated in Fox News \nSunday and a debate between Justice Scalia and Justice Breyer was \nfilmed and available for viewing on the Web.\n  There is no doubt of the enormous public interest in what the Supreme \nCourt does. When the case of Bush v. Gore was decided, the block \nsurrounding the Supreme Court Chamber, just across the green from the \nSenate, was loaded with television trucks. Although the cameras could \nnot get inside, there was tremendous public concern. The decisions of \nthe Court are on all of the cutting edge issues of the day. The Court \ndecides executive power, congressional power, defendants' rights, \nhabeas corpus, Guantanamo, civil rights, voting rights, affirmative \naction, abortion, and the list could go on and on.\n  In both the 109th and 110th Congresses, I introduced legislation \ncalling for the Court to be televised. Twice it was reported favorably \nout of committee, but neither time did it reach the floor of the \nSenate. I intend to reintroduce the legislation and I intend to pursue \nit.\n  A number of Justices have commented about television. Justice Stevens \nsaid he favors televising the Supreme Court. He thinks, as he put it, \n``it is worth a try.'' Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said she would \nsupport television and cameras as long as it was gavel to gavel. \nJustice Alito, in his Senate confirmation hearing, noted that when he \nwas on the Third Circuit, he voted in favor of televising the \nproceedings, but had a reservation, saying if confirmed, he would want \nto consult with his colleagues about it. Justice Kennedy has said that \nhe thinks televising the Court is inevitable. Chief Justice Roberts \nleft the question open.\n  There is an obvious sensitivity in the Court if a colleague \nstrenuously objects, and such a vociferous objection has been lodged by \nJustice Souter, who was quoted as saying, ``I can tell you the day you \nsee a camera come into our courtroom, it is going to roll over my dead \nbody.'' That is quite a dramatic statement. Justice Souter has \nannounced his retirement. Perhaps in the absence of that strenuous \nobjection, it is a good time for the Court to reconsider the issue.\n  I intend to ask Judge Sotomayor in her confirmation hearing whether \nshe agrees with Justice Stevens that televising the Supreme Court is \nworth a try, whether she agrees with Justice Breyer that televising \njudicial proceedings is a valuable teaching device, whether she agrees \nwith Justice Kennedy that televising the Court is inevitable. She can \nshed some light on the issue, because her courtroom was part of a pilot \nprogram where it was televised. There was a program from 1991 through \n1994, where the Judicial Conference evaluated a pilot program conducted \nin six Federal district courts and 2 Federal circuits, and they found:\n\n       Overall, attitudes of judges toward electronic media \n     coverage of civil proceedings were initially neutral and \n     became more favorable after experience under the pilot \n     program.\n\n  The Judicial Center also stated:\n\n       Judges and attorneys who had experience with electronic \n     media coverage under the program generally reported observing \n     small or no effects of camera presence on participants in the \n     proceedings, courtroom decorum, or the administration of \n     justice.\n\n  I think that is a very solid step forth from some of the Justices who \nhave expressed concern that the dynamics of the Court would be changed. \nWith the ability to put a camera in a concealed position and the \nfindings of the Judicial Center that is a solid argument in favor of \nproceeding and, to repeat, I will continue to press the issue; and the \nconfirmation proceedings of Judge Sotomayor will be a good opportunity \nto ask her about her experience when she presided over the trial under \nthe pilot program, and to further develop the issue and perhaps \nstimulate some more public interest.\n  I commend to the attention of my colleagues the report of the \nJudiciary Committee on the legislation I had introduced in the 110th \nCongress. I cite Calendar No. 907, Senate Report 110-448 to Accompany \nS. 344, ``A Bill to Permit the Televising of Supreme Court \nProceedings.'' It is lengthy, but I think it has a good summary to \nsupplement the remarks that I have made to acquaint the public with the \nissue and the importance of it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/25/senate-section/article/S7031-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7031-S7032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SYRIAN AMBASSADOR\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I compliment the President for his \ndecision to send an Ambassador back to Syria. I am a firm believer in \ndialog. I believe that even though we may have some substantial \nquestions about Syria's activities and Syria's conduct, we ought to \ncontinue the dialog. I believe in the famous maxim that you make peace \nwith your enemies and not your friends. The derivative of that would be \nto talk to people who may be adversaries--not that I necessarily put \nSyria in an adversarial position, and I certainly wouldn't characterize \nthem as an enemy. But the Ambassador was withdrawn 4 years ago as a \nprotest to the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik \nHariri.\n  The Security Council of the United Nations adopted a resolution on \nApril 7, 2005, to establish an independent international investigating \ncommission to inquire into all aspects of the terrorist attack killing \nPrime Minister Hariri. That tribunal has faced considerable obstacles, \nbut it is still in operation, and I think its report would be very \nimportant in making a determination as to who was responsible for the \nassassination of Prime Minister Hariri and whether Syrian officials \nwere implicated in any way.\n  I do believe and have believed for a long time that Syria could be \nthe key to advancing the peace process in the Mideast.\n  In connection with my duties as chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee in the 104th Congress and my work on the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee of the Appropriations Committee during my tenure in the \nSenate, I have traveled extensively abroad and have concentrated on the \nsituation in the Mideast. In connection with those travels, I have \nvisited Syria 18 times and have studied the Syrian Government. I have \ngotten to know former President Hafez al-Asad, current President Bashar \nal-Asad, Foreign Minister Walid Mualem, who for 10 years was Ambassador \nto the United States and now is Foreign Minister.\n  It has long been my view that a dialog with Syria is very important. \nIn December of 1988, I had my first meeting with Syrian President Hafez \nal-Asad, a meeting which lasted 4 hours 35 minutes. During the course \nof that meeting--President Hafez al-Asad was noted for his long \nmeetings--we discussed virtually every problem of the world and every \nproblem of the Mideast. It seemed to me from that meeting that \nPresident Asad was open to conversation. I have had many similar \nmeetings with him. I was the only Member of Congress to attend his \nfuneral in the summer of 2000. At that time, I met his successor, \nPresident Bashar al-Asad, and have gotten to know him, with meetings \nvirtually every year in the intervening time.\n  There have been back-channel negotiations conducted through Turkish \nintervention between Israel and Syria, and I think dialog between the \nUnited States and Syria could promote future discussions between Syria \nand Israel. It would be my hope that the day would be sooner rather \nthan later when Syria would be willing to talk to Israel directly. The \nIsraeli officials, the Prime Ministers, have repeatedly stated their \ninterest in direct conversations. Syria has resisted but has undertaken \nconversations through back channels. President Clinton came very close \nto effectuating--or made a lot of progress toward an agreement is \nperhaps more accurate to say--in 1995 when Prime Minister Rabin was in \ncharge of Israel. In the year 2000, again, there was substantial \nprogress made by President Clinton on those efforts. The back-channel \ncommunications brokered by Turkey suggest the time is right for \npromoting that kind of an effort.\n  Only Israel can make a determination as to whether Israel wants to \ngive up the Golan Heights, which is key to\n\n[[Page S7032]]\n\nhaving the peace talks proceed. But it is a very different world today \nin the era of rockets than it was in 1967 when Israel captured the \nGolan Heights. Syria, obviously, wants the Golan back as a matter of \nnational pride.\n  Former Secretary of State Kissinger told me that he found President \nHafez al-Asad to keep his word on the negotiations for the \ndisengagement in 1974, so that, obviously, any arrangements would have \nto be very carefully negotiated under President Reagan's famous dictum \nof ``trust but verify.''\n  It seems to me now is a good time to promote that dialog. The \nadvantages would be if Lebanon could be stabilized. It is an ongoing \nquestion to the extent Syria is destabilizing Lebanon. The Syrian \nofficials deny it. There is no doubt that Syria supports Hezbollah and \nHamas, so that Israel could gain considerably if the weapons to Hamas \nwere cut off and attacks from the south and Hezbollah were not a threat \nfrom the north.\n  The sending of an Ambassador is a very positive sign, a positive sign \nthat Envoy former-Senator George Mitchell was visiting. I think this \nbodes well. The article I wrote in the Washington Quarterly some time \nago sets forth in some greater detail my views on the issue of dialog.\n  I note my colleague has come to the floor, so I will conclude my \nstatement and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/25/senate-section/article/S7032-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to resume consideration of the \nfollowing nomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Harold Hongju \nKoh, of Connecticut, to be Legal Adviser of the Department of State.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I rise today to express my strong \nopposition to the nomination of Mr. Harold Koh to be the Legal Adviser \nto the Department of State. My concerns with Mr. Koh arise primarily \nfrom his own statements, writings, and testimony before Congress. In my \nopinion, he seems more comfortable basing his legal conclusions on \npartisan political opinions and trendy arguments rather than the facts \nand the law. We do not need more legal theorists in government. We need \nmore legal realists in government, someone who pays attention to the \nhard work we do in this body to pass laws. The Department of State and \nthe country deserve better than that kind of advice.\n  Let me provide a few quick examples. On September 16, 2008, Mr. Koh \ntestified before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution. \nHis written testimony included the following statement:\n\n       A compliant Congress repeatedly blessed unsound executive \n     policies by enacting nominal, loophole-ridden ``bans'' on \n     torture and cruel treatment and rubberstamping without \n     serious hearings presidentially introduced legislation \n     ranging from the PATRIOT Act to the Military Commissions Act \n     to the most recent amendment of the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act.\n\n  In the same testimony, he argued that Congress should revisit the \nhastily enacted FISA Amendments Act with less emphasis on the issue of \nimmunity for telephone and Internet service providers. He obviously was \nnot paying attention.\n  Besides his condescending and inappropriate tone, I think his \nstatements reflect a poor understanding of some of the most important \npieces of national security legislation that have been passed since the \nSeptember 11 terrorist attacks and passed on a bipartisan basis in both \nHouses.\n  As my colleagues may know, I was heavily involved in the legislative \nprocess surrounding the passage of the FISA Amendments Act. I can \nassure you that certainly was not the result of a congressional \nrubberstamp that was enacted hastily. We began working on the first \none, the Protect America Act, debated it, and passed it in the summer \nof 2007. When we came back in the fall, the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee went to work on a bipartisan basis, and we worked for months \nto get a truly bipartisan bill that came out of the committee. In that \nbill, we added many additional protections to American citizens to \nassure their rights would be protected from warrantless surveillance, \neven if they were overseas. We added that. And we added further \nprotections. That bill passed the Senate. It went to the House, and it \nwas stalled for months.\n  In the spring of 2007, I sat down with the Republican whip and the \nDemocratic whip in the House of Representatives--Steny Hoyer of \nMaryland and Mr. Roy Blunt of Missouri. We went through and took \naccount of all of the concerns they had on both sides in the House of \nRepresentatives. We worked with lawyers from the Department of Justice, \nfrom the intelligence community, and lawyers for the majority staff in \nthe House of Representatives. It took us several months. What we \nfinally came up with was a piece of legislation that overwhelmingly \npassed the House on a bipartisan basis and came back and passed the \nSenate on a bipartisan basis.\n  Another key aspect of the FISA Amendments Act was to ensure the \nintelligence community could continue to collect timely intelligence \nthat could be used to prevent future terrorist attacks. Another key \naspect of the legislation was the carrier liability provisions that \nwere designed to end frivolous litigation against companies alleged to \nhave responded to requests for assistance from the highest levels of \ngovernment. I don't know what planet Mr. Koh is living on, but if he \nthinks we can accept electronic communications without being able to \ngive legitimate orders to the carriers of those communications, he \ndoesn't understand the real world. That is where we find out what the \nterrorists' plans are, who the terrorists are, and where they are \nlikely to strike. If we cannot say we are not going to have frivolous \nlawsuits against those who respond to lawful orders from the Federal \nGovernment, then we are not going to be able to have access to that \ninformation.\n\n  I am happy to report that earlier this month, the U.S. District Court \nfor the Northern District of California, which had raised questions and \nentertained legislation, rejected the constitutional challenges to the \ncarrier liability provisions and dismissed all but a few of the \nlawsuits involved in the multidistrict litigation. They found that, \ncontrary to Mr. Koh, they were constitutional, and a well-reasoned \nopinion said they were right. A bipartisan majority in both Houses of \nCongress said they were right.\n  Let me be clear, the FISA Amendments Act was a necessary and \nimportant piece of national security legislation that is keeping us all \nsafe. But despite the overwhelming bipartisan approval, apparently Mr. \nKoh does not see it that way. I urge my colleagues, even those who \nvoted for cloture, to go back and think again, to see if legislation \nworked on for a year in this body on a bipartisan basis and passed by \nthis and the other body should be dismissed as hastily approved.\n  In his book, he condemns the Democratic leaders in the Senate who \nplayed a leading role in making the improvements to the FISA Act. And \nto the Republicans, he condemned everybody who worked on it. \nApparently, decisions need to be made in the Department of Justice, not \nthrough the elected will of those of us who represent the people of \nAmerica. I think his charges and his disregard of Congress warrant a \nhard look at him.\n  Another example of Mr. Koh's partisan legal scholarship can be found \nin his May 2006 article in the Indiana Law Journal, where he wrote:\n\n       We should resist the claim that a War on Terror permits the \n     commander in chief's power to be expanded into a wanton power \n     to act as torturer in chief.\n\n  While that might appear to be a nice media sound bite in winning \npartisan plaudits, I think it is a bit premature to conclude that the \nUnited States illegally tortured detainees. We know the Department of \nJustice's Office of Legal Counsel reviewed the proposed interrogation \nprocedures on several occasions and found them to be lawful. We in the \nSenate Intelligence Committee are\n\n[[Page S7033]]\n\nconducting a review of those practices to make sure what was done \ncomplied with the law. Where American soldiers violated all standards--\nnot only of law but of decency--and performed unspeakable acts on \ndetainees at Abu Ghraib prison, they were rightfully punished and sent \nto prison, as they should have been. That is what we do even with our \nbrave soldiers who step out of bounds.\n\n  Here is another clever sound bite from Mr. Koh. In an article for the \nBerkeley Journal of International Law back in 2004, he wrote:\n\n       What role can transnational legal process play in affecting \n     the behavior of several nations whose disobedience with \n     international law has attracted global attention after \n     September 11--most prominently, North Korea, Iraq, and our \n     own country, the United States of America? For shorthand \n     purposes, I will call these countries the ``axis of \n     disobedience.''\n\n  To my fellow colleagues, I ask: Do you accept the fact that the \nUnited States is part of an ``axis of disobedience''? Do you really \nthink fighting back against the terrorists who struck us on 9/11 was \ndisobedience? Do you think we should have a Legal Adviser in the State \nDepartment who believes international law--ill-defined, not \napplicable--should be applied to affect his political judgments on \nAmerica?\n  The Legal Adviser for the State Department should be an advocate for \nthe Nation not a detractor. If I remember correctly, after September \n11, by a vote of 77 Members in the Senate, plus a majority in the \nHouse, we made the determination to go to war in Iraq to make sure we \ndidn't suffer further attacks. It was in compliance with a U.N. \nresolution. Oh, I say, by the way, that was a legal international \nresolution.\n  A lot of people will say Mr. Koh had a distinguished career in \ngovernment service and legal academia. I am concerned he spent a little \ntoo much time in the ivory tower, and I wish he would return to that \njurisdiction.\n  Given my previously stated concerns, I cannot and will not in good \nconscience vote in favor of his nomination. I recognize that Mr. Koh \nmay be headed for confirmation, but I would ask those who may have \npreviously voted for cloture to go to this nomination and think about \nwhat he said about Congress, about the work we have done, and about \nwhat he has said about America. Are you comfortable having him as a \nLegal Adviser to the State Department after what he said about America \nbeing part of the ``axis of disobedience''? Are you comfortable with \nwhat he said about those of us who voted for the war resolution, about \nthose of us who voted for the FISA Amendments Act? I certainly am not.\n  If he is confirmed, I would hope for his and our country's sake, if \nhe returns to the State Department, his legal advice will be based on \nfacts rather than political rhetoric.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                        Honoring Denise Johnson\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, once again I rise to honor a Federal \nemployee whose service to our Nation is exemplary. Before I do, I want \nto thank my distinguished colleague from Mississippi, Senator Cochran, \nfor his June 11 statement about Federal employees. It is my great \npleasure to join with him and other Senators to recognize the enormous \ncontributions to the security and prosperity of our country by those \nwho work in the Federal Government.\n  Madam President, last week, I shared the story of a Federal employee \nwho spent his career working at the Redstone Arsenal in Alabama. He \nhelped design and test the advanced missile systems used by our \nmilitary to defend our ideals overseas. This week, I wish to share the \nstory of a Federal employee who also works to advance our interests \noverseas--that of humanitarian good works. Both are vital to our global \nleadership.\n  I have spoken before about the groundbreaking medical research \nperformed by Federal employees at the National Institutes of Health. \nThe advances in medicine and biotechnology pioneered by those working \nat NIH keep America's health care the most innovative in the world. Yet \nmaking breakthroughs and developing treatments are only a part of how \nthe Federal Government is helping to promote global health. One of our \nforeign policy and humanitarian priorities is to expand access to new \nmedications and health technologies among those who live in the \ndeveloping world.\n  The hard-working men and women of the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention are at the forefront of initiatives to bring lifesaving \nmedicines to those in greatest need. Foremost, the CDC monitors, \nprevents, and, if necessary, contains the outbreak of deadly diseases \nin the United States, such as West Nile and Swine Flu. Part of this \neffort is a push to eradicate some of the most dangerous viruses \nthroughout the world.\n  With the lens of Congress now focused on our health care system, so \nmuch has been said about its shortcomings. Yet for all the problems we \nface on this front, Americans are blessed with freedom from fear of \ndiseases that afflicted previous generations.\n  When I was young, tens of thousands of children each year were \nstricken with polio. In the early part of the 20th century, polio \noutbreaks occurred in the United States with deadly frequency. Parents \nused to keep their children home and away from their peers. Many became \nparalyzed or had to make use of the iron lung. We have all seen those \nfamous images of President Franklin Roosevelt seated behind his desk in \nthe Oval Office signing New Deal programs into law and overseeing a \nWorld War against the enemies of liberty. But at the same time, few \nAmericans knew that behind that desk our President sat in a wheelchair, \nhis legs paralyzed from his own battle with polio.\n  Today, in parts of Africa and South Asia, hundreds of children each \nyear still develop polio. While children in developing nations \nroutinely receive the Salk or Sabin vaccines, this is a luxury for \nrural villagers in places such as India, Nigeria, Afghanistan, and \nSomalia. The CDC has set a goal of vaccinating every child on Earth. \nLeading this charge over the past decade, Denise Johnson serves as the \nActing Chief of the CDC's Polio Eradication Branch.\n  Before she was recruited to direct this project, Denise served for 6 \nyears as the manager of the CDC's Family and Intimate Partner Violence \nPrevention Program. In this role, she oversaw the promotion of \nnonviolent, respectful relationships through community and social \nchange initiatives. This was around the time that Congress passed the \nViolence Against Women Act, which was one of the proudest achievements \nof my friend and predecessor, Vice President Joseph Biden, during his \ncareer in the Senate.\n  When asked why Denise was highly sought after to work on the polio \nproject, one of her supervisors at the CDC said:\n\n       If you do a good job keeping women and children from being \n     beaten, you can eradicate polio.\n\n  With Denise at the helm, the Polio Eradication Branch has been \nworking in close concert with the World Health Organization and UNICEF \nto promote immunization. In her first few years alone, Denise and her \nteam helped immunize over a half billion--let me repeat that, a half \nbillion--children in 93 countries.\n  From her office in Atlanta, Denise oversees a staff of over 40 \nprofessionals working overseas. Her effective leadership has proven to \nbe a key factor in the program's success. Denise administers the \npurchase and distribution of over 200 million doses of the oral polio \nvaccine--bought for a mere 63 cents per dose--and routinely serves as a \nfield consultant in polio hotspots around the world. In fact, Denise is \nin Kenya right now, taking the fight against polio straight to the \nfront lines.\n  Twenty years ago, there were over 350,000 cases of polio in 125 \ncountries, but today there are fewer than 2,000 cases. That is 350,000 \ncases down to 2,000 cases because of the diligent work\n\n[[Page S7034]]\n\nperformed by Denise and the rest of her team at the CDC's Polio \nEradication Branch. It is only a matter of time before this disease no \nlonger threatens our world's children.\n  Madam President, Denise is just one of so many Federal employees who \nhave dedicated their lives to serving the greater good. She and her \nteam are truly engaged in what President Obama has called ``repairing \nthe world.'' Their work saves lives and helps demonstrate our Nation's \ncommitment to humanitarian leadership in the global community.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring Denise Johnson and her \nteam for their outstanding work, as well as the important contributions \nmade by all of our excellent public servants.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Groves Nomination\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, in the Constitution, we see laid out \nbefore us a framework of how our government is supposed to work, with \nthree branches--legislative, executive, judicial. We also find in the \nConstitution what our relative responsibilities are, not with great \ndetail but with some definitiveness.\n  Ironically, one of the requirements the Constitution provides for us \nin this country is that every 10 years we try to count everybody. We \nhave a census. Most nations do that. We have been doing that really for \nover 200 years. It does not get any easier. In fact, every 10 years it \ngets harder, and it also gets to be more expensive.\n  The Director of the Census does not serve a finite period of time. \nThe Director of the Census really serves at the pleasure of the \nPresident, and we have had Census Directors who have served as little \nas 1 year and some Directors who have served maybe 4 or even 5 years.\n  This is particularly appropriate to speak about today because we do \nnot have a Director of the Census. We had a Dr. Murdock, from down in \nTexas, who served for about the last year of the Bush administration as \nour Census Director. He did a very nice job. But at the beginning of \nthis year, Dr. Murdock resigned. We do not have a Census Director. What \nwe do have coming down the railroad tracks is the requirement to do the \ncensus.\n  Next April 1--I call it a little bit like D-day. At Normandy, we sent \nall of our troops ashore, and they scrambled off of those landing \nvessels. They stormed the beaches. That took place after literally \nmonths of planning, months of preparation, and finally the day of \nexecution came.\n  In a way, the census is like preparing for the Normandy invasion. The \nefforts are underway now. They have been underway for months and will \ncontinue up to April 1 and beyond that day, as we try to count \neverybody. Yet, at this critical time, as we approach the need to \nconduct our census, to do it in an accurate, cost-effective way, we do \nnot have a leader there. We have some good people, but they lack a \nDirector.\n  Last month, I held a hearing of our Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Subcommittee, and we invited people who had been \nhigh-level officials in, I think, every census since 1970--the 1970 \ncensus, the 1980 census, the 1990 census, and the 2000 census. We asked \nthem to come in and talk to us about how they thought we were doing in \nterms of the preparation for the 2010 census. At the end of their \ntestimony, I asked each of them to give to us on our committee two \nnames of people who they thought would be excellent Census Directors, \nand they were good enough to do that. I think every one of them \nincluded in their recommendations the name of a fellow from Michigan--I \nam an Ohio State guy, but they recommended a fellow from Ann Arbor \nwhose name is Dr. Robert Groves.\n  Dr. Groves is an expert in survey methodology. He has spent decades \nworking to strengthen the Federal statistical system, to improve its \nstaffing through training programs, and to keep the system committed to \nthe highest scientific principles of accuracy and efficiency. Having \nonce served as Associate Director of the Census Bureau a number of \nyears ago, Dr. Groves knows how the agency operates and what its \nemployees need to successfully implement the decennial census and other \nprograms. He knows because he has been there. He is not just an \nacademician--one of the most respected people in his field in the \ncountry--he actually helped run the Census Bureau at an earlier time. \nThe combination of those experiences has prepared him well to lead the \nBureau at a time when rapid developments and changes are occurring.\n  As a manager, he elevated the University of Michigan's Institute for \nSocial Research to a premier survey research organization, respected \nthroughout the country--actually, respected around the globe. Numerous \nFederal and State agencies and policymakers have sought his expertise \nin survey design and response. His work has received professional \nrecognition through awards from various professional associations, \nincluding the 2001 American Association for Public Opinion Research \nInnovator Award and more recently the 2008 American Statistical \nAssociation Julius Shiskin Award for original and important \ncontributions in the development of economic statistics. Ultimately, \nhis deep expertise in survey response will help the Census Bureau focus \non the most important goal of the 2010 census, which is to encourage \nall people to respond to the census.\n  Dr. Groves will undoubtedly face a host of operational and management \nchallenges as we move closer to the 2010 census. However, I remain \nconfident he is well equipped--remarkably well equipped--to understand \nthe agency's inner workings, to lead his staff--he has led a large \norganization already; he served at a senior level at the Census Bureau \nbefore--and to also be a national spokesperson for the 2010 census and \nthe agency's other equally important ongoing survey programs. It is for \nthese reasons that I hope the full Senate will support his nomination \nand move it quickly.\n  Let me just reiterate, we are now about 8 months away from when the \nfirst forms go out as part of the start of the 2010 census. The Bureau \nhas already completed something we call address canvassing--an \noperation in which 140,000 people on the ground nationwide were making \nsure the address lists we have to do the census are accurate.\n  Since the 2000 count, the population in this country is estimated to \nhave increased by over 40 million people, with increased numbers of \nminorities and an increase in the number of languages spoken. Further \ncomplicating the 2010 decennial operations is the mismanagement and \nlack of preparation that occurred in past years, most notably in the \nfailure of the field data collection automation contract, resulting in \na last-minute decision to return to paper-based questionnaires, \nultimately adding billions of dollars to the census budget. And it is \nonly going to get harder the longer the Senate delays the confirmation \nprocess.\n  The reason we do not have a Census Bureau Director is not because we \ndo not have a qualified candidate. It is not because our Subcommittee \non Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs has not endorsed his \ncandidacy. We have done so unanimously, and actually we have endorsed \nhim with acclaim. We are just lucky, very fortunate in this country to \nhave--at a time when we are about to try to meet our constitutional \nresponsibility to count everybody accurately and in a cost-effective \nway--to actually have somebody with his gifts and his talents to bring \nto the job. What we do not have is the permission to bring his name up \nfor a vote in the Senate. If we leave here today without having had the \nopportunity to vote up or down on the nomination of Dr. Groves, we will \nhave made a very grave mistake.\n  I understand our Republican friends are uncomfortable, unhappy with \nthe pace for the confirmation process for Judge Sotomayor, who has been \nnominated, as we know, to be an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. I voted for Chief Justice John Roberts a couple of years ago. \nThe timetable for approving his confirmation was almost the very same \nfrom the day he was nominated by former President Bush to the day we \nvoted for him here, it was almost the same number of days we are\n\n[[Page S7035]]\n\ntalking about with respect to the Sotomayor nomination. The timetable \non Justice Alito: almost the same from the day he was nominated by \nPresident Bush until the day we voted here in the Senate--at least a \nmajority of our colleagues did--to confirm him. It was almost the same \nnumber of days. I realize some of our colleagues are unhappy that we \nare providing the same kind of timetable for Judge Sotomayor that we \nprovided for Justice Alito and Chief Justice Roberts. I, for the life \nof me, do not see what the beef is.\n  Just as I believe we are fortunate to have someone with Dr. Groves' \ncredentials to serve as our Census Director, I think we are lucky to \nhave somebody with Judge Sotomayor's credentials to serve on the \nSupreme Court. I have had the opportunity to meet with her. I know a \nnumber of my colleagues have too. I must say, among the things I most \nlike and respect about her: She is up from nothing. She was a kid born \nin the Bronx, raised in the Bronx, and very humble, from a humble \nsetting, a humble beginning. She worked hard, won herself a scholarship \nto Princeton, went there, excelled, and later went off to law school at \nYale--two of the finest institutions we have in our country.\n  After that, she was a prosecutor for a number of years; beyond that, \na corporate litigator; and finally nominated by a Republican \nPresident--George Herbert Walker Bush--to serve as a district court \njudge. By all observers, she did a superb job. She was not just so-so. \nShe was an exceptional judge--so good, in fact, that a few years later, \nwhen there was a vacancy on the circuit court of appeals in her \ndistrict, a Democratic President, Bill Clinton, said: I think she ought \nto get the nod. He nominated her for that position, and she was \nconfirmed by a wide margin. So she has actually been through this \nprocess not once but twice. I think she has gone on to serve longer as \na Federal judge--when you add together the district court time and the \ncircuit court of appeals time, I think she has served longer as a \nFederal judge than anybody in the last 100 years who has been nominated \nto serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n  I have read the comments some of her colleagues have to say about \nher, including colleagues who were also nominated by Republican \nPresidents. They have been uniformly complimentary, very gracious in \ntheir remarks, very laudatory as well.\n  So I would say to my Republican colleagues, while you struggle to get \nover the fact that we are going to set the same timeline or try to set \nthe same timeline for the confirmation of Judge Sotomayor that we set \nfor the nominations of Judges Alito and John Roberts--I just don't \nunderstand the angst you feel.\n  I do know this: Apparently, the nomination of Dr. Groves is being \nheld up along with 25 to 30 other names, all of whom have cleared \ncommittees, I think, by wide margins. We can't move forward on those \nnominations. Some of them maybe are not of grave consequence. The \nnomination of Dr. Groves is of grave consequence. If we have the \nopportunity later today in the course of business to actually consider \na number of nominations that are before the Senate, that are awaiting \nour consideration, I would urge my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle to allow the nomination of Dr. Groves to come here for a vote and \nto give us the opportunity to vote him up or down. I am sure we will \nvote him up, and I am equally sure he will make us proud with the \nservice he will provide as the Director of the Census Bureau for our \ncountry in the years ahead.\n  With that having been said, I yield the floor and note the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, just before walking into this Chamber, I \nattended a historic rally on health care reform across the street. \nToday, thousands of Americans--some from every State in this country--\ntraveled to Washington for one of the largest health care lobby days in \nthe history of the Nation. I joined these citizens--volunteers, almost \nall--representing more than a thousand organizations and more than 30 \nmillion people who are fighting to ensure that every American has \naccess to affordable health care coverage.\n  I am inspired by their activism and energy and by the message I hear \nfrom these Americans. I am hearing from hundreds of thousands of \nmiddle-class Ohioans, and their message is: Don't let the special \ninterests hijack this health insurance reform.\n  The message I hear is to make sure health care reform includes a \nstrong public option. I will tell you about individuals, Americans like \nJoseph from Powell, OH, who are demanding they change. Joseph, an \nordained pastor and doctor of psychology, wrote to me that as a child \nhe suffered a stroke and became paralyzed and blind. His father's \ninsurance expired and his family had no coverage. They struggled to \nprovide the care he needed. As an adult, he is concerned that too many \nAmericans are not receiving the medical care they need. Joseph wishes \nto see a public insurance option that will bring down costs and help \nall Americans lead a productive life.\n  The spirit and energy of the people I met today--thousands from \naround this Nation demanding change--reaffirms why health care reform \nis so important.\n  Health care reform is about keeping what works and fixing what's \nbroken. Middle-class families from all over the country are demanding a \nhealth care system that reduces costs, enhances quality of care, and \nprovides choice--choice either of a private insurance plan or of a \npublic option. It is their choice. The existence of both will make the \nother behave better and make the other work better and will improve the \nquality of care for all Americans. Good old American competition.\n  People are reminding elected officials in the Senate and House about \nAmericans like Ken from Findlay, OH. He lost his manufacturing job a \nfew years ago, after working in the industry for nearly 30 years. \nShortly before losing his job, Ken began having serious health issues--\nunexplained seizures and memory loss. In and out of the hospital, and \nout of a job, Ken was forced to find expensive private insurance after \nbeing denied Social Security disability and not yet old enough to be \neligible for Medicare. Unfortunately for Ken, the price of the private \ninsurance was simply too high.\n  After a near-death seizure a few years ago, Ken was hospitalized \nagain and diagnosed with lupus. After a month-long hospitalization, Ken \nentered a nursing home for rehabilitation.\n  All this treatment was done without insurance. With tens of thousands \nof dollars in medical expenses, Ken had to withdraw from his 401(k) \nsavings early--facing tax penalties, I might add--ultimately draining \nhis lifetime, hard-earned savings, and putting his retirement security \nin jeopardy.\n  It is unacceptable that Ohioans such as Ken, who worked hard all \ntheir lives, have to fight for health insurance simply to take care of \ntheir disability. That is why the time for health care reform is now.\n  The HELP Committee has accomplished a lot on quality, on prevention \nand wellness, in part thanks to the contribution and efforts of the \nPresiding Officer from North Carolina. We have done well with the \nworkforce shortages issue. We have good language on fraud and abuse. \nClearly, most important, the most difficult work is in front of us. We \nhave more work to do to make sure health care reform is about providing \npeople with affordable, quality health insurance that protects them, to \nprotect what works and to fix what is wrong.\n  I need some of my colleagues to explain to me something that is \npretty confusing. As we talk about this public option, I hear the \ninsurance industry tell us over and over they can do things better, \nthat with their marketing, their skills, their bureaucracy, their well-\npaid executives and all the things they do they can do things better. \nAs they argue against the public option, they say the government cannot \ndo\n\n[[Page S7036]]\n\nanything right. What puzzles me is why the insurance industry is so \nafraid that the public option will put them out of business. They tell \nus the insurance business does things better, the government cannot do \nanything right, but yet they are afraid the public option will put them \nout of business. I don't understand.\n  I encourage all of the grassroots volunteers whom I met today to keep \nmoving forward to remind your elected officials this legislation is not \nabout helping out the insurance companies. Health care reform is about \nhelping people such as Cheryl from Cleveland.\n  Cheryl is 59 years old and was recently diagnosed with diabetes. Her \nhusband died just 4 months ago, and with no income, her insurance costs \nmore than $400 a month. With no income, Cheryl cares for a disabled \nadult son and an autistic granddaughter. She writes that she has no \nchoices and that our system is broken and unaffordable for her, for \nsome of her neighbors, and for too many Americans. She writes that she \nneeds health care reform now before all her savings are lost. That is \nwhy it is so important we do this now.\n  President Obama is right we not wait for next year or the year after. \nSome people say the economy is bad; we cannot do it now. The same \npeople said when the economy was good: We cannot do it now. As Chairman \nDodd repeatedly said in the committee that Senator Hagan and I sit on, \n14,000 Americans every day are losing their health insurance.\n  It is people such as Cheryl I talked about and Ken and Kathleen and \nJoseph--Kathleen, I will speak about in a minute--people who are losing \ntheir health insurance every day, 14,000 Americans every single day. \nFor us to wait an additional 6 months or a year, or some people say \nlet's wait until the next election until the voters, again, say we need \nhealth care reform, 14,000 people every day are losing their insurance.\n  Health care reform is about helping small business owners such as \nKathleen from Rocky River, OH, west of Cleveland. One of Kathleen's \nfinest employees suffers from rheumatoid arthritis. Kathleen's premiums \nhave increased to $1,800 a month, and after trying to purchase another \nplan, she was turned down because of her employee's arthritic \ncondition.\n  Keep in mind, if you have a small business of 10, 20, 50 employees, \nand you have a decent insurance plan, if one of them gets very sick to \nthe tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars, everybody's premium goes \nup because it is such a small insurance plan. Then so often the small \nbusiness person has to give up and cannot insure their employees. \nKathleen is being victimized, as are her employees, by that phenomenon. \nShe does not want to fire her finest employee, nor should she have to.\n  I stand ready to work with my colleagues to design a public insurance \noption that will help provide middle-class families with economic \nstability, with stable coverage, with stable costs, with stable \nquality. I stand with the thousands of volunteers who were here today \nacross the street demanding real change in our health care system. They \nare showing the world how change in America happens. Their activism is \nimportant--the stories of the people they are fighting for, people I \njust mentioned--Joseph, Ken, Cheryl, and Kathleen. That is why we \ncannot wait any longer. We need health care reform now, and we need a \nstrong public option now.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Aid to Pakistan\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to speak on the record in support \nof the Kerry-Lugar legislation that was passed by this body basically \nwithout objection--by voice vote. It went through so quickly, to me it \ndemonstrates the power of the bill, and so I want to congratulate \nSenator Kerry and Senator Lugar for this piece of legislation.\n  To the public, what I am talking about is an aid package to Pakistan \nof I think it is over $1.5 billion a year for the next 5 years. I know \nwe need money here at home. Trust me, in South Carolina we have the \nthird highest unemployment in the Nation. Times are tough. But all I \ncan tell the taxpayers and the American people is that what happens \noverseas does matter.\n  September 11 was planned in Afghanistan. It was an area of the world, \nquite frankly, that we ignored. Pakistan has been an ally in the war on \nterror generally. It is a regime with nuclear weapons. It is a country \nthat has been hit incredibly hard by the downturn of the world economy. \nThere are millions of people in Pakistan who are looking to find a \nbetter way. The government is fighting forces that are aligned with the \nal-Qaida movement--the type of people who would impose a period of \ndarkness in the Middle East that would affect the quality of our lives. \nSo $1.5 billion is a lot of money, but it will do a lot of good in \nPakistan and it will help this government and the Pakistan military \ncombat the growing threat of terrorism in Pakistan. The aid package is \ngoing to help the government provide a better quality of life for its \npeople. Where the government fails to provide a decent quality of life \nin Afghanistan and Pakistan, you will have a vacuum that will be filled \nby the Taliban. The Taliban is not in favor with the Afghan people, but \nwhen the government of Afghanistan cannot deliver justice, provide the \nbasic necessities of life, that allows the drug dealers and the Taliban \nto come along and fill in the vacuum.\n  Pakistan is a large country with nuclear weapons. It is in our \nnational security interest to make sure that the government is stable, \nthat the military will be supportive of civilian control of the \ngovernment and will be able to defeat the forces of extremism we have \nseen. We know what they can do when left unchecked. So this bill is an \naid package which focuses on civil capacity.\n  The bill also makes sure that we know where the money is going to go. \nIt is not a $1.5 billion check to Pakistan that could be stolen through \ncorruption. It is a very accountable system that follows the money. It \nmakes an effort to upgrade the Pakistan military to deal with \ncounterinsurgency, because they do not have the capacity now that they \nneed. Again, it provides assistance to the Pakistani people and the \ngovernment to improve the quality of their lives.\n  I think we are getting something for our money. I think we are going \nto get a good return if we can stabilize Pakistan. It helps us in \nAfghanistan, where we have thousands of American troops stationed and \nfighting as I speak.\n  So to Senators Kerry and Lugar, congratulations on being able to get \nthis bill through the Senate so swiftly. To Senators McConnell and \nReid, I applaud them both, the minority and majority leaders, for \nworking for the common good here. The administration has also been very \nsupportive. I have had my differences with this administration, and I \nwill continue to have them, but I want to acknowledge that Ambassador \nHolbrooke, who is now in charge of monitoring Pakistan and Afghanistan \nas a unit, has done a good job of focusing on what we need to do in \nboth countries, because one does affect the other.\n  The Kerry-Lugar bill, according to the Ambassador and General \nPetraeus, would be the most important thing the Congress could do to \naid the Pakistan Government and the Pakistan military at this crucial \ntime. So I am glad to see that in a bipartisan fashion we responded to \nthat call from our general and from our Ambassador, and hopefully this \nwill become law soon.\n  To the American taxpayer, I know times are tough. I know money is in \nshort supply. But quite frankly, this is an investment we have to make. \nWe have soldiers serving in Afghanistan. If we can make Pakistan more \nsecure and less of a safe haven for terrorists who are attacking our \ntroops, that makes their lives better. If we can stabilize Pakistan and \nput it in the column of moderation and not extremism, not\n\n[[Page S7037]]\n\nonly will our Nation prosper now, but future generations will be able \nto prosper. It is impossible for us as a nation to have a strong, \nvibrant economy and to enjoy the freedom we enjoy today and pass it on \nto our kids and grandkids without confronting these problems head on. \nAnytime you ignore problems such as Pakistan and Afghanistan, they \nalways come back to bite you.\n\n  This is a wise investment at a time that it matters. The tide is \nturning in Pakistan, it is turning our way, and I hope this aid package \nwill allow it to accelerate and get a result in Pakistan that helps us \nin Afghanistan.\n  Every American should be proud of the history and tradition of our \ncountry. We have been blessed in many ways. The challenges we face are \nenormous, but we have to remember we are the most blessed nation on \nEarth and this is a chance for us not only to help ourselves but help \nthe world at large.\n  I am proud of the Senate. I look forward to working in the future \nwith Ambassador Holbrooke and the administration on Afghanistan, Iraq, \nand Pakistan, to find ways to make sure we are successful. This is not \na Republican or Democratic problem, this is a problem for anyone who \nloves freedom. This is a problem that needs to be addressed and the \nKerry-Lugar bill does address the problem of Pakistan in a reasoned \nway.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Struggle For Equality\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, this June we celebrate our diversity as \nAmericans as we mark Pride Month. In many ways, the struggle for \nequality is a singular thread that is woven through the fabric of \nAmerican history.\n  From the Declaration of Independence, to the Emancipation \nProclamation, to women's suffrage, from school integration, to \nStonewall, the story of this Nation is a story of a long, slow march \ntoward equal rights for every citizen. It is a story of ever greater \ninclusiveness--a tribute to the enduring promise of the American dream.\n  Together, we can reduce discrimination based on race, ethnicity, \nreligion, sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity.\n  I believe we can achieve equal rights for all. I believe our next \nstep in this ongoing struggle must be to secure the rights of the gay, \nlesbian, bisexual, and transgender community. We must start by stepping \nup our efforts to prevent hate crimes.\n  It is hard to believe that it has been over a decade since Matthew \nShepard was brutally beaten and left to die on a bitterly cold Wyoming \nroad. His story rightly sparked intense national debate about the \nnature of hate. It reminded us that if Matthew was vulnerable, anyone \ncould be vulnerable to such a vicious attack.\n  The thing that is particularly heinous about hate crimes is that they \nare not just an assault on an individual, they are intended as an \nindiscriminate assault on an entire community.\n  Our government has a moral obligation to say this is wrong, and we \nneed to make sure our law enforcement officers and our courts have all \nof the resources they need to deliver justice.\n  That is why I am proud to be a cosponsor of the bill inspired by \nMatthew's tragic story. I do not want to see another year go by without \nthe Matthew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Act as the law of the land.\n  But we must not stop there. Far too many gay and lesbian Americans \nface not just violence but other forms of discrimination in their daily \nlives.\n  We are fortunate in Illinois to have laws on the books to protect our \ncitizens from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender \nidentity. I believe those equal protections should be Federal law. I am \nalso a proud cosponsor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. It is \nthe fair thing to do, and it is the right thing to do, and it is far \noverdue.\n  Passing ENDA will not end all forms of discrimination. One of the \nworst forms of discrimination is not only destroying people's careers \nand lives, it is undermining our national security.\n  I am talking about the military's ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy.\n  To all of those who have served, and to those currently serving in \nour Armed Forces, let us say: Thank you--thank you to those who have \nserved. We honor your service. We honor your sacrifices. And we honor \nyour courage.\n  This Nation is a better, safer place because of them. They fight for \nthis Nation every day. We should end this offensive and discriminatory \npolicy so they can be the best soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines \nthey can be, while living their lives openly and honestly.\n  Especially in this time of war, when we face terrorist threats, we \nmust welcome the service of every patriotic man and woman who signs up \nto defend our freedom. When we dismiss the sacrifices made by those \nwith a different sexual orientation, we determine the strength--we \nundermine the strength--of our fighting forces.\n  When we fail to recognize the brave contributions that gay and \nlesbian servicemembers continue to make every single day, we diminish \nourselves as much as we diminish their service.\n  Senator Ted Kennedy has long been a leader on this issue, and I know \nhe wants to see legislation passed to end the ban. I support his \nimportant work and I will do all I can to support those efforts.\n  We will see justice, and not just in the military, but also for gay \nand lesbian families.\n  Last week, President Obama took a first step toward ending the \ninequality of gay and lesbian families when he extended certain \nbenefits to domestic partners of Federal employees. For the first time, \nsame-sex partners can be included in the Federal Long Term Care \nInsurance Program. Now any employee will be able to use sick leave to \ncare for a same-sex partner, just as an employee can take time off to \ncare for an opposite-sex spouse.\n  I applaud the President for beginning to tear down these inequities, \nbut while this Executive order represents an important initial step, \nthere is so much more to be done. The U.S. Government is far behind the \nprivate sector on this front. A large number of Fortune 500 companies \nalready offer comprehensive benefits to same-sex couples. They have \ndone so for many years, sometimes for over a decade. This allows them \nto compete for the best and brightest, attracting talented \nprofessionals regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. We \nneed to make sure the Federal Government is able to compete for the \nsame talented people.\n  I am proud to support a bill that would extend additional benefits to \nthe domestic partners of Federal workers. This legislation, introduced \nby my friend Chairman Lieberman and Ranking Member Collins, will extend \nthe full range of benefits to these couples. This includes access to \nthe same Federal health and retirement plan currently available to the \nrecognized spouses of government workers. As the free market has shown, \nextending these benefits to same-sex partners is not only the right \nthing to do, it also makes good business sense.\n  I know that this week, the many Pride events around the country mean \na lot of different things for people in the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and \ntransgender community. For some, it is a chance to reflect on the \nprogress and accomplishments made by this community and to organize for \nthe future. For others, it is an opportunity to reflect and to honor \nthose who have been lost to AIDS. And still for others, it is a chance \nto feel safer, to feel empowered to celebrate a part of something \nbigger than themselves, and to be reminded that everyone should be \nproud of who they are. However each of us celebrates Gay and Lesbian \nPride Month, we must remember that gender equality is far from over. \nBut just as the Emancipation Proclamation set this country on the path \nto racial equality, just as women's suffrage paved the way for gender \nequality, so that singular refrain throughout our history will be taken \nup again. The struggle for equality will not be easy,\n\n[[Page S7038]]\n\nand it never has been, but if we keep at it, we will get there.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, might I inquire what the status is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the executive nomination of Harold \nKoh.\n  Mr. ENZI. Are there time restrictions?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in postcloture, which requires debate \non the pending matter.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business for such time as I might consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need to \nreform our Nation's health care system. If we are to be successful, we \nmust undertake this effort with the greatest care and deliberation.\n  When it comes to health care reform, we have started down this road \nbefore. Last Congress, I proposed legislation called Ten Steps to \nTransform Health Care in America in an effort to provide a blueprint \nfrom which we could begin to address the challenge of improving our \nhealth care system.\n  I might mention the way that came about is that Senator Kennedy as \nthe chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, \nand I as the ranking member, worked together on a number of bills. In \nfact, I have quite a record for being able to work in a bipartisan way \nto get bills completed. We were very busy on the Higher Education Act \nand other education issues, so I took some leadership in the health \narea, and we talked about principles we wanted to achieve. Then I \ncollected ideas from both sides of the aisle and put together this \npackage of 10 steps that will transform health care in America as a \nblueprint to improve and address this challenge of improving our health \ncare system. So it isn't something on which he or I just started \nworking.\n  After I introduced the bill, I took my message of health care reform \ndirectly to the people in my State. I traveled 1,200 miles and held a \nseries of events in March of last year to provide the people of Wyoming \nwith the chance to see what I was working on and to voice their \nconcerns with our current system. Everywhere I went, I heard the same \nmessage repeated over and over, and that was that people want change. \nThey want a system that will provide them with a health care system \nthat is affordable, more available, and easier for them to access. \nSimply put, the people of Wyoming, as do people all across the country, \nwant more choices and more control over their health care. That was the \ngoal of my Ten Steps bill. It was drafted with the aim of leveling the \nplaying field in tax treatment of health insurance. It was also \nintended to provide a helping hand to low-income Americans in the form \nof subsidies that would ensure access to quality, affordable health \ninsurance.\n  As I traveled through the State, I also heard from members of the \nsmall business community. They made it clear that they wanted greater \nequity and access to a plan that would allow cross-State pooling so \nthey could band together with small business owners in other States and \nget better rates on the health insurance they provide to their \nemployees.\n  In the end, no matter whom I spoke with, they all had one message \nthey wanted me to bring to the Senate: Keep costs down and under \ncontrol. There have to be limits. That is why, as the only accountant \nin the Senate and as a member of the Budget Committee, I was and remain \nvery concerned with the effect any health care reform proposal will \nhave on our Federal budget, both in the short and the long term.\n  I can't be the only one who heard those things when I was back home. \nI think my experience on the road was very similar to that of almost \nevery one of my colleagues. Last year, whether they were campaigning \nfor themselves or for other members of our party, we logged on a lot of \ntravel miles. We met with and spoke to people from all walks of life \nwho came from every imaginable background. Some were from large cities \nand towns with large populations and others came from the smaller \ncities and some very small towns with fewer people and resources. \nWhomever we spoke to and wherever we were, we all heard the same \nconcerns: We need a better health care system, and we need it now.\n  In response, I was pleased to join with several of my colleagues as \nwe continued to work on health care reform this year. As the ranking \nmember on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions and in my service on the Senate Finance Committee, I have been \nworking to foster and facilitate a constructive dialog with my \ncolleagues on both committees. I have also met with the President and \nadministration officials on numerous occasions so we could share ideas \non how to best craft a strong, bipartisan bill. As the debate on health \ncare reform proceeds, I continue to stand ready to work on this \ncritical issue.\n  This is likely to be the most important legislation we will ever work \non as Members of the Senate, no matter how many terms we serve. How \nwell we handle this crucial issue will have an impact not just today \nbut for many tomorrows and countless years to come. If we fail to \nprovide the change that is needed, it may be a long time before the \nSenate will ever try to do this again.\n\n  I am convinced we have a perfect storm before us as we face this \nissue. The time is right, the political winds are with us, and we have \nthe support and encouragement of the current administration and the \npeople of this Nation to get something done. That is why a good bill \nand a bipartisan effort are well within our grasp.\n  If we are to do the work that is before us and do it well, however, \nwe can't have one side or the other try to grab the reins and lead the \neffort exclusively in their direction. The American people are looking \nfor us to solve the problem, and they want to know we wrote this bill \ntogether, amended it together, and, most importantly, finished it \ntogether. They know no one side has all the answers, so they do expect \nus to put partisanship aside. This is too important an issue not to \nfollow a path that will produce a bill that will have the support of 75 \nor 80 Members of the Senate. I have every belief we can do that, and \nthat is why I am so strongly committed to bringing massive change to \nthe policies laid out in the recently filed Kennedy bill. I will \ncontinue to try to bring that change to the work being done by the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and in the Finance \nCommittee.\n  Let me be very clear about what I believe we can do if we put \npartisanship aside and work together. We can draft a good bipartisan \nbill, one that will draw a large majority to its side, and we can get \nit done this year.\n  Last week, the HELP Committee began to mark up a very flawed piece of \nlegislation. I understand the difficult circumstances that brought \nSenator Dodd to chair this extraordinarily complex bill, and I \nappreciate Senator Dodd's willingness to take on the task, as he also \nchairs the Banking Committee. However, the legislation we are \nconsidering in the HELP Committee is broken, almost to the point of \nbeing beyond repair. It is too costly and it is incomplete. Of course, \nwe are promised we will get the other pieces of the bill. Arguments \nmade about the unfairness of estimating the cost of an incomplete bill \nshow that in the race to revamp our health care system, this bill was a \nfalse start. In order to get this right, we should slow down, and in \nsome areas we need to start over.\n  This shouldn't be a matter of speed. To stay with the analogy of \nhealth care, no one goes to a doctor or a surgeon based on how fast \nthey can operate or conduct an examination. It never matters how long \nit takes. All that matters is that they get it right. We should do the \nsame.\n  I am not suggesting that we come up with a new process to develop \nthis legislation. All I am saying is that we need to make better use of \nthe one we already have in place, the way we have always done things in \nthe Senate when we want to make sure we get it done right.\n  For instance, it wasn't all that long ago that we had to do something \nabout our Nation's pension system. We worked together. We talked about \nwhat we had to do together. Then we came up with a way to get there, \ntogether.\n\n[[Page S7039]]\n\nThe result was a bill that when it came to the floor was over 1,000 \npages long and it had the immense involvement of two committees--the \nsame two committees we are talking about with health care, the HELP \nCommittee and the Finance Committee. Those two committees came together \non a bill of over 1,000 pages. When it came to the floor, we already \nhad an agreement between the two committee members which was taken to \nthe leaders, which meant we had an agreement with everybody in the \nChamber that there would be 1 hour of debate, two amendments, and a \nfinal vote. I asked the Parliamentarian when the last time was that \nthere was a bill of that complexity that had that kind of an agreement \nbefore we even debated it, and that person said: Not in my lifetime. \nThat is what is possible around here if we work together. That is what \nwe did with the Nation's pension system.\n  I think we were talking about the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation being short a drastic $24 billion. Boy, that doesn't look \nlike much money anymore, does it? No. We are talking about some errors \non this one that are over $58 billion. That pensions bill wasn't so \nlong ago. We worked together, we talked about what we had to do \ntogether, and then we came up with it together. The result was a bill \nthat only had the two amendments offered to it because the agreement on \nboth the illness and the remedy was so strong.\n  As we prepared to begin the markup of this bill last week, we \nreceived a troubling preliminary analysis from the Congressional Budget \nOffice and the Joint Committee on Taxation regarding the costs and \ncoverage figures associated with the legislation. In its review of the \nproposal, the CBO found that enacting the proposal would result in an \nincrease in spending of about $1.3 trillion, with a net increase to the \nFederal budget deficit of about $1 trillion over the 2010-to-2019 \nperiod. This cost estimate did not include the promised ``significant \nexpansion of Medicaid or other options for subsidizing coverage for \nthose with an income below 150 percent of the poverty level.'' As the \nmarkup continues, we will be asking the CBO for an official analysis of \nthe impact of the addition of such a policy on the Federal budget \ndeficit.\n  We are having more and more seniors moving into the category of long-\nterm care--and we have a proposal before us, which we will debate when \nwe get back. The Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, ranking member \non the Budget Committee, pointed out that the only part of that \nproposal that gets scored are the premiums people would pay in over \nthat first 10 years for their long-term care, which comes to about $59 \nbillion, which shows a surplus of $59 billion. But what it doesn't take \ninto consideration is the obligation to those people who are paying in \nthose premiums that they will get long-term care.\n  The expected cost of that long-term care to those people paying in \nthat $59 billion is $2 trillion. The proposed payment doesn't match the \nproposed costs, and it would not be sustainable beyond the 10 years. \nWhether or not people actually start taking long-term care benefits \nright away, we will have another Federal Government program with a \nbudget deficit. At the same time we received notice of the preliminary \nanalysis of the Kennedy bill, we got word the Finance Committee was \npostponing the markup on health care legislation, after reports \nsurfaced that the CBO was preparing an estimate of its legislation that \nprojected an increase to the Federal deficit of $1.6 trillion over the \nnext 10 years. All of this was on the heels of President Obama's speech \nlast week at the American Medical Association, in which he said:\n\n       Health care reform must be and will be deficit neutral in \n     the next decade.\n\n  The bill we have before us misses the target of this commitment by \nmore than $1 trillion. Again, the bill is still missing language in \nthree key areas.\n  I will take a few moments to speak about our Nation's deficit and \noverall fiscal and economic condition. My concern about the runaway \nspending in the Kennedy bill--I should call it the Kennedy staff bill; \nI know the Senator, had he been able to work with me, would have come \nup with some different conclusions on the bill. My concern with the \nrunaway spending in the Kennedy staff bill is not simply a concern that \nit breaks faith with the President's health care reform commitments. \nRather, I am deeply troubled by the direction this bill would take us \nduring a truly perilous fiscal age.\n  I was elected to this body in 1996. In my first years in Congress, we \nmoved from a budget deficit to a budget surplus. I am deeply \ndisappointed that nearly 13 years later, our projected deficit for this \nfiscal year exceeds $1.84 trillion, and our national debt exceeds $11.4 \ntrillion. That is bad. People are starting to take notice, and that, \nunfortunately, includes our creditors. Add to this the losses to our \ngross domestic product and an unemployment rate heading toward 10 \npercent and the news is worse. Again, there have to be limits. People \nhave them in their families, municipalities have them, and most States \nhave them. The Federal Government doesn't.\n  According to the Federal Reserve, the level of debt-to-GDP ratio is \nestimated to reach the highest levels it has since immediately after \nWorld War II. The increasing spread between short-term and long-term \ntreasuries is evidence that global investors are increasingly concerned \nabout our Nation's level of debt and the real potential for future \ninflation.\n  In recent weeks, Treasury Secretary Geithner traveled to China to \nattempt to ease growing concerns about our ability to pay off our \ngrowing debts. When Geithner told an audience of Chinese students at \nPeking University that ``Chinese assets are very safe,'' reports are \nthat this statement drew loud laughter.\n  It is really not a laughing matter for us. It is serious. Tough \naction, not ``I will tell you what you want to hear'' speeches, is what \nwe need.\n  On the State and local front, our economic indicators are equally \ntroubling. On Thursday, the Rockefeller Institute of Government issued \na report on State personal income tax revenues for 2009. They are \nfalling fast; 34 of the 37 States in the report saw declines in tax \nrevenue, indicating that it will be increasingly more difficult than \nexpected for States to close their widening budget gaps. I can hear \ncalls for more bailouts, but my question is, who is going to bail out \nthe Federal Government?\n  These numbers provide the critical backdrop as we consider the new \ndeficit spending included in the Kennedy staff bill. Recently, Fed \nChairman Bernanke stated that ``achieving fiscal sustainability \nrequires that spending and deficits be well controlled.'' He went on to \nnote that ``unless we demonstrate a strong commitment to fiscal \nsustainability in the longer term, we will have neither financial \nstability nor economic growth.'' For these reasons, the Kennedy \nproposal requires an entire rewrite with respect to its impact on our \nFederal budget deficit.\n  Just as troubling as this bill's impact on the deficit is its failure \nto help tens of millions of Americans get the health insurance they \nneed. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that, if enacted, this \nbill would only provide health insurance for one-third of the Nation's \nuninsured. Let's see, $1 trillion for 16 million people. This number \nfalls far short of the President's stated goal of ``quality, affordable \nhealth insurance for all Americans'' in his recent letter to Chairmen \nKennedy and Baucus.\n  Of even greater concern, the CBO projects that about 10 million \nindividuals who would be covered through an employer's plan under \ncurrent law would not have access to that coverage under the Kennedy \nlegislation. This figure breaks President Obama's often-repeated \npromise during both the 2008 campaign and since taking office that \nunder his health care plan:\n\n       If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep \n     your health care plan, period. No one will take it away, no \n     matter what.\n\n  Under the Kennedy plan, that promise rings hollow for millions of \nAmericans, and that is simply unacceptable. I know the President has \nalready scheduled an event on one of the networks to push his health \ncare ideas. When it airs, I am sure we will hear him repeat the line \nover and over: If you like the health care plan you already have, you \ncan keep it.\n  If he makes that promise again, every time we hear him say that, we \nshould remind ourselves that the White House has already admitted that \nsuch statements aren't to be taken literally. I think that means they \nare not true.\n\n[[Page S7040]]\n\n  I cannot recall ever hearing something like that from the White \nHouse, but those are their words. Maybe they should be applied to the \nwhole presentation--that none of it should be taken literally.\n  I know one thing that can be taken literally, and we ought to give it \nstraight to the American people, and that is this: Under the Kennedy \nproposal being rolled out, you would not be able to keep the care you \nhave right now. Washington bureaucrats will be able to deny you and \nyour family the care you need and that you fully deserve.\n  Unfortunately, that is not the only thing that we are in denial \nabout. We are also in denial when it comes to the cost of the \nDemocrats' health care plan and our ability to work our way out of a \nhole of debt that only promises to grow deeper and deeper for a long \ntime and for many years to come.\n  A lot of times we talk about how we are spending our kids' and \ngrandkids' money. I really feel compelled to point out that we are \nalready spending our seniors' money. Why is that? Well, normally, what \nhappens in this country is that a little bit is taken--well, a bunch is \ntaken--out of your check for Social Security, which is matched by the \nemployer. That amount of money each month has always gone to pay the \nseniors who are retired, their pensions, and to have a little bit of \nsurplus. But do you know what? It is not doing that anymore. We are \nhaving to take money out of the trust funds now to supplement that to \nbe able to pay the people who are retired now--and we are not even to \nthe baby boomers yet. So we have a problem.\n  Unfortunately, that is not the only thing we are in denial about. \nHaving shown the devastating impact of the Kennedy bill on the Federal \ndeficit, and the failure of it to provide access to adequate health \ncoverage for millions of Americans, I want to turn to one of the three \nfoundational principles of my 10-step plan; namely, improving the \nquality of care.\n  On this front, I think the Kennedy plan again fails to live up to the \npromise laid out by President Obama to ``improve patient safety and \nquality of care.'' That is very important--to improve patient safety \nand quality of care.\n  I am deeply troubled by the real possibility that comparative \neffectiveness research, which is mentioned in the bill and has been \ndebated in the committee, and which has been held intact in there, will \nbe used as a cost-containment measure to ration care under this \nlegislation. The result would be, for millions of Americans, a Federal \nbureaucrat would dictate the type of care they receive and interfere \nwith the doctor-patient relationship.\n  As the Kennedy bill proceeds through Congress, I will fight to strip \nthose provisions that will delay and deny needed health coverage to \nAmericans. I spoke at length in committee about the truly horrible \nstories of rationing care that we hear about from the United Kingdom. I \nwill continue to speak out to make sure this type of so-called care is \nnot imported to the United States.\n  Finally, I am deeply troubled with a number of other policies \nadvanced in the Kennedy bill. I believe the community rating provisions \nwill result in skyrocketing premium costs for younger Americans. I am \ntroubled that the bill doesn't provide incentives to encourage \nindividuals to make healthier choices. There are a lot of choices we \ncan make to improve our health ourselves.\n  As we complete the second week of the HELP Committee markup, we are \nstill missing the guts of the Kennedy proposal. We expect that the \nfinal proposal will include a government-run plan, a mandate on \nemployers to provide insurance, and a provision dealing with \nbiosimilars. It is difficult to comment on these provisions until they \nare released.\n  Proponents of the government-run option--including the President--\nconsistently argue that a public plan is necessary to keep the \ninsurance companies honest and to foster competition. With respect to \nprovisions dealing with preexisting conditions, rate bands, and other \nreforms, we are all committed to taking action to keep insurers honest \nand make sure people with preexisting and chronic diseases can get \ninsurance. The creation of a new government program at a time when the \nexperts and Medicare trustees tell us that Medicare stands on the brink \nof insolvency, does nothing to foster honesty; it fosters fiscal \nirresponsibility. We are borrowing to pay for the government-run \nprograms we have now. If you already have trouble making your mortgage \npayments, why would you go out and buy a boat and an RV?\n  With respect to the notion that we will be fostering competition with \nthe creation of a government-run health plan, I think the public is \ngrowing tired of government intervention in our day-to-day lives. \nFirst, there was our involvement in the mortgage system and then the \nbanking system and then we got more involved in our Nation's automotive \nindustry. It is certainly more than a possibility that the government \nhas taken on more than it can handle. We are operating at more than the \nmaximum capacity already. Having government take over our Nation's \nhealth care system may be the last straw.\n  Think about that--about all the things that just this year the \ngovernment has decided to take over. The comment I get at home, and in \nother places I have traveled across the United States, is, doesn't the \ngovernment have a little bit of trouble just running government?\n  There is certainly a role for government as a strong regulator of \nfree market enterprise, but the inclusion of the government as a \nprincipal player in our competitive markets is entirely inconsistent \nwith our Nation's capitalist economic system. I will forcefully oppose \nthe creation of a government-run health plan.\n\n  Before I conclude, I would like to say a few words about the current \nprocess of health care reform in the Senate Finance Committee. I said \nat the outset that I am committed to working toward bipartisan health \ncare reform. As a member of the Finance Committee, I have witnessed and \nhave been a part of at least the foundations of such reform. There are \nmany hurdles to remain, but I thank Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member \nGrassley for their very hard work on this extremely complex, difficult \nissue. We have never had an issue that involved as many people in this \ncountry--100 percent of the people. It is important we get it right, \nthat we take the time to get it right. Ranking member Grassley has been \ncooperative and Chairman Baucus has been open and that has been \nextremely helpful. We have spent hours upon hours in that committee \nreceiving inputs and options from both sides on how to reform our \nNation's health care system.\n  This stands in great contrast to the partisan process that has, \nunfortunately, unfolded in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee we have been tediously working through. There have been \ncomments about how many amendments we turned in. We had 388 amendments. \nI had to remind them that if you don't get any piece of the drafting, \nyou have to get your opinions in somehow and you do it through multiple \namendments. Probably half those amendments were to fix grammatical \nerrors, punctuation, typos--about half of them. Those were accepted.\n  It is my hope that the difference in process will result in a \ndifference in substance between the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee legislation and the Finance Committee legislation. I \nwill continue to work in the Finance Committee to shape legislation \nthat improves the quality of our health care, reduces costs, is \nresponsible in its budgetary impact, and increases access to care for \nall the American people.\n  As I have said, there is a long way to go on that committee and many \ndifferences to resolve, but I continue to work in good faith and hope \nfor bipartisan, responsible health care reform. I am holding out hope a \nbetter, more inclusive process will emerge as we continue our work in \nthe HELP Committee. I hope that a change will come about soon, but the \nbill we currently have before us is a clear sign that just as we have \nbeen excluded early on in the health care reform effort, it looks like \nwe will continue to be excluded as the process continues. There is time \nto get us included. There is an important reason to get us included. \nBut we will see.\n  In the end, for me and many people across this country, our \ndiscussions\n\n[[Page S7041]]\n\nabout health care can be summed up in a short story with a simple \nmoral. I was reading a book about a Wyoming doctor who came home and \ndecided to settle in a town called Big Piney. He found some ranch land \nhe liked, and he decided to make it his home. When he was attending a \nlocal rodeo, one of the cowboys competing in the contest looked at him \nand said: You aren't from here, are you?\n  He said: Well, I am going to be, I am a doctor.\n  Unable to control his enthusiasm, the cowboy walked away shouting to \nall within earshot: Hey, we finally got ourselves a doctor.\n  That is what health care is all about in Wyoming, the West, and \ncountless towns and cities all across our country.\n  I have to tell you, this doctor spent most of his life in the Congo. \nHe studied Ebola and established a lot of health clinics over there. \nWhen he retired, he did move to Wyoming. He did health care the old-\nfashioned way. He made house calls. He sat with people while they were \ndying. He had a lot of friends over there. Incidentally, he did not \ntake Medicare or Medicaid. He said there were too many strings attached \nto it. He set up a foundation, and people he worked with could make a \ndonation to his foundation instead. That way he wouldn't violate any \nFederal rules about treating some people and taking money. He was a \ntremendous doctor. Unfortunately, we lost him this year. So that area \nis once again without a doctor. If you can send me one who likes \nrodeos, we would be happy to have him there. That is what health care \nin Wyoming is about.\n  In the big cities and towns of Chicago, New York, Boston, and Los \nAngeles, it seems to me there is a hospital or doctor's office on \nalmost every corner. In States such as Wyoming, however, they are few \nand far between, which makes health care a very precious commodity. I \nalways tell people the statistics are we are short every kind of \nprovider in Wyoming, including veterinarians, which always brings the \ncomment: Surely, veterinarians don't work on people. We say: Yes, if \nyou are far enough from a regular doctor, you are happy to have a \nveterinarian. You just hope he doesn't use the same medicines!\n  If we are not careful with this legislation, it will not make health \ncare more plentiful and abundant, it will make it even more rare and \ndifficult to obtain, and when health care gets more expensive and less \navailable in places such as the big cities in this Nation, imagine what \nit will be like in the small towns of Wyoming and the West. People back \nhome know what it will be like--another one-size-fits-all policy that \ndid not fit so well into the rural areas of this country to begin with. \nThat is why people are worried right now. The only way we can assure \nthem they do not have to worry is if we take the time to make sure we \nget it right the first time. Then, and only then, will the American \npeople feel like they will be getting what they said they wanted during \nour campaigns last year--not just change but change for the better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nas in morning business for the time I consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me say of my friend, the senior \nSenator from Wyoming, he does articulate this issue well. He has spent \ncountless hours working on it. When you listen to him, his depth of \nknowledge and trying to work out something that would give improvements \nand avoid a total socialization of medicine, he knows what he is \ntalking about.\n  When I go back to my State of Oklahoma, it is not all that different \nthan from when he goes back to his State of Wyoming and people ask the \nquestion: If government isn't working well now, why do we want to put \nall the rest of these things in government, whether it is health care \nor the banking industry, the insurance industry, oil and gas and the \nother takeovers we are witnessing right now?\n  I do think you can summarize what he said very simply by merely \nsaying, if there is a government option, of course, this is a moving \ntarget. For those of us who are not on a committee that is dealing with \nhealth care reform, we are not sure what is going on there, and I am \nnot sure anyone else does either because it is a moving target. From \none time to another, we hear different things that are going to be in \nthe bill, and then they change their mind.\n  One thing we know, though, they keep saying there is going to be a \ngovernment option. If there is a government option, we are going to see \na huge impact on insurers, private companies that offer insurance, and \nyou will see that market dwindling. You can't blame them for that.\n  The other thing that is a certainty in this whole issue of the \nKennedy bill and what they are trying to do, what the administration is \ntrying to do with the health delivery system in America is they would \nbe putting Washington between the patient and the doctor. That gets a \nresponse when I am back in Oklahoma of we don't want that to happen.\n  So we have right now a lot of invasions on the systems that have \nworked well in America.\n\n\n                          National Energy Tax\n\n  I wish to talk about one other issue since tomorrow the House is \nscheduled to vote on what is known as the Waxman-Markey bill, which is \nthe Democrat's answer to the worst recession in decades, a national \nenergy tax, a tax designed to impose economic pain through higher \nenergy prices and lost jobs or as a recent Washington Post editorial \nput it:\n\n       The bill contains regulations on everything from light bulb \n     standards to the specs on hot tubs and it will reshape \n     America's economy in dozens of ways that many don't realize.\n\n  In other words, this would be, if it were to pass, the largest tax \nincrease in the history of America. I know a little bit about this \nissue because I started working on this issue back in the late nineties \nwhen they were trying to get the United States to ratify the Kyoto \ntreaty. The Kyoto treaty is very similar to the proposals we have had \nsince that time. We know what that would have cost at that time. \nSomewhere between $300 billion and $330 billion a year as a permanent \ntax increase.\n  There have been proposals on the floor of the Senate in 2003, 2005, \n2007, 2008, and now this time. We in the Senate have more experience in \ndealing with this issue than the House does because this is the first \ntime they have ever had it up for consideration.\n\n  Over the past several weeks, Speaker Pelosi has been facing an \ninsurrection within her own ranks. We have been reading about the \nDemocrats who are pulling out saying: We don't want to be part of the \nlargest tax increase in the history of America. More and more people \nare jumping in and saying we cannot have it. As of yesterday, the \nAmerican Farm Bureau came in opposing, the strongest opposition to this \nlegislation.\n  Let me say, if the Democrats are having trouble passing this bill in \nthe House, where the majority can pass just about any bill it wants, \nthen there is no hope for a cap-and-trade bill to come out of the \nSenate. I think we know that. We watched it.\n  Right now, by my count, the most votes that could ever come for this \nlargest tax increase in the history of America would be 34 votes--34 \nvotes. They are not even close.\n  I say that because there are a lot of people wringing their hands: \nShe wouldn't bring this bill up in the House on Friday unless she had \nthe votes. Maybe she will have the votes. There has been a lot of \ntrading, a lot of people getting mad. Nonetheless, she may have bought \noff enough votes to make it a reality.\n  The fact is the Waxman-Markey bill is just the latest incarnation of \nvery costly cap-and-trade legislation that will have a very devastating \nimpact on the economy, cost American jobs by pushing them overseas, and \ndrastically increasing the size and scope of the Federal Government.\n  In the Senate, we have successfully defeated cap-and-trade \nlegislation in the years I mentioned. Four different times it has been \non the floor. I remember in 2005, I was the lead opposition to it. \nRepublicans were in the majority at that time. It had 5 days on the \nSenate floor, 10 hours a day, 50 hours. It was the McCain-Lieberman \nbill at\n\n[[Page S7042]]\n\nthat time. It was defeated then and by larger margins ever since then.\n  Just a year later, with the economy in a deep recession, it is hard \nto believe that many more Senators would dare vote in favor of \nlegislation that would not only increase the price of gas at the pump \nbut cost millions of American jobs, create a huge new bureaucracy, and \nraise taxes by record numbers. It is not going to happen.\n  I appreciate that my Democratic colleagues desperately want to pass \nthis bill. They argue that cap and trade is necessary to rid the world \nof global warming and to demonstrate America's leadership in this noble \ncause. But their strategy is all economic pain and no climate gain. \nThis is a global issue that demands a global solution. Yet cap-and-\ntrade advocates argue that aggressive unilateral--unilateral, that is \njust America; in other words, we pass the tax just on Americans--\naggressive unilateral action is necessary to persuade developing \ncountries--now we are talking about China, India, Mexico, and some \nother countries--to enact mandatory emission reductions. In other \nwords, we provide the leadership and they will follow. But recent \nactions by the Obama administration and by China and other developing \ncountries continue to prove just the opposite. They continue to confirm \nwhat I have been saying and arguing for the past decade, that even if \nwe do act, the rest of the world will not.\n  If you still believe--and there are fewer people every day who \nbelieve that science is settled--that manmade gases, anthropogenic \ngases, CO2, methane are causing global warming--there are a \nfew people left who believe that. If you are one of those who still \nbelieves that, stop and think: Why would we want to do something \nunilaterally in America? It doesn't make sense. The logic is not \ndifficult to understand.\n  Carbon caps, according to reams of independent analyses, will \nseverely damage America's global competitiveness, principally by \nraising the cost of doing business here relative to other countries \nsuch as China, where they have no mandatory carbon caps. So the jobs \nand businesses would move overseas, most likely to China.\n  This so-called leakage effect would tip the global economic balance \nin favor of China. A lot of them are saying China is going to follow \nour lead, they are going to do it. Look at this chart. This person is \nthe negotiator for the administration. His statement is: We don't \nexpect China to take a national cap-and-trade system. This is the guy \nwho is supposed to be in charge of seeing to it that they do. This is \nTodd Stern. He is admitting it.\n  I wish those people who come to the floor and say: Oh, no, we know \nthat if America leads the way, China is going to follow us--they are \nsitting back there just rejoicing, hoping we will go ahead and have a \nhuge cap-and-trade tax to drive our manufacturing jobs to places such \nas China where they don't have any real controls on emissions, and the \nresult would be an increase in CO2. In other words, if we \npass this huge tax in this country, it is going to have the resulting \neffect of increasing the amount of CO2 that is in the \natmosphere.\n\n  By itself, China has a vested interest in swearing off of carbon \nrestrictions in order to keep its economy growing and lifting its \npeople from poverty. Add unilateral Federal U.S. action into the mix, \nand we give China an even stronger reason to oppose mandatory \nreductions for its economy. And China understands this all too well. I \nbelieve they will actively and unfailingly pursue their economic self-\ninterest, which entails America acting alone to address global warming.\n  Consider that in other realms, whether on intellectual property \nrights or human rights. The Chinese have conspicuously failed to follow \nAmerica's example. We have tried to get them to do it, and they haven't \ndone it. All the human rights efforts we have gone through to try to \nget political prisoners released and all these other things we have \nsaid to them to do it--we have threatened, we have asked, we have \nbegged--and they do not do it. So why would they do this? So for China, \nclimate change will be no exception.\n  My colleagues in the Senate are rightly focused on the economic \neffects this bill will have on their States and their constituents. But \nwith China and other developing countries staunchly opposed to \naccepting any binding emissions requirements, we should be asking a \nmore fundamental question: What exactly are we doing this for? If the \ngoal of cap and trade is to reduce global temperatures by reducing \nglobal greenhouse gas concentrations, and if China and other leading \ncarbon emitters continue to emit at will, then how can this supposed \nproblem be solved?\n  Well, if I accept the alarmist science that anthropogenic gases are \ncausing a catastrophe, then reducing global greenhouse gas \nconcentrations is a solution. But the unilateral Federal solution, \nagain, that America must first act to persuade China and others to \nfollow--please follow us, please pass a tax in your own country, and \nthen they are going to be following our example--there is no evidence \nthat has ever happened before or that it would happen again. The only \nthing America gets by acting alone is a raw deal and a planet that is \nno better off.\n  Now, my Democratic colleagues want to sweep this reality under the \nrug. They argue that cap and trade--and I hope everyone understands \nwhat cap and trade is. I have often said, and other people have said--\nincluding some of the advocates of this--that they would prefer to have \na carbon tax over cap and trade. Well, if you are going to have one or \nthe other, I would too. But the only reason they use cap and trade is \nto hide the fact that this is a tax--a very large tax increase. So they \nargue that cap and trade will not only be at least to pull China along, \nbut also it will solve our economic woes, create millions of new green \njobs, and promote energy security.\n  Of course, these are laudable goals, and Republicans have a simple \nanswer to this: Let's provide the incentives rather than the taxes and \nmandates to produce clean, affordable, and reliable sources of energy.\n  I am for all of the above. I want to have renewables, I want nuclear, \nI want wind, I want solar, I want clean coal, and natural gas. We need \nit all. Cut the redtape and encourage private investment. Let all \ntechnologies compete in the marketplace. However, that is not what the \nDemocrats are proposing in the Waxman-Markey bill.\n  I am talking on the Senate floor about a House bill, and I am doing \nthat because it is scheduled to pass tomorrow and then there will be an \neffort over here. We have had experience with this legislation. As I \nhave said before, it is not going to pass here, but it is a very \nsignificant thing. Anytime one House is proposing to pass the largest \ntax increase in history, we have to be concerned.\n  This bill does the exact opposite. It closes access to affordable \nsources of energy by trying to price certain kinds of energy out of the \nmarket. It picks winners and losers that leave places such as the \nMidwest and the South paying higher energy prices to subsidize areas in \nthe rest of the country. We have a chart that shows how much this would \nraise in the way of taxes in Middle America as opposed to the east \ncoast and the west coast, and it creates more bureaucracy that will \nonly increase the costs that consumers bear and add more layers of \nregulation to small business.\n  We have to ask: Why, then, do my colleagues believe creating a \nnational energy tax is necessary? It is all rooted in fabricated global \nwarming science. In fact, just last week, the administration produced \nyet another alarmist report on global warming--which, of course, is \nnothing new--that takes the worst possible predictions of the United \nNations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment \nReport--is what it is called.\n  By the way, these assessment reports are not reports by scientists. \nThey are reports by political people, policy people. I have to also \nsay--and I have said this on the floor of the Senate many times \nbefore--a lot of the things that come out and that are not in the best \ninterests of the United States come from the United Nations. That is \nwhere this whole thing started, back in the middle 1990s.\n  It was the IPCC of the United Nations where it all started. So it is \nno surprise that such a report was released just in time for the House \nvote on Waxman-Markey. However, what is becoming clear is that despite \nmillions of dollars spent on advertising, the American public has \nclearly rejected\n\n[[Page S7043]]\n\nthe so-called ``consensus'' on global warming. There was a time when \nthis wasn't true. I can remember back between the years of 1998 and \n2005, when I would be standing on the Senate floor and talking about \nthe science that rejects this notion. Since that time, hundreds and \nhundreds of scientists who were on the other side of the issue have \ncome over to the skeptic side, saying: Wait a minute, this isn't really \ntrue.\n  I can name names: Claude Allegre was perhaps considered by some \npeople to be the top scientist in all of France. He used to be on Al \nGore's side of this issue back in the late 1990s. Clearly, he is now \nsaying: Wait a minute, we have reevaluated, and the science just isn't \nthere. David Bellamy, one of the top scientists in the U.K., the same \nthing is true there. He was on the other side and came over. Nieve \nSharif from Israel, same thing. So there is no consensus on the fact \nthat they think anthropogenic gases are causing global warming.\n  Of course, the other thing is, we don't have global warming right \nnow. We are in our fourth year of a cooling spell. But that is beside \nthe point. I am not here to address the science today but on the \nargument advanced by my colleagues, which is that U.S. unilateral \naction on global warming will compel other nations to follow our lead, \nas I have documented in speeches before since 1998.\n  By the way, if anyone wants--any of my colleagues--to look up those \nspeeches, they can be found at inhofe.senate.gov. If you have insomnia \nsome night, it might be a good idea to read them. They are all about 2 \nhours long. But I think many would find it very troubling indeed, that \neven if they believe the flawed IPCC or United Nations science, that \nscience dictates that any unilateral action by the United States will \nbe completely ineffective. The EPA even confirmed it last year during \nthe debate on the Lieberman-Warner bill, and the same would hold true \nfor this year's bill.\n  Put simply, any isolated U.S. attempt to avert global warming is a \nfutile effort without meaningful, robust international cooperation. No \none disputes this fact. The American people need to know what they will \nbe getting with their money: all cost and no benefit. This chart shows \nthat U.S. action without international action will have no effect on \nworld CO2. This is assuming there is no change in the \nmanufacturing base, which we know there would be.\n  This brings us to a key question as to whether a new robust \ninternational agreement can ever be achieved. In addition to the \ndomestic process ongoing in Congress, the United States is currently \ninvolved in negotiations for a new international climate change \nagreement to replace the flawed Kyoto treaty. This process is scheduled \nto culminate in Copenhagen this December. This will be the big bash put \non by the United Nations to encourage countries to buy into their \nprogram.\n  The prospects of such an endeavor are bleak at best. Following the \nconclusion of the climate meeting in Bonn recently, the U.N.'s top \nclimate official--Yvo de Boer--said it would be physically impossible--\nnow this is the chief advocate of all this--to have a detailed \nagreement by December in Copenhagen. This is ironic to say the least, \nconsidering that President Obama was supposed to bring all the parties \ntogether to transcend their differences and to produce a treaty that \nwould save the world from global warming. But the reality of the cost \nof carbon reductions has intervened, and now a deal appears--as it \nalways has to me and others--far from achievable.\n  We must not forget where the Senate stands on global warming. As \nSenators may recall, in 1997, the Senate voted favorably, 95 to 0--95 \nto 0 doesn't happen often in this Chamber--on the Byrd-Hagel \nresolution. That stated simply that if you go to Kyoto and you bring \nback a treaty, we will not ratify that treaty if it, No. 1, would \nmandate greenhouse gas reductions from the United States without also \nrequiring new specific commitments from developing countries--China--\nover the same compliance period; or, No. 2, result in serious economic \nharm to the United States.\n  Well, obviously, we have talked about the serious harm to the United \nStates and the fact there is no intention at all of having China have \nto be a part of this new treaty now, what, 15 years later they are \ngoing to be talking about. So I think the Byrd-Hagel resolution will \nstill stand strong support in the Senate; therefore, any treaty the \nObama administration submits must meet the resolution's criteria or it \nwill be easily defeated.\n  Remember that criteria: If they submit something in which the United \nStates is going to have to do something that the rest of the world--or \nthe developing world--doesn't have to do, then it is not going to pass; \nand, secondly, if it inflicts economic harm on this country.\n  Proponents of securing an international treaty are slowly \nacknowledging that the gulf is widening between what the United States \nand other industrialized nations are willing to do and what developing \ncountries such as China want them to do. I suggest the gulf has always \nbeen wide but will continue to widen. Recent actions by the United \nStates and China continue to confirm my belief.\n  Take China's initial reaction to the Waxman-Markey bill. The bill, \nhailed on Capitol Hill as a historic breakthrough, went over with a \nthud last week during the international negotiations. Get this: Waxman-\nMarkey, which will be economically ruinous for the United States, was \ncriticized by China for being too weak.\n  Another troubling aspect coming out of those meetings was the U.S. \nGovernment's official submission. Many in the Senate may be surprised \nto learn that this administration's position is to let China off the \nhook. You might wonder, why would China look at this thing that would \ndestroy us economically and say they do not think it is strong enough; \nthat they want it stronger? Because the stronger it is, the more \nmanufacturing jobs will leave the United States to go to China. They \nhave to go someplace where they are producing energy. Nowhere in the \nsubmission to the conference do we require China to submit to any \nbinding emission reduction requirements before 2020. In fact, before \n2020, the submission only asks for ``nationally appropriate'' \nmitigation actions, followed by a ``low carbon strategy for long-term \nnet emissions reductions by 2050.''\n  I would submit this proposal is typical of the United States to say: \nWell, we have to do some face-saving, so at least let's put them in an \nawkward position of having to ``try'' to do something. It doesn't say \nthey ``have'' to do anything; they have to try. So China can sit back \nand say: We are trying. Meanwhile, they enjoy all the jobs that are \ncoming from the United States to China.\n  So what, then, is the Chinese Government's idea of a fair and \nbalanced global treaty? Well, the Chinese believe the United States and \nother Western nations should, at a minimum, reduce their greenhouse gas \nemissions by 40 percent below the 1990 levels by 2020. For comparison's \nsake, Waxman-Markey, which could become the official U.S. negotiating \nposition, calls for a 17-percent reduction--not 40 percent--below the \n2005 levels by 2020.\n  Despite the positive spin the administration is putting on actions by \nthe Chinese Government to reduce energy intensely or pass a renewable \nenergy standard, while laudable, the official position of the Chinese \nin their submission to the United States remains as such, which I will \nread.\n\n       The right to development is a basic human right that is \n     undeprivable. Economic and social development and poverty \n     eradication are the first and overriding priorities of the \n     developing nations.\n\n  So China is talking about themselves and India and other developing \nnations.\n\n       The right to development of developing countries shall be \n     adequately and effectively respected and ensured in the \n     process of global common efforts in fighting against climate \n     change.\n\n  That is their written statement, and that speaks for itself.\n  Finally, and the most telling of all, the Chinese and other \ndeveloping countries collectively argue that the price for reducing \ntheir emissions is a massive 1 percent of GDP from the United States \nand other developed countries. What does that tell us? That tells us \nthey are not willing to pay anything.\n  So let me get this straight. China opposes any binding emission \nreduction targets on itself; China wants the United States to accept \ndraconian emission reduction targets that will continue to cripple the \nU.S. economy;\n\n[[Page S7044]]\n\nand on top of that, China wants the United States to subsidize its \neconomy with billions of dollars in foreign aid. In the final analysis, \none must give China credit for seeking its economic self-interest. I \nsure hope the Obama administration will do the same for America.\n  Despite this reality, some here in the Senate will continue to tout \nthe fact that China's new self-imposed emissions intensity reductions, \nwhich do not pose any type of binding reductions requirements, will \nsomehow miraculously appear--will somehow suffice for binding \nrequirements. I believe, however, that position will fail to satisfy \nthe American people as acceptable justifications for passage of a bill \nthat will result in higher United States energy taxes and no change in \nthe climate.\n  I do not blame them. If I were in China, I would be trying to do the \nsame thing. I would be over there saying we want the United States to \nincrease their energy taxes, we want a cap-and-trade bill, an \naggressive one that is going to impose a tax--now it is expected to \nbe--MIT had figures far above the $350 billion a year.\n  That is not a one-shot deal. I stood here on the Senate floor \nobjecting last October when we were voting on a $700 billion bailout. I \ncan't believe some of our Republicans, along with virtually most of the \nDemocrats, voted for this. I talked about how much $700 billion is. If \nyou do your math and take all the families who file tax returns, it \ncomes out $5,000 a family.\n  At least that is a one-shot deal. What we are talking about here is a \ntax of somewhere around $350 billion every year on the American people \nand the bottom line is, China wants no restrictions for theirs. They \nwant the highest reductions for the United States and they want foreign \naid on top of that.\n  I want to mention one other thing that just came up in today's \nChicago Tribune. I read this because the Chicago Tribune has \neditorialized in favor of the notion that anthropogenic gases are \nresponsible for global warming. I will read this:\n\n       Democratic leaders need to slow down. This proposed \n     legislation would affect every American individual and \n     company for generations. There's a huge amount of money at \n     stake: $845 billion for the federal government in the first \n     10 years. Untold thousands of jobs created--or lost. This \n     requires careful study, not a Springfield-style here's-the-\n     bill-let's-vote rush job.\n\n  Then:\n\n       The bill's sponsors are still trying to resolve questions \n     over whether and how to impose sanctions on countries that do \n     not limit emissions. That's crucial.\n\n  That is exactly what we have been saying. Even the Chicago Tribune \nagrees with that.\n\n       That's crucial. Those foreign countries would enjoy a cost \n     advantage in manufacturing if their industries were free to \n     pollute, while American industries picked up the tab for \n     controlling emissions. The Democrats need to delay the vote. \n     Otherwise, the House Members should vote no.\n\n  That came out today in the Chicago Tribune. Even the Chicago Tribune \nsays there should not be a vote, but there is going to be a vote. I \ncan't imagine that Speaker Pelosi would bring this up for a vote unless \nshe had the votes.\n  What is the motivation for this, knowing full well it will not pass \nthe Senate? I mentioned Copenhagen a moment ago--the big meeting of the \nUnited Nations, all these people saying America should pass these tax \nincreases. They have to take something up there that will make it look \nas though America is going to be taking some kind of leadership role. \nThey are not going to do it. If they take the bill passed out of the \nHouse, I expect one will be passed out of the Senate committee--because \nthat committee will pass about anything--they will take that to \nCopenhagen. Everyone will rejoice up there and come back only to find \nout we are not going to join in.\n  I am sure there is going to be some type of a treaty that is given to \nthe Senate to ratify. We will all have to remember what happened in \n1997. We voted 95 to 0 against ratifying any treaty that is either \nharmful to us economically or is not going to impose the same hardship \nand taxes on developing countries such as China as it does on the \nUnited States.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado).

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Global Warming\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I did not plan to come down to the floor \nand speak today about the global warming legislation. But I heard bits \nand pieces of my friend Senator Inhofe's speech about essentially why \nwe will never approve global warming legislation, why it is a bad idea, \nand his usual litany of ``horribles'' about what will happen. My friend \nSenator Inhofe and I work very well together on most issues that come \nbefore our committee when it comes to building the infrastructure; the \nState Revolving Fund, we have been a team; the highway trust fund, we \nhave been a team. He has been very helpful on most of our nominees, if \nnot all. So I am very grateful to him. But I could not allow his words \nto be the last word here on the global warming legislation as we get \nready to leave for our week to go home and work.\n  I disagree very strongly with those who say that if we attack the \nproblem with global warming head-on, we are moving into territory where \nwe are\n\n[[Page S7045]]\n\ngoing to regret the fact that we did it because it is going to hurt our \npeople, we are going to lose jobs, it is going to increase energy \ncosts, when, in fact, we know the opposite is true. It is not just me \nsaying it. I come from a State--California--where we have taken the \nlead in addressing the environment. We always have since the very early \ndays. And what we have proven is that when you do it, you have a much \nhealthier base for economic growth.\n  If you look at the per capita use of energy in my home State over the \nlast 20 years, it has stayed absolutely flat, if you were to look at a \ngraph. The rest of the country has gone up like this. So the difference \nbetween remaining on a flat line--in other words, keeping your per \ncapita energy use stable--even with the creation in that time of \ncomputers and bigger TVs and all the rest, and a lot of other comforts, \nI might add--bigger homes--we have been able to do it. The rest of the \ncountry has gone this way with their per capita use. The difference \nbetween energy efficiency and the rest of the country, we have a lot of \nroom for improvement, and it has been tried and it is proven and it \nmakes a lot of sense, whether it is better energy-efficiency standards, \nwhich have been absolutely key to us, or better fuel economy, which has \nbeen key to us. We are the State that happens to buy the most, for \nexample, hybrid cars. We have shown that we can keep per capita energy \nuse down. A lot of us in our State have changed to the lightbulbs that \nmake sense, the compact fluorescent bulbs. We know we have laws that \nwill move that even faster. And we have not given up one ounce of our \nquality of life. We have a very good quality of life.\n  So by addressing the issue of global warming and getting the carbon \nout of the air, the first way to do it is through energy efficiency. \nThat is what I call the low-hanging fruit. Renewable standards for our \nutilities--very important. We have done it in California, and I know my \nfriend who is in the chair is on the Energy Committee, and I am very \ngrateful they did renewable portfolio standards, although I would like \nto see it a little tougher. Be that as it may, we are on the road.\n  These are the things we can do that actually will tackle the problem \nof global warming, but there is so much more we can do through a system \nwhere we expect our industries that are emitting the most carbon to \ngradually bring it down so that we make sure we don't suffer the \nravages of increased temperatures.\n  The science is so clear, and my friend Senator Inhofe and I have \ndisputed this for a long time. He insists that the science is not \nclear. Well, he is not a scientist and I am not a scientist. So I think \nthe best way to do this is to look to the most qualified scientists in \nthe world. And we are very fortunate that we have had those scientists \nworking at the United Nations, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange, and they have come out with a series of reports, all of which \ntell us that temperatures are going up even more rapidly than we \nthought, the icemelt in the Arctic is occurring faster than we thought \nwould happen. We all see the pictures of the polar bears. That picture \nis worth so much to us because we can see what is happening to the \nhabitat there.\n  I will be leading a trip to Alaska for a couple of days at the \ninvitation of Senator Mark Begich. He wants to show me and a group of \nSenators--and also Senator Murkowski has been gracious enough to say \nshe will join us in this. We are going to see ground zero for global \nwarming in Alaska. I know in Greenland, where I went, you can just see \nthe ice melt. You can sit and actually see the ice break off from these \ngiant icebergs and watch them go out to sea.\n  So the scientists have proven it, and we know it is absolutely true. \nSo when Senator Inhofe comes down here and he flies in the face of \nscience, those of us who have been working on this--and I see one of \nour great leaders, not only, I say this, in the Senate but, frankly, in \nthe country and even in the world community, John Kerry, who has joined \nus. Just for his information, I will be speaking for about another 10 \nminutes, and then I am going to be so happy to sit and hear him because \nhe has such an important vision on this.\n  But here is the good news. The good news is that this is an enormous \nopportunity to move our country forward. Again, I could quote Thomas \nFriedman, who did an extraordinary job of writing books and articles, \nand he testified before the Committee on Environment and Public Works \nvery clearly on this, that the country that does this now and does it \nright and sets up a price on carbon--and I am sure he now knows that a \ncap-and-trade system is a very good way to do that--is going to be the \nleader in the world, not just an environmental leader, which is very \nimportant for our kids and our grandkids--we don't want to turn over a \nplanet to them where temperatures are so high that we see people dying \nin the summer from the high temperatures or see our kids swimming in \nrivers that have turned so warm that organisms now live in those \nrivers. We have seen some of that already happen, where toxins exist \nthat couldn't exist before, where we can be harmed because of the kind \nof life that lives in these warmer waters that can, in fact, harm our \nchildren. So we do not want to know those stories. We do not want to \nsee hordes of refugees coming to our shores because countries are \ninundated due to rising seas.\n  Look, our own national security teams--the Department of Defense, the \nCIA--all of those that worry so much about national security--have told \nus--and Senator Kerry has the quotes chapter and verse--that this is a \nnational security issue.\n  So when my friend from Oklahoma comes down here and says: Don't worry \nabout it, you know, don't worry about it at all, the science is \ndivided, it is just not so, just not so.\n  I guess there were always people who said smoking doesn't cause \ncancer. I guess there still are. I guess there are some people who say \nHIV doesn't cause AIDS. You know, I know there were people when I was a \nkid who said: Forget about polio, there is nothing you can do about it. \nBut Dr. Jonas Salk figured out we could do something about it.\n  The science is clear. The world is getting warmer. Yes, to a certain \ndegree, we can handle it, but above that it gets very dangerous. None \nother than the Bush administration's CDC, the Centers for Disease \nControl, told us that it is unequivocal that the dangers are lurking. \nThey started the work to say that there would be an endangerment \nfinding, that our people are in danger if we don't act. And now \nPresident Obama sees it clearly, and his EPA has picked up the ball and \nthey have issued a draft finding that we are in danger. So Senator \nInhofe and other Senators can stand up and say that we are not, but \nthis work started in the Bush administration, and Bush administration \nofficials participated in a lot of these U.N. meetings. So it is clear.\n\n  We have a great recession we are dealing with, and we have this great \nchallenge of global warming. The great news is that when we act to \nsolve global warming, we act to solve the problem of this great \nrecession. Why do I say that? Because we know from the venture \ncapitalists, many of whom live in the Silicon Valley, that the amount \nof funding from the private sector, not the public sector, that is \ngoing to flow into clean energy is going to dwarf that that went into \nthe computer industry, that went into high-tech and biotech. This is \ntestimony from those who are venture capitalists. And that, matched \nwith the cap-and-trade system, which will have the ability to really \nhelp agriculture, which will have the ability to help our \nmanufacturers, which will have the ability to make sure we have fair \ntrade at the border when products come in, that means we are going to \nsee technologies invented, cleanups start to happen, we will stop the \nravages of global warming, and eventually, when all of this technology \nkicks in, the average family is going to pay less for their \nelectricity. In the short run, if you have to pay just a little more--\nand I mean a little more, like 50 cents a day more maybe, probably \nless--we have the wherewithal to give you a credit for that funding.\n  I think the House of Representatives has worked very hard to make \nsure they have the bill that will keep people whole, that will \ntransform this economy to a clean energy economy, will get us off \nforeign oil, which is only to the good.\n  You know, Iran has been in the news, and our hearts go out to those \nwho are\n\n[[Page S7046]]\n\ntrying to take their country back, if I could say that. We all stand \nwith those demonstrators. We will not forget what they have gone \nthrough in their struggle.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when I am done, Senator Kerry finish \nthis time on global warming, followed by Senator Coburn if he would \nlike to be recognized at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Good.\n  So what Thomas Friedman--again, writing his great column, as he \ndoes--says is that Iran would not be such a formidable power in the \nworld if oil was not so sought after in the world.\n  We do not buy any Iranian oil for obvious reasons, but the rest of \nthe world does. The fact is, if we can create these clean alternatives, \nit is going to make every difference--every difference--in the world.\n  So in closing--and I am so pleased Senator Kerry is here--let me say \nthis: My ranking member, Jim Inhofe, made a comment. I just want to say \nwe are good friends, and anything I say here I say to him, and vice \nversa. My ranking member said in the press--and I do not know if \nSenator Kerry saw this--my ranking member, Senator Inhofe, said to me \nin the press I should get a life--get a life--and stop trying to pass \nglobal warming legislation because it is not going to happen.\n  I want to say to him very clearly today, I have a life, and I am \nspending it getting the votes I need to make sure we take advantage of \nthis momentous opportunity. I want to thank those over in the House who \nseem to understand this golden moment of opportunity for our economy, \nfor our foreign policy, for the creation of millions of new jobs, for \nenergy independence--that is what they are fighting for over there--and \nfor great opportunities for our agricultural sector, our manufacturing \nsector.\n  This is an opportunity we should not lose. I am very pleased at the \nprogress we are making over here, and I want to send that signal: We \nare making great progress.\n  Mr. President, I thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is operating under cloture on the \nnomination of Harold Koh.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, has the time for a vote been set at this \npoint?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not.\n  Mr. KERRY. It is not set. I thank the Chair.\n  With that in mind, I think the leadership is hopeful of trying to get \nthat vote somewhere in the near term.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, could I ask the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts if he would yield for a unanimous consent request or two?\n  Mr. KERRY. Of course, I will yield, Mr. President.\n  Mr. REID. As usual, I appreciate the courtesy of my friend from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all postcloture time be \nyielded back except for 30 minutes and that time be divided as follows: \n10 minutes for Senator Kerry--and we can count the time he has already \nused. Does the Senator need more time? OK--10 minutes for Senator \nKerry, 10 minutes for Senator Cornyn, 10 minutes for Senator Coburn, or \ntheir designees; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate \nproceed to vote on the confirmation of the nomination; that upon \nconfirmation, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction, and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would ask to modify the consent request \nthat instead of 10, 10, and 10, Senator Kerry be given 15 minutes and \nSenator Cornyn be given 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 2918\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon \ndisposition of the Koh nomination, and the Senate resuming legislative \nsession, the Senate then move to proceed to the consideration of \nCalendar No. 84, H.R. 2918, the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act; \nthat the motion be agreed to, and once the bill is reported, a Nelson \nof Nebraska substitute amendment, which is at the desk, be called up \nfor consideration; further that the following be the only first-degree \namendments and motion in order: McCain, Nebraska photo exhibit; Coburn, \nonline disclosure of Senate spending; DeMint, Visitor Center \ninscription: ``In God We Trust''; Vitter, motion to commit, 2009 \nlevels; DeMint, audit reform Federal Reserve; that upon disposition of \nthe amendments and motion, the substitute amendment, as amended, if \namended, be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; that the bill, as amended, be read a third time, and the Senate \nthen proceed to vote on passage of the bill; that upon passage, the \nSenate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House on \nthe disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and that the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate; provided \nfurther that if a point of order is raised against the substitute \namendment, then it be in order for another substitute amendment to be \noffered minus the offending provisions but including any amendments \nwhich had been agreed to; and that no further amendments be in order; \nand that the substitute amendment, as amended, if amended, be agreed \nto, and the remaining provisions beyond adoption of the substitute \namendment remain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, could I have a 5-minute notice from the \nParliamentarian?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/25/senate-section/article/S7046-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7046-S7051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to make some closing comments with \nrespect to the nomination of Dean Koh. But before I do that, I want to \nhave a chance to share a few thoughts with the distinguished chairman \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee, who has been an \nextraordinary leader on this subject of global climate change.\n  Let me be the first to affirm that I rather think the Senator has a \nterrific life, and I am proud of what she is doing with respect to this \nissue. It is really interesting. I think it is important for us to talk \nabout a few of the issues.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, has made some comments on the \nfloor of the Senate that are either wrong on the facts or wrong in \nterms of the judgment politically.\n  I want to say upfront, as my colleague has said, I enjoy my \nconversations and my relationship with the Senator enormously. We are \nboth pilots. He flies often, much more frequently than I do these days, \nbut we both share a passion for flight and for aerobatics, and for \ndifferent kinds of airplanes, and I love talking to him about them.\n  I wish he were up to state of the art with respect to the science on \nglobal climate change. He made a number of comments on the floor of the \nSenate which Senator Boxer and I just have to set the record straight \non: No. 1, suggesting that the science is somehow divided. That is \nmyth. It is wishful thinking, perhaps, on the part of some people. I \nsuppose if your definition of divided is that you have 5,000 people \nover here and 2 people over here--who want to put together a point of \nview that is usually encouraged and, in fact, paid for by a particular \nindustry or something--you can claim it is divided.\n  But by any peer review standard, by any judgment of the broadest \narray of scientists in the world--not just the United States, across \nthe planet--the science is not divided. The fact is, Presidents of \ncountries are committing their countries to major initiatives on global \nclimate change.\n  The science is clearly not divided with respect to global climate \nchange. In fact, every major scientist in the United States whose life \nhas been devoted to this effort, such as Jim Hansen at NASA, or John \nHoldren, the\n\n[[Page S7047]]\n\nPresident's Science Adviser--formerly at Harvard--these people will \ntell you in private warnings that are even far more urgent than the \nwarnings they give in public. The reason is, the science is coming back \nat a faster rate and to a greater degree in terms of the damage that \nwas predicted than any of these people had predicted.\n  The fact is, there is a recent study about the melting of the \npermafrost lid of the planet. It shows in the Arctic--this is the \nSiberian Shelf Study, which I would ask my colleague from Oklahoma to \nread--columns of methane rising up out of the sea level, and if you \nlight a match where those columns break out into the open air, it will \nignite. Those columns of methane represent a gas that is 20 times more \ndamaging and dangerous than carbon dioxide, and it is now--as the \npermafrost melts--uncontrollably being released into the atmosphere.\n  In addition to that, there is an ice shelf, the Wilkins Ice Shelf, \ndown in Antarctica. A 25-mile ice bridge connected the Wilkins Ice \nShelf to the mainland of Antarctica. That shattered. It just broke \napart months ago. Now we have an ice shelf that for centuries--\nthousands of years--was connected to the continent that is no longer \nconnected.\n  We have sea ice which is melting at a rate where the Arctic Ocean is \nincreasingly exposed. In 5 years, scientists predict we will have the \nfirst ice-free Arctic summer. That exposes more ocean to sunlight. The \nocean is dark. It consumes more of the heat from the sunlight, which \nthen accelerates the rate of the melting and warming, rather than the \nice sheet and the snow that used to reflect it back into the \natmosphere.\n  There are countless examples of evidence of what global climate \nchange is already doing across the planet. In Newtok, AK, they just \nvoted to move their village 9 miles inland because of what is happening \nwith the sea ice melt and the melting of the permafrost. We will spend \nmillions of dollars mitigating and adapting to these changes as they \ncome at us.\n  The Audubon Society has reported a 100-mile wide swath of land in the \nUnited States where their gardeners--who do not record themselves as \nDemocrats or Republicans, ideologues, conservatives, or liberals; they \nare people who like to go out and garden; they are part of the Audubon \nSociety as a result of that--are reporting plants they can no longer \nplant that used to be able to be planted.\n  We have millions of acres of forests in Alaska and in Canada that \nhave been lost: spruce and pine to the spruce beetle that used to die, \nbut because it is warmer, now it no longer dies. You can run down a \nlong list.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to go through all of it here now, but \nsuffice it to say, he is wrong about China. I just came back from a \nweek in China where I met with their leaders. I went out to see what \nthey are doing in wind power. I went to see their energy conservation \nefforts. They are ahead of us in some respects with respect to those \nefforts. They have a higher standard of automobile emissions reduction \nthat they are putting in place sooner than we are. They are tripling \ntheir level of wind power that they are trying to target. They have a \n20-percent energy intensity reduction level that they are now exceeding \nin several sectors of their economy, which they did not think they \nwould be able to do. In 2 or 3 years, we are going to be chasing China \nif we do not recognize what has happened and do this.\n  So the Senator from California, the chairperson of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee, completely understands, as do many others, \nthis can be done without great cost to our electric production \nfacilities, without our companies losing business and losing jobs. On \nthe contrary, the jobs of the future are going to be in alternative and \nrenewable energy and in the energy future of this country.\n  There is barely a person I know who does not think we would not be \nbetter off in America not sending $700 billion a year to the Middle \nEast to pay for oil so we can blow it up in the sky and pollute and \nturn around and try to figure out how we are going to spend billions to \nundo it. Why not spend those $700 billion in the United States creating \nthat energy in the first place, with jobs that do not get sent abroad, \nand which pay people good value for the job they are doing? It \nliberates America for our energy security. It provides a better \nenvironment. We are a healthier nation, and we increase our economy. So \nyou get all those pluses. What are they offering? What is the \nalternative that Senator Inhofe and others are offering? If they are \nwrong in their predictions, we have catastrophe for the planet.\n\n  So I think we are on the right track. China is going to reduce \nemissions. China will be on a different schedule because that is what \nthe international agreements set up years ago. But as a developing \ncountry with 800 million people living on less than $2 a day, it is \nunderstandable that they would fight to say: We can't quite meet the \nsame schedule now, but we will get to the same schedule. What is \nimportant is that, globally, all countries come together to reduce \nemissions. That will happen in Copenhagen. It is much more likely to \nhappen in Copenhagen if the United States of America leads here at \nhome. If we undertake these efforts and pass legislation here, I \nguarantee my colleagues that Copenhagen will be a success and China and \nother countries will all agree to reductions that are measurable, that \nare verifiable, and that are reportable.\n  So we need to get our facts straight as we come at this debate. The \nSenator from California and I are thirsty and waiting for this debate \nbecause we will show how we can reduce emissions, how we can transition \nour economy with minimal--minimal--costs. In fact, for the first few \nyears, it pays for itself to undertake many of these transformations.\n  I wish to reemphasize some thoughts in the time I have left about \nDean Koh. Dean Koh has been chosen to be legal counsel for the State \nDepartment. I have already spoken about his remarkable academic career, \nhis leadership in the legal profession, the respect and glowing praise \nhe has received from colleagues within the legal profession. We have \nheard a lot about him. I wish to address some of the points that have \nbeen raised in opposition to his nomination, some of which I believe \nare just plain disrespectful and indecent. It is hard to find the \nrationale for where they come from, frankly--maybe a mean-spiritedness \nor something--but it is hard, and I am grateful, as I think we all \nought to be, that nominees are willing to subject themselves to some of \nthese kinds of arguments. Also, there are some misunderstandings and \nmischaracterizations.\n  It is no surprise that not everybody is going to agree with him and \nevery decision or opinion he has made, but the fact is that a lot of \nthe arguments that have been made aren't grounded in reality. First, \nthere have been allegations that his views on foreign law would somehow \nundermine the Constitution of the United States. Well, please, that is \nbaseless beyond any kind of evidence I have ever seen or any statement \nhe has ever made. Let me repeat what Dean Koh, himself, has said about \nthe primacy of our Constitution. I quote:\n\n       My family settled here in part to escape from oppressive \n     foreign law, and it was America's law and commitment to human \n     rights that drew us here and have given me every privilege in \n     life that I enjoy. My life's work represents the lessons \n     learned from that experience. Throughout my career, both in \n     and out of government, I have argued that the U.S. \n     Constitution is the ultimate controlling law in the United \n     States and that the Constitution directs whether and to what \n     extent international law should guide courts and \n     policymakers.\n\n  That is definitive. No one should insert any other interpretation \ninto it other than the Constitution is primary.\n  Some have also argued that Dean Koh's views on international law, \nparticularly on something called ``the transnational legal process,'' \nwould somehow undermine our sovereignty and our security. Again, this \nrepresents a fundamental misunderstanding of his views. Dean Koh \nunderstands that international law and institutions are simply part of \nlife in a globalized world. Engagement with the international community \nis inevitable. He believes it is best to engage constructively. Here is \nwhat he said at his confirmation hearing:\n\n       Transnational legal process . . . says what we all know--\n     that we live in an interdependent world that is growing \n     increasingly more interdependent. It is not new, and . . . \n     [i]t is not an ideology. It is a description of\n\n[[Page S7048]]\n\n     a world in which we live . . . It is from the beginning of \n     the republic. It is the basic views of Thomas Jefferson and \n     Ben Franklin, who called for us to give decent respect to the \n     opinions of mankind. And most importantly, it is necessary \n     and unavoidable that we be able to understand and manage the \n     relationship between our law and other law.\n\n  Those aren't the words of an ideologue. They aren't the words of a \nradical. It is the broad perspective of a deeply knowledgeable and \npragmatic and committed advocate for our Nation's interests. It \nreflects how we represent our interests. It reflects our real \nchallenge, which is how we best use international law and institutions \nto advance national security interests and promote our core values. \nThat is exactly what Dean Koh has spent his career working on. As one \nof the world's leading experts on international law, there is nobody \nbetter qualified to meet this challenge.\n  Yesterday, my colleague from Texas suggested that Dean Koh somehow \ncreated a moral equivalence between the United States and Iran's brutal \nand deadly crackdown after the recent election. This is what our \ncolleague said:\n\n       Koh appears to draw moral equivalence between the Iranian \n     regime's political suppression and human rights abuses that \n     we've been watching play out on television and America's \n     counterterrorism policies on the other hand. In 2007, he \n     wrote: The United States cannot stand on strong footing \n     attacking Iran for illegal detentions when similar charges \n     can and have been lodged against our own government.\n\n  Well, common sense--in one sentence, the Senator accuses Dean Koh of \nequating our treatment of detainees with Iran's actions and violently \nsuppressing protests this week--right now--and in the next sentence he \ncites as evidence for that comments that Dean Koh made a couple years \nago on an unrelated issue of Iran's treatment of detainees. I have \nheard of people trying to make ``six degrees of separation'' \nconnections and somehow make it mean something, but this is to the \nextreme.\n  The broader point is, Dean Koh was not suggesting there is a moral \nequivalence between Iran and the United States. He was arguing that we \nare safer if we can convince countries such as Iran and North Korea to \nrespect global norms and standards. It is harder for the United States \nto run around the world enlisting allies and marshaling pressure when \nwe are simultaneously forced to fend off accusations of lawless \nactivity by ourselves. So Guantanamos and other things work to deplete \nour ability to be able to maintain the highest moral ground. That is \nnot moral equivalence. That is a practical reality about how the world \nworks and how you protect the interests of the United States.\n  We have heard the argument that Dean Koh's position in supporting the \nregulation of global arms trade is somehow going to infringe on the \nrights of Americans under the second amendment. Please. I mean, please. \nNothing could be further from the truth. The fact is that Dean Koh \nsupports efforts to regulate the transfer of guns across borders, which \ndoes nothing to interfere with the domestic possession of firearms. As \nhe said at his confirmation hearing:\n\n       The goal is to prevent child soldiers in places like \n     Somalia and Uganda from having AK-47s transferred from the \n     former Soviet Union. It is not to in some way interfere with \n     the legitimate hunter's right to use a hunting rifle in a \n     national or State park.\n\n  Dean Koh went on to unequivocally state that he respects the Supreme \nCourt's decision in Heller, which affirmed the right to bear arms under \nthe second amendment as the law of the land.\n  There are other criticisms that have been made. I don't have time to \ngo into all of them now, but the bottom line is whether it is the \nCEDAW--the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against \nWomen--or questions about his beliefs about the war in Iraq, the fact \nis that Dean Koh has also been questioned for allegedly supporting \nsuits against the Bush administration's involvement in abusive \ninterrogation techniques. Well, first of all, Dean Koh had no personal \ninvolvement in the lawsuit against John Yoo that has been mentioned, \nnone whatsoever. Let's be clear. The State Department Legal Adviser is \nnot charged with defending U.S. officials from legal suit or \ninvestigation of allegations of war crimes. That is the job of the \nJustice Department and the Defense Department.\n\n  Finally, we have heard questions about Dean Koh's respect for the \nrole that Congress has played in crafting legislation relating to our \nnational security. Dean Koh said at his confirmation hearing, and his \nwords should stand:\n\n       [T]he Constitution's framework while defining the powers of \n     Congress in Article 1 and the President in Article 2, creates \n     a framework in which the foreign affairs power is a power \n     shared. Checks and balances don't stop at the water's edge. \n     It is both constitutionally required, and it is also smart in \n     the sense that the President makes better decisions when \n     Congress is involved. If they are in at the takeoff, they \n     tend to be more supportive all the way through the exercise.\n\n  That is just the type of approach that we here in Congress should \nwelcome.\n  While disagreements on legal and policy issues are entirely \nlegitimate, I regret that there have been some accusations and \ninsinuations against Dean Koh in the media that would be laughable if \nthey weren't impugning the reputation of such a devoted public servant. \nSome have alleged that Dean Koh supports the imposition of Islamic \nShariah law here in America. Others have actually claimed that he is \nagainst Mother's Day. Does anyone really think this President and this \nSecretary of State would seek legal advice from a man trying to impose \nIslamic law on America? Or abolish Mother's Day? That type of \nallegation has no place in this debate.\n  Fortunately, there is a chorus of voices across party lines and \nacross American life that know the truth about Dean's Koh's record. \nThat's why he has the support of such a long and impressive list of law \nprofessors, deans, clergy, former State Department Legal Advisers, and \nlegal organizations.\n  I was heartened to see that eight Republicans voted for cloture. This \nsends an important message that his nomination has real bipartisan \nsupport. The words of Senator Lugar on Dean Koh bear repeating: ``Given \nDean Koh's record of service and accomplishment, his personal \ncharacter, his understanding of his role as Legal Adviser, and his \ncommitment to work closely with Congress, I support his nomination and \nbelieve he is well deserving of confirmation by the Senate.''\n  Senator Lieberman, one of this body's strongest supporters of the war \nin Iraq and of Professor Koh's nomination, also put it well: ``[T]here \nis absolutely no doubt in my mind that Harold Hongju Koh is profoundly \nqualified for this position and immensely deserving of confirmation. He \nis not only a great scholar, he is a great American patriot, who is \nabsolutely devoted to our nation's security and safety.''\n  In closing, I believe Dean Koh's own words best sum up the case for \nhis confirmation: As he has written, ``I love this country with all my \nheart, not just because of what it has given me and my family, but \nbecause of what it stands for in the world: democracy, human rights, \nfair play, the rule of law.''\n  There is no stronger bipartisan voice for foreign policy or for the \nConstitution in the Senate than Senator Dick Lugar of Indiana, and I \nhope my colleagues will follow his example.\n  I thank our Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to speak, once again, on the \nnomination of Harold Koh, whom the President has nominated to be Legal \nAdviser for the State Department. To put this in context, as the \nSenator from Massachusetts has addressed, the Legal Adviser is a very \nimportant job at the State Department. He is responsible for providing \nguidance on important legal questions, including treaty interpretation \nand other international obligations of the United States. He gives the \nSecretary of State legal advice during negotiations with other nations. \nSo the Legal Adviser can be a very influential voice in diplomatic \ncircles, especially if he or she has particularly strong views on \nAmerica's obligations to other nations and multilateral organizations.\n  Based on my review of Dean Koh's record, I don't believe he is the \nright man for this job. His views are in tension with what I believe \nare core Democratic values, in that he would subjugate America's \nsovereignty to the opinions of the so-called international common law, \nincluding treaty obligations that the Senate has never ratified. \nIndeed, they are not obligations,\n\n[[Page S7049]]\n\nbut he nevertheless would impose them on the United States. When the \nSenator from Massachusetts says he believes the U.S. Constitution is \nprimary, I would have felt much better if he had said it was the \nexclusive source of American law, together with the laws that we \nourselves pass as representatives of the people; not just a \nconsideration but the consideration when it comes to determining the \nobligations and rights of America's citizens, rather than subjecting \nthose to international opinion and vague international norms which I \nheard the Senator refer to.\n  It is true Professor Koh is an advocate of what he calls \ntransnational jurisprudence. He believes Federal judges--these are U.S. \njudges--should use their power to ``vertically enforce'' or \n``domesticate'' American law with international norms and foreign law. \nAs I mentioned, this means judges using treaties and ``customary \ninternational law'' to override a wide variety of American laws, \nwhether they be State or Federal. Of course, we understand treaties \nthat have been ratified by the Senate are the law of the land, but \nProfessor Koh believes that even treaties that the United States has \nnot ratified can be evidence of customary international law and given \nlegal effect as such.\n  The Legal Adviser to the State Department has an important role, as I \nmentioned, in drafting, negotiating, and enforcing treaties. That is \nwhy it is so crucial he understands that no treaty has the force of law \nin the United States until it has been ratified, pursuant to the \nConstitution, by the Senate. Do we want a top legal advisor at the \nState Department who believes that norms that he and other \ninternational scholars make should become the law, even if they are \nrejected or not otherwise embraced by the Congress? That can't be \nwithin the mainstream. That is outside the mainstream; indeed, I \nbelieve a radical view of our obligations in the international \ncommunity.\n  In 2002, Professor Koh delivered a lecture on the matter of gun \ncontrol. He argued for a ``global gun control regime.''\n  I don't know exactly what he means by that, but if he means that the \nsecond amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution of an individual \nAmerican citizen to keep and bear arms are somehow affected by global \ngun control regimes, then I disagree with him very strongly. Our rights \nas Americans depend on the American Constitution and American law, not \non some global gun control regime or unratified treaties because of \nsome legal theory of customary international law.\n  On the matter of habeas corpus rights for terrorists, in 2007, \nProfessor Koh argued that foreign detainees held by the U.S. Armed \nForces anywhere in the world--not just enemy combatants at Guantanamo \nBay--are entitled to habeas corpus review in U.S. Federal courts. Those \nare the rights reserved to American citizens under our Constitution and \nlaws, not to foreign terrorists detained by our military in farflung \nbattlefields around the world.\n  If Professor Koh were correct--and he is not--this would mean that \neven foreign enemy combatants captured on the battlefield fighting \nagainst our troops in Afghanistan and held at Bagram Air Force Base \nwould be able to sue in the U.S. courts seeking their release.\n  On this issue, fortunately, Dean Koh's radical views are not shared \nby the Obama administration, which filed a brief recently arguing that \nhabeas corpus relief doesn't extend to detainees held at Bagram Air \nForce base in Afghanistan.\n  Do we want a top legal adviser in the State Department working to \ngrant terrorists and enemy combatants even more rights than they have \nnow?\n  There is the issue of military commissions, something Congress has \nspoken on at some length after lengthy debate. Professor Koh's views of \nmilitary commissions also deserve our attention.\n  Military commissions, it turns out, have been authorized since the \nbeginning of this country--by George Washington during the \nRevolutionary War, by Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War, and by \nFranklin Roosevelt during World War II. Yes, military commissions have \nbeen authorized both by our 43rd and 44th President of the United \nStates in the context of the war on terror.\n  President Obama has said that ``military commissions . . . are an \nappropriate venue for trying detainees for violations of the laws of \nwar.'' I agree with him.\n  Of course, military commissions, as I alluded to a moment ago, have \nhad bipartisan support and have been authorized by the Congress. But \nsomehow Professor Koh takes a more radical view. He believes military \ncommissions would ``create the impression of kangaroo courts.'' He said \nthey ``provide ad hoc justice.'' He said they do not and cannot provide \n``credible justice.''\n  Do we want the top legal adviser at the State Department undermining \nboth the will of Congress and the President regarding the time-tested \npractice of military commissions during wartime?\n  Again, here is another example of Professor Koh's views that are \nradical views--certainly outside of the legal mainstream. Senators \nshould also take a look at Professor Koh's views on suing or \nprosecuting lawyers for providing professional legal advice in the \nservice of their country.\n  My position is clear: Government lawyers--and I don't care whether \nthey are working in a Democratic administration or a Republican one--\nshould not be prosecuted or sued for doing their jobs in good faith. \nThey should not be punished for giving their best legal advice under \ndifficult and novel situations, even if it turns out that some lawyer \nsomewhere later disagrees with that advice.\n  As dean of the Yale Law School, Professor Koh has enabled and \nempowered the leftwing attempt to sue one of its own alumni, John Yoo, \nwho worked at the Office of Legal Counsel in the Bush administration.\n  The Yale Law School's Lowenstein International Human Rights Law \nClinic has filed suit against John Yoo for the legal advice he provided \nto policymakers during his service on behalf of the American people.\n  I wonder if Professor Koh is willing to hold himself to the same \nstandard and agree that individuals can sue him for his official acts \nif he is confirmed as Legal Adviser to the State Department--if later \non lawyers, and perhaps prosecutors, disagree with that legal advice \nand say it was wrong.\n  Suppose Professor Koh gives legal advice that certain GTMO detainees \nshould be released. If they return to the battlefield, as many have, \nand end up killing Americans, or our allies, should the victims' \nfamilies be allowed to hold Professor Koh legally responsible in a \ncourt of law? Or suppose Professor Koh gives legal advice that \nauthorizes military actions in Afghanistan or Pakistan. If those \noperations result in collateral damage, or civilian casualties, would \nthe victims have standing in Federal Court to sue Professor Koh?\n  Do we want a top Legal Adviser at the State Department who is so \ncompromised by the fear of being sued or prosecuted that he could not \nbe trusted to give honest, good-faith legal advice to the Secretary of \nState or the President of the United States?\n  Perhaps most timely, given the civil unrest in Iran--and the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts was critical of the fact that I quoted a 2007 \nwriting of Professor Koh, but it is true from this writing, and I will \nread it in a moment--Professor Koh appears to draw a moral equivalence \nbetween Iran's regime's political suppression and human rights abuses, \non one hand, and America's counterterrorism policies on the other.\n  In 2007 he wrote:\n\n       The United States cannot stand on strong footing attacking \n     Iran for ``illegal detention'' when similar charges can be \n     and have been lodged against our own government.\n\n  He goes on to say that U.S. Government criticism of Iranian \n``security forces who monitored the social activities of citizens, \nentered homes and offices, monitored telephone conversations, and \nopened mail without court authorization,'' was ``hard to square'' with \nour own National Security Agency's surveillance programs.\n  Do we want to confirm a top Legal Adviser at the State Department who \ncan't see the difference between counterterrorism policies approved by \nthe Federal courts and the Congress and the brutal repression practiced \nby a theocratic regime?\n  We have heard enough moral equivalence about Iran over the last week,\n\n[[Page S7050]]\n\nand we have heard enough apologies for the actions of the United \nStates, and enough soft-peddling of the actions of the Iranian \ntheocracy, which is a brutal police state. We don't need another voice \nin the administration whose first instinct is to blame America and \nwhose long-term objective is to transform this country into something \nit is not.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose the nomination of \nHarold Koh as the top Legal Adviser to the State Department.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof Dean Harold Hongju Koh to serve as Legal Adviser to the Department \nof State. Dean Koh is a close friend of mine, whom I have known and \nrespected for many years. His distinguished career reflects a long \nhistory of public service and bipartisanship. For example, Dean Koh \nserved in both Republican and Democratic administrations, beginning his \ncareer in government in the Office of Legal Counsel during the Reagan \nadministration and at the Department of Justice and as Assistant \nSecretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor in the \nClinton administration.\n  Dean Koh also has strong academic and professional credentials. He \nwas the editor of the Harvard Law Review, a Marshall scholar and a law \nclerk for the Honorable Harry A. Blackmun of the U.S. Supreme Court. He \nhas been awarded with several honorary degrees and more than 30 human \nrights awards.\n  Dean Koh's established expertise in international law makes him a \nstrong candidate for the position. I am certain that he will protect \nthe U.S. Constitution and execute the job with extraordinary \nprofessionalism. I strongly support his nomination.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nHarold Koh to serve as Legal Adviser to the Department of State.\n  My one and only regret in offering my enthusiastic support for this \nnomination is that it will take from my State of Connecticut a pillar \nof our academic community and a mentor to countless young legal minds \nat the Yale Law School, where Harold Koh has served as a member of the \nfaculty since 1985 and dean since 2004.\n  Dean Koh is a man of extraordinary intellect, unquestioned \npatriotism, and great accomplishment. He is a former Marshall Scholar, \na graduate of Harvard Law School, the recipient of 11 honorary degrees, \nand the author of 8 books.\n  He has appeared before appellate courts and the Congress on countless \noccasions, won many awards and accolades as a human rights advocate, \nand served his country under Presidents of both parties. In his most \nrecent service, he was unanimously approved by this body to serve as \nAssistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, \nwhere he served with tremendous distinction for 3 years.\n  In short, Dean Koh is exactly the sort of public servant we need at \nthe State Department at a time when our Nation is seeking to restore \nits standing in the world by renewing our commitment to traditional \nAmerican values like respect for all people and adherence to the rule \nof law.\n  After all, we confront global challenges as complex as they are \nnumerous. Nuclear proliferation and international terrorism threaten \nour national security, and issues like genocide and human trafficking \ntest our leadership on the world stage. Our foreign policy must be \nrooted in an understanding of American and international law, as well \nas a firm commitment to not only our Constitution, but also the \nunderlying moral values from which it was created.\n  No one understands these issues better than Harold Koh. He is the \nchild of parents born in South Korea who grew up under Japanese \ncolonial rule. They lived through dictatorship and unrest before coming \nto America. Their son Harold chose to study law because he understood \nthat, as he once stated in an essay, ``freedom is contagious.''\n  Dean Koh wrote movingly of his time with the State Department:\n\n       Everywhere I went--Haiti, Indonesia, China, Sierra Leone, \n     Kosovo--I saw in the eyes of thousands the same fire for \n     freedom I had first seen in my father's eyes. Once, an Asian \n     dictator told us to stop imposing our Western values on his \n     people. He said, ``We Asians don't feel the same way \n     as Americans do about human rights'' I pointed to my own \n     face and told him he was wrong.\n\n  Our Nation will be safer and stronger, and the world will be freer, \nwith Harold Koh at the State Department once again.\n  I suspect that many of my colleagues who have raised concerns about \nthis nomination understand fully just how qualified Dean Koh is for \nthis position. Unfortunately, some are too willing to play politics \nwith our foreign policy.\n  Let's be clear. To suggest that Dean Koh does not understand or \nappreciate American sovereignty or the supremacy of our Constitution is \nan insult. Dean Koh has done important and valuable work exploring the \ntenets of international law and comparisons between the legal systems \nof different countries, work I hope he will continue when his \nnomination is approved. He does not wish to subjugate our legal system \nto that of any other nation, or to international law, and claims to the \ncontrary are simply inaccurate and unfair.\n  Indeed, while some have been tempted by the prospect of opposing a \ntalented legal scholar nominated by a President of the opposing party, \nDean Koh's nomination has been endorsed by serious legal minds on both \nsides of the ideological spectrum.\n  John Bellinger, who served in this position under President George W. \nBush, wrote: ``I do think Harold Koh is well qualified and should be \nconfirmed.''\n  Kenneth Starr, the well-known Republican attorney who has opposed \nDean Koh in court on many occasions, calls him ``not only a great \nlawyer, but a truly great man of irreproachable integrity.''\n  Conservative legal legend Ted Olson agrees, calling Dean Koh a \n``brilliant scholar and a man of great integrity.'' He also makes the \nvery salient point that ``the President and the Secretary of State are \nentitled to have who they want as their legal adviser.''\n  Serious people, people who understand the importance of this position \nto our foreign policy and the nature of the man President Obama has \nnominated to fill it, have been able to look past political \nconsiderations and judge Dean Koh fairly.\n  They support him. I support him. I urge my colleagues to support him. \nAnd I look forward to his confirmation, his service, and his continued \nfriendship.\n  Mr. CORNYN. We yield back the remainder of our time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen).

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, today the Senate confirmed Harold Koh to \nthe position of Legal Adviser to the State Department by a vote of 62 \nto 35. I voted against his confirmation for reasons I explained on the \nfloor yesterday. Chiefly, I am concerned about his support for a \ntransnational legal process. The National Review recently published an \narticle that explores the inherent conflict between transnational legal \nstructures built on ``global norms'' and the constitutionally defined \nrole of the American judiciary. I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Koh Fails the Democracy Test\n\n                            (By John Fonte)\n\n       Advocates of global governance advance their agenda through \n     the ``transnational legal process.'' Harold Koh, former dean \n     of the Yale Law School, who has been nominated by President \n     Obama to be the legal adviser to the State Department, is a \n     leading advocate of this ``transnational legal process.'' His \n     confirmation hearing is today, Tuesday, April 28.\n       Dean Koh has written extensively--sometimes clearly, \n     sometimes obtusely--on transnational law and the \n     ``transnational legal process.'' In a rather clear paragraph \n     in The American Prospect (September 20, 2004), Koh explains \n     how the system works: Transnational legal process encompasses \n     the interactions of public and private actors--nation states, \n     corporations, international organizations, and non-\n     governmental organizations--in a variety of forums, to make, \n     interpret, enforce, and ultimately internalize rules of \n     international law. In my view, it is the key to understanding \n     why nations obey international law. Under this view, those \n     seeking to create and embed certain human rights principles \n     into international and domestic law should trigger \n     transnational interactions, which generate legal \n     interpretations, which can in turn be internalized into the \n     domestic law of even resistant nation-states.\n       Koh says much the same thing in the Penn State \n     International Law Journal (2006)--more abstractly, to be \n     sure, but it is worth listening to his voice to begin to \n     appreciate the tone of the global-governance debate in legal \n     circles: To understand how transnational law works, one must \n     understand ``Transnational Legal Process,'' the \n     transubstantive process in each of these issues areas \n     [business, crime, immigration, refugees, human rights, \n     environment, trade, terrorism] whereby [nation] states and \n     other transnational private actors use the blend of domestic \n     and international legal process to internalize international \n     legal norms into domestic law. As I have argued elsewhere, \n     key agents in promoting this process of internalization \n     include transnational norm entrepreneurs, governmental norm \n     sponsors, transnational issue networks, and interpretive \n     communities. In this story, one of these agents triggers an \n     interaction at the international level, works together with \n     other agents of internalization to force an interpretation of \n     the international legal norm in an interpretive forum, and \n     then continues to work with those agents to persuade a \n     resisting nation-state to internalize that interpretation \n     into domestic law.\n       Koh notes that the crucial mechanism for incorporating \n     these global norms that are ``created'' and ``interpreted'' \n     in transnational forums into American constitutional law is \n     the American judiciary. As Koh declares, ``domestic courts \n     must play a key role in coordinating U.S. domestic \n     constitutional rules with rules of foreign and international \n     law.''\n       The global norms that are to be ``internalized'' into \n     American law cover a wide range of policy areas, including \n     matters of foreign policy, terrorism, internal security, \n     commerce, environment, human rights, free speech, and social \n     issues such as feminism, abortion, gay rights, and the status \n     of children.\n       To ask the crucial questions of democratic theory: Who \n     governs? Who decides?\n       For the advocates of global governance, the policy issues \n     listed above are typically global problems that require \n     global solutions. In this view, international judges, NGO \n     activists, international lawyers, and the like operating in \n     transnational forums such as the International Court of \n     Justice, the International Criminal Court, and various U.N. \n     agencies are the appropriate decision-makers.\n       For the advocates of liberal democracy, these issues should \n     be decided through the democratic political process. In the \n     United States, this would mean the elected representatives of \n     the people: the Congress and president at the national level, \n     state legislatures and governors at the state level, and city \n     councils and mayors at the local level.\n       To be sure, the American judiciary should perform its \n     constitutional role of interpreting the laws made by the \n     political branches of American democracy. However, it is not \n     appropriate for American courts to impose or ``internalize'' \n     global norms, rules, or laws ``created'' at transnational \n     forums by transnational actors who have no direct \n     accountability to ``We the People of the United States''; \n     actors who not only are not elected by the American people, \n     but who are, for the most part, not even citizens of the \n     United States. It is not appropriate, that is, if one \n     believes in liberal democracy.\n       But, of course, the ``transnational legal process'' \n     articulated by Harold Koh and the politics of \n     transnationalism generally are not democratic. They represent \n     a new form of governance that I call ``post-democratic.'' To \n     ``make, interpret, [and] enforce'' international law, ``which \n     can in turn be internalized into the domestic law of even \n     resistant nation-states'' (as Koh describes it), is to \n     exercise governance. But do these transnational governors \n     have the consent of the governed?\n       The transnational legal process fails the ``government by \n     the consent of the governed'' test in two ways. First, the \n     democratic branches of government, the elected \n     representatives of the people, have no direct input either in \n     writing the global laws in the first place, or even in \n     consenting to their domestic internalization, as, for \n     example, happens when the Senate ratifies a treaty or the \n     Congress passes enabling legislation for a non-self-executing \n     treaty.\n       Second, there is no democratic mechanism to repeal or \n     change these international rules that are incorporated into \n     U.S. law by this process. What if the American people decide \n     that they object to these global norms and transnational laws \n     that were imposed upon them without their consent (on, for \n     example, the death penalty, internal security, immigration, \n     family law, etc.)? What if the American people at first \n     approved, but later changed their minds on, some of these \n     rules: How can these global norms, now part of international \n     law and U.S. constitutional law, be repealed? Legislation to \n     repeal the global norms could be deemed ``unconstitutional.'' \n     In short, there are no democratic answers to these questions \n     consistent with the transnational legal process, because it \n     is not a democratic process.\n       At the end of the day, the argument over the transnational \n     legal process is one part of a larger argument that will come \n     to dominate the 21st century: Who governs?\n       Will Americans continue to decide for themselves public \n     policies related to national security, human rights, \n     immigration, free speech, terrorism, the environment, trade, \n     commercial regulation, abortion, gay rights, and family \n     issues--or will questions be decided by ``transnational issue \n     networks'' working with ``transnational norm entrepreneurs,'' \n     ``governmental norm sponsors,'' and ``interpretive \n     communities,'' with the complicity of American judges?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to present the \nfiscal year 2010 legislative branch bill. I want to start by thanking \nSenator Murkowski and her staff for their help in putting this bill \ntogether. I am very grateful for her support on this subcommittee. This \nwas truly a bipartisan effort from start to finish. I thank her and I \nnote that her health is improving because her leg is improving and she \nis getting to places on her own now.\n  This bill funds the salaries of the very dedicated public servants \nwho support the legislative branch of government. The legislative \nbranch is home to not only all of us here in the Senate and the House, \nbut the Capitol Police, the Library of Congress, the Architect of the \nCapitol, the Government Accountability Office, the Government Printing \nOffice, the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of Compliance, and \nthe Open World Leadership Center.\n  In crafting this bill, it was our firm belief that the legislative \nbranch should lead by example, funding only the most critical needs of \nour agencies and being good stewards of the taxpayers' dollars. This \nproved to be quite a challenge when we were presented with a budget \nrequest that reflected a 15-percent increase over the fiscal year 2009 \nenacted level. However, after several hearings, many meetings, and \ncountless hours of staff negotiations, I am proud to say that we did \nexactly what we set out to do in writing this bill.\n  The bill before us today totals $4.6 billion, which is a 4.7-percent \nincrease over the current year. The bill includes House-related items \nsolely considered by that body which totaled $1.475 billion. It is \nimportant to note that the Senate Legislative Branch appropriations \nbill, which did not include House-related items, over which we had no \ncontrol, represented only a 3.3-percent increase over fiscal year 2009 \nand was significantly below the budget request. If you include the $25 \nmillion that GAO received in the stimulus bill, then this is only a \n2.4-percent increase over current year funding levels.\n  The fiscal year 2010 bill provides $934 million for the Senate, which \nis an increase of 4.3 percent over the current year. This funding will \nprovide for annual salary and operating increases for Senate offices, \nthe Senate Sergeant at Arms, the Secretary of the Senate, and other \nagencies that support the operation of the Senate.\n  The bill includes $331 million for the Capitol Police, which is an 8-\npercent increase over current year. This includes $15.4 million to \nfully implement the merger of the Library of Congress Police with the \nCapitol Police, providing seamless security throughout the entire \nCapitol complex.\n  The bill also provides for 10 additional civilian positions to help \nresolve management issues, including the constant increase in the \ndemand for overtime. The committee did not provide the 76 new officers \nrequested in fiscal year 2010, but does direct GAO to work with the \nCapitol Police to ensure that they are getting the most efficient use \nof their nearly 1,800 officers currently on board, by far the biggest \nthis force has ever been.\n  The Architect of the Capitol is funded at $445 million, which is a \ndecrease of $18 million, or 4 percent below current year. The amount \nincludes $48 million in deferred maintenance projects, including $16.8 \nmillion for continued work on asbestos abatement and structural repairs \nin the utility tunnels. I am happy to say that the utility tunnel work \nis on schedule and significantly below original cost estimates. The \nbill also includes over $14 million in energy and sustainability \nprojects across the Capitol campus.\n  The Library of Congress funding totals $638.5 million, which is a 4-\npercent increase over the current year. This amount includes $8.5 \nmillion for technology upgrades to allow for increased digitization of \nthe Library's collections and full funding for the Digital Talking Book \nfor the Blind project.\n  The Government Accountability Office is funded at $553.6 million, \nwhich is a 4-percent increase over current year, and provides all \nsalary and inflationary increases for GAO's current staff level.\n  The Government Printing Office is funded at $147 million, which is a \n4-percent raise over current year, allowing for the continued \nimplementation of GPO's Federal Digital System and other technology \nupgrades.\n  The Congressional Budget Office is funded at $45 million, a 2-percent \nincrease over the current year. Combined with the $2 million included \nin the supplemental, CBO will have adequate funding and FTEs needed to \nperform the critical work associated with health care spending, the \ncurrent financial crisis, and global climate change.\n  The Office of Compliance is funded at $4.4 million, an increase of 8 \npercent above current year to cover inflationary changes and to allow \nthe Office to hire an Occupational Safety and Health Program \nsupervisor.\n  Last, but not least, the Open World Leadership Office is funded at \n$14.4 million, which is a 4-percent increase over the current year.\n  I believe the bill before the Senate is sound, prudent, and fiscally \nresponsible. Taking into account the calculations I have given, it is a \n2.4-percent increase over the current with those calculations. I \nencourage my colleagues to support its passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I rise this afternoon in support of \nthe Legislative Branch appropriations bill for fiscal year 2010. The \nchairman of the subcommittee, Senator Nelson, and I have worked \ncollaboratively in this process of putting the bill together. I thank \nhim for that. I think we had some real substance in our hearings and \nspent the time, the energy, and the focus we needed on these matters \nregarding this particular appropriation.\n  When combined with the House items, the bill before us totals $4.7 \nbillion, and while this is an increase of 5 percent over the current \nyear, the bill we reported out of the committee represented less than a \n3-percent increase over fiscal year 2009, as the chairman has said--in \nfact, 2.4 percent. I would argue for those who say we need to keep our \nappropriations bills within the range of inflation, we are probably \nthere at a 2.4-percent increase.\n  We cannot, within this body, control the amounts the other body may \nprovide for its own operations, but the amounts for the Senate and the \nother legislative branch agencies that are controlled in this bill are \ncontrolled very closely, especially when we compare this with the \naverage 15 percent increase that was requested by the legislative \nbranch agencies. I think we worked very hard to take the requests that \ncame before the committee and really pared them down to what was \nappropriate, what was needed, what was necessary.\n  Both Senator Nelson and I are new to the Appropriations Committee. I \nam very pleased we were able to have these very good and substantive \nhearings with all of the legislative branch agencies. We discussed the \nwide range of issues and challenges before the legislative branch. We \nworked well together and have been consistent in our efforts to \neliminate unnecessary spending, tighten our belts, and help ensure that \nthe legislative branch is a model for the rest of the government. We \nbelieved we needed to set a good standard. If we stay on schedule, we \nwill be able to get this bill enacted prior to the beginning of the \nfiscal year. It is a good start to the appropriations process.\n  I would like to highlight just a few areas, adding on to what the \nchairman has mentioned.\n  First, with respect to the Architect of the Capitol, the bill funds \nthose projects that address the most serious risks to safety and \nhealth, such as repairs within the utility tunnels that underlie the \nCapitol Complex and projects that remedy deferred maintenance in our \nbuildings. If we don't address the maintenance backlogs, the price \ntags, we know, will just increase down the road.\n  The bill continues the Architect of the Capitol's efforts to improve \nenergy efficiency, with over $14 million in funding designated for this \npurpose.\n  Within the Library of Congress, we managed to include funding to \nbegin to update the agency's information technology infrastructure. For \nabout a decade now, there have been no increases to IT within the \nLibrary of Congress. Yet most of the users of the Library are virtual \nusers. This was the highest priority of our Librarian of Congress, Mr. \nBillington. This investment will\n\n[[Page S7053]]\n\nensure that millions of people who access the Library through its Web \nsite will be able to find what it is they are looking for.\n  Similarly, within GPO, we funded the final increment for updating \nGPO's--this is the Government Printing Office--Web site to ensure \ngovernment publications can be easily accessed and searched.\n  Also, the bill provides the final increment of funding to complete \nthe merger of the Library of Congress Police into the Capitol Police. \nThis project was initiated by Senator Bennett when he was chairman of \nthe subcommittee and has been promoted by each of the successive chairs \nand ranking members to improve security of the Capitol Complex.\n  Finally, there is a directive in the bill for a report by the \nGovernment Accountability Office of a study of Capitol Police staffing \nand overtime. Senator Nelson and I both share the concern that we \nright-size the Capitol Police and we control overtime spending. We \nrecognize security is absolutely paramount, but effective management of \nthe agency is equally as important.\n  I thank Senator Nelson for his efforts and those of his staff and my \nstaff in putting this bill together. I also thank the full committee \nchairman, Senator Inouye, and the ranking member, Senator Cochran, for \ngetting us to the floor today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, today the Senate begins its \nconsideration of our annual spending bills. We start with the \nlegislative branch appropriations bill. I am pleased to announce to my \ncolleagues that as of this moment, the Appropriations Committee has \nreported out four appropriations bills. It may please you to know, \nMadam President, that all of these bills--Legislative, Homeland \nSecurity, Commerce, and Interior--passed the committee unanimously and \nall of the bills represent a bipartisan approach.\n  We start with the legislative branch appropriations bill not because \nwe want to take care of ourselves, but because it is the only bill so \nfar which has been passed by the House and marked up by the Senate \nAppropriations Committee.\n  Without unanimous agreement, the Senate can only act on those \nappropriations bills which have already been approved by the House. \nWhile we begin today with the legislative bill, we are confident that \nseveral bills will soon follow. We are optimistic that the Homeland \nSecurity bill will pass the House this week and be available for \nconsideration before we adjourn for the recess. Later this week the \nCommittee on Appropriations will meet to consider two additional \nappropriations bills and we expect to meet in early July to prepare \nanother five bills. Over the next several weeks we expect to have many \nbills debated and hopefully passed by the Senate so that we can begin \nfinal conference deliberations on these critically important measures.\n  The bill before the Senate, as prepared by our Legislative \nSubcommittee Chairman, Senator Nelson of Nebraska and his ranking \nmember Senator Murkowski of Alaska provides $3.1 billion for the \noperations of the Congressional Branch, excluding amounts specifically \nrequested for the House of Representatives. It represents a 3-percent \nincrease over the amounts provided in FY 2009, but it is nearly 10 \npercent below the amount requested.\n  Our colleagues should thank Senators Nelson and Murkowski for \ncompleting their hard work on this bill. Because of the change in \nadministration, the committee has had the details of the President's \nrequest for less than 2 months. Yet our colleagues, who have only \nassumed their subcommittee leadership positions this year, have already \ncompleted their review and prepared this measure.\n  The bill was marked up by the committee last week and approved on a \nunanimous vote. It is a tribute to our two managers that this bill was \npassed by the committee without a single amendment.\n  For those of our colleagues who focus on the small part of the \nAppropriations bills which are earmarks, I would note there is only one \nearmark in this bill.\n  Many critics and pundits constantly overstate the controversy over \nearmarks, but here in the bill which provides the essential support for \nour legislative branch, we include only one earmark.\n  As we begin our process to provide for our Nation's spending it is \nimportant to remember why we are engaged in this annual exercise.\n  As the Framers of our Constitution recognized it is critically \nimportant to our democracy to ensure that the people's representatives \nin the Congress are the ones who determine how taxpayer money should be \nexpended.\n  While the Congress relies on the expertise of the executive branch to \ndevelop programs and to construct spending plans, it is our \nresponsibility to determine which of these programs and plans is right \nfor the American people. We were elected to represent our States. One \nway in which we carry out our responsibilities is by determining our \nNation's budget.\n  Included in this process is the relatively small amount of funding \nthat are included in direct response to our constituents' petitions. In \nthe fiscal year 2010 bills that the Appropriations Committee will \nrecommend to this body we will reduce our spending on non-project based \nearmarks by 50 percent compared to amounts for these program in fiscal \nyear 2006.\n  To understand the importance of our willingness to curtail this type \nof spending, I would note that this means a reduction of more than $8 \nbillion in earmarks.\n  Chairman Obey and I have agreed that, as long as he and I are \nChairmen, the total of non-project based earmarks in appropriations \nbills will not exceed 1 percent of the total discretionary funding \nappropriated by the committee in any fiscal year.\n  What this means is that this year and in future years we will \nallocate 99 percent of the funds in the budget for national programs \nand programs which are included in the president's request, and only 1 \npercent, really less than 1 percent, for programs that are included in \ndirect response to the needs of our States, cities, towns and the \nconstituents whom we represent.\n  It is essential that the Congress maintain its control over Federal \nspending. While it may not always be politically popular to challenge \nthe authority of Presidents in determining the spending priorities for \nthe country, it is how we safeguard the democratic traditions of this \nNation.\n  The day that we cede this authority to the White House is the day \nwhen we create a monarchy. As chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nand a member of this body for more than 46 years, I have no intention \nto allow that to occur.\n  As the Senate reviews this and the other spending bills which will \nsoon follow, I urge it to be mindful of the importance of this task.\n  The bill before this body deserves the support of every Member of \nthis body. It provides for the essential services to fulfill the \nfunctions of our legislative branch.\n  It is a clean bill free of unnecessary legislative riders. It is $300 \nmillion below the amount requested and within the funding allocation \nprovided to the subcommittee. I strongly recommend its approval.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n\n                   Motion to Commit With Instructions\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I have a motion to commit with \ninstructions at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Vitter moves to commit the bill H.R. 2918 to the \n     Committee on Appropriations with instructions to report the \n     same back to the Senate making the following changes.\n       (1) Amend the amounts appropriated in the bill so as to \n     report back a bill with an aggregate level of appropriations \n     for fiscal year 2010 not more than the level enacted for \n     fiscal year 2009, while not reducing appropriations necessary \n     for the security of the United States Capitol complex.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I will outline my motion to commit \nshortly. First, by way of introduction, let me say how disappointed and \nfrustrated I am that another amendment I had proposed for this bill was \nconsistently blocked out all of this week, and no vote, no \nconsideration was allowed by the distinguished majority leader. That \namendment, which had been filed some time ago, which I worked hard to \nget before this body, would have passed again, a repeal of the \nautomatic pay\n\n[[Page S7054]]\n\nraise provision for Members of the Senate and Members of the U.S. House \ncurrently in the law.\n  We are in the midst of a very serious recession. American families \nall around the country are really hurting. Many have been laid off, \nlost their jobs through investment losses and the stock market. Many \nothers are scared to death about their future. Yet all of us as Members \nof Congress live under this system where we get an automatic pay raise \nvirtually every year, a pay raise on autopilot without any need for a \nproposal or a bill to be offered, to be filed, to be debated or voted \non. That really is a very offensive system to millions of American \nfamilies, particularly so during this serious recession.\n  I am very sorry the majority leader felt the need to work at every \nturn to block out any consideration of this amendment and certainly any \nvote on this amendment. We have a unanimous consent agreement on this \nbill before us. It contains amendments that are not germane to the \nbill. It contains amendments that have points of order against them. \nThere is no legitimate way the majority leader can distinguish my \namendment from those, except that he didn't want to deal with the \nissue.\n  We already have dealt with it by passing a stand-alone bill through \nthe Senate. But, of course, to require the House to deal with it, we \nneed to effectively attach it to another must-pass bill. So that \nremains my goal, and my effort will continue. I wish to assure and \nreassure the majority leader that effort will continue and we will be \ntalking about this more in the future.\n  With regard to my motion to commit with instructions, it has a very \nsimilar theme because this motion to commit would simply send this \nappropriations bill back to the committee and ask that they restyle it \nso that it does not spend any more money than we spent on legislative \nappropriations for the last fiscal year. That would constitute about a \n$76 million cut. That is not a huge amount of money in Washington \nterms, but I think it would be the beginning of a huge and an important \nand an appropriate statement by this body.\n  Again, as I said, American families are hurting all over the country. \nThere have been layoffs, job losses; there have been tremendous \ninvestment losses; people's savings have been whittled away, down to \nnearly nothing in some cases. People who had retired, counting on a \ncertain future have seen that future disappear in front of their eyes. \nThey don't have the luxury, particularly now, this year, in this \nrecession, of any percentage increase--many of them. Many of those \nAmerican families are dealing with a huge income decrease. Wouldn't it \nbe reasonable and appropriate for us collectively to say we are going \nto live by the same dollar amount as we did last year? Consider that \namount last year was an 11-percent increase from the year before, so \nthat amount Congress passed last year was an 11-percent increase--about \ntriple the rate of inflation--done in the middle of this serious \nrecession. That was a significant increase last year. Shouldn't we \ntemper that? Shouldn't we make a statement that we are going to live \nwith the same dollar amount as last year?\n  I also note that under the exact language of my amendment, No. 1, we \nwould give maximum flexibility to the Appropriations Committee about \nhow they would find those modest savings of $76 million, and No. 2, the \none thing we would protect, the one thing we would tell them not to \ntouch is spending which is essential for security of the Capitol \nComplex. There would be no chance--not that it would be the desire of \nthe Appropriations Committee--there would be no possibility of \nsacrificing anything to do with security of the Capitol Complex.\n  This is a pretty simple and a pretty basic suggestion. I think it is \na pretty commonsense one. American families are struggling with the \nworst recession since World War II. Millions of American families have \none or more members who have lost their jobs. Those families have seen \ntheir incomes go down enormously. Tens of millions of other Americans \nhave seen life savings cut in half. Folks in retirement or near \nretirement have seen that whole picture change before their eyes. So \nthere are plenty of Americans who are not dealing with an increase from \nlast year, they are dealing with a huge decrease. How about we say on a \nbipartisan basis: OK, our legislative budget got an 11-percent increase \nlast year even as this recession was underway.\n  So this year, we are going to get a zero percent increase. This year \nwe are simply going to live with the same dollars as we lived with for \nthe legislative branch last year. This is simple, straightforward, but \nI think important. Again, we would do this by giving the committee \nmaximum flexibility in terms of finding those savings, and we would do \nit by protecting the security of the Capitol complex.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this important symbol and this \nimportant statement as families hurt all around our country.\n  Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the \nVitter amendment to fund the legislative branch agencies at current \nyear levels, which would result in a reduction actually of $101 million \nbelow the level that Senator Murkowski and I have proposed in the bill \nwe are considering.\n  The fiscal year 2010 bill reflects, as I have mentioned and said, \nonly a 2.4-percent increase over fiscal year 2009 spending when you \ntake GAO's stimulus funding into account.\n  When we started drafting this bill, the budget request we received \nsought a 15-percent increase over fiscal year 2009. From the outset, my \nranking member and I have been committed to holding this bill to the \nlowest possible funding level, and to lead by example in being good \nstewards of the taxpayers' money.\n  My intention was to hold this bill at the rate of inflation, if we \ncould, and it frankly pained me to even have to go as far as 2.4 \npercent over current year. But the reality is there are expenses in the \nlegislative branch that we are responsible for.\n  As a former Governor, I am used to hearing individuals assert the \ndesire to make budget cuts without actually offering any specifics. So \nI am used to what we are seeing here tonight. I say to my colleague, if \nhe has specific suggestions about what types of cuts would be prudent--\nhe has told us what not to cut, but if he has some specific suggestions \nabout the types of cuts, I would be happy to talk about them. Speaking \nin generalities will not get the job done. I can appreciate the desire \nto keep spending restrained. However, if the Senator wishes to make \nspecific suggestions of the $100 million cuts that he is, in fact, \nproposing, I would welcome it, as I would have welcomed hearing any of \nthe Senator's suggestions during the weeks and months it took to create \nthis bill.\n  As a matter of fact, I have visited with my colleague Senator Johanns \nabout the increases in this budget this year, and have suggested to him \nthat if there are other areas we should cut, then we would take his \nthoughts into consideration and make any adjustments that would make \nsense.\n  But, to my knowledge, I have not received any note of concern from \nthe Senator, the sponsor of this amendment, about any of the items \nincluded in this bill while it was being created. We are all concerned \nabout fiscal responsibility.\n  Let's talk a little bit about this bill and what this amendment would \nmean. We now have a fully operating Visitor Center here in the Capitol \nthat costs money to operate and to secure, recently completed. There \nare still costs associated with bringing it up and into the running \nprocess. The Visitor Center has provided increased amenities for our \nconstituents when they make the trip to Washington to visit. But it \ndoes cost money.\n  I have already outlined the bill in my opening statements, so I will \nnot go through all of that again.\n  This is the first time through this process as chairman of the \nLegislative Branch Subcommittee, and I must say I was honored when \nChairman Inouye tasked me with the enormous responsibility.\n  This committee funds the agencies Congress relies on to provide them \nwith timely information pertaining to the oversight of the Federal \nGovernment. For example, last year the Government Accountability \nOffice, the GAO, as it is referred to, received over\n\n[[Page S7055]]\n\n1,200 congressional requests and testified at over 300 congressional \nhearings. Their work produced hundreds of improvements in government \noperations and produced significant financial savings for the American \ntaxpayer.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, the CBO, also funded in this bill, \nactually received emergency funding in the supplemental that passed \nlast week to further strengthen their workforce, allowing for timelier \nproduction of analyses for congressional offices.\n  I do not know how a spending freeze can be proposed to an agency that \ndesperately needed this kind of help to do their job here so we can do \nour jobs here in Congress.\n  It does not make sense. I know for a fact that my colleagues depend \non the CBO, that office, perhaps now more than ever before, for \nanalysis related to health care costs, energy, and the current \nfinancial crisis.\n  The agencies funded in this legislative branch work for Congress. \nQuite simply, if you reduce their funding, you will reduce the service \nwe receive here in Congress at an important time when we are facing \nimportant legislation. So we are a little spoiled here. But that is \nbecause of the great service we are used to receiving from the \nGovernment Printing Office to the Congressional Research Service to the \nCapitol Police who maintain our security, and the security of those who \nare in our buildings and on our grounds. These are agencies and staff \nthat also support Congress. That is their mission. I think we owe it to \nthem to at least to fund the cost-of-living increase for these \ndedicated public servants. The vote will determine whether you think \nyour staff deserves a cost-of-living adjustment in 2010, and whether \nyou think our Capitol Police deserve to be paid overtime with the long \nhours they work, risking life and limb to keep us and the thousands of \nAmericans who visit here each year safe in the Capitol complex.\n  Every elevator operator, every construction worker, every plumber, \nevery electrician, every maintenance person, every parking lot \nattendant, virtually every employee you encounter here in the Capitol \ncomplex, including staff present here today, is paid from this \nappropriations bill.\n  I could go on and I could go on. But I have to admit, I did not \nrealize what a lot of those folks did until I started working on this \nbill. But now I do.\n  It is my responsibility, and the responsibility as well of the \nranking member, to do what we think is right by these employees and \nthese agencies.\n  I respectfully urge my colleagues to vote no on this motion.\n  How much time does the Senator need in response?\n  Mr. VITTER. I might need an additional 3 minutes to wrap up.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I yield the Senator 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. In summary, let me try to clarify and rebut a few points. \nFirst, to say that this bill is a 2.4-percent increase over last year's \nis complete fiction, because that assumes the stimulus into last year's \nnumber. In fact, last year's number, because of the stimulus--and the \nstimulus was a one-time bill, not a normal fiscal year bill.\n  No. 2, last year's bill, as I mentioned, was an 11-percent increase \nover the previous year, three times the rate of inflation.\n  No. 3, I wanted to give the committee maximum flexibility in making \nthis modest cut. But there are plenty of suggestions I would have. I \nwould be happy to offer specifics. I will offer one right now. The Open \nWorld Leadership Center Trust Fund, $14.5 million. That would be almost \na quarter of the savings I am asking for. That is a program to bring \ngovernmental officials from Russia and Eastern European republics to \ntour the United States. I am sure it is a nice idea, but I think there \nwould be a lot of American families in the middle of this recession who \nwould ask, is that essential? Is that core to what we are doing in \ngovernment in very tough economic times? Do we actually need to do \nthis?\n  We can find those savings. That program alone is a quarter of the \nsavings my motion to commit would require. We can find those savings \nclearly without touching Capitol Police overtime, without touching \ncost-of-living increases for employees.\n  Finally, there are millions of American families who are not dealing \nwith any increase this year in their incomes. They are dealing with a \nhuge decrease. They are dealing with a huge decrease in savings. So \ncan't we simply live with the same dollar amount as we did in the \nlegislative branch last year? I think the huge majority of Americans \nwould find that a very reasonable and a very modest goal.\n  I yield the reminder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I move to table the Vitter \nmotion and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

When we come back a week from Monday, we will \nhave a number of votes beginning at 5:30.\n  As I have told everyone more than once, the next 5 weeks after we get \nback are going to be jam packed with stuff to do. Members should \nunderstand that we will have votes on Mondays and Fridays, with one \nexception which has already been announced: It is July 17. We hope we \ndon't have to have weekend sessions. We have a lot to do. Everyone \nknows the workload we have. I would hope that we understand the amount \nof work we have to do. We are going to be in a week longer than the \nHouse of Representatives, as everyone knows. Because of our rules, we \ncan't move as quickly as they do. We have an immense amount of work to \ndo. We have the Sotomayor nomination. We have Defense authorization \nthat was reported out of committee today by Senators Levin and McCain. \nThat is something that is very important for the military and to the \nAmerican people. We have other appropriations bills we have to work on. \nWe have health care. We are going to move as far as we can on that \nduring that period of time. So we have a lot of work to do.\n  Also, on July 14, there will be no votes after 2 p.m. These are \narrangements I made with one of the Senators, and this will be good for \nthe entire body. So there will be no votes after 2 p.m. on July 14.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/25/senate-section/article/S7056-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7056-S7060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2010--Continued\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1366 to Amendment No. 1365\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1366 to amendment No. 1365.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To strike the earmark for the Durham Museum in Omaha, \n                               Nebraska)\n\n       On page 27, strike lines 5 through 10 and insert \n     ``mission.''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, the amendment is very simple. It strikes \nfrom the bill an earmark of $200,000 for the Durham Museum in Omaha, \nNE. Let me be very clear. I hold no grudge against the museum or the \nsponsor of this earmark. On the contrary, I hold my colleagues from \nNebraska in very high esteem, and I have no doubt that the museum does \nwonderful work. Thanks to modern technology and Wikipedia, it has a \nvery nice description of the Durham Museum, formerly known as the \nDurham Western Heritage Museum in downtown Omaha, NE, dedicated to \npreserving and displaying the history of the U.S. western region and it \nis housed in Omaha's Union Station.\n  I am sure it is a very fine place. I am sure it gets lots of visitors \nfrom all over the great State of Nebraska. The only problem is, as I \nunderstand from reading the bill, which sometimes some of us don't do, \nthis is a bill that is entitled ``Making Appropriations for the \nLegislative Branch for the Fiscal Year Ending September 30, 2010, and \nfor Other Purposes.'' Well, obviously, the distinguished manager of the \nbill found another purpose but certainly none that has the slightest \nconnection to the city of Omaha or the State of Nebraska, except the \nSenator happens to be from that State. He maybe even resides in that \ncity.\n  The reason I am taking the floor is because Americans are hurting \nright now. Americans all over this country are hurting right now. I go \ndowntown in my city, my hometown of Phoenix, AR, and I see people \nclosing store fronts. I see people not able to make their house \npayments or people not able to pay their medical bills, and $200,000 \nwould mean a lot to them; $200,000 is not a small sum.\n  So the fact is, I don't question the merits of the program. I don't \nquestion that the Durham Museum is probably a nice place to visit. I do \nquestion when we are going to stop earmarking porkbarrel projects \nbecause of the influence or clout of Members of the Senate.\n  I want to repeat, I do not question that this museum is a fine \nmuseum. I do question--and any objective observer would question--how \nin the world that has a place on appropriations of the taxpayers' \ndollars for the legislative branch. I don't think the Durham Museum is \nin the legislative branch of government unless I am badly mistaken, and \nI am sure I am not.\n  Here we are with trillions of dollars of deficit--$1.2 trillion for \nTARP, $410 million for the Omnibus appropriations bill, which was \nloaded with 9,000 unnecessary and wasteful earmarks, tens of billions \nof dollars to the domestic auto manufacturers, and we passed a budget \nresolution totaling $3.5 trillion. Now we have a bill totaling $3.1 \nbillion to run the legislative branch of government.\n  As has been widely trumpeted, this bill is less than that requested. \nWhat it is also, though, is 3 percent more than it was last year. How \nmany Americans are able to get 3 percent more money than they had last \nyear? It is over $76 million more than last year's bill. So is this a \nbig deal, $200,000? Probably not, with the trillions of dollars that we \nseem to throw around here.\n  But I am serving notice on my colleagues that I and some of my other \ncolleagues are going to come to the floor and challenge these earmarks. \nWe have to stop doing business as usual while we are committing \ngenerational theft and mortgaging our children's future.\n  Since it is going to be about 10 days or so before we will have a \nvote on this amendment--as the majority leader mentioned, we are not \ngoing to have anymore votes--I ask unanimous consent that before the \nvote I have 5 minutes and the Senator from Nebraska have the time he \nneeds before the vote that will take place at the pleasure of the \nmajority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I respect greatly my \ncolleague from Arizona and his concern about spending. As was noted, \nthe increase in the spending requested in the\n\n[[Page S7057]]\n\nappropriations bill is about 2.4 percent. While $200,000 is a lot of \nmoney--and it certainly is a lot to people today--I think it is \nimportant to point out that this museum is associated with the \nlegislative branch in the following manner.\n  The Durham Museum is seeking to provide a public service of Federal \ninterest making it appropriate to promote a public-private partnership. \nAnd this truly is a public-private partnership; the funding for the \nproject in this bill is only 10 percent of the total cost. The Durham \nMuseum will privately raise the remaining 90 percent and incur all \nongoing operating costs.\n  The $200,000 requested in this bill for the Durham Museum to begin \nthe preservation and digitization of the museum's photo archive \ncollection will create new jobs, preserve our history and improve \naccess to these priceless treasures.\n  This project will be moved significantly forward by the able \nassistance of the Library of Congress, and I thank Dr. Billington for \nhis willingness to assist with this important project.\n  It is important to point out that the Library of Congress has been a \nleader in digitization efforts, having digitized more than 15 million \nunique primary source documents. The library enjoyed a remarkable long-\nterm relationship with the Durham Museum long before I came to the \nSenate and will undoubtedly oversee a quality project as the Durham \nMuseum seeks to follow in our national library's footsteps.\n  Mr. President, not all national treasures are located inside the \nbeltway.\n  This project is more than just a ``photo exhibit.'' In addition to \nmaking these images available to the public, as noted in the \nLegislative Branch Report, Durham will work with the Library of \nCongress to establish conservation and preservation training programs, \nand on incorporating digitized primary source materials into school \ncurricula.\n  Dr. Billington and I have worked together to ensure that the \nlibrary's most impressive exhibits have traveled to the Durham Museum \nover the years, ensuring that my fellow Nebraskans, Iowans from the \neast, Kansans from the south, and South Dakotans from the north, have \nhad access to some of our Nation's most treasured documents and \nartifacts.\n  Some of the notable library exhibits that have traveled to the Durham \nMuseum have included: ``Bound for Glory,'' showcasing the photographs \nof the Farm Security Administration in the late 1930s and 1940s, and \n``With An Even Hand, Brown v. Board at Fifty,'' commemorating the 50th \nanniversary of the landmark Supreme Court decision in the case of Brown \nv. the Board of Education.\n  In January of 2011, the library's most recent impressive exhibit on \nAbraham Lincoln, ``With Malice Toward None,'' will travel to the Durham \nMuseum, showcasing some of our revered former President's most \ntransformative speeches and eloquent letters.\n  I urge that this not be considered just a local project. It is \nassociated with the Library of Congress and, as such, has a tie that is \nan ongoing and longstanding relationship that will benefit both the \nLibrary of Congress and the Durham Museum. There is a nexus here and it \nis not an isolated incident.\n  At this point, I ask my colleagues to support the inclusion of that \nfunding within this budgetary request.\n\n\n                            OSHA violations\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, as the Senate considers the fiscal \nyear 2010 legislative branch appropriations bill, S. 1294, I would like \nto raise a concern I have with a provision related to the Congressional \nAccountability Act of 1995, CAA. As the author of the Congressional \nAccountability Act, I have long believed that Congress needs to \npractice what it preaches by applying certain laws Congress passes to \nthe legislative branch. The CAA did this by incorporating a number of \nlaws including the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. Senator \nMurkowski, the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on the Legislative Branch, is here and I would like to ask \nabout the provision in the bill related to the CAA.\n  I am concerned that the provision striking a section of the CAA \nrelated to the compliance date for OSHA violations may go further than \nnecessary. As the author of the CAA, this provision was included to \nensure that OSHA violations that are found in legislative branch \nbuildings are remedied in a timely fashion. I understand that some \nconcerns have arisen regarding the requirement that compliance occur by \nthe next fiscal year, which prompted this revision, is that correct?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. That is correct, and it was a topic of discussion \nduring the subcommittee hearings. Citations from the Office of \nCompliance are requiring certain actions by the Architect of the \nCapitol that don't always make sense. We found that the legislative \nbranch is held to a higher standard than the executive branch and the \nprivate sector, and certain standards and timelines are applied that \nwould not be applied outside the legislative branch, particularly to \nhistoric buildings.\n  As I said in our hearing with the Architect of the Capitol and Office \nof Compliance, I am completely supportive of having strong fire and \nlife safety standards, but applying a ``gold standard'' to the \nlegislative branch doesn't seem to be appropriate. We need to be \npragmatic, and operate within a risk-based framework. In some cases, we \nhave been asked to fund expensive projects by the AOC that simply \naren't a good use of taxpayer dollars and don't necessarily offer \nsignificant improvements in fire and life safety.\n  Senator Nelson and I asked GAO to work with us to suggest how we \ncould get the legislative branch on par with the executive branch and \nprivate sector. This language is the result of those discussions.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree that this provision should not lead to \nunnecessary expenditures and that we should examine this provision. \nHowever, I'm concerned the current revision in S. 1294 goes a bit too \nfar by completely striking the compliance date. In fact I am informed \nthe Office of Compliance, the entity in charge of enforcing the CAA has \nexpressed concerns with completely striking this provision and instead \nrecommends a selective amendment.\n  Out of the interest of saving time on the Senate floor, I will \nwithhold an amendment to strike or modify this provision if the \ndistinguished ranking member is willing to commit to working with me on \nthis provision to make sure the revision is as narrow as possible as \nrecommended by the Office of Compliance.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I would agree to work with the ranking member of the \nFinance Committee, to work with the chairman of this subcommittee, \nSenator Nelson, and attempt to address his concerns as this bill moves \nforward.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the distinguished ranking member and look \nforward to working with her and the chairman to narrow this provision \nand address the concerns expressed by the Office of Compliance.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, the nomination of a new Justice to the \nSupreme Court has somewhat unexpectedly brought to our mind a core \nquestion both for the Senate and the American people, and that is: \nWhat, if any, is the appropriate role for foreign law to play in the \ninterpretation of our Constitution--meaning, should judges look at what \nother countries say when they are determining what are our \nconstitutional rights.\n  This is not an academic question; it is a question that has the \npotential to impact our fundamental rights guaranteed to us by the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  Until recent years, the answer has always been understood to be no, \napart from a few rare circumstances, certainly, and certainly never in \nthe interpretation of the meaning of our precious constitutional \nrights.\n  This traditional understanding has served to protect our \nconstitutional right by ensuring that judges remain true to the will of \nthe American people, not the will of foreign judges or courts.\n  Our system has a critical component: moral authority. That moral \nauthority\n\n[[Page S7058]]\n\ncomes from the basic concept that our law is a product of the will of \nthe people through the people they chose to represent them. The \nConstitution begins ``We the People do ordain and establish this \nConstitution.'' Our laws are enacted by a Congress, a body subject to \nthe will of the people, composed of people elected by the people. We \nare accountable to the American citizens.\n  The novel idea that foreign law has a place in the interpretation of \nAmerican law creates numerous dangers. A number of academics, and even \nFederal judges, I would say, are seduced by this idea.\n  Judge Sotomayor clearly shares in that idea. I am somewhat surprised, \nbut it is true, as I will discuss. Her vision seems to be that we \nshould change our laws, or listen to other laws and judges, and sort of \nmerge them with this foreign law. That is the overt opinion of Mr. Koh, \nwho was just nominated and confirmed to the chief counsel of the U.S. \nState Department. Mr. Koh is quite open about it--shockingly so, \nreally.\n  But I suggest that if we become transnational, we suffer two \nmonumental blows to our legal system. First, the laws we are subject to \nwould not be laws made by us. This should remind us of the Boston tea \nparty. The colonies objected to paying taxes, but not just any taxes; \nthey objected because the taxes were being imposed on them by the \nBritish Parliament, and they didn't have a voice in it. The complaint \nwas ``taxation without representation.'' Thus, the moral power of the \nAmerican law to compel obedience arises from the people's choice to \nenact it in the first place. That moral authority is undermined when we \nallow foreign law, which we had nothing to do with, to impact our law. \nThat is a pernicious thing, I suggest.\n  Second, it is not ever going to work in a good way. Most countries \ndon't have laws, truth be known. They have politics masquerading as \nlaws. Trying to merge our system, based on truth, the law, and the \nevidence, with these political legal systems will only result in our \nbeing shortchanged. We can reach agreements affecting mutual interests \nwith foreign nations and adhere to them as long as we agree to do so--\ntreaties and other kinds of agreements--but to submit ourselves to \ntheir political policies while pretending we are merging our law with \ntheirs is foolishness.\n  It also creates confusion on a matter of utmost importance. The \nquestion is, who does the judge serve, the people of the United States \nor the people of the world or some individual country with whom they \nagree or the amorphous ``world community,'' which has been referred to?\n  Furthermore, reliance on foreign law places our constitutional rights \nin jeopardy. There are great differences between American and foreign \nlaw on cherished rights protected by our Constitution. The \nConstitution's protection of free speech is probably unparalleled \nanywhere in the world. Other nations punish sometimes spirited debate \non controversial matters. They call it sometimes ``hate speech'' and \ntake action against speech and other things that we would allow without \na single thought, but it is criminalized in other countries.\n  The Constitution clearly protects the right to keep and bear arms. \nOther nations ban private gun ownership entirely. The Constitution \nallows for the death penalty. Other nations reject the use of the death \npenalty, even for violent killers, while some other nations have the \ndeath penalty and they impose it without due process being carried out. \nYet this troubling potential for infringements on constitutional \nrights, I suggest, is only the tip of the iceberg.\n  First and foremost, reliance on foreign law creates opportunities for \njudges to indulge their policy preferences. In a speech that was given \nto the Puerto Rico chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union on \nApril 28 of this year, 2009, 1 day after having been contacted by the \nWhite House about the possibility of a Supreme Court vacancy, Judge \nSotomayor placed herself firmly on what I believe is the wrong side of \nthis debate, stating in this speech:\n\n       To suggest to anyone that you can outlaw the use of foreign \n     or international law is a sentiment that is based on a \n     fundamental misunderstanding. What you would be asking \n     American judges to do is close their minds to good ideas.\n\n  Well, the ideas our judges are supposed to reflect are the ideas that \nthe Congress sought to be good, the ones we enacted into law--not what \nwas enacted in France, Saudi Arabia, China, or any other place. This is \na matter of real importance. This whole concept of foreign law has been \na matter of real controversy for several years. It is a timely subject, \nfor sure. I thought it was pretty roundly condemned, although one judge \non the Supreme Court defends it. In her speech, Judge Sotomayor \nexplains:\n\n       The nature of the criticism comes from . . . a \n     misunderstanding of the American use of that concept of using \n     foreign law, and that misunderstanding is unfortunately \n     endorsed by some of our own Supreme Court justices. Both \n     Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas have written extensively \n     criticizing the use of foreign and international law in \n     Supreme Court decisions.\n\n  So she criticized Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas, who have \nexpressed opposition to this. Let me be blunt. I believe it is Judge \nSotomayor, not Justices Scalia and Thomas, who is wrong.\n  Under her approach, a judge has free rein to survey the world to find \nwhat they might consider to be good ideas and then impose these views \non the American people, calling it law. However, this is not the \nAmerican system. Our system requires judges to adhere to this \nConstitution, to the statutes, and to the legal precedent, to the end \nthat judges follow the will of the people of our country as expressed \nin our law.\n  The Constitution says ``We . . . do ordain and establish this \nConstitution for the United States of America,'' not some other. Judges \nare not free to amend it by citing some other foreign constitution. I \nthink this is a big deal.\n  Judges are not free to indulge their own personal opinions about what \ngood policy is. Judges do not set policy and search for support for \nthat in foreign law. Despite Judge Sotomayor's claim at a Duke Law \nSchool panel discussion that ``courts of appeals is where policy is \nmade,'' judges are not policymakers. They are servants of the law, if \nthey are fulfilling their role properly--the law as it is, not the way \nthey might wish it to be.\n  Second, reliance on foreign law causes confusion rather than \nclarification as to the state of American law. Judge Sotomayor claims \nthat foreign law ``can add to the story [sic] of knowledge relevant to \nthe solution of . . . [a] question [sic],'' paraphrasing Supreme Court \nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who pioneered this concept. She made those \nstatements. Judge Ginsburg's citation of it in cases and her defense of \nit in speeches has really led to this controversy to which Justices \nScalia and Thomas have responded.\n  On the contrary, reliance on foreign law creates confusion. Consider \nJudge Sotomayor's dissenting opinion in Croll v. Croll in the \ninterpretation of a treaty--one of the few instances in which reliance \non foreign law may be perfectly permissible. Judge Sotomayor repeatedly \ncriticized the majority judges on the panel as ``parochial'' for \nconsulting American dictionaries to understand the meaning of custody \nas determined by the Hague Convention on International Child Abduction, \nand then she relies on foreign interpretations of those words instead. \nYet the majority rightly rebuked Judge Sotomayor for relying on the \nscattered and divergent foreign legal cases on this subject. The \nmajority even cites a Supreme Court precedent that warns against \nrelying on foreign law where it is in a state of confusion.\n  Third, the reliance on foreign law is also based on a misconception \nthat judges, rather than elected officials in the political branches of \ngovernment, play a role in advancing our Nation's foreign policy.\n  Judge Sotomayor states this:\n\n       I share more the ideas of Justice Ginsburg in thinking . . \n     . that unless American courts are more open to discussing the \n     ideas raised by foreign cases, and by international cases, \n     that we are going to lose influence in the world.\n\n  But judges are not diplomats. It is the job of diplomats to protect \nour standing in the world, and they have to explain to the world why we \nrule the way we rule on our cases. That is their responsibility.\n  Fourth, reliance on foreign law blurs the distinction between \ndomestic and\n\n[[Page S7059]]\n\nforeign law, undermining our ability to make democratic choices. The \nexamples of the Supreme Court reliance on foreign law, cited \napprovingly by Judge Sotomayor, involved the interpretation of the \nConstitution dealing with purely domestic legal issues that do not and \nshould not touch on any matter of international concern. For example, \nshe approvingly cites the case of Roper v. Simmons in which five \nJustices of the Supreme Court recently rendered a decision based in \npart on their review of foreign law and concluded that our Constitution \ndeclares that we cannot execute a violent criminal if that criminal is \n1 day under 18 years of age when he killed someone or a group of \npeople. There is nothing in the Constitution that says that. They found \nsome foreign law to make an argument about what the Constitution says \nabout what age a State can set for the death penalty. I know we can \ndisagree on what the age should be, but it is a legislative matter.\n  The Court in that case said it was looking to ``evolving standards of \ndecency that mark the progress of a maturing society.'' What kind of \nstandard is that for law? Where do you find what a maturing society now \nbelieves? Do you check with China? Do you check with Iran? Or maybe \nFrance? Where do we do this? How do they divine what this all is?\n  The Court concluded that the death penalty violated the eighth \namendment which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. There are at \nleast six or more references in the Constitution itself to capital \ncrimes, to taking a life without due process. It has always been \ncontemplated in the Constitution that the death penalty is not cruel \nand unusual. That was for drawing-and-quartering and such matters as \nthat.\n  If basic constitutional rights are subject to redefinition by \nconsidering foreign law, our Constitution ceases to be the bulwark for \nour liberty it has always been. The Constitution will be weakened. Its \nauthority and power will be diminished. Yet this is precisely the view \nof foreign law advocated by Judge Sotomayor, who says that these courts \nthat do this ``were just using foreign law to help us understand what \nthe concept meant to other countries, and to help us understand whether \nour understanding of our own constitutional rights fell into the \nmainstream of human thinking.'' I am not sure, did the judge conduct \nworldwide polls of human thinking? How does a judge find out what the \nmainstream of human thinking is? In truth, many of the critics of this \nidea have hit the nail on the head. They say that all it does is allow \na judge to look around the world to find somebody who agrees with them \nand use that as authority to do what they wanted to do all along.\n  Judge Sotomayor not only advocates for reliance on foreign law, but \nshe also goes a step further than Justice Ginsburg, advocating for \nadoption of the techniques of foreign judges, even ones that serve to \nconceal the individual judge's reasoning process from public scrutiny.\n  In her forward to the book ``The International Judge,'' which she was \nchosen to do, Judge Sotomayor states:\n\n       [T]he question of how much we have to learn from foreign \n     law and the international community when interpreting our \n     Constitution is not the only one worth posing. As ``The \n     International Judge'' makes clear, we should also question \n     how much we have to learn from international courts and from \n     their male and female judges about the process of judging and \n     the factors outside the law that influence our decisions.\n\n  In her speech in 1999, Judge Sotomayor expressed admiration for the \nFrench tradition of judicial panels of judges issuing single decisions, \ncommenting:\n\n       With a single decision, there is less pressure on \n     individual judges and less fear of reprisal for unpopular \n     decisions.\n\n  According to law professor William D. Popkin, French legal opinions \nare anonymous, unanimous, and laconic, the legal ``equivalent of \nflashing a policeman's badge,'' and ``[t]he irony about French judicial \nopinion writing is that minimal reason-giving allows French judges to \nconceal a bold judicial lawmaking role, perhaps even bolder than in the \ncase of U.S. and English judges because of the lack of any formal \nnotion of precedent.''\n  That is different from the American heritage of law. Judges sign \nopinions. But we have seen at least three very significant opinions in \nrecent years and months from Judge Sotomayor that were per curiam. No \none judge assumed responsibility for the decision, and they were very \nshort--so in a way, maybe she is following that--really surprisingly \nshort in the case involving firearms, in the case involving the \nfirefighters in Connecticut. They were very short opinions and not a \nlot of discussion and per curiam.\n  The problems with this tradition are clear. The approach makes it \neasier for judges to conceal the grounds of their decisions, making it \nmore difficult to assess whether their legal reasoning was justified. \nOnly then can one see if proper principles are being followed. Indeed, \nJudge Sotomayor may already be following that, as I noted with some of \nthe per curiam opinions we have seen.\n  I have to say the judge wants more international law, not less. \nOminously, Judge Sotomayor states:\n\n       International law and foreign law will be very important in \n     the discussion of how we think about the unsettled issues in \n     our legal system. It is my hope that judges everywhere will \n     continue to do this because . . . within the American legal \n     system, we're commanded to interpret our law in the best way \n     we can, and that means looking to what other, anyone has said \n     to see if it has persuasive value.\n\n  The judge makes an audacious claim that the American legal system \ncommands judges to look at foreign law and highlights the role of \nmaking decisions on unsettled cases. There have been and will be many \ndifferences between domestic and foreign law on matters that are \nfundamental. This is normal and understandable because different \nnations have different cultures, values, and legal systems. The United \nStates should be independent to pursue its own individual choices \nexpressed through the American people through their elected officials \nto reach the fullest and richest expression of our exceptionalism as a \nnation.\n  The American ideal of law is objectivity in deciding the case before \nthe court, that case being sufficient for the day. This is unusual. \nMost countries are not so restrained. To a much greater degree, foreign \njudges see themselves as policymakers. In Afghanistan and Pakistan \nrecently, the chief judge was setting all kinds of policy in \nAfghanistan. I thought it was most unusual. Surely nothing like that \nwould happen here because we have a different heritage.\n  I suggest that for an ambitious, strong-willed American judge, such \nfreedom to search around the world to identify arguments that might be \nhelpful in allowing them to reach a result they might like to reach \nwould be a great temptation. It is a siren call that ought not to be \nfollowed, and great judges do not do so. They analyze the American \nstatutes, the American Constitution in a fair and objective way. They \napply it to the evidence fairly and honestly found and render a \ndecision without any regard to the parties before them, to the rich and \npoor alike, as their oath says. That is why we give them independence \nas a judge to show they will be more willing to render those kinds of \nopinions.\n  I am troubled by this, I have to say. I did not expect to see a \nnominee who would be one of the leading advocates for the adoption of \nforeign law in the American legal system. I think it is wrong. I don't \nthink that is a good idea. The American people need to be talking about \nthat issue as they think about the confirmation that will be coming up.\n\n  Our nominee, Judge Sotomayor, is delightful to talk to. She has a \nrecord and a practice as a private practitioner, as a prosecutor, as a \ndistrict judge, and an appellate judge. All of those are good. She has \nmany good qualities. But some of the issues I am raising today and have \nraised previously do cause me concern.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich).

I have known Mark \nand his family for many years, and have long been impressed by his many \naccomplishments and contributions to his community.\n  Mark's affiliations are far too long to list but that is an accurate \nindication of how much of himself he has given to others.\n  A founding partner at his successful firm--Mandell, Schwartz & \nBoisclair, Ltd. in Providence, RI, Mark has been listed among the \n``Best Lawyers in America.'' He has served as the president of the \nAssociation of Trial Lawyers of America, the Roscoe Pound Institute of \nCivil Justice, the Rhode Island Bar Association and the Rhode Island \nTrial Lawyers Association.\n  In addition to his abundant bar memberships, professional \nassociations, society memberships, civic and community activities, and \ngovernment appointments, Mark has authored and lectured extensively \nthroughout the United States and around the world.\n  Mark has been recognized with numerous awards, but I know that he is \nmost gratified not by those that honor his professional achievements, \nbut rather those that acknowledge his good citizenship and leadership \nin community service.\n  Many of those awards honor Mark for his strong commitment to the \nJewish community he so values. As the Torah implores, ``Justice, \njustice shall you pursue.''\n  I am proud to call Mark Mandell my friend, and thank him for his \ndedicated and principled pursuit of justice. Happy birthday, Mark.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/25/senate-section/article/S7060-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7060-S7062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to submit to the Senate the first \nbudget scorekeeping reports for the 2010 budget resolution. The \nreports, which cover fiscal years 2009 and 2010, were prepared by the \nCongressional Budget Office pursuant to section 308(b) and in aid of \nsection 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended.\n  The reports show the effects of congressional action through June 23, \n2009, and include the effects of P.L. 111-22, the Helping Families Save \nTheir Homes Act of 2009; P.L. 111-31, the Family Smoking Prevention and \nTobacco Control Act; H.R. 1777, an act to make technical corrections to \nthe Higher Education Act of 1965, and for other purposes, pending \nPresidential action; and H.R. 2346, the Supplemental Appropriations \nAct, 2009, pending Presidential action. The estimates of budget \nauthority, outlays, and revenues are consistent with the technical and \neconomic assumptions of S. Con. Res. 13, the 2010 budget resolution.\n  For 2009, the estimates show that current level spending is $942 \nmillion below the level provided for in the budget resolution for \nbudget authority and $3.9 billion above it for outlays while current \nlevel revenues match the budget resolution level. For 2010, the \nestimates show that current level spending is $1,205.9 billion below \nthe level provided for in the budget resolution for budget authority \nand $715.9 billion below it for outlays while current level revenues \nare $12.3 billion above the budget resolution level.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the letters and accompanying tables \nfrom CBO printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 25, 2009.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed report shows the effects of \n     Congressional action on the fiscal year 2009 budget and is \n     current through June 23, 2009. This report is submitted under \n     section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional \n     Budget Act, as amended.\n       The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues \n     are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of \n     S. Con. Res. 13, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for \n     Fiscal Year 2010, as approved by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives.\n       Pursuant to section 403 of S. Con Res. 13, provisions \n     designated as emergency requirements are exempt from \n     enforcement of the budget resolution. As a result, the \n     enclosed current level report excludes these amounts (see \n     footnote 2 of Table 2 of the report).\n       Since my last letter dated September 11, 2008, the Congress \n     has cleared and the President has signed several acts that \n     affect budget authority, outlays, and revenues for fiscal \n     year 2009. The budgetary effects of legislation enacted at \n     the end of the second session of the 110th Congress are \n     included in the effects of previously enacted legislation on \n     Table 2.\n       Legislation enacted during the 111th Congress prior to the \n     adoption of S. Con. Res. 13 is included in the budget \n     aggregates of S. Con. Res. 13 (see footnote 1 of Table 2). In \n     addition, since the adoption of S. Con. Res. 13, the Congress \n     has cleared and the President has signed the following acts:\n       Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009 (Public Law \n     111-22); and\n       An act to protect the public health by providing the Food \n     and Drug Administration with certain authority to regulate \n     tobacco products . . . and for other purposes (Public Law \n     111-31).\n       The Congress has also cleared for the President's signature \n     the following acts:\n       An act to make technical corrections to the Higher \n     Education Act of 1965, and for other purposes (H.R. 1777); \n     and\n       Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009 (H.R. 2346).\n       This is CBO's first current level report since the adoption \n     of S.

Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the \nlife of Army SPC Chancellor Arsenio Keesling, from Indianapolis, IN. \nChancellor was 25 years old when he lost his life on June 19, 2009, in \nBaghdad, Iraq. He was a member of the 961st Engineer Company of the \nU.S. Army Reserve, based in Sharonville, OH.\n  Today, I join Chancellor's family and friends in mourning his death. \nChancellor, who was known to his friends and family as Chancy, will \nforever be remembered as a loving brother, son and friend to many. He \nis survived by his parents Gregg and Jannett Keesling; his brother \nO'Neil; his sister Tiana; his grandparents Gary and Gwen Keesling and \nTerrence and Barbara Fowle; and a host of other friends and family \nmembers.\n  Chancellor, a graduate of Lawrence North High School in Indianapolis, \nenlisted in the Army following his graduation in 2003. He served his \nfirst tour of duty in Iraq as a combat engineer assigned to a company \nbased at Fort Sill in Lawton, OK. He was redeployed to Iraq in May 2009 \nwith the 961st Engineer Company for a second tour of duty.\n  Chancellor had been home just a few weeks ago to celebrate his 25th \nbirthday with family and friends. A native of Jamaica, where he lived \nuntil he was 12 years old, he had a particular passion for soccer and \nreggae music. He planned on going into the construction business once \nhis military career was complete.\n  While we struggle to express our sorrow over this loss, we can take \npride in the example Chancellor set as a soldier and patriot. Today and \nalways, he will be remembered by family and friends as a true American \nhero, and we cherish the legacy of his service and his life.\n  As I search for words to do justice to this valiant fallen soldier, I \nrecall President Abraham Lincoln's words as he addressed the families \nof soldiers who died at Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as we can take \nsome measure of solace in knowing that Chancellor's heroism and memory \nwill outlive the record of the words here spoken.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Army SPC Chancellor Arsenio \nKeesling in the Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this \ncountry and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and \npeace. I pray that Chancellor's family can find comfort in the words of \nthe prophet Isaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and \nthe Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Chancellor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/25/senate-section/article/S7062-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7062-S7063]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on July 4, the Nation will celebrate the \n43rd anniversary of the signing of the Freedom of Information Act, \nFOIA. The tragic events unfolding in Iran are a powerful reminder of \nthe vital role of a free press and the free flow of information in an \nopen society. Now in its fifth decade, FOIA remains an indispensable \ntool for shedding light on bad policies and government abuses. The act \nhas helped to guarantee the public's ``right to know'' for generations \nof Americans.\n  Today, thanks to the reforms contained in the Leahy-Cornyn OPEN \nGovernment Act, Americans who seek information under FOIA will \nexperience a process that is much more transparent and less burdened by \ndelays than it has been in the past. A key component of the OPEN \nGovernment Act was the creation of an Office of Government Information \nServices, OGIS, within the National Archives and Records \nAdministration. This office will mediate FOIA disputes, review agency \ncompliance with FOIA, and house a newly created FOIA ombudsman.\n\n[[Page S7063]]\n\n  I applaud President Obama and Acting Archivist of the United States \nAdrienne Thomas for recently appointing Miriam Nisbet as the first \nDirector of OGIS. I look forward to working closely with Director \nNisbet and I will continue to work very hard to ensure that OGIS has \nthe necessary resources to carry out its mission.\n  These new reforms to FOIA are very good news. But there is still much \nmore to be done.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Cornyn and I joined together to \nreintroduce the bipartisan OPEN FOIA Act, S. 612, a commonsense bill to \npromote more openness regarding statutory exemptions to FOIA. This FOIA \nreform measure requires that Congress clearly and explicitly state its \nintention to create a statutory exemption to FOIA when it provides for \nsuch an exemption in new legislation. While there is a very real need \nto keep certain government information secret to ensure the public good \nand safety, excessive government secrecy is a constant temptation and \nthe enemy of a vibrant democracy.\n  The OPEN FOIA Act has twice passed the Senate this year as a part of \nother legislation. This bill provides a safeguard against the growing \ntrend towards FOIA exemptions and would make all FOIA exemptions clear \nand unambiguous, and vigorously debated, before they are enacted into \nlaw. I hope that the Congress will enact this good government measure \nthis year.\n  When describing our vibrant democracy, President Kennedy once wisely \nobserved that ``[w]e are not afraid to entrust the American people with \nunpleasant facts, foreign ideas, alien philosophies and competitive \nvalues. For a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth \nand falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its \npeople.'' As we reflect upon the celebration of another FOIA \nanniversary, we in Congress must reaffirm this commitment to open and \ntransparent government.\n  Open government is not a Democratic issue, nor a Republican issue. It \nis truly an American value and a virtue that all Americans hold dear. \nIt is in this bipartisan spirit that I join Americans from across the \npolitical spectrum in celebrating the 43rd anniversary of FOIA and all \nthat this law has come to symbolize about our vibrant democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/25/senate-section/article/S7063-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7063-S7064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COMMENDING HUBERT AND THOMAS VOGELMANN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the Senate's \nattention a recent article published in The Burlington Free Press on \nFather's Day, which featured father and son botanists Hubert and Thomas \nVogelmann from Jericho, VT, and the University of Vermont.\n  Now professor emeritus at the University of Vermont, Hub Vogelmann \nwas the pioneer researcher calling attention to the impact of \natmospheric deposition--acid rain--on the forests of the Northeast. Hub \nled a field trip on the western slopes of the Green Mountains to view \nthe damage in person with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, \nAdministrator. His contributions to the stewardship of our natural \nresources are many, particularly concerning the health of the forest \necosystem.\n  Now dean of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at the \nUniversity of Vermont, Hub's son Tom is carrying on in the Vogelmann \nfamily tradition of science, service and stewardship.\n  As if this were not remarkable enough, Hub and his late wife Marie's \ntwo other sons are scientists as well, Jim a botanist and Andy, a \nphysicist.\n  I value the working relationship I have enjoyed with Hub over the \nyears and look forward to working with Tom in his new role as dean.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article ``Like \nFather, Like Son--Fellow botanists have a lot in common,'' be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Like Father, Like Son; Fellow Botanists Have a Lot in Common\n\n                            (By Tim Johnson)\n\n       Jericho.--This is a story about the family Vogelmann, \n     father and son. They're next-door neighbors.\n       Hub, the father, grew up in a city, married, had three \n     sons, moved here to the country, and tried his hand at \n     raising beef cattle--grass-fed, back before that was \n     fashionable.\n       Tom, the eldest, proved adept at haying. He was a bit of a \n     handful, into everything, but he was good at tossing bales \n     into the barn.\n       Hub had a day job, and he used to joke that's what made it \n     possible for him to lose money on the cattle. Tom helped out \n     but ``he always had a mind of his own--it was get out of my \n     way,' '' Hub recalled the other day.\n       Tom smiled knowingly. They were sitting on Tom's porch in \n     the late afternoon sun, reminiscing.\n       Hub's day job was professor of botany at the University of \n     Vermont. He was there 36 years, retiring in 1991.\n       Tom turned out all right. He, too, is a professor of botany \n     . . . at the University of Vermont, where else? He's also the \n     new dean of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.\n       If ever there was a prime example of a son's following in \n     his father's footsteps--not just figuratively, but \n     literally--Tom is it. That's what he's doing every time he \n     walks along the gravel road that runs past their houses.\n\n\n                           Butternuts decoded\n\n       Hubert W. ``Hub'' Vogelmann, son of a minister in Buffalo, \n     N.Y., became a botanist by a kind of happenstance.\n       He liked science. During his last year at Heidelberg \n     College, in Ohio, his favorite professor asked him what he \n     was going to do after he graduated.\n       ``I said, `I dunno,' '' Hub recalled. ``And he said, \n     `You've got to go to graduate school. I know some people in \n     the botany department at the University of Michigan.' ''\n       On the strength of the professor's recommendation, Hub went \n     to Ann Arbor.\n       ``They gave me an exam, and I flunked it,'' he said. ``The \n     department chairman was very kind. He let me stay on.''\n       Hub stayed on long enough to get his Ph.D. His first job \n     after that was at UVM, and he never left.\n       ``Vermont,'' he said. ``As a botanist, you couldn't ask for \n     a better place.''\n       At first, Hub and his wife, Marie, settled in Essex \n     Junction. In 1958, when Tom was 5, Hub bought a 120-acre \n     dairy farm in Jericho and has lived there ever since. He \n     later acquired the adjoining property and rented that place \n     out.\n       Tom was in the first entering class at the new Jericho \n     Elementary School. He remembers being able, from the house, \n     to spot the distant school bus approaching from far across \n     the fields--far enough away that he could time his arrival \n     just right at the stop down the road. His summers were pretty \n     uneventful. He remembers sitting in a tree and watching draft \n     horses at work--old farming technology that was in its last \n     throws in the '50s. He appreciated what he saw.\n       ``When they'd do haying,'' he said, ``there was not one \n     straw left.''\n       At age 14, during a year the family spent in Mexico, Tom \n     served as his father's assistant as they studied fog in the \n     Cloud Forest. Later Tom went to UVM, where he sampled various \n     disciplines. He liked science and remembers being \n     intellectually swept away by plant biochemistry and molecular \n     biology, two courses in his senior year. He remembers one \n     night at the family dinner table: Tom remarked how curious it \n     seemed to him that butternuts grow next to stone walls--could \n     it be something in their biochemistry or molecular biology?\n       His father looked at him.\n       ``Tom,'' Hub said, ``you need to take more ecology. They \n     grow there because that's where squirrels drop the nuts.''\n       Hub knew something about ecology, a field that began to \n     flourish during his career. He did seminal research on the \n     impact of acid rain on forests. He was the first to pin the \n     decline of red spruce on industrial emissions from the \n     Midwest, according to Walter Poleman, a senior lecturer at \n     UVM, who delivered a testimonial May 1 when Hub received a \n     Lifetime Achievement Award at the Center for Research on \n     Vermont. ``His findings helped establish guidelines for the \n     Clean Air Act and set the stage for acid rain research \n     throughout the Northeast,'' Poleman said.\n       Tom went his own way. He applied to graduate school in \n     plant biochemistry and in archaeology.\n       ``The plant people took me,'' he said. ``The archaeology \n     people didn't.'' So, he became a botanist, earning a Ph.D. \n     from Syracuse University and specializing in whole-plant \n     physiology. He and his wife, Mary (also a botanist), spent \n     three years in southern Sweden, then they went to the \n     University of Wyoming, where he rose to full professor. In \n     2001, someone from UVM asked if he'd be interested in \n     chairing the botany department--the same department Hub had \n     chaired for 20 years.\n       ``I thought, `Why not?' '' Tom said. ``So, I came back in \n     January of 2002.'' He camped out in his old room in his \n     father's place. Before long the tenant vacated the house next \n     door. Tom and Mary moved in. ``The whole story is a bit \n     surreal,'' Tom said, when asked how he came to be living next \n     door to his father. ``It wasn't ever thought out or planned.\n       ``One thing led to another,'' he said.\n\n\n                            Growing degrees\n\n       One thing led to another for Tom's younger brothers, too, \n     both of whom also have doctorates. Jim has a Ph.D. in botany, \n     and so does his wife. The youngest, Andy--the odd one out in \n     this family, unless you count their late mother, Marie, who \n     was an accomplished musician--has a Ph.D. in atmospheric \n     physics.\n\n[[Page S7064]]\n\n       Was it something in the water? How was it that all three \n     Vogelmann offspring wound up with advanced degrees in \n     science?\n       The question brought a blank look to Tom's face.\n       ``A lot of conversations around dinner table . . .'' he \n     said vaguely.\n       About what, besides butternuts?\n       ``Could be about anything, `` he said, ``from fossils to. . \n     . . We used to walk through plowed fields, we'd find \n     artifacts, and we'd talk about them.''\n       Or, he mused, maybe it had to do with the ambiance in which \n     they came of age. Some kids grow up in a corporate culture. \n     They grew up in a university culture.\n       Hub still enjoys hearing Tom talk about the doings at UVM. \n     Some things don't change, Hub said.\n       They don't just talk shop, though. Each one brags about the \n     other's garden.\n       ``He grows some of the world's best celeriac,'' Tom was \n     saying before Hub showed up.\n       Celeriac, Tom explained, is a big root that you can grate \n     into soups or salads. The leaves look like celery leaves.\n       After Hub arrived and sat down, the porch conversation soon \n     got back to gardens.\n       ``He has the biggest garlic patch in Vermont,'' Hub said.\n       ``No, I don't,'' Tom said.\n       ``How many plants do you have--a thousand?''\n       ``Over a thousand,'' Tom said. ``That's a lot of holes to \n     make with your thumb.''\n       ``How many varieties?''\n       ``Forty-two,'' Tom said.\n       Hub smiled. He seemed to know what was coming.\n       ``It all tastes pretty much the same,'' Tom said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/25/senate-section/article/S7064-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the past few months have been marked by \nseveral high-profile, tragic shootings that have left families to \ngrieve and communities to ponder why. While many of the details of \nthese recent shootings vary tremendously, one fact remains constant, \nour current gun laws have failed to keep firearms out of the hands of \nthose who should not have been able to acquire them.\n  In 1983, James von Brunn, a white supremacist and Holocaust denier, \nwas convicted of attempting to kidnap members of the Federal Reserve \nBoard, after he was caught trying to enter a board meeting carrying \nmultiple firearms. As a convicted felon, Mr. Von Brunn was legally \nbarred from possessing firearms. Despite this fact, on June 10, Mr. Von \nBrunn walked into the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and \nfatally shot security guard Stephen T. Johns, a 6-year veteran of the \nfacility, before being shot himself by other officers. Holding a .22-\ncaliber rifle, this man entered a museum that welcomes 30 million \nvisitors and school children annually. Tragically, this type of \nviolence is not uncommon.\n  On June 1, a 24-year-old man shot two soldiers, PVT William A. Long \nand PVT Quinton Ezeagwula, outside of a military recruiting station in \nLittle Rock, AR. Private Long, who had just completed basic training \nand was volunteering at the recruiting office before starting an \nassignment in South Korea, was killed in the shooting. The man accused \nin this incident was later found with two rifles and a handgun, despite \nbeing under investigation by the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force. The \nday before, a 51-year-old man with a history of mental illness walked \ninto the Reformation Lutheran Church in Wichita, KS, and shot Dr. \nGeorge Tiller in the head while he served as an usher during Sunday \nmorning services. The accused in this incident had been arrested by \npolice in 1996, after being found with bomb-making material in his car.\n  These senseless acts of gun violence frequently also target police \nofficers. On April 4, a 23-year-old man, dishonorably discharged from \nMarine basic training, armed with three guns, including an assault \nrifle, ambushed and gunned down Officers Eric Kelly, Stephen Mayhle, \nand Paul Sciullo in Pittsburgh, PA. A fourth officer, Timothy \nMcManaway, was shot in the hand. This shooting occurred just 2 weeks \nafter a 26-year-old man, with a prior conviction for assault with a \ndeadly weapon, turned two guns, including an assault rifle, on police \nofficers in Oakland, CA. SGTs Mark Dunakin, Ervin Romans, Daniel Sakai, \nand Officer John Hege were fatally shot in what was the deadliest day \nfor U.S. law enforcement since September 11, 2001.\n  In the span of a few months, a security officer, a doctor, two \nsoldiers, and seven police officers lost their lives. All devoted their \nprofessional lives to the protection of others; all gunned down by \nsomeone who should not have had access to a firearm. These are not \nuncommon events, but rather simply the latest high-profile shootings to \ncapture national headlines. In a nation which suffers 12,000 gun \nhomicides, 17,000 gun suicides, 650 accidental gun deaths, and another \n70,000 nonfatal gun injuries every year, there are still those who \nresist legislation aimed at putting an end to these tragedies. I urge \nmy colleagues to act immediately and pass urgently needed commonsense \ngun legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/25/senate-section/article/S7064-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CLOSE THE SILO/LILO LOOPHOLE ACT\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

GALVIN\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the long and \ndistinguished service of chief warrant officer and ancient keeper, \nKevin J. Galvin of the U.S. Coast Guard.\n  For over 30 years, Chief Warrant Officer Galvin has served proudly in \nour Nation's Coast Guard, exhibiting the classic attributes of a \n``Coastie'': a profound dedication to duty, unsurpassed technical \nexpertise, and an uncompromising commitment to operational excellence.\n  Since June 2006, Chief Warrant Officer Galvin has served as the \ncommanding officer of Castle Hill Station in Newport, RI. Through this \nperiod, during which the Coast Guard has taken on an increasing burden \nto help secure our homeland, Chief Warrant Officer Galvin exhibited \nsound and capable leadership. Under his watch, the Castle Hill Station \nexceeded every operational expectation, including the successful \nexecution of over 350 search and rescue cases which resulted in 46 \nlives saved, 428 persons assisted, and $23 dollars in property secured. \nChief Warrant Officer Galvin also oversaw more than 500 law enforcement \nboardings, directed multiple ports, waterways, and coastal security \nmissions to protect critical infrastructure, provided security for \nvisits by the President and foreign heads of state, and led his crew in \nproviding security and SAR response for Tall Ships 2007, where 27 ships \nvisited Rhode Island from around the world culminating in a Parade of \nSail with over 6000 spectator vessels.\n  On June 21, 2008, Chief Warrant Officer Galvin relieved master chief \nboatswain's mate John E. Downey as the ancient keeper of the Coast \nGuard, becoming the second recipient of the Joshua James Ancient Keeper \nAward. The Ancient Keeper Award is presented to a Coast Guard member on \nActive Duty in recognition of their longevity and outstanding \nperformance in boat operations. The award's namesake, CAPT Joshua \nJames, is the most celebrated lifesaver in Coast Guard history with 626 \nlives saved. Only those who have exemplified the finest traits of \nmaritime professionalism and leadership are appointed keepers. The \nancient keeper is charged with overseeing Coast Guard boat operations \nto ensure the service's traditional professionalism remains intact. \nChief Warrant Officer Galvin has carried out this responsibility with \nhonor and distinction.\n  On July 1, 2009, Chief Officer Galvin will bring his long and \nimpressive career in the Coast Guard to an end and will be relieved of \nhis duty as the ancient keeper and commanding officer of the Castle \nHill Station by another outstanding member of the Coast Guard, CWO \nThomas Guthlein.\n  Again, I commend Chief Warrant Officer Galvin for his dedicated \ncareer in the U.S. Coast Guard and thank him for all he has done in \nservice to our country.\n\n[[Page S7065]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/25/senate-section/article/S7065-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     PROJECT SPONSORSHIP CORRECTION\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Mr. President, I rise today to show my support for the \nMatthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009.\n  On June 15, 2009, Stephen Johns was killed in the U.S. Holocaust \nMuseum. On February 12, 2008, Lawrence King, a 15-year-old student, was \nmurdered in his high school because he was gay. On election night 2008, \ntwo men went on an assault spree to find African Americans, because \nthen-Senator Obama won the Presidential election. In July 2008, four \nteenagers brutally beat and killed a Mexican immigrant while yelling \nracial epithets. Hate crimes continue to occur in our country every \nday. According to recent FBI data, there were over 7,600 reported hate \ncrimes in 2007. That's nearly one every hour of every day. Over 150 of \nthose incidents occurred in my own home State of Maryland.\n  The number of hate crimes occurring across the country is likely \nunderestimated. At least 21 agencies in cities with populations between \n100,000 and 250,000 did not participate in the FBI data collection \neffort for the 2007 report. Additionally, victims may be fearful of \nauthorities and may not report these crimes. Local authorities may \ndefine what constitutes a hate crime differently than other \njurisdictions. But what we do know is that hate crimes are occurring \nand have increased toward certain groups of individuals.\n  According to the recent Leadership Conference on Civil Rights \nEducation Fund Report, entitled ``Confronting the New Faces of Hate,'' \nhate crimes against Latinos has been increasing steadily since 2003. \nThis marked increase also closely correlates with the increasing heated \ndebate over comprehensive immigration reform. There was also a five \nyear high in victimization rates in 2007 toward lesbian, gay, bisexual \nand transgendered individuals. That number has increased by almost 6 \npercent. The number of White supremacist groups has increased by 54 \npercent and African Americans continue to experience the largest number \nof hate crimes, with an annual number essentially unchanged over the \npast 10 years. While religion based offenses decreased, the number of \nreported anti-Jewish crimes increased slightly between 2006 and 2007.\n  The Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act is a necessary and \nappropriate response to this ongoing threat to our communities. \nCurrently, 45 States and the District of Columbia have enacted hate \ncrime laws and have taken a stand against hate in their States. Thirty-\none of those States have already included sexual orientation in their \ndefinition of what constitutes a hate crime. Twenty-seven States and \nthe District of Columbia prohibit violent crimes based upon a victim's \ngender. States have a patchwork of hate crimes statutes which leaves \ngaps which need to be filled in order to have an effective response and \nprosecution of these crimes. The Federal Government has a clear \nresponsibility to respond to hate crimes. Current Federal hate crime \nlaws are based only on race, color, national origin and religion. We \nneed to include gender, disability, gender identity, and sexual \norientation. Current law also requires the victim to be participating \nin a federally protected activity, like attending school or voting. \nThose who commit hate crimes are not bound to certain jurisdictions and \nneither should the people who prosecute them, which is why this \nlegislation removes the requirement that a victim be participating in a \nfederally protected activity. The Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes \nPrevention Act will make sure all Americans are equally protected \nagainst hate crimes.\n  The American public supports this goal. According to a Gallup poll \nfrom 2007, 68 percent of all Americans support extending hate crime \nprotection to groups based on sexual orientation and gender identity, \nincluding 60 percent of Republicans, and 62 percent of individuals who \nfrequently attend church. This legislation also enjoys the support of \n43 Senators from both sides of the aisle. The legislation has also \nalready passed the House of Representatives.\n  This legislation will also provide necessary resources to our State \nand local governments to fight hate crimes. Specifically, it will \nprovide grants for State, local and tribal law enforcement entities for \nprosecution, programming and education related to hate crime \nprosecution and prevention. The bill will assist States and provide \nthem with additional resources, not diminish their role in managing \ncriminal activity within their State. The bill supplements state and \nlocal law enforcement efforts.\n  Additionally, and most importantly, the legislation was carefully \ndrafted to maintain protections for Americans' first amendment rights. \nNothing in this legislation diminishes any American's freedom of \nreligion, freedom of speech or press, or the freedom to assemble. The \nSupreme Court has already ruled that such laws do not obstruct free \nspeech. Let me be clear, the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act \ntargets violent acts, not speech.\n  Hate crimes affect not just the victims; they victimize entire \ncommunities and make residents fearful. We cannot allow our communities \nto be terrorized by hatred and violence. I encourage my fellow \ncolleagues to support the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/25/senate-section/article/S7065-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7065-S7066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               100TH ANNIVERSARY OF MEDICINE BOW, WYOMING\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 100th \nanniversary of the town of Medicine Bow, WY. The town eventually became \nthe setting for the classic Western novel by Owen Wister, ``The \nVirginian.''\n  Medicine Bow's history began decades before its incorporation on June \n26, 1909. The town's name originates from the mountains surrounding the \narea. American Indians would annually travel to the foot of the \nMedicine Bow Mountains to obtain wood that was excellent for arrows. \nAccording to the Native Americans, anything that is perfect for the \npurpose for which it is intended is called ``good medicine.''\n  The Union Pacific Railroad routed tracks through the valley because \nthe Medicine Bow River was an ideal place for a pumping station. Steam \nengines would pause to take on a load of water before roaring across \nthe prairie to the east or over the mountains to the west. The railroad \nnot only produced what is now known as the town of Medicine Bow, but it \nalso created economic opportunities. Wyoming's booming cattle industry \nnecessitated stock yards in Medicine Bow. The town became an important \nshipping center for cattle headed to the eastern market and a great \nplace for cowboys to congregate after gathering their herds.\n  The wood in the Medicine Bow forest was excellent not only for arrows \nbut also for railroad ties. Every year, tie hacks cut hundreds of \nthousands of railroad ties and mining props from the mountains at the \nhead of the river. The material was then floated down to a river boom, \na mile from the Medicine Bow Station. These ties were pulled from the \nriver and shipped to supply America's swiftly expanding railroad \nnetwork.\n  The tie hacks and the cowboys played a vital role in the development \nof Medicine Bow's untamed reputation. It was this reputation as one of \nthe West's wildest towns that brought famous novelist Owen Wister to \nMedicine Bow. Following his stay in Medicine Bow, Wister authored the \nclassic Western novel, ``The Virginian.'' In his novel, he mirrored \nmore than just the setting of the town. His plot was a fictionalized \nstory about the Johnson\n\n[[Page S7066]]\n\nCounty War in Wyoming, told from the cattle barons' point of view. Even \nWister's famous line from the novel was not original. The phrase, \n``When you look at me smile,'' came from a local man named William \nHines. His novel brought fame and recognition to Wyoming's culture and \nhistory. In 1913 the Virginian Hotel was built by August Grimm and \nnamed after Wister's novel. To this day, visitors from all over the \nworld enjoy a nice meal and a comfortable night's sleep at the \nVirginian.\n  The area surrounding Medicine Bow has long been host to several \nenergy industries. Coal and uranium mines brought jobs to the area. \nPresently, wind turbines secure Medicine Bow's future and contribution \nto the America's energy market. Without a major interstate nearby, the \nMedicine Bow Valley has been able to secure and maintain its majestic \nwestern roots. Modernization may sweep through, but valleys like the \nMedicine Bow remind us of the Old West legacy.\n  In celebration of the 100th anniversary of the town of Medicine Bow, \nI invite my colleagues to visit this historic place. I congratulate the \ncitizens of Medicine Bow who steward this important piece of Wyoming's \nhistory and present it to visitors from all over the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/25/senate-section/article/S7066-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   COMMENDING REVEREND GEORGE POULOS\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize \nthe extraordinary service and remarkable character of Reverend George \nPoulos of the Church of the Archangels in Stamford, CT, who recently \nretired after over a half decade of service.\n  Reverend Poulos has come to hold a special place in our hearts and \nminds over his 53-year career. Over the years, he has been a spiritual \nfather and friend to thousands of Connecticut families. As parish \npriest for Church of the Archangels, Reverend Poulos has officiated \nover 2,000 baptisms, 1,000 weddings, and 800 funerals. Although his \nformal tenure as parish priest ended earlier this week, Reverend Poulos \nremains intimately connected to the birth, life, and remembrance of the \nStamford community. I have known Reverend Poulos for many years and \ntreasure the example he has set in his career of devoted service; I am \ngrateful for all the wisdom he has offered me personally.\n  The Church of the Archangels where Reverend Poulos served as parish \npriest is a magnificent structure built in the 11th century Byzantine \nstyle; in fact, it is the only true Byzantine-style church in the \nWestern Hemisphere. As a 16-year-old, I watched the amazing structure \nemerge just down the street from the house where I grew up.

Mr. President, as our colleagues know, this \nyear marks the 50th anniversary of Alaska's admission to statehood. \nEarlier this year I had the privilege to speak at a number of events to \nkickoff the 50th anniversary celebration. I marveled at the fact that \nso many of Alaska's statesmen and stateswomen--the people who led \nAlaska from a frontier territory to a modern and vibrant state--are \nstill with us today. The founding fathers and mothers of so many of our \nStates are just names in a history book. In contrast, the founding \nfathers and mothers of Alaska are not remote historical figures, but \nour friends and neighbors. Alaska's history is very much a living \nhistory. That is a source of great pride to me and to all Alaskans.\n  Yet every year, it seems, we lose another piece of Alaska's living \nhistory as those who played a significant role in the statehood fight \nand the early growth of our 49th State pass on. Today it is my sad duty \nto acknowledge the loss of Red Boucher, the first elected lieutenant \ngovernor of Alaska. Red died last Friday at the age of 88. This Friday \nthe people of Alaska will celebrate Red's life at a memorial service in \nAnchorage\n  Everyone who knew Red knew of his persuasive gifts. Born in Nashua, \nNH, he grew up in St. Vincent's Orphanage in Fall River, MA, where he \nwas placed at age 9 after his father's death in 1930. Seven years later \nRed, who was barely 16 years old, talked his way into the U.S. Navy. He \nserved for 20 years, including all of World War II. After he left the \nservice he ended up in Fairbanks, where in 1958 he established one of \nInterior Alaska's first sporting goods stores. But sports was only one \nof his passions. Politics was clearly another.\n  Following service on the Fairbanks city council and as mayor of the \ncity of Fairbanks, Red served as lieutenant governor of Alaska under \nGovernor Bill Egan from 1970 to 1974.\n  After his term as lieutenant governor, Red did not disappear from \npublic service. During his nationwide travels from 1976 to 1980 at the \nbehest of the Citizens for Management of Alaska's Lands, Red met with \nhundreds of newspaper editorial boards, winning acclaim for his strong \nreasoned arguments for why the Arctic Coastal Plain should be left open \nto oil and gas development if an environmental impact statement proved \nit could be developed without environmental harm. Many credited Red's \nefforts as the reason that ANWR's coastal plain was not locked up as \nwilderness when ANILCA was enacted in 1980. He returned to Juneau in \n1985 representing an Anchorage district in the Alaska House of \nRepresentatives. And in 1991 Red was elected to the Anchorage Assembly.\n  In the minds of many Alaskans these significant contributions are \nrelatively minor. They would regard Red's creation of the Alaska \nGoldpanners, Fairbanks' summer baseball team, as his most enduring \naccomplishment. He managed the team from 1960 to 1969. During the 1964 \nand 1965 seasons Red managed a young pitcher named Seaver, Tom Seaver.\n  The alumni list of the Alaska Goldpanners reads like a ``who's who'' \nof Major League Baseball. In fact, nearly 200 Goldpanner alumni have \ngone on to play in the majors. Then there was Dan Pastorini who pursued \na career in football as quarterback for the Houston Oilers, Oakland \nRaiders, Los Angeles Rams, and Philadelphia Eagles.\n  The Alaska Goldpanners continue to delight Alaskans and visitors from \naround the world each summer at Growden Memorial Field. At the time of \nhis death, Red was the director of external affairs for the team.\n  Two days after Red's passing, at 10:30 P.M. on the evening of Sunday, \nJune 21, his beloved Goldpanners took the field against the Lake Erie \nMonarchs. It was Fairbanks' 104th annual Midnight Sun Game, game played \neach year to commemorate the Summer Solstice. That game ended in the \nwee morning hours of Monday, June 22, with a 6-3 victory for the \n``Panners.'' Red's still watching out for them.\n  In his later years Red championed bringing modern telecommunications \nand computing technologies to the remotest parts of Alaska. He hosted a \nstatewide cable television show called ``Alaska On Line.'' I was proud \nto be Red's guest on more than one occasion. We discussed ANWR and the \nneed to construct a pipeline to transport Alaska's abundant natural gas \nsupplies to market.\n  The formula for ``Alaska On Line'' was simple: Invite interesting \nguests and let them tell their stories. These shows are virtual oral \nhistories of Alaska. In fact, many of the tapes have already been \nacquired by the University of Alaska Anchorage Consortium Library for \nuse by historians and scholars.\n  Red Boucher lived every day to the fullest enriching the lives of his \nfellow Alaskans in innumerable ways. I join with Red's family and all \nAlaskans in mourning the loss of this exemplary Alaskan.\n\n[[Page S7067]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/25/senate-section/article/S7067-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WEST VIRGINIA SCHOOL OF EXCELLENCE AWARD RECIPIENTS\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I honor the recipients \nof the West Virginia School of Excellence award for the 2008-2009 \nacademic school year. This is a prestigious award given to schools for \nproviding rigorous curricula, innovative programs, and exhibiting an \noverall high standard of learning. Those receiving the award this year \nwere Ben Franklin Career and Technical Center in Kanawha County; Poca \nMiddle School in Putnam County; Eagle School Intermediate in Berkeley \nCounty; Davis Creek, Village of Barboursville, and Martha Elementary \nSchools all of Cabell County; Cottageville Elementary in Jackson \nCounty; and Stratton Elementary in Raleigh County. They are all \nincredibly impressive schools that are challenging their students. I \nwould like to take a little time to highlight how each school is \npreparing their pupils for future success.\n  Ben Franklin Career and Technical Center, located in Dunbar, centers \nits curriculum on the principle of preparing all students for the 21st \ncentury by training them to operate efficiently in a complex economy. \nIt offers career preparation programs, short-term skill courses, and \ncustomized training for local businesses.\n  Poca Middle School is based on the principles of allowing students to \n``master basic academic skills and to explore and identify their own \ninterests and talents.'' It is a school that prides itself on offering \nstudents various opportunities to explore the arts and to actively \npursue their interest by attending a wide range of classes and school \nevents. It has allowed students to experience a more personal learning \nenvironment by implementing an online math program. The school's use of \nonline learning is just the beginning of the many expanded learning \nprograms that West Virginia schools will be implementing in the near \nfuture.\n  Eagle School Intermediate, located in Martinsburg, is dedicated to \n``providing educational opportunities for all students to reach their \nhighest academic potential.'' Eagle School Intermediate was one of the \nfirst schools in West Virginia to allow parents to track their \nstudent's progress via online grade checking. This is just another \nexample of how West Virginia is expanding its boundaries towards \nproviding the most in-depth academic technology to its students and \ntheir parents.\n  Davis Creek Elementary School, located in Barboursville, is an \nextraordinary representation of the Mountain State's flourishing \nprimary education programs. For the 2006-2007 school year, the Cabell \nCounty public school was declared a National Blue Ribbon School. Davis \nCreek served 169 students in grades K-5 and has also been named a West \nVirginia Exemplary School.\n  Village of Barboursville Elementary School, located in Barboursville \nas well, is an institution that is focused on cohesive learning among \nstudents and faculty. It boasts a strikingly high parental approval \nrating. The school focuses its curriculum on providing students with \nthe opportunity not only to learn inside the classroom, but also to \ndevelop proper social skills that can be taken and used to develop a \nstronger bond with the community.\n  Martha Elementary School, also located in Barboursville, is an \ninstitution founded on cooperation between parents and students to \ncreate an environment conducive to learning. This 300-student rural \nschool focuses on endowing students with the opportunity to follow \ntheir dreams. The dedicated faculty uses innovative programs to assist \nstudents on an individual basis, allowing for a more personalized \neducational experience. The school strives to create an atmosphere of \nsupport among family, the school, and the community.\n  Cottageville Elementary, located in Cottageville, is dedicated to \nproviding ``equity and excellence in education.'' The school bases its \ncurriculum on the belief that all students should be held to a high \nstandard and endowed with the resources necessary to receive an \nexcellent education. Teachers and faculty strive to provide their \nstudents with the skills necessary to excel academically by creating a \nsupport system that includes the school, family, and the community.\n  Stratton Elementary, located in Beckley, strives to afford all of its \nstudents the opportunity to learn at a pace that is the best match for \neach individual. Stratton offers many gifted programs and online \nlearning portals that allow students to take more advanced courses and \nto have access to one-on-one help around the clock.\n  Once again, I congratulate these eight schools for receiving the West \nVirginia School of Excellence award, a distinction each school \nundoubtedly deserves. I commend them on their impressive achievements \nand applaud all of the administrators, teachers, and students for the \nwonderful example they set for all West Virginians.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/25/senate-section/article/S7067-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/25/senate-section/article/S7067-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/25/senate-section/article/S7067-4", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 9:33 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 407.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nsimplify the deduction for use of a portion of a residence as a home \noffice by providing an optional standard home office deduction; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I rise to reintroduce legislation to \noffer a drastically simplified alternative for home-based businesses to \nbenefit from the home office tax deduction. The U.S. Small Business \nAdministration's, SBA's, Office of Advocacy designated reforming the \nhome office tax deduction as one of its top 10 regulatory review and \nreform initiatives for 2008. By establishing an optional home office \ndeduction, the Home Office Tax Deduction Simplification and Improvement \nAct of 2009 would take a strong step toward making our tax laws easier \nto understand. I would like to thank Senator Conrad for joining me to \nintroduce this critical bill here in the Senate and Representative \nGonzalez for introducing identical legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  As Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I continually hear from small enterprises across \nMaine and this nation about the necessity of tax relief and reform. \nDespite the fact that small firms are our economy's real job creators, \nthe current tax system places an entirely unreasonable burden on them \nas they struggle to satisfy their tax obligations.\n  Notably, according to the Office of Management and Budget's Office of \nInformation and Regulatory Affairs, the American public spends \napproximately nine billion hours each year to complete government-\nmandated forms and paperwork. A staggering 80 percent of this time is \nconsumed by completing tax forms. What is even more troubling is that \ncompanies that employ fewer than 20 employees spend nearly $1,304 per \nemployee in tax compliance costs, an amount that is nearly 67 percent \nmore than larger firms.\n  Turning to the legislation we are reintroducing today, the Internal \nRevenue Code currently offers qualified individuals a home office tax \ndeduction if they use a portion of their home as a principal place of \nbusiness or as a space to meet with their patients or clients. That \nsaid, although recent research from the SBA indicates that roughly 53 \npercent of America's small businesses are home-based, few of these \nfirms take advantage of the home office tax deduction. The reason is \nsimple: reporting the deduction is complicated.\n  A 2006 survey conducted by the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness Research Foundation found that approximately 33 percent of \nsmall-employer taxpayers try to comprehend the tax rules governing the \nhome office tax deduction, but only about half of those respondents \nbelieve that they actually have a good understanding of the rules. As \nDewey Martin, a Certified Public Accountant from my home State of \nMaine, so aptly said in testimony last year before the Senate Finance \nCommittee, ``Many small business owners avoid the deduction because of \nthe complications and the fear of a potential audit.''\n  With a morass of paperwork attributable to the home office deduction, \nthe time-consuming process of navigating the tangled web of rules and \nregulations makes it unsurprising that so many small business owners \nforego the home office deduction. So to encourage the use of the home \noffice tax deduction, the bill we are introducing today would establish \nan optional, easy-to-use incentive.\n  Specifically, our bill would direct the Secretary of the Treasury to \nestablish a method for determining a deduction that consists of \nmultiplying an applicable standard rate by the square footage of the \ntype of property being used as a home office. The proposal would also \nrequire the IRS to separately state the amounts allocated to several \ntypes of expenses in order to reduce the burden on the taxpayer. It is \nvital that the IRS clearly identify the amounts of the deduction \ndevoted to real estate taxes, mortgage interest, and depreciation so \nthat taxpayers do not duplicate them on Schedule A. Finally, the bill \nmakes two changes designed to ease the administration of the deduction: \nFirst, to reflect an economy in which many business owners conduct \nbusiness or consult with customers through the Internet or over the \nphone versus face-to-face, our legislation takes these entrepreneurs \ninto account by allowing the home office deduction to be taken if the \ntaxpayer uses the home to meet or deal with clients regardless of \nwhether the clients are physically present. Second, our bill would \nallow for de minimis use of business space for personal activities so \nthat taxpayers would not lose their ability to claim the deduction if \nthey make a personal call or pay a bill online.\n\n  I would be remiss not to note that the bill we are introducing today \nis the result of the dedicated efforts of various groups and \norganizations, which have worked with Senator Conrad and me on a \nconsensus approach to improve the current home office tax deduction. In \nparticular, it is significant to note that the IRS Taxpayer Advocate \nService strongly backs this bill. In fact, the National Taxpayer \nAdvocate, Nina E. Olson, sent my office the following statement \nregarding our legislation:\n\n[[Page S7074]]\n\n``In my 2007 Annual Report to Congress, I made a similar proposal to \nsimplify the home office business deduction. I am pleased that Senator \nSnowe and Conrad's proposed bill reflects the gist of my legislative \nrecommendation. Reducing the burdensome substantiation requirements for \nemployees and self-employed taxpayers who incur modest home office \ncosts would make the home office business deduction simpler and more \naccessible to them.''\n  Our bill also received an endorsement from the National Federation of \nIndependent Business. Dan Danner, the organization's Executive \nDirector, said the following: ``Currently only a small percentage of \nhome-based businesses in the U.S. take advantage of the home-office \ndeduction because calculating the deduction is unnecessarily \ncomplicated. NFIB small business owners have advocated for a simpler, \nstandard home-office deduction for years. The Snowe-Conrad legislation \ngives home-based businesses the option to deduct a legitimate business \nexpense with minimum hassle. This commonsense change to the tax code \nwill reduce tax complexity and help many home-based businesses take \nadvantage of this deduction.'' Additionally, the SBA's Office of \nAdvocacy added: ``The SBA Office of Advocacy reviewed the legislation \nand supports it.''\n  In closing, according to the SBA's Office of Advocacy, America's \nhome-based sole proprietors generate $102 billion in revenue annually. \nWith this in mind, it is absolutely critical to endow these small firms \nwith as much relief from burdensome tax constraints as possible so that \nthey can focus their efforts on developing the products and services of \nthe future, as well as creating new jobs. The confusion over the home \noffice business tax deduction, in my estimation, can be easily solved \nby passing this legislation. I urge all Senators to consider the \nbenefits this bill will provide to thousands of small business owners, \nand I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact it in a \ntimely manner.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1349\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to encourage increased production of natural gas and \nliquified petroleum gas vehicles and to provide tax incentives for \nnatural gas and liquefied petroleum gas vehicle infrastructure, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senator Inhofe to \nintroduce the Fueling America Act of 2009 which will provide incentives \nfor the production and use of natural gas and propane vehicles \nthroughout the United States.\n  In response to high gasoline and diesel fuel prices, consumers have \nbecome more interested in alternative fuel vehicles that run on natural \ngas or propane. These vehicles and aftermarket conversion kits have \nbeen available for years, but they have been used mostly in government \nand private fleets. Very few have been purchased and used by consumers. \nLarger natural gas and propone vehicles are often used for clean-\nburning transit buses and delivery trucks.\n  Natural gas and propane are clean, cost-effective alternative fuel \nchoices. Two important potential benefits of increasing the supply of \nnatural gas and propane vehicles are energy security and reduced \npollutant and greenhouse gas emissions than comparable gasoline or \ndiesel vehicles. Compared with conventional vehicles, natural gas \nvehicles produce only 5 to 10 percent of allowable emissions, which \nmeans far less greenhouse gases.\n  Thanks to new drilling technologies that are unlocking substantial \namounts of natural gas from shale rocks, the nation's estimated gas \nreserves have surged by 35 percent, according to a study released last \nweek. The report by the Potential Gas Committee, the authority on gas \nsupplies, shows the United States holds far larger reserves than \npreviously thought. Estimated natural gas reserves rose to 2,074 \ntrillion cubic feet in 2008, from 1,532 trillion cubic feet in 2006, \nwhen the last report was issued.\n  Increasing the production of natural gas and propane vehicles for \nboth individual and public transportation will provide a huge boost for \nArkansas'\n\n[[Page S7075]]\n\neconomy and job growth. Arkansas, with its abundant natural gas \nresources, has the capability to be a leader in the alternative energy \nsector and the fight to reduce our country's dependence on foreign oil. \nDeveloping the natural gas vehicle and propane industry will help \nArkansas' natural gas producers grow and thrive, boosting the State's \neconomy. In Arkansas, the Fayetteville Shale is proving to be a major \nnew find of domestic natural gas. The Center for Business and Economic \nResearch at the University of Arkansas estimates that this shale play \nwill result in about $17.9 billion in economic stimulus and 11,000 jobs \nfor the State.\n  Natural gas and propane vehicles are more fuel efficient and \nenvironmentally friendly than their gasoline counterparts, but right \nnow their high cost and lack of infrastructure, such as refueling \nstations, make them an unrealistic option for the average American. \nSince the number of natural gas refueling stations is limited only \nabout 400 to 500 publicly available nationwide, compared to roughly \n120,000 retail gasoline stations the purchaser of a new natural gas \nvehicle would likely also install a home refueling system. According to \nNGVAmerica, a typical home system costs roughly $4,500 plus \ninstallation.\n  The Fueling America Act of 2009 will establish a research, \ndevelopment and demonstration program at the Department of Energy to \nimprove cleaner, more efficient natural gas and propane vehicle \nengines, on-board storage systems, and fueling station infrastructure; \nrequire the GSA to report on whether the Federal fleet should increase \nthe number of natural gas and propane vehicles; extend the Clean School \nBus Program through 2014; extend tax credits for natural gas and \npropane refueling property; and extend and increase the consumer tax \ncredit for the purchase of natural gas, propane and bi-fuel vehicles.\n  The Fueling America Act will make it easier and more practical for \npeople to buy these clean, green vehicles. This bill will provide \nincentives for consumers and industry to purchase new natural gas and \npropane vehicles, as well as aftermarket conversion kits. At the same \ntime, America can become less dependent on foreign oil, utilize our \nample domestic natural gas resources, and create a cleaner environment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1350\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the expansion of Federal efforts \nconcerning the prevention, education, treatment, and research \nactivities related to Lyme and other tick-borne diseases, including the \nestablishment of a Tick-Borne Diseases Advisory Committee; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my fellow New \nEnglander, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, in introducing the Lyme and \nTick-Borne Disease Prevention, Education, and Research Act of 2009.\n  As families in New England look forward to outdoor fun this summer--\nand as families around the country look forward to vacationing in New \nEngland--they might not be thinking about the risks and dangers \nassociated with hiking, camping, and other outdoor activities.\n  But every year, tens of thousands of Americans working or playing \noutdoors are bitten by ticks.\n  For most, a tick bite is nothing more than a minor annoyance. But \napproximately 20,000 Americans contract Lyme disease each year, and the \nnumbers are rising. And because Lyme disease is difficult to diagnose, \nmany experts believe the true number of cases each year could be as \nmuch as 10 or 12 times the reported number. Worst of all, it is our \nchildren who are most at risk.\n  Lyme disease was first described in my home State of Connecticut, and \nwe still have the unfortunate distinction of being ten times more \nlikely to contract Lyme disease than the rest of the Nation. But the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention has received reports of new \ncases from 46 States and the District of Columbia. According to some \nestimates, Lyme disease costs our Nation more than $2 billion in \nmedical costs each year.\n  Lyme disease can affect every part of the body. Tens of thousands of \nAmericans suffer through pain, severe fatigue, sleep disturbance, and \ncognitive difficulties, among many other symptoms. Some of these \nvictims are able to lead normal lives, finding ways to cope with the \ndisease. But many more find the disease significantly disrupts their \nlives, preventing them from everyday experiences that we all take for \ngranted.\n  The legislation we offer today directs the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to establish a Tick-Borne Diseases Advisory Committee at \nHHS to coordinate efforts and improve communication between the federal \ngovernment, medical experts, physicians, and the public.\n  It will improve diagnostic efforts, establish a national \nclearinghouse for research and reporting, and require that scientific \nviewpoints on this often-frustrating disease be disseminated in a \nbalanced way.\n  It contains tools for researchers, physicians, and the public to \nimprove awareness and treatment.\n  Finally, it requires the Secretary to prepare and submit to Congress \nan annual report tracking developments related to Lyme disease, its \nspread, its treatment, and its impact on families in Connecticut and \naround the country.\n  Lyme disease is a frustrating puzzle for physicians, a burden on our \nNation's health care system, and most importantly, a threat to American \nfamilies enjoying our beautiful outdoor spaces.\n\n[[Page S7077]]\n\n  I want to specifically mention and thank the organization from my \nhome State of Connecticut that worked closely with me to develop this \nlegislation, Time for Lyme. The co-presidents and founders of Time for \nLyme, Diane Blanchard and Debbie Siciliano, are tireless advocates for \nthe patients struggling with chronic Lyme disease. This is not their \njob. They are parents whose children suffer from this disease. They \nwork to find time in their busy schedules to make a difference. This is \ntheir mission and they give me hope that we can get this done.\n  I also want to thank my good friend, Senator Collins, for her \nleadership on this issue. I want to thank Senators Reed, Lieberman, \nCardin, and Whitehouse for their support for this bill. Whether it is \nfishing on the Housatonic River or exploring Gillette Castle State Park \nnear my home in East Haddam, Connecticut families enjoy a variety of \noutdoor activities.\n  But Lyme disease remains a persistent and dangerous risk for my \nconstituents, for Senator Collins's constituents, and for those across \nthe country. With leadership from this body and better coordination \nfrom federal agencies, we can more effectively combat this disease, \nbetter protect our children and families, and make our outdoor spaces \nsafer places to work and play.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Collins and myself in support of \nthis legislation and thank them kindly for their consideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Sanders):\n  S. 1353. A bill to amend title 1 of the Omnibus Crime Control and \nSafe Streets Act of 1986 to include nonprofit and volunteer ground and \nair ambulance crew members and first responders for certain benefits; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill correct an inequality in the Department of Justice's Public Safety \nOfficers Benefits, PSOB, Program by extending benefits to non-profit \nEMS providers who die or are disabled in the line of duty. I am pleased \nto be joined in this effort by Senator Sanders.\n  Vermonters were deeply saddened earlier this week when we received \nword that veteran EMT specialist Dale Long died in a tragic, on-duty \naccident in Bennington. Dale Long had a superb 25-year career as a \nVermont EMT, and I extend our deepest condolences to his family, to the \nBennington Rescue Squad, and to the entire Vermont EMT community.\n  First responders nationwide literally put their lives at risk every \nday for the people of their communities. They represent the best of our \nnation's dedicated service to others, and Dale Long was a solid example \nof that tradition. He was Bennington Rescue Squad's 2008 EMT of the \nYear, and a 2009 recipient of the American Ambulance Association's Star \nof Life Award. I had the pleasure of meeting Dale just last month when \nhe visited my office during the Star of Life festivities.\n  This tragedy highlights a major shortcoming in the current PSOB \nprogram, which Congress established over 30 years ago to provide \nassistance to police, fire and medics who lose their lives or are \ndisabled in the line of duty. The benefit, though, only applies to \npublic safety officers employed by a federal, state, and local \ngovernment entity. With many communities around the United States \nchoosing to have their emergency medical services provided by non-\nprofit agencies, medics working for non-profit services unfortunately \nare not eligible for benefits under the PSOB program.\n  Non-profit public safety officers provide identical services to \ngovernmental officers and do so daily in the same dangerous \nenvironments. With a renewed appreciation for the important community \nservice of first responders since the national tragedy of September 11, \n2001, more people are answering the call to serve their communities. At \nthe same time, more rescue workers are falling through the cracks of \nthe PSOB program.\n  The Dale Long Emergency Medical Service Provider Protection Act would \ncorrect this inequality by extending the PSOB program to cover non-\nprofit EMS officers who provide emergency medical and ground or air \nambulance service. These emergency professionals protect and promote \nthe public good of the communities they serve, and we should not \nunfairly penalize them and their families simply because they work or \nvolunteer for a non-profit organization.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1353\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove access to health care for individuals residing in underserved \nrural areas and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, along with my friend, Senator Barrasso, I \nam introducing legislation to keep rural America from becoming a health \ncare sacrifice zone. Our legislation, the Rural Health Clinic Patient \nAccess and Improvement Act, will make it more financially attractive \nfor doctors and other providers to treat patients in rural areas. Both \nSenator Barrasso and I have heard from the folks back home about how \nhard it is to get doctors and mid-level practitioners in rural areas. \nMy constituents have had to travel hours to get treatment when they \nneed it. This bill takes major strides to ensure access to health care \nby building on the successes of the rural health clinic program. When \nit comes to health care, rural residents should not have to accept \nsecond-class status.\n  As the Senate takes up comprehensive healthcare reform, this Congress \nmust not lose focus on the health needs of folks in rural areas. Too \nmany Oregonians cannot get the kind of affordable and comprehensive \ncoverage or access to care their Members of Congress receive. In \naddition, many patients in rural Oregon, even those with good health \nbenefits, do not have access to providers or have to travel long \ndistances to get medical care.\n  Meanwhile, providers lack incentives to go to--or stay in--rural \nareas. It is a lot more lucrative for them to work in big cities where \nthey can work in state-of-the art facilities and earn top dollar. \nAccording to the Oregon State Office of Rural Health, a major obstacle \nfacing Oregon's rural health clinics is the severe shortage of health \ncare providers willing or able to work in a rural area. One out of \nthree Oregon rural health clinics was recruiting in 2008.\n  That is why Senator Barrasso and I come here to introduce the Rural \nHealth Clinic Patient Access and Improvement Act. Simply put, our bill \nwould help improve access for patients in rural areas, while increasing \nreimbursement rates and giving incentives to providers in rural areas.\n\n[[Page S7078]]\n\n  The Rural Health Clinic Patient Access and Improvement Act increases \nthe all-inclusive Medicare payment rate for rural health clinics by \nmore than 20 percent per visit from an average of $76 to $92. This bill \nwould provide an additional $2 bonus for rural health clinics that \nparticipate in a quality improvement program. Quality of care should be \na focus for all providers.\n  The bill will allow for better collaboration between community health \ncenters and rural health clinics. It also creates a 5-state \ndemonstration project to recruit and retain providers in rural \ncommunities by subsidizing a portion of the provider's medical \nliability costs if they practice in a rural health clinic. These \nreforms will help ensure rural residents have access to the same level \nof quality care as those in other parts of the country.\n  This bill builds upon the success of Oregon's 54 rural health clinics \nthat serve 26 out of 36 counties across the state. These rural health \nclinics help to ensure access to primary care for the underserved \nelderly and low-income populations. Ninety-eight percent of Oregon's \nrural health clinics are willing to see Medicare and Medicaid patients \nas well as patients with no insurance. Not only are they willing to see \nthese patients, but 96 percent are currently accepting new patients. \nMany rural residents--whether they are uninsured, publically insured or \nhave private insurance--would have nowhere to go to receive primary \ncare without rural health clinics.\n\n  When it comes to health care, people want to go to a provider they \nknow and trust. One of the reasons rural health clinics have been so \nsuccessful is that they have become an integral part of their \ncommunities. A great example of this is Gilliam County Medical Center. \nGilliam County hosted a succession of short-term physicians placed in \nthe community through the National Health Service Corps. In the 1970s, \nthe community, in conjunction with the State, sought a more permanent, \nstable health care provider situation. The Oregon legislature \nappropriated $20,000 as seed money to attract a team of health \nprofessionals to the community and the residents of Gilliam County \ncreated the South Gilliam Health District to support Gilliam County \nMedical Center, a certified rural health clinic.\n  Two physician assistants, David Jones and Dennis Bruneau who were on \nthe faculty at the University of Washington PA program at the time they \nheard about the opportunity with the clinic were hired. Dave, Dennis, \ntheir spouses, who also work at the clinic, and supervising physician \nDr. Bruce Carlson created a team that continues to sustain one of the \nmost stable and long-term small rural primary care clinics in the \nstate.\n  Dr. Carlson visits the clinic one day every 2 weeks to see those \npatients in need of his services and provide overall medical direction. \nOtherwise, the clinic is staffed full-time by physician assistants \nJones and Bruneau. David's wife is a medical technician who works in \nthe clinic and Dennis' wife serves as the clinic manager. When Dr. \nCarlson is not in Condon, he has his own medical practice 70 miles away \nin Hermiston, OR, which is also the location of the nearest hospital to \nCondon.\n  Not all rural areas are alike and the rural health clinic program \ngives these providers the flexibility they need to be the regular \nsource of care of primary care in their communities. Regular access to \nprimary care, as you know, is one of the key tests of whether or not \nyou will receive the preventive health screenings that can mean the \ndifference that could save your life. They allow for health problems to \nbe caught early on so that they can be headed off for just a little \nmoney, instead of at later stages, which require costly specialty care \nthat runs up the bill for the patient and the taxpayer.\n  Oregonians in rural areas have the same right to quality, affordable \nmedical care as those living in urban areas, but they do not have it \nunder our current system. This bill will expand access to health care \nfor folks in rural areas and level the playing field for rural health \nclinics by giving them the tools they need to attract and retain \nquality medical providers.\n  I want to thank Senator Barrasso and his staff for their hard work in \nbringing this important bipartisan legislation before the Senate.\n  I hope my colleagues will join Senator Barrasso and me, and support \nthis much needed and bipartisan bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1356. A bill to amend the National Trails System Act to provide \nfor the study of the Western States Trail; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself and Senator \nFeinstein to speak on the introduction of the Western States Trail \nStudy Act of 2009. This legislation would provide for a study by the \nDepartment of the Interior on the possible designation of the Western \nStates Trail as a National Historic Trail.\n  The National Trails System Act specifies that to qualify for listing \nas a National Historic Trail, a trail must be historically significant \nand must have significant potential for public recreational use or \nhistorical interpretation and appreciation. The Western States Trail \nabsolutely meets these criteria.\n  From the beginning of California's recorded history, the Western \nStates Trail has played an important role in the development of our \nstate and nation. Originally a Native American trail used by the Paiute \nand Washoe Indians, it later became the most direct link between the \ngold camps of California and silver mines of Nevada. Professor William \nBrewer also followed part of this trail in his 1863 expedition as part \nof State Geologist Josiah Whitney's survey of California.\n  In 1955, the Western States Trail became the site of the world's \nfirst and leading 100-mile trail ride, and in 1974 became the world's \nfirst and leading ultramarathon run. These recreational events are of \ntremendous importance to the local community as well as equestrians and \nrunners throughout the nation. Western States volunteers dedicate \nhundreds of hours each year to the U.S. Forest Service and California \nDepartment of Parks and Recreation to maintain the trail, exemplifying \ncitizen action at its best.\n  Most of the trail remains in the same state as in the 19th century, \npassing through scenic wilderness ranging from the Sierra Crest, to \nmagnificent forests and mountain streams, to the grasses and oaks of \nthe Sierra foothills.\n  The citizen-government partnership that our bill represents continues \nthe tradition of the Western States Run to protect and preserve the \nWestern States Trail, and to ensure that the public has access to its \nrich history and scenery.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 1357. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax incentive to individuals teaching in elementary and secondary \nschools located in rural or high unemployment areas and to individuals \nwho achieve certification from the National Board for Professional \nTeaching Standards, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I believe that perhaps the most \neffective way to improve the education of our children is to invest in \ntheir teachers, and make certain that quality teachers have the \nincentive to stay in the classroom.\n  Unfortunately, without new investments, our disadvantaged and rural \nschools may not be able to attract the qualified teachers needed to \nprepare our children for the 21st Century workplace. Isolated and \nimpoverished, too many West Virginia schools must compete against \nhigher paying, well-funded schools for scarce classroom talent. As a \nresult, they face a shortage of qualified teachers, particularly in \nmath, science and foreign languages.\n  Today, I am introducing a bill designed to invest in bringing \ndedicated and qualified teaching professionals to West Virginia and \nAmerica's disadvantaged and rural schools. This bill will help give \nstudents the opportunity to learn and flourish, an opportunity that \nevery child deserves. The Incentives To Educate American Children Act--\nor I Teach Act--will provide teachers with a refundable tax credit \nevery year they teach in the public schools with the most need. And it \nwill give every public school teacher--regardless of the school they \nchoose--a refundable tax credit for earning their certification by the \nNational Board for Professional\n\n[[Page S7079]]\n\nTeaching Standards. Together, these two tax credits will give \neconomically depressed areas a better ability to recruit and retain \nskilled teachers.\n  There are over 16,000 rural school districts in the U.S., and these \nschools face real challenges in recruiting and retaining teachers, as \nwell as dealing with other issues related to their rural location. \nDisadvantaged urban schools must overcome similar difficulties. My I \nTeach Act will reward teachers willing to work in rural or \ndisadvantaged schools with an annual $1,000 refundable tax credit. \nAdditionally, teachers that obtain certification by the National Board \nfor Professional Teaching Standards will receive an annual $1,000 \nrefundable tax credit. Therefore, teachers who work in rural or \ndisadvantaged schools and get certified will earn a $2000 credit. \nSchools that desperately need help attracting teachers will get a \nboost, and children educated in disadvantaged and rural schools will \nbenefit most.\n  In my state of West Virginia, as in over 30 other states, there is \nalready a state fiscal incentive for teachers who earn National Board \ncertification. My legislation builds upon the West Virginia program. \nTogether, they will create a powerful tax incentive for teachers to \nremain in the classroom and to use their skills where they are most \nneeded.\n  Education is among our top national priorities. It is essential for \nall children and it is vital for our economic and national security. \nTeachers are a critical component of quality education, and they \ndeserve the incentives to stay in the classroom.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 1361. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to enhance the \nnational defense through empowerment of the National Guard, enhancement \nof the functions of the National Guard Bureau, and improvement of \nFederal-State military coordination in domestic emergency response, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with Senator \nBond in introducing the National Guard Empowerment and State-National \nDefense Integration Act of 2009. This is a clearly needed piece of \nlegislation that will enable the Nation to tap more of the tremendous \nexperience and expertise that exists within the National Guard.\n  This legislation--known as Empowerment II--ensures that the \nDepartment of Defense takes advantage of the Guard's unique strengths \nand focuses on the critical mission of domestic operations and military \nsupport to civilian authorities. This bill is about focusing attention \non the military's response to emergencies at home and fleshing out the \nstructure of that response. Doing that will ensure our National Guard, \nReserves and active forces can bring their specialized capabilities to \nbear, all while safely under the control of democratically elected \nofficials and civilian authorities.\n  The bill will specifically make the Chief of the National Guard a \nfull member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, while creating a new three-\nstar deputy to the Bureau Chief to reflect the Bureau Chief's increased \nresponsibilities. Additionally, the 2009 Empowerment Act provides the \nNational Guard Bureau with limited budget authority to be able to \nacquire specially designed equipment for domestic operations, and it \nrequires the Department of Defense to establish procedures to formalize \narrangements to allow National Guard forces to have tactical control \nover active forces that operate in a domestic setting.\n  Today Senator Bond and I seek to build on some of the major \nimprovements to the Guard that we, together, made in the Fiscal Year \n2008 Defense Authorization Bill. That landmark bill enacted large \nportions of the first version of the Guard Empowerment Bill which \nelevated the Chief of the National Guard from three-star general to \nfull General. The goal of all the changes enacted was to begin to \nensure that the Guard has a seat at the table in major budget and \npolicy decisions.\n  We need to pick up where we left off early last year and sharpen the \nfocus on the National Guard's role as a homeland defense and defense \nsupport to civilian authorities force. In fact, we are trying, in the \nrealm of domestic operations and military support to civilian \nauthorities, to do exactly what Secretary of Defense Robert Gates is \ntrying to do in the realm of irregular warfare. The Secretary is \nworking to ensure that at least a good portion of the Department of \nDefense's equipment has utility in counterinsurgency situations. The \nSecretary has recently testified that he foresees about 10 percent of \nprocured equipment to be dedicated solely for counterinsurgencies. I \nstrongly support the Secretary's initiative.\n  There also is a need to carve out a small wedge of the defense budget \nto develop technologies and systems that will help the National Guard, \nserving in a Title 32 capacity under the control of the Governors. Much \nof all Guard equipment is considered and should be ``dual use,'' but a \nsliver should be specially designed and used solely for domestic \nsituations.\n  The Guard Empowerment bill we are introducing today will also reduce \nthe confusion that sometimes exists when there is a domestic emergency \nabout how National Guard forces, serving under a Governor during an \nemergency, will interact with active duty forces that serve under the \nPresident's command. United States Northern Command in Colorado has \nunfortunately only exacerbated those concerns through attempts to \noverride Governors and take command-and-control of National Guard \nassets in a State even though they are in their so-called Title 32 \nstatus.\n  There is nothing in this bill that the National Guard is not already \nundertaking. The President and the Secretary of Defense look to the \nGuard Bureau Chief on matters related to defense at home. The Guard \nworks to purchase homeland defense-oriented equipment through the so-\ncalled Guard and Reserve Equipment Account, and the Governors already \nwield active duty personnel during so-called National Security Events. \nThe chain of command arrangements made during last year's political \nconventions in Minnesota and Colorado are a good example.\n  The President recognizes that this legislation makes sense. In his \n``Blueprint for Change,'' his new Administration's national security \nplan, President Obama endorsed the idea of making the Guard Bureau \nChief a full member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a move that Vice \nPresident Biden also has endorsed. In developing the bill, we worked \nclosely with The National Guard Association of the United States, the \nAdjutants General Association of the United States and the Enlisted \nNational Guard Association of the United States--organizations that we \nexpect to formally endorse the bill after its introduction.\n  Everyone recognizes that if there is an emergency like Katrina and \nour civilian resources at all levels get overwhelmed, the military is \ngoing to have to come in to assist. The American people expect no less \nthan a swift, coordinated and effective response. And it is the \nNational Guard that knows how to do this mission right. Providing \nsupport to civilian authorities at the State level is what the Guard \nhas done since its inception more than two centuries ago, and it is a \nmission that the National Guard continues to take seriously.\n  This legislation solidifies and codifies sensible approaches to \nimproving the Guard's ability to support civil authorities in an \nemergency. Enactment of this legislation is the very least we owe our \nproud citizen soldiers and airmen for their efforts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1361\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide grants to States to ensure that all \nstudents in the middle grades are taught an academically rigorous \ncurriculum with effective supports so that students complete the middle \ngrades prepared for success in high school and postsecondary endeavors, \nto improve State and district policies and programs relating to the \nacademic achievement of students in the middle grades, to develop and \nimplement effective middle grades models for struggling students, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Success in the \nMiddle Act, which will help provide new support for raising student \nachievement in the middle grades. I thank Senators Klobuchar, Stabenow, \nWhitehouse, and Lautenberg for joining me as original cosponsors.\n  We know that the middle grades are an important and unique transition \nperiod for young people, and a critical\n\n[[Page S7082]]\n\ntime in a student's educational and social development. The middle \ngrades are the key to ensuring students remain on track to college and \ncareer-readiness. International comparisons indicate that students in \nthe United States do not start out behind other nations in math and \nscience, but they fall significantly behind in these subjects by the \nend of the middle grades. According to the 2007 National Assessment on \nEducational Progress, only one-third of eighth grade students in the \nUnited States can read at proficiency or above. For math proficiency, \nthis number falls to 31 percent of all American eighth grade students.\n  There has been significant focus during K-12 reform discussions \nregarding high school reform, and while there is no doubt that this is \nan essential component of improving our education system, addressing \ndropout prevention must begin earlier. It must begin at the middle \nschools that feed into the thousands of ``dropout factories'' across \nthe country. Dropout factories are high schools in which fewer than 60 \npercent of students graduate. As one of the leading experts in the area \nof middle and high school reform, Robert Balfanz, has stated, middle \nschools are the ``first line of defense'' in identifying at-risk \nstudents and then effectively intervening to prevent them from dropping \nout. Balfanz's research has shown that sixth-graders who failed math or \nEnglish, attended school less than 80 percent of the time, or received \nan unsatisfactory behavior grade in a core course had only a 10 to 20 \npercent chance of graduating on time. Without successful intervention, \nthese behaviors lead students to course failure, non-promotion, and \neventually dropping out.\n  That is why I am reintroducing the Success in the Middle Act. This \nbill will help strengthen that first line of defense by authorizing \ngrants to states and school districts to improve and turnaround low-\nperforming middle schools. It would concentrate new resources on the \nmiddle grades by requiring districts to develop an early warning \nindicator system for indentifying students at risk of dropping out, and \ntailoring research-based interventions to get these students back on \ntrack to graduating college and career-ready. These interventions would \ninclude high-quality professional development for teachers; personal \nacademic plans such as the Individual Learning Plans required in Rhode \nIsland; mentoring and counseling; and extended learning time.\n  When he was in the Senate, President Obama was the lead sponsor of \nthis legislation. I am pleased that the President has continued to \nrecognize the need for increased investment in middle and high school \nreform, including earlier this year, his action to encourage states and \nschool districts to spend a significant portion of their American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act education funds on improving student \nachievement in the middle and high school grades.\n  I was pleased to work with the Rhode Island Middle Level Educators, \nRhode Island Association of School Principals, ACT, Alliance for \nExcellent Education, The College Board, International Reading \nAssociation, National Association of Secondary School Principals, \nNational Council of Teachers of English, National Forum to Accelerate \nMiddle Grades Reform, and National Middle Schools Association, and a \nhost of other education organizations on this bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to cosponsor the Success in the Middle Act.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S7082, June 25, 2009, the Record reads: . . . and a host \nof other education organizations on this bill.\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . and a host \nof other education organizations on this bill.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Success in the Middle Act of \n     2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) International comparisons indicate that students in the \n     United States do not start out behind students of other \n     nations in mathematics and science, but that they fall behind \n     by the end of the middle grades.\n       (2) Only \\1/3\\ of eighth grade students in the United \n     States, and only 4 percent of such students who are English \n     language learners, can read with proficiency, according to \n     the 2007 National Assessment on Educational Progress (NAEP). \n     The percentage of eighth grade students proficient at reading \n     has not increased since 1998, and the NAEP average reading \n     score for eighth grade students has remained static. In \n     contrast, NAEP reading scores and achievement levels for \n     fourth grade students have increased significantly.\n       (3) In mathematics, less than \\1/3\\ of students in eighth \n     grade show skills at the NAEP proficient level, and nearly 30 \n     percent score below the basic level. The percentage of eighth \n     grade students scoring above the basic level was 8 points \n     higher in 2007 than in 2000, but for fourth grade students, \n     the percentage increased 17 points, more than double the \n     increase for middle grades students. In eighth grade, the \n     gaps between the average mathematics scores of white and \n     black students and between white and Hispanic students were \n     as wide in 2007 as in 1990.\n       (4) Fewer than 2 in 10 of the students who graduated from \n     high school in 2005 or 2006 met, as eighth graders, all 4 of \n     ACT's EXPLORE College Readiness Benchmarks, the minimum level \n     of achievement that ACT has shown is necessary if students \n     are to be college- and career-ready upon their high school \n     graduation.\n       (5) Lack of basic skills at the end of middle grades has \n     serious implications for students. Students who enter high \n     school 2 or more years behind grade level in mathematics and \n     literacy have only a 50 percent chance of progressing on time \n     to the tenth grade; those not progressing are at significant \n     risk of dropping out of high school.\n       (6) Middle grades students are hopeful about their future, \n     with 93 percent believing that they will complete high school \n     and 92 percent anticipating that they will attend college.\n       (7) Sixth grade students who do not attend school \n     regularly, who are subjected to frequent disciplinary \n     actions, or who fail mathematics or English have less than a \n     15 percent chance of graduating high school on time and a 20 \n     percent chance of graduating 1 year late. Without effective \n     interventions and proper supports, these students are at risk \n     of subsequent failure in high school, or of dropping out.\n       (8) Student transitions from elementary school to the \n     middle grades and to high school are often complicated by \n     poor curriculum alignment, inadequate counseling services, \n     and unsatisfactory sharing of student performance and \n     academic achievement data between grades.\n       (9) According to ACT, the level of academic achievement \n     that students attain by eighth grade has a larger impact on \n     the students' college and career readiness upon graduation \n     from high school than anything that happens academically in \n     high school.\n       (10) Middle schools are almost twice as likely as \n     elementary schools to be identified for improvement, \n     corrective action, or restructuring (22 percent as compared \n     to 13 percent) under section 1116 of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 63116).\n       (11) Middle grades improvement strategies should be \n     tailored based on a variety of performance indicators and \n     data, so that educators can create and implement successful \n     school improvement strategies to address the needs of the \n     middle grades, and so that teachers can provide effective \n     instruction and adequate assistance to meet the needs of at-\n     risk students.\n       (12) To stem a dropout rate nearly twice that of students \n     without disabilities, students with disabilities in the \n     critical middle grades must receive appropriate academic \n     accommodations and access to assistive technology, high-risk \n     behaviors such as absenteeism and course failure must be \n     monitored, and problem-solving skills with broad application \n     must be taught.\n       (13) Local educational agencies and State educational \n     agencies often do not have the capacity to provide support \n     for school improvement strategies. Successful models do exist \n     for turning around low-performing middle grades, and Federal \n     support should be provided to increase the capacity to apply \n     promising practices based on evidence from successful \n     schools.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate \nsegments of the Molalla River in the State of Oregon, as components of \nthe National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to amend the \nWild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate segments of the Molalla River \nas Wild and Scenic. I am pleased to be introducing this legislation \nwith my colleague from Oregon, Senator Merkley. This legislation has \nalready been introduced by Representative Schrader in the House, who is \na champion for protecting the river. The Molalla River Wild and Scenic \nRivers Act of 2009 will designate an approximately 15.1-mile segment of \nthe Molalla River, and an approximately 6.2-mile segment of Table Rock \nFork Molalla River as a recreational river under the Wild and Scenic \nRivers Act.\n  The Molalla River Wild and Scenic Rivers Act protects a popular \nOregon destination that provides abundant recreational activities all \nof which take place among the abundant wildlife that call this area \nhome. The scenic beauty of the Molalla River provides a backdrop for \nhiking, mountain biking, camping, and horseback riding, while the \nwaters of the river are a popular destination for fishing, kayaking, \nand whitewater rafting enthusiasts. My bill would not only preserve \nthis area as a recreation destination, but would also protect the river \nhabitat of the Chinook salmon and Steelhead trout,\n\n[[Page S7087]]\n\nalong with the wildlife habitat surrounding the river, home to the \nnorthern spotted owl, the pileated woodpecker, golden and bald eagles, \ndeer, elk, the pacific giant salamander, and many others.\n  The Molalla River is not only an important habitat for wildlife and a \npopular northwest recreation destination, but it is also the source of \nclean drinking water for the towns of Molalla and Canby, Oregon. \nProtecting the approximately 21.3 miles of the Molalla River will \nprovide the residents of these Oregon towns with the assurance that \nthey will continue to receive clean drinking water, and will provide \nall the people of the Pacific Northwest and beyond the knowledge that \nthis important natural resource will be preserved for continued \nenjoyment for years to come.\n  I want to express my thanks to the Molalla River Alliance--a \ncoalition of more than 45 organizations that recognize that this river \nis a jewel. Michael Moody, the President of this Alliance, made sure \nthat irrigators, city councilors, the mayor, businesses and \nenvironmentalists all came together on this. I look forward to working \nwith Senator Merkley, Representative Schrader, and the bill's \nsupporters to advance this legislation to the President's desk.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1369\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor clean renewable water supply bonds; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, with \nmy colleagues Senators Ensign and Martinez, the Clean Renewable Water \nSupply Bond Act of 2009.\n  While many of us do not think twice when we turn on the faucet, State \nand local authorities anticipate widespread water shortages in the near \nfuture, and the consequences may be severe, if not catastrophic. Rising \ndemand and dwindling sources of fresh water raise serious questions \nabout our ability to ensure every community has access to a clean, \nsafe, and affordable water supply. The U.S. population has grown more \nthan 50 percent in the last 30 years. At the same time, the amount of \nwater used by each of us has tripled. In many States, particularly \nfast-growing States, water consumption nears or exceeds the renewable \nwater supply.\n  Several parts of the country have experienced drought or near-drought \nconditions requiring authorities to impose water user strictions. \nAccording to a comprehensive Government Accountability Office study, \neven under normal conditions, 36 States expect water shortages by 2013. \nCompounding the problem, the Environmental Protection Agency estimates \na shortfall of $224 billion in funding for water projects over the next \n20 years.\n  Water shortages also have implications for the environment. The \nEverglades is a prime example. Over the years, diminished flows into \nthe Everglades have reduced the ecosystem to half its original size. As \na result of less water, the Everglades experienced a 90 percent \nreduction in the population of wading birds. The effects of climate \nchange--including salt water intrusion and higher sea levels--mean our \nrecent experiences will only intensify over the next couple decades.\n  There is a growing consensus on the need for new investments in water \nsupply and treatment projects. Advanced technologies offer \nextraordinary promise and can provide new sources of clean water, but \nthe cost of the initial capital investment is often prohibitive. States \nare primarily responsible for managing the development, allocation, and \nuse of freshwater supplies. A single advanced water project can cost as \nmuch as $400 million, an amount difficult to finance with conventional \ntax-exempt bonds, which require principal and interest payments by the \nissuer.\n  The bipartisan legislation we are introducing today would authorize \npublic water agencies at the State and local level to issue tax credit \nbonds as a financing vehicle for innovative new water supply \ntechnologies. The legislation would create a new category of Clean \nRenewable Water Supply Bonds, to finance innovative projects such as \nwater recycling, desalination, and groundwater contamination clean-up. \nTax credit bonds such as CREWS provide a deeper and more efficient \nsubsidy than tax-exempt bonds. The Federal Government provides a tax \ncredit to the bondholder in lieu of an interest payment. As a result, a \npublic agency financing a $100 million project with CREWS would save an \nestimated $62 million in interest payments over the life of the bond. \nThe issuer remains responsible for repayment of the principal. The \nbonds would be issued by public agencies in the same way that they \nissue conventional tax-exempt bonds.\n  A project would not be eligible for CREWS unless the issuer has \nreceived all Federal and State regulatory approvals necessary to \nconstruct the project. Qualifying projects must be designed to comply \nwith regulations that minimize negative environmental impacts. In order \nto limit the revenue loss to $1 billion over ten years, the bill caps \nthe amount of annual CREWS bonding authority.\n  Tax credit bonds are a proven and effective financing mechanism. \nCongress has authorized the issuance of tax credit bonds for the \nconstruction of inner city schools, renewable energy projects, energy \nconservation measures, forestry conservation programs, and post-Katrina \nand Rita reconstruction. According to an analysis prepared for the New \nWater Supply Coalition, an investment of $6.2 billion in construction \nfor desalination, recycling and groundwater recovery would generate a \nnational economic impact of $19.5 billion and approximately 143,000 \njobs. Most importantly, if enacted and fully funded, the Coalition \nprojects that over 1.8 billion gallons of water per day would be \ncreated by the new investment resulting from the Clean Renewable Water \nSupply Bond Act--enough new water to meet the needs of over four \nmillion families of four.\n  Addressing the challenges of our growing water needs will require a \nconcerted effort that involves all levels of government--Federal, \nState, and local. The Clean Renewable Water Supply Bond Act would \ncreate an effective tool for the shared Federal-State financing of \nadvanced, innovative clean water supply projects. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support the legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S7088]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1371\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for Federal agencies to develop public \naccess policies relating to research conducted by employees of that \nagency; or from funds administered by that agency to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Federal Research \nPublic Access Act. I am very pleased to be joined again by my good \nfriend and colleague, Senator Joe Lieberman, who has remained dedicated \nto seeing this important legislation passed. This bipartisan bill is \nthe same legislation we introduced in the 109th Congress. The purpose \nof this legislation is to ensure American taxpayers' dollars are spent \nwisely, which is even more important now in this time of fiscal \ntension.\n  To put things in perspective, the Federal Government spends upwards \nof $55 billion on investments for basic and applied research every \nyear. There are approximately 11 departments/agencies that are the \nrecipients of these investments, including: the National Institutes of \nHealth, National Science Foundation, NASA, the Department of Energy, \nthe Department of Defense, and the Department of Agriculture. These \ndepartments/agencies then distribute the taxpayers' money to fund \nresearch which is typically conducted by outside researchers working \nfor universities, health care systems, and other groups.\n  While this research is undoubtedly necessary and is beneficial to \nAmerica, it remains the case that not all Americans are capable of \nexperiencing these benefits firsthand. Usually the results of the \nresearchers are published in academic journals. Despite the fact that \nthe research was paid for by Americans' tax dollars, most citizens are \nunable to attain timely access to the wealth of information that the \nresearch provides.\n  Some Federal agencies, most notably the NIH, have recognized this \nlack of availability and have proceeded to take positive steps in the \nright direction by requiring that those articles based on government-\nfunded research be easily accessible to the public in a timely manner. \nI am proud to report that the NIH's public access policy has been a \nsuccess over the past few years. By the NIH implementing a \ngroundbreaking public access policy, there has been strong progress in \nmaking the NIH's federally funded research available to the public, and \nhas helped to energize this debate.\n  Although this has surely been an encouraging and important step \nforward, Senator Lieberman and I believe there is more that can and \nmust be done, as this is just a small part of the research funded by \nthe Federal Government.\n  With that in mind, Senator Lieberman and I find it necessary to \nreintroduce the Federal Research Public Access Act that will build on \nand refine the work done by the NIH and require that the Federal \nGovernment's leading underwriters of research adopt meaningful public \naccess policies. Our legislation provides a simple and practical \nsolution to giving the public access to the research it funds.\n  Our bill will ask all Federal departments and agencies that invest \n$100 million or more annually in research to develop a public access \npolicy. Our goal is to have the results of all government-funded \nresearch to be disseminated and made available to the largest possible \naudience. By speeding access to this research, we can help promote the \nadvancement of science, accelerate the pace of new discoveries and \ninnovations, and improve the lives and welfare of people at home and \nabroad.\n  Each policy that these departments and agencies develop will require \nthat articles resulting from federal funding must be presented in some \npublicly accessible archive within six months of publication. In doing \nso, the American taxpayers will have guaranteed access to the latest \nresearch, ensuring that they do not have to pay for the same research \ntwice--first to conduct it and then again to view the results.\n  This simple legislation will provide our government with an \nopportunity to better leverage our investment in research and in turn \nensure a greater return on that investment. All Americans stand to \nbenefit from this bill, including patients diagnosed with a disease who \nwill have the ability to use the Internet to read the latest articles \nin their entirety concerning their prognosis, students who will be able \nto find full abundant research as they further their education, or \nresearchers who will have their findings more broadly evaluated which \nwill lead to further discovery and innovation.\n  While a comprehensive competitiveness agenda is still a work-in-\nprogress, this legislation is good step forward. Providing public \naccess to cutting-edge scientific information is one way we can \nencourage public interest in these fields and help accelerate the pace \nof discovery and innovation. In promoting this legislation, I hope to \nguarantee that students, researchers, and every American can access the \npublished results of the research they funded.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 1377. A bill provide for an automatic increase in the federal \nmatching rate for the Medicaid program during periods of national \neconomic downturn to help States cope with increases in Medicaid costs; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will guarantee that Medicaid remains available as a critical \nsafety-net for working families in the event of another economic \ndownturn. Medicaid is consistently the first program slated for cuts \nduring a State budget crisis. My legislation would establish an \nautomatic trigger for a temporary FMAP increase so that state Medicaid \nassistance becomes available in a timely and targeted manner during \nsignificant economic challenges.\n  State cutbacks during the 2001-2003 recession eliminated public \nhealth coverage for more than one million Americans. According to the \nKaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, between fiscal years \n2002 and 2005, the loss of revenue led all 50 States to reduce Medicaid \nprovider payment rates and implement prescription drug cost controls, \n38 States to reduce Medicaid eligibility and 34 States to reduce \nbenefits. Many more Americans would have lost coverage if Congress had \nnot provided states with $20 billion in Federal aid in 2003.\n  Now, once again, the country is facing economic challenges unlike \nanything else we have faced since the Great Depression. Fortunately, \nthe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, ARRA, included $87 billion \nin Federal Medicaid relief for States. It is estimated that through \nthis temporary FMAP increase, my State of West Virginia will receive \nnearly $450 million in\n\n[[Page S7090]]\n\nFederal funding over the next 2 years to help meet the existing and \ngrowing enrollment needs in Medicaid. This temporary FMAP increase will \nprotect the health care coverage of nearly 400,000 West Virginians, and \napproximately 58 million Americans, as this country works to pull \nitself out of the current economic recession.\n  After the last economic downturn, I joined a bipartisan group of my \ncolleagues in requesting that the Government Accountability Office, \nGAO, study and report on options to protect Medicaid during future \nrecessions. In response to this request, the GAO issued a report GAO-\n07-97, entitled Medicaid: Strategies to Help States Address Increased \nExpenditures during Economic Downturn and developed a State and local \ngovernment model that can simulate the fiscal outcomes for this sector \nin the aggregate for several decades into the future.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is based on the findings of \nthis GAO study. As we have seen in the past two recessions, waiting for \nCongress to act to provide necessary Federal Medicaid relief results in \nharmful delays in families getting the assistance they need. I believe \nthat there should be an automatic economic trigger for State fiscal \nrelief--independent of Congressional intervention--during future \nrecessions. My legislation would create such a trigger for a temporary \nFMAP increase.\n  State fiscal relief would become available when the average \nunemployment rate has increased by at least 10 percent in at least 23 \nStates. This type of automatic trigger would provide states with the \ntimely, targeted, and temporary Federal Medicaid assistance that they \nneed in the face of a significant economic downturn. More importantly, \nit would help Americans maintain access to health care in tough times.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1377\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nadditional tax relief for small businesses, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, President Obama, in his press briefing \nthis past Tuesday, June 23, 2009, made the following statement \nregarding his assessment of the first four months of the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act: ``I am not satisfied with the progress \nthat we've made.'' I could not agree more with President Obama's \nassessment. Thus far, the $787 billion American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act has fallen short on virtually every one of its \nadvertised effects.\n  In the abbreviated debate leading up to the consideration of this \nbill, we constantly heard the mantra from my friends on the other side: \nJOBS, JOBS, JOBS! This stimulus bill was supposed to create jobs, jobs, \njobs, but in the four months since the bill's passage, there are still \nno jobs in sight.\n  The architects of this bill made several bold claims in projecting \nthe job effects of the $787 billion stimulus bill. First, they said \nthat its passage would keep the unemployment rate from exceeding 8 \npercent. Second, they said it was going to create or save 3 to 4 \nmillion jobs. And third, they said that 90 percent of the new jobs \ncreated would be in the private sector.\n  So far, in all three of these areas, the actual effects of the \nstimulus bill have not lived up to the hype. Let us examine each of \nthese areas one by one.\n  First, the stimulus bill was supposed to keep unemployment at or \nbelow 8 percent. In fact, the administration projected that in the \nabsence of stimulus, the unemployment rate would peak at around 8.8 \npercent. However, four months into this program, the unemployment rate \nstands at 9.4 percent and rising--higher than the administration \nprojected it would be in the absence of stimulus.\n  Just listen to President Obama's comments from his June 23rd press \nbriefing to see which direction the unemployment rate is headed: ``I \nthink it's pretty clear now that unemployment will end up going over 10 \npercent, if you just look at the pattern, because of the fact that even \nafter employers and businesses start investing again and start hiring \nagain, typically it takes a while for that employment number to catch \nup with economic recovery. And we're still not at actual recovery yet. \nSo I anticipate that this is going to be a difficult, difficult year, a \ndifficult period.''\n  When asked how high he thought the unemployment rate would go, \nPresident Obama responded, ``I am not suggesting that I have a crystal \nball. Since you just threw back at us our last prognosis, let's not \nengage in another one.'' Once again, I have to agree with President \nObama's assessment.\n  As the unemployment rate continues to go up, that means job numbers \ncontinue to go down, which brings me to my next point: The \nadministration projected that the stimulus bill would create--or save--\nbetween 3 and 4 million jobs by the end of 2010. While we've got a long \nway to go before the end of 2010, the prospects of the stimulus bill \nliving up to this job creation estimate seem very unlikely. Before we \nlook at the actual job numbers for the past few months from the \nDepartment of Labor, let me discuss the source of the administration's \nprojections.\n  In January, Christina Romer, who is now Chair of the Council of \nEconomic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, who is now the Chief Economist \nfor the Vice President, released a 14-page paper titled ``The Job \nImpact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.''\n  In this document, Romer and Bernstein repeatedly asserted that a \npackage of the size discussed by the President-Elect would be expected \nto create between three and four million jobs by the end of 2010, which \nwould more than meet the President-Elect's goal of creating or saving 3 \nmillion jobs by the end of 2010. In a follow-up report in May, the \nCouncil of Economic Advisers attempted to explain how the \nadministration planned on measuring the number of jobs created or saved \nby the stimulus. This document articulated that all recipients of \nstimulus funds for government investment will be required to provide \n``recipient reports'' estimating the number of jobs retained or created \ndirectly by the funds.\n  Then, to arrive at the total estimate of jobs created or saved by the \nstimulus, the job numbers from the recipient reports will be added to \nthe administration's estimate of jobs created or saved through tax \ncuts, State fiscal relief and transfer payments. These estimates will \nbe derived from administration-produced multipliers and macro-economic \nmodeling.\n  Sounds pretty simple, don't you think? Unfortunately, there are some \nproblems.\n\n[[Page S7092]]\n\n  The first problem is that the most accurate part of these job \nestimates will be from the recipient reports, and since the stimulus \nbill included approximately $271 billion in government investment \nspending, these reporting requirements cover just over a third of the \n$787 billion of stimulus funding.\n  While the job estimates from these recipient reports should be an \naccurate representation of actual jobs created by the stimulus, the \nadministration even admits that ``there will likely be inconsistencies \nand measurement error across the individual reports.''\n  This leads us to the second problem: for the other \\2/3\\ of the bill, \nin the administration's own words, ``There is no mechanism available \nfor collecting data on actual job creation from these parts of the \nAct.'' So, for \\2/3\\ of the bill, the job estimates are basically going \nto be guesswork from the administration based on mathematical formulas.\n  Since President Obama's ``First 100 Days'' address on April 29, 2009, \nwe have heard plenty about the 150,000 jobs that have been created or \nsaved so far by the stimulus.\n  As I have pointed out, it is impossible to verify these numbers with \nany degree of certainty, and the administration can not even give an \nestimate of how many of the 150,000 jobs were created and how many were \nsaved.\n  What we can verify are the actual job numbers produced on a monthly \nbasis by the Department of Labor. According to the Department of Labor, \nin the 3 full months March, April, and May, following the enactment of \nthe stimulus bill, the U.S. economy has lost over 1.5 million jobs. In \nthe first 5 months of 2009, the U.S. economy has lost 2.9 million jobs. \nThese are the painful numbers that really matter.\n  As Jared Bernstein, Chief Economist for the Vice President, said on \nJune 8, 2009, ``Most importantly from the perspective of American \nfamilies, the nation's employers are still shedding jobs on net.''\n  So, the advertised effect of the stimulus on unemployment was clearly \nwrong, and the job claims resulting from the stimulus are unverifiable. \nNow, how about the claim suggesting that 90 percent of the jobs created \nby the stimulus will be in the private sector?\n  To be clear, this claim was first made in Romer and Bernstein's \nJanuary report, and the President himself has repeated this \nassertion. Unfortunately, this projection--like the first two--is \nmissing the mark by a long shot.\n\n  Let's look at the actual data from the Department of Labor once \nagain. In the first three months since the stimulus bill has been the \nlaw of the land, the private sector has lost nearly 1.6 million jobs. \nIn those same 3 months, government payrolls have actually expanded by \n81,000 jobs. Similarly, in the first 5 months of 2009, while the \nprivate sector has lost over 3 million jobs, the government has gained \n96,000 jobs.\n  While I am encouraged to see at least one sector of the economy \nexperiencing job gains, I don't expect that the administration's \nprojection of 90 percent of stimulus jobs being in the private sector \nwill be realized. The administration has promised that 600,000 \nadditional public sector jobs will be created or saved this summer. \nWhile an increase of 600,000 government jobs would certainly be a \npositive development if it comes to pass, it does raise concerns as to \nwhether the government will be the only winner from the stimulus bill.\n  My point today, Mr. President, is not to berate the administration or \nthose who voted for this bill.\n  My point is, first, to note the conspicuous absence of job gains in \nour economy following the stimulus, and second, to bring our focus back \nto the source of 70 percent of net new jobs over the past decade--the \nengine that drives the U.S. economy. Of course, I am talking about \nAmerica's small businesses.\n  America's small businesses have been suffering during this recession. \nIf you go back to your States frequently, like I do, you'll hear about \nit directly. A few months ago, Senators Landrieu and Snowe held a \nhearing on the credit crunch hitting small business. They found that \nbig banks have been cracking down on lending to small businesses.\n  Another very good source of answers about the environment of small \nbusiness is found in the monthly survey of small business. This survey \nis published by the National Federation of Independent Business \n``NFIB''.\n  NFIB is the largest small business organization. NFIB has been \nconducting these surveys for 35 years.\n  NFIB's membership includes hundreds of thousands of small businesses \nall across America. You can find the survey on NFIB's website at http:/\n/www.nfib.com/Portals/0/PDF/sbet/sbet200906.pdf. I would encourage \nevery member to check out the June 2009 survey.\n  The survey shows some extremely disturbing trends. On credit \navailability, small businesses are getting squeezed very hard. The \navailability of loans has fallen off a cliff since late 2007 and is at \nits lowest point since the recession period of 1980 to 1982.\n  This credit crunch and other factors have contributed to NFIB's index \nof small business optimism falling well below average. According to the \nsurvey, small business owners have become extremely pessimistic in the \nlast couple of years. What you see here is the attitude of the decision \nmakers in small business America.\n  Those are the decision makers for businesses that President Obama and \nCongress agree are the businesses most likely to grow or contract jobs. \nThis data should concern every policy maker in this town.\n  While those two sets of data are bad, it doesn't get any better when \nyou look at small business hiring plans. Another question on the survey \nasks the small business owner whether he or she plans to expand or \ncontract employment over the next three months. The survey results show \nsmall business activity contracting tremendously, and the overall small \nbusiness employment numbers tell the same story.\n  I must say that the President's recent efforts to increase lending to \nthe small business sector are commendable. The center piece of his \nsmall business plan will allow the federal government to spend up to \n$25 billion to purchase the small-business loans that are now hindering \ncommunity banks and lenders. Unfortunately, that is a drop in a very \nempty bucket.\n  Remember, colleagues, that small business accounts for about half of \nthe private sector.\n  Moreover, the positives that will come to small businesses from this \nrelatively small package of loans--which will ultimately have to be \npaid back--will be heavily outweighed by the negative impact of the \nPresident's proposed tax increases. Helping small businesses get loans \njust to take that money back in the form of tax hikes is not wise.\n  I now want to turn to those aforementioned tax hikes on small \nbusinesses that President Obama and my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle have proposed. I certainly understand that small business is \nvital to the health of our economy. The President and I agree that 70 \npercent of new private sector jobs are created by small businesses.\n  However, where we differ is that I believe small businesses' taxes \nshould be lowered, not raised, to get our economy back on track. In \n2001 and 2003, Congress enacted bipartisan tax relief designed to \ntrigger economic growth and create jobs by reducing the tax burden on \nindividuals and small businesses. This included an across-the-board \nincome tax reduction, which reduced marginal tax rates for income \nearners of all levels, a reduction of the top dividends and capital \ngains tax rate to 15 percent, and a gradual phaseout of the estate tax.\n  Unfortunately, like many of the other provisions enacted in 2001 and \n2003, these tax relief measures are scheduled to expire at the end of \n2010.\n  Some have referred to this bipartisan tax relief as ``the Bush tax \ncuts for the wealthy'' and have suggested that the tax relief provided \nfor higher-income earners should be allowed to expire. However, this \ntax relief was bipartisan and provides tax relief for all taxpayers. \nThe President and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nproposed increasing the top two marginal tax rates from 33 percent and \n35 percent to 36 percent and 39.6 percent, respectively.\n  They have also proposed increasing the tax rates on capital gains and \ndividends to 20 percent, and providing for an estate tax rate as high \nas 45 percent and an exemption amount of $3.5 million.\n  Also, the President has called for fully reinstating the personal \nexemption phaseout, or PEP for short, and\n\n[[Page S7093]]\n\nthe limitation on itemized deductions, which is known as Pease. Under \nthe 2001 tax law, PEP and Pease are scheduled to be completely phased \nout in 2010. However, like other provisions in the law, PEP and Pease \nare scheduled to come back in full force in 2011 should Congress fail \nto take further action.\n  With PEP and Pease fully reinstated, individuals in the top two rates \ncould see their marginal effective tax rate increased by 20 percent or \nmore. For example, a family of four that is in the 33 percent tax \nbracket in 2010 could pay a marginal effective tax-rate of 41 percent \nafter 2010--or even more if they had more children--because of PEP and \nPease.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have defended \nthis proposal by claiming they will only raise taxes on ``wealthy'' \ntaxpayers who make over $200,000 a year. For the vast majority of \npeople who earn less than $200,000, raising taxes on higher earners \nmight not sound so bad.\n\n  However, this means that many small businesses will be hit with a \nhigher tax bill. These small businesses happen to at least 70 percent \nof all new private sector jobs in the U.S.\n  These small businesses that are taxed as sole proprietorships, S \ncorporations, and partnerships--including LLCs--whose owners make over \n$200,000, or $250,000 if married, would get hit with the President's \nproposal to raise the top two marginal tax rates.\n  In addition, there are just under 2 million C corporations that are \nnot publicly traded, and all C corporations are subject to double \ntaxation. To the extent these C corporations' owners that make over \n$200,000, or $250,000 if married, pay themselves a salary, they would \nget hit with the tax increase on the top two marginal tax rates \nproposed by the President.\n  Also, any owners of C corporations that receive dividends or realize \ncapital gains and make over $200,000, or $250,000 if married, would pay \na 20 percent rate on these dividends and capital gains after 2010 under \nthe President's tax hike proposals, instead of paying the current law \nrate of 15 percent.\n  According to NFIB survey data, 50 percent of owners of small \nbusinesses that employ 20-249 workers would fall in the top two \nbrackets. According to the Small Business Administration, about \\2/3\\ \nof the Nation's small business workers are employed by small businesses \nwith 20-500 employees.\n  Do we really want to raise taxes on these small businesses that \ncreate new jobs and employ \\2/3\\ of all small business workers?\n  With these small businesses already suffering from the credit crunch, \ndo we really think it's wise to hit them with the double-whammy of a 20 \npercent increase in their marginal tax rates?\n  Newly developed data from the Joint Committee on Taxation \ndemonstrates that 55 percent of the tax from the higher rates will be \nborne by small business owners with income over $250,000. This is a \nconservative number, because it doesn't include flow-through business \nowners making between $200,000 and $250,000 that will also be hit with \nthe Budget's proposed tax hikes.\n  If the proponents of the marginal rate increase on small business \nowners agree that a 20 percent tax increase for half of the small \nbusinesses that employ two-thirds of all small business workers is not \nwise, then they should either oppose these tax increases, or present \ndata that show a different result.\n  I will also fight for a lower estate tax rate and a higher estate tax \nexemption amount to protect successful small businesses and farmers. In \na time when many businesses are struggling to stay afloat, it does not \nmake sense to impose additional burdens on them by raising their taxes.\n  Odds are, they will cut spending. They will cancel orders for new \nequipment, cut health insurance for their employees, stop hiring, and \nlay people off. Instead of seeking to raise taxes on those who create \njobs in our economy, policies need to focus on reducing excessive tax \nand regulatory barriers that stand in the way of small businesses and \nthe private sector making investments, expanding production, and \ncreating sustainable jobs.\n  As the current ranking member of the tax writing Finance Committee, \nyou can be sure that I will continue to fight to prevent a dramatic tax \nincrease on our nation's job engine--the small businesses of America. \nThis includes working to protect small businesses from higher marginal \ntax rates, an increase in the capital gains and dividends tax rate, and \nan increase in the unfair estate tax rate that will penalize the \nsuccess of small businesses and farmers who would like to pass on their \ngains to the next generation.\n  In fact, today I have introduced a bill to lower taxes on these job-\ncreating small businesses.\n  My bill contains a number of provisions that will leave more money in \nthe hands of these small businesses so that these businesses can hire \nmore workers, continue to pay the salaries of their current employees, \nand make additional investments in these businesses.\n  For instance, my bill would increase the amount of capital \nexpenditures that small businesses can expense from $250,000 to \n$500,000. Also, my bill would allow more small C corporations to \nbenefit from the lower graduated tax rates for smaller C corporations.\n  Another provision takes the general business credits, which are \nlisted in section 38, out of the Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT, for \nthose sole proprietorships, flow-throughs and non-publicly traded C-\ncorps with 50 million or less in annual gross receipts. This provision \namends section 39 to extend the 1-year carryback for general business \ncredits to a 5-year carryback. This applies to general business credits \nfor those sole proprietorships, flow-through entities and non-publicly \ntraded C-corps with 50 million or less in annual gross receipts.\n  Another provision in my bill amends section 199 of the Internal \nRevenue Code, which contains the deduction for manufacturing, to \nprovide a 20 percent deduction for flow-through business income for all \nsmall businesses, which are defined as flow-through entities with 50 \nmillion or less in annual gross receipts. Another provision in my bill \ndeals with the situation where a C corporation becomes an S \ncorporation. Under current law, there is no tax on built-in gains of \nassets within a C corporation that converts to an S corporation if \nthose assets with built-in gain are held for 10 years by the S \ncorporation. The stimulus bill reduced this 10-year period down to 7 \nyears for sales of assets with built-in gain that occur within 2009 and \n2010.\n  My provision reduces this time period down to 5 years for all S \ncorporations that have converted from a C corporation.\n  Another provision in my bill expands the net operating loss provision \ncontained in the stimulus bill. Current law provides that net operating \nlosses from any size business may be carried back 2 taxable years \nbefore the year that the loss arises and carried forward 20 years. The \nstimulus bill amended the carryback provision by expanding the \ncarryback from 2 years to 5 years if a small business had gross \nreceipts of $15 million or less.\n  This provision expands that $15 million gross receipt requirement to \n$50 million in gross receipts so that more small businesses can qualify \nfor this benefit.\n  Another provision in my bill amends section 1202 of the Internal \nRevenue Code to eliminate the tax on capital gains for certain start-up \nC corporations. The stimulus bill reduced the capital gains tax to \napproximately 7 percent on stock qualifying under 1202. However, \nPresident Obama has called for eliminating, not simply reducing, the \ntax on capital gains for these start-up businesses, and that is exactly \nwhat my provision would do.\n  The final provision in my bill permits a deduction for payments made \nunder the Self-Employment Contribution Act, or SECA, at one-hundred \npercent of health insurance premiums that are paid by those who are \nself-employed.\n  We all want to see the job numbers from the Department of Labor \nmoving in a positive direction. We all want to see the unemployment \nrate plummet. I firmly believe that the best way for us to do that is \nto prime the job-creating engine of our economy, which is small \nbusinesses. Furthermore, increasing taxes on small businesses as \nPresident Obama has proposed will destroy even more jobs.\n  My small business bill, if enacted, will lead to many new jobs. As \nopposed\n\n[[Page S7094]]\n\nto the jobs President Obama argues that the stimulus bill has saved \nwhile our economy has been hemorrhaging jobs, my bill will create \ncountable, verifiable, private sector jobs that will put people to work \nand get the economy moving in the right direction again.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1381\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve and expand the Peace Corps. for the 21st \ncentury, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a piece of \nlegislation--and not just any old piece of legislation, I might add, \nbecause this organization I am about to talk about had as much to do \nwith the formation of who I am as my family did: the Peace Corps \nImprovement and Expansion Act of 2009.\n  I would point out that some 35 years ago a young man from \nMassachusetts and an equally young man from Connecticut were elected to \nthe House of Representatives. A fellow by the name of Paul Tsongas and \nmyself were the first two former Peace Corps volunteers to be elected \nto the Congress. Paul Tsongas went on to be elected to the Senate, I \nthink, in 1978. He is no longer with us. He died tragically a number of \nyears ago. His wife Niki is now a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives from Massachusetts.\n  Paul Tsongas and I were great friends and enjoyed sharing stories \nwith each other for many years about our respective Peace Corps \nexperiences.\n  Paul Tsongas served in Ethiopia--one of the earliest programs, if not \nthe earliest program, in that country. I served in the Dominican \nRepublic from 1966 through 1968 as a Peace Corps volunteer up in the \nmountains of that country, not far from the Haitian border. The Peace \nCorps experience for me was as formative, as I said at the outset of \nthese remarks, as anything else in my life, with the exception of my \nown family; growing up with wonderful five brothers and sisters in \nConnecticut and a family who was deeply involved in public service.\n  The Peace Corps experience was formative, and so over the years, I \nhave expressed a great deal of interest in the organization and the \nvarious administrations that have served in Washington since the late \n1970s through the 1980s and 1990s and this decade. So my interest in \nthe organization is strong.\n  The contribution of the Peace Corps has been remarkable over the \nyears. It is one of the few Federal agencies that enjoys almost \nuniversal support from the American public. It has had greater moments \nof celebration and public awareness than at others, but it has been \nconsistent in the minds of most Americans. This organization sends \nmostly younger Americans, but not always younger Americans, to serve in \nunderprivileged nations, nations that are struggling, including Third \nWorld nations, to make a difference in the lives of others. It has been \na unique contribution to the world.\n  There are many other volunteer organizations--some in our own \ncountry, some in other nations--but I think the Peace Corps holds a \nspecial place in the minds not only of our own fellow citizenry but \nalso millions of people around the world who have come to know those \nPeace Corps volunteers--as I said, mostly younger people but not always \nyounger people--who serve and spend 2 years working with them in their \nvillages or urban areas, not only making a difference in their daily \nlives but also getting to know them, getting to know us. People who \nwould never have the chance to come to America got to know America \nbecause they got to know that young American who was learning their \nlanguage and spending time with them and making a contribution to \nimprove their lives.\n  Well, for 48 years, the Peace Corps has stood as a uniquely American \ninstitution. I know other nations make contributions. This is not a \nunique idea for ourselves. But what other great nation would send its \npeople abroad not to extend its power or intimidate its adversaries, \nnot to kill or be killed, but to dig, to teach, to empower, and ask for \nnothing in return. For 48 years, those men and women--180,000 of us--\nhave returned, as stronger, wiser, and more inspired people prepared to \nlive our American lives of service.\n  For a half century, the Peace Corps has shaped our lives and the \nidentity of all Americans; who we are as a people and what we hope to \nachieve, not only for our own Nation but also for others who share this \nplanet with us.\n\n[[Page S7096]]\n\n  Today I rise to offer a piece of legislation for one simple reason, \nMr. President: I want the Peace Corps to continue playing that role \nthat it has for the last half century for another half century to come. \nBut before we consider how the Peace Corps can grow going forward, I \nthink it might be worth remembering just how it came into being. Where \ndid it all start? How was it created?\n  Like an awful lot of groundbreaking ideas, Mr. President, the Peace \nCorps might not have survived a board meeting or a subcommittee hearing \nwhere the idea was first proposed. It was a wild notion in many ways, \nso breathtakingly outrageous that it could only have been born out of \nidealism, youthful energy, and--perhaps a key element--too much \ncaffeine. For you see, the Peace Corps was born at 2 in the morning.\n  It was October 4, 1960, and a then young Senator from Massachusetts \nby the name of John F. Kennedy was running for the Presidency. He was \nrunning hours late, as candidates often do, for a campaign stop at the \nUniversity of Michigan in Ann Arbor. John Kennedy assumed that most of \nthe crowd would have gone home by that late hour. But when he arrived \nat the student union, at the campus in Ann Arbor, he found 10,000 \nstudents waiting outside in the frigid dark to greet him. As public \nofficials and holders of elective office, I think we can sympathize \nwith then-Senator Kennedy at that hour, having endured months of late \nnights on a campaign trail, uncomfortable beds, and a bad diet along \nthe way. I suspect he might have been sorely tempted at that late \nhour--as all of us have been from time to time--to offer a perfunctory \nthank-you to the Michigan students for hanging around all that long, \nrecite a memorized stump speech--having given it on countless \noccasions, he would know it from memory--and send them home and retire \nhimself.\n  But something besides a chill was in the air that night in Ann Arbor. \nFloodlit and shivering, the crowd began to chant his name as he climbed \nthe steps to the student union, and Senator John Kennedy realized this \nwas something special. He realized he owed these students more than \njust that perfunctory set of remarks. So at 1:30 or 2:00 in the \nmorning, on a frigid night in Michigan, he challenged them as a \ncandidate, as a United States Senator, and he asked:\n\n       How many of you, who are going to be doctors, are willing \n     to spend your days in Ghana? Technicians or engineers, how \n     many of you are willing to work in the Foreign Service and \n     spend your lives traveling around the world?\n\n  I believe, Mr. President, that challenge is the Peace Corps' founding \ndocument. It didn't begin with a white paper or a TV ad. It began with \na simple question.\n  In the days that followed the Kennedy rally at the student union in \nMichigan, students drafted a petition, circulating it to colleges all \nacross the State, and within a couple of weeks across the country, \npresenting several scrolls ultimately to John Fitzgerald Kennedy \ncontaining thousands upon thousands upon thousands of names. Some \n30,000 letters flooded his office asking him to continue with this \nidea.\n  So I think it is fair to say, Mr. President, the answer to that \nquestion--are you willing to serve your country by serving the world?--\nwas an overwhelming yes by a generation almost 50 years ago. Of course, \nseveral other pressing questions also followed: How do you build an \norganization around that raw energy? How do you pay for that? What do \nyou even call that idea or organization?\n  John Kennedy's top advisers were already working on those issues. \nAfter all, they had decided, if we don't start doing our part for the \ndeveloping world, they were concerned--and rightfully so--the \nCommunists around the world would. At a time much like today, when our \nNation faced conflicts with people who knew as little of America as we \nknew of them, this case for a Peace Corps could be made not only in the \nlofty rhetoric of idealism but in the cold hard language of \nrealpolitik.\n  The notion that service could be a part of our foreign policy--indeed \nthat it could be a powerful weapon in the Cold War--was truly a radical \nidea. It suggested that there could be more measures of strength than \ncaliber or tonnage. It argued that the world needed to see our ideals \nnot just in ink but incarnate in the person of Americans with dirty \nhands working under a hot foreign sun. It said: You cannot hate America \nif you know Americans.\n  The skeptics quickly descended upon John Kennedy's idea. Richard \nNixon called the Peace Corps ``a haven for draft-dodgers.'' Former \nPresident Dwight Eisenhower called it ``a juvenile experiment.'' Even \nthose old foreign policy hands who supported Kennedy's idea thought it \nwas a fine idea, as long as it was kept small. Academics and State \nDepartment officials agreed: Proceed with caution, they urged. Start \nwith just a few hundred volunteers. Don't create a fiasco, they said. \nDon't let this experiment get out of hand.\n  If they had gotten their way, I suspect the Peace Corps might not \neven exist today. But just as a late-night burst of exuberance gave \nbirth to the Peace Corps in Ann Arbor, a similar bolt of sleepless \ninspiration kept it alive. In a hotel room in downtown Washington--not \nfar from where I am on the floor of the Senate--with only a few \ntypewriters and a stack of blank papers, two aides--only two of them; \none named Sergeant Shriver and the other named Harris Wofford, who \nturned out many years later to be a colleague of ours in the Senate--\ncomprised the entirety of the Peace Corps staff that had been tasked \nwith figuring out how to put this outrageous idea into practice.\n  The one thing the two of these men knew, Sergeant Shriver later told \nus, was that the conventional approach then in vogue wouldn't work. \nAmerica would only have one chance to get it right. So it was that \nSergeant Shriver happened to be in the office at 3 o'clock in the \nmorning--not unlike the hour at Ann Arbor--reading a paper prepared by \na State Department employee who had sent along some ideas. His name was \nWarren Wiggins.\n  Warren Wiggins called his paper ``The Towering Task,'' a reference to \nJFK's first State of the Union Address, where the young President said:\n\n       The problems are towering and unprecedented and the \n     response must be towering and unprecedented as well.\n\n  Warren Wiggins called for a towering and unprecedented Peace Corps. \nHe wrote:\n\n       One hundred youths engaged in agricultural work of some \n     sort in Brazil might pass by unnoticed, but 5,000 American \n     youths helping to build Brasilia might warrant the full \n     attention and support of the President of Brazil himself.\n\n  Where a handful of young people might present a nuisance to a foreign \nambassador, an army of motivated young Americans could make a real \ndifference. Besides, wasn't it a moment for great ambition?\n  At 3 o'clock in the morning, Sergeant Shriver read Warren Wiggins's \nconclusion: The Peace Corps needed to begin with a ``quantum jump,'' \nand it needed to begin immediately, by Executive order, with as many as \n5,000 to 10,000 volunteers right away. By 9 o'clock that same morning, \nWarren Wiggins himself was sitting alongside Sergeant Shriver in that \nvery hotel room drafting a report for the President of the United \nStates.\n  Within a month of that date, President John Kennedy had created the \nPeace Corps by Executive order. Within 2 years, more than 7,000 young \nAmericans were serving across the globe, and that number had more than \ndoubled by 1966, the year that I joined the Peace Corps.\n  One of those young Americans--as I mentioned, the person speaking to \nyou this afternoon--was a 22-year-old English major at Providence \nCollege who arrived in the small village of Moncion in the Dominican \nRepublic. As a young person, I spoke barely any Spanish. I had little \nidea I was doing, and I certainly didn't have a clue that more than 40 \nyears later I would be standing on the floor of the United States \nSenate explaining that the Peace Corps gave me the richest 2 years of \nmy life.\n  I owe those 2 years, and the impact they had on all of my years \nsince, to John Kennedy's 2 a.m. question and Warren Wiggins paper that \nSergeant Shriver read at 3 in the morning.\n  From the story of the Peace Corps, and my own story, we can learn \nthree things: First, the Peace Corps works,\n\n[[Page S7097]]\n\nMr. President. Besides simple labor and goodwill, every American we \nsend abroad brings with him or her another chance to make America known \nto a world that often fears and suspects us and our motives. Every \nAmerican who returns to our country from that service comes home as a \ncitizen strengthened with the knowledge of the world in which he or she \nhas just lived.\n  As Sargent Shriver said, ``Peace Corps Volunteers come home to the \nUSA realizing that there are billions--yes, billions--of human beings \nnot enraptured by our pretensions, or our practices, or even our \nstandards of conduct.''\n  Second: size matters. The perils of a small, timid Peace Corps are \njust as clear today as they were in 1961. Just as then, advocates of a \nstripped-down mission make the same arguments: sending untrained, \nuntested students only aggravates our host countries and raises the \nchance of a mishap--so let's send a few experts instead. And just as in \n1961, our response is fundamentally the same, and still fundamentally \ncorrect: of course we need volunteers of the highest quality. But we \nneed the highest quantities, too.\n  Third: size comes at a cost. The bigger any organism grows, the \nslower it gets. The Peace Corps that charted its course in a hotel room \nwith a staff of two now enjoys a staff of over a thousand and a fine \noffice building close to the White House. But even the most \ngroundbreaking ideas must all make, in good time, what the philosopher \nGramsci called ``the long march through the institutions.'' And where \nPresident Kennedy once predicted that, within a few decades, our Nation \nwould have more than one million returned volunteers, today fewer than \n200,000 have had the opportunity to serve.\n  The legislation I offer today is designed to help the Peace Corps not \nonly grow--and I have joined the many voices calling for it to grow \ndramatically--but also reform.\n  To those who know and love the Peace Corps, reform is an \nuncomfortable subject. After all, we don't want to destroy what has \nmade this institution so remarkable and unique. There wouldn't be a \nPeace Corps if JFK had stuck to the script in Ann Arbor. There wouldn't \nbe a Peace Corps if thousands of students, acting on their own \ninitiative, hadn't caught his attention with their movement. There \nmight not be a Peace Corps if Sargent Shriver had listened to the \nrespectable voices of caution in the early days of 1961.\n  The Peace Corps is unlike any other organ of our government because \nof its uniquely grassroots origin. And we can't treat it like any other \norgan of our government for those reasons.\n  So the Peace Corps Improvement and Expansion Act of 2009 does not \ninclude a list of mandates. It does not micromanage.\n  Instead, it asks those who have written this remarkable success \nstory--from the Director to managers and country directors to current \nand returned volunteers--to serve once more by undertaking a thorough \nassessment of the Peace Corps and developing a comprehensive strategic \nplan for reforming and revitalizing the organization.\n  Just as JFK's question to those Michigan students sparked the Peace \nCorps, asking questions today, some 50 years later, I believe will \nstrengthen it. How can volunteers be better managed? How can they be \nbetter trained? Can we improve recruiting? Are we sending our \nvolunteers to the right countries? Why do we have volunteers in Samoa \nand Tonga, but not in Indonesia, Egypt, or Brazil? Are we still \nachieving the broader goals of the Peace Corps and helping our country \nmeet 21st century challenges?\n  Most of all: How can we strengthen and grow this remarkable \norganization without losing the spark--the ambitious sense of the \npossible that led JFK to stay up late dreaming with those students in \nAnn Arbor and Sargent Shriver to stay up even later reading Warren \nWiggins's paper?\n  Warren Wiggins died 2 years ago at the age of 84. His obituary quoted \nHarris Wofford: ``I think he embodied the watchwords that were once \ngiven to me: We must be more inventive if we're going to do our duty.''\n  Inventiveness and duty: two qualities that don't often go together. \nBut the Peace Corps is the result of just such a combination. It has \nstrengthened our Nation, improved the world, and stands today as one of \nthe signal accomplishments of the 20th century. It has been supported \nby Republican and Democratic administrations over the last 50 years.\n\n  As I said at the outset of these remarks, except for my own family, \nnothing has meant more in my life--or in the lives of so many others--\nthan the experience I enjoyed so many years ago.\n  Today we honor the accomplishment of this organization. But let us \ncommit to strengthening and expanding the Peace Corps by passing this \nlegislation which I will send to the desk momentarily. Let us strive to \ninspire future generations to walk the path of service and exploration, \nthe one that led me and thousands of our Nation's citizens to nations \nsuch as the Dominican Republic or Ethiopia, where Paul Tsongas served, \nand then years later to arrive at this institution, which I cherish and \nlove as well. And let us never lose that spirit, that idealism, that \nambition that led a young President of a young nation to ask a \ngeneration to serve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 1383. A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act to prevent the \nabuse of dextromethorphan, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I rise to introduce the Dextromethorphan Abuse Reduction \nAct of 2009. This legislation will help prevent the dangerous abuse by \nminors of cough medicines containing the ingredient dextromethorphan, \nand will also help education and prevention efforts regarding teen \nabuse of prescription and nonprescription drugs. I am pleased to be \njoined by my colleague Senator Grassley of Iowa in sponsoring this \nlegislation, and I look forward to working with him to see it enacted \ninto law.\n  Dextromethorphan, or DXM, is a cough suppressant commonly found in \nover-the-counter cold medicines. These medicines are safe and effective \nwhen taken in their recommended dosage, but when consumed in large \namounts, medicines containing DXM can produce a hallucinogenic high. \nTeens who abuse cough medicines often refer to the practice as \n``Robotripping,'' a term derived from the cough medicine Robitussin \nwhich contains DXM. When abused, cold medicines containing DXM can \ncause a variety of harmful physical effects, including disorientation, \nimpaired physical coordination, abdominal pain, nausea, rapid \nheartbeat, and seizures. However, medicines containing DXM are legal, \ninexpensive, and sold at retail stores and over the Internet.\n  Studies show that teenagers are abusing cough medicines at an \nalarming rate. A recent study by the Partnership for a Drug-Free \nAmerica revealed that about 7 percent of teens--or 1.7 million--\nreported abusing cough medicine in the year 2008. This study also found \nhigh rates of teen abuse of other prescription drugs, with 2.5 million \nteens reporting having abused a prescription pain reliever in 2008. \nExperts say that cough syrup and prescription drug abuse is \nsignificantly underreported.\n  The Dextromethorphan Abuse Reduction Act would take significant steps \nto reduce and prevent teen abuse of DXM and other over-the-counter \ndrugs. First, the bill prohibits the sale of products containing DXM to \na buyer who is under 18 years old. Several major retailers, including \nWalgreens, Rite-Aid, and Giant, have already voluntarily agreed not to \nsell products that contain DXM to purchasers who are under 18, and \ntheir retail clerks check IDs to verify the purchaser's age. The \nlegislation would codify these voluntary steps, and would also direct \nthe Justice Department to promulgate regulations ensuring that Internet \nsales of DXM-containing products comply with these age restrictions. \nNotably, the legislation prohibits the sale to minors of any product \ncontaining DXM, including not just over-the-counter cough medicines but \nalso products containing DXM in its raw, unfinished form. This is \nimportant since the abuse of unfinished DXM products has been \nresponsible for several deaths in my home State of Illinois and \nelsewhere.\n  Second, this legislation would fund prevention and educational \nprograms\n\n[[Page S7098]]\n\nto combat over-the-counter and prescription drug abuse. The bill \nauthorizes the Director of National Drug Control Policy to provide \nmoney for the creation of a nationwide education campaign directed at \nteens and their parents regarding the prevention of abuse of \nprescription and nonprescription drugs. It also authorizes grants to \ncommunities for over-the-counter drug abuse awareness and prevention \nefforts, and provides increased funding to the National Community Anti-\ndrug Coalition Institute to provide training and technical assistance \nto boost those community-level efforts.\n  I am pleased that drug manufacturers and drug prevention groups have \njoined together in support of this legislation. The bill is supported \nby the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, the Partnership for a \nDrug-Free America, and the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America.\n  Restricting access by minors to DXM-containing products and \nincreasing awareness for teens and their parents of the potential harms \nof cough syrup and other over-the-counter drugs will help combat the \nhigh rates of teen abuse of these products. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1383\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Dextromethorphan Abuse \n     Reduction Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) When used properly, cough medicines that contain \n     dextromethorphan have a long history of being safe and \n     effective. But abuse of dextromethorphan at doses that exceed \n     the recommended levels can produce hallucinations, rapid \n     heart beat, high blood pressure, loss of consciousness, and \n     seizures. The dangers multiply when dextromethorphan is \n     abused with alcohol, prescription drugs, or narcotics.\n       (2) Dextromethorphan is inexpensive, legal, and readily \n     accessible, which has contributed to the increased abuse of \n     the drug, particularly among teenagers.\n       (3) Increasing numbers of teens and others are abusing \n     dextromethorphan by ingesting it in excessive quantities. \n     Prolonged use at high doses can lead to psychological \n     dependence on the drug. Abuse of dextromethorphan can also \n     cause impaired judgment, which can lead to injury or death.\n       (4) An estimated 1,700,000 teenagers (7 percent of teens) \n     abused over-the-counter cough medicines in 2008.\n       (5) The Food and Drug Administration has called the abuse \n     of dextromethorphan a ``serious issue'' and has said that \n     while dextromethorphan, ``when formulated properly and used \n     in small amounts, can be safely used in cough suppressant \n     medicines, abuse of the drug can cause death as well as other \n     serious adverse events such as brain damage, seizure, loss of \n     consciousness, and irregular heart beat.''\n       (6) In recognition of the problem, several retailers have \n     voluntarily implemented age restrictions on purchases of \n     cough and cold medicines containing dextromethorphan, and \n     several manufacturers have placed language on packaging of \n     cough and cold medicines alerting parents to the dangers of \n     medicine abuse.\n       (7) Prevention is a key component of the effort to address \n     the rise in the abuse of dextromethorphan and other legal \n     medications. Education campaigns teaching teens and parents \n     about the dangers of these drugs are an important part of \n     this effort.\n\n     SEC. 3. SALES OF PRODUCTS CONTAINING DEXTROMETHORPHAN.\n\n       (a) Sales of Products Containing Dextromethorphan.--\n       (1) In general.--Part D of title II of the Controlled \n     Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841 et seq.) is amended by adding \n     at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 424.

A bill to enable the Director of National Intelligence to \ntransfer full-time equivalent positions to elements of the intelligence \ncommunity to replace employees who are temporarily absent to \nparticipate in foreign language training, and for other purposes; to \nthe Select Committee on Intelligence.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that I \nhope will enable our national intelligence agencies to increase their \nemployees' proficiency in critical foreign languages. I have been a \nmember of the Senate Intelligence Committee for over eight years, and \nduring that time I have sat in a number of briefings and hearings that \naddressed foreign language capabilities. While specific details \nregarding the intelligence community's capabilities are generally \nclassified, it is no secret that there is still a great need for more \nanalysts and agents trained in key foreign languages. Over the past few \nyears there have been a number of new initiatives designed to address \nthis problem from different angles, and even newer initiatives are \nbeing introduced this year. The legislation that I am introducing \ntoday, which I have drafted along with Senator Chambliss of Georgia, is \nnot designed to replace any of those initiatives--rather, we think it \nwill complement those other initiatives by filling a key gap.\n  Let me explain this gap a little, so it will be clear what problem we \nare trying to fix. Most efforts to improve the language capabilities of \nvarious intelligence agencies focus on recruiting Americans who have a \nbackground in critical foreign languages--either from their education, \nor from their family. But this only attacks the problem from one angle. \nIf you want the national security workforce to have the strongest \nlanguage skills possible, you also need to improve language training \nfor people who already work for the intelligence agencies. This means \nboth teaching the basics of key languages to more people, and helping \npeople who are already proficient improve their skills further. \nUnfortunately, language training is time-intensive, and this can mean \nthat personnel are diverted from short-term priorities.\n  Here is an example of how this problem might crop up in practice. \nImagine that you are the supervisor of a group of 10 people somewhere \nin the intelligence community, working on counterterrorism issues, and \nthat one of those employees decides he wants to go spend several months \nin intensive language training to improve his Arabic. This would be a \ngood career move for that individual, and a good long-term investment \nfor your agency. But for you, the supervisor, it means that you might \nbe short-handed for several months while one of your employees is off \ngetting language training. Since you have a fixed number of positions \navailable for your office, it is difficult for you to replace someone \nwhile they are gone. This means that as the supervisor you actually \nhave an incentive to resist letting that employee head off for language \ntraining, since it will leave your team less well-equipped to meet \nshort-term priorities.\n  I am not saying that all supervisors within the intelligence \ncommunity are focused solely on short-term priorities, to the detriment \nof our long-term security interests. But I am saying that if we want \nour intelligence agencies to effectively balance short- and long-term \npriorities, we need to give them incentives that encourage them to do \nso, and not penalize people who try to balance short-term needs and \nlong-term goals.\n  Here is how the bipartisan legislation that Senator Chambliss and I \nare introducing today would attempt to address this problem. Our bill \nwould give the Director of National Intelligence the authority to \ntransfer additional positions to offices whose personnel are\n\n[[Page S7100]]\n\ntemporarily unavailable due to language training. The Director of \nNational Intelligence is uniquely situated to evaluate which offices \nare most in need of these extra positions, and could transfer them to \nthe places where they would do the most good.\n  So, to return to my previous example, if you were the supervisor of a \nyoung counterterrorism analyst who wants to take 6 months to go learn \nArabic, you could go ask the Director of National Intelligence to \ntransfer an extra position to your office for that 6 month period. That \nway, you could bring someone else in on a temporary basis to do that \nanalyst's work while they are gone for training. The analyst and the \nagency would get the long-term benefits of additional language \ntraining, and you, the supervisor, would not have to sacrifice in the \nshort-term.\n  Senator Chambliss and I do not claim that this legislation will \nrevolutionize the intelligence community's language capabilities \novernight. But it is our hope that it will make it easier than it is \ntoday for managers to balance short- and long-term priorities. If we \ncan achieve that it will be good for our national intelligence \nworkforce, and for our national security interests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/25/senate-section/article/S7100-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7100-S7102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 206--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n UNITED STATES SHOULD IMMEDIATELY IMPLEMENT THE UNITED STATES-COLOMBIA \n                       TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Roberts, \nMr. Martinez, and Mr. Bond) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                              S. Res. 206\n\n       Whereas, since his election in 2002, the President of \n     Colombia, Alvaro Uribe, has been overwhelmingly successful in \n     strengthening the institutions of Colombia, fighting \n     terrorism, improving the economy of Colombia, and extending \n     the authority of the central government, the social support \n     network, and security to most of Colombia;\n       Whereas, during President Uribe's term, the economy of \n     Colombia grew at an average rate of more than 5 percent per \n     year between 2002 and 2007;\n       Whereas, according to the World Bank, the total gross \n     domestic product of Colombia increased from $93,000,000,000 \n     in 2002 to $207,800,000,000 in 2007;\n       Whereas, according to the Office of the United States Trade \n     Representative, approximately 10,000,000 people in Colombia \n     have been lifted out of poverty during the past 5 years;\n       Whereas, according to the Ministry of Defense of Colombia, \n     between 2002 and 2007, kidnappings in Colombia decreased by \n     83 percent, murders decreased by 40 percent, and terrorist \n     attacks decreased by 76 percent;\n       Whereas police are now present in all 1,099 municipalities \n     in Colombia, including areas previously held by various \n     criminal and terrorist groups;\n       Whereas, according to the Department of State, more than \n     30,000 paramilitaries have been demobilized and disarmed \n     since 2002;\n       Whereas, in July 2008, the security forces of Colombia \n     successfully rescued 15 prisoners held hostage by the \n     Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), including \n     French-Colombian Ingrid Betancourt and 3 citizens of the \n     United States, Marc Gonsalves, Keith Stansell, and Thomas \n     Howes;\n       Whereas, according to the Office of the United States Trade \n     Representative, unemployment in Colombia fell from 16 percent \n     in 2002 to 9.9 percent in 2007;\n       Whereas, partially in recognition of the impressive \n     economic, political, and diplomatic advances Colombia has \n     made during the past decade, the United States negotiated and \n     signed the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement \n     on November 22, 2006, and a protocol of amendment to the \n     Agreement on June 28, 2007;\n       Whereas, according to the Office of the United States Trade \n     Representative, Colombia is currently the 27th largest \n     trading partner of the United States with respect to goods;\n       Whereas, according to the United States International Trade \n     Commission, goods valued at $11,400,000,000 were exported \n     from the United States to Colombia in 2008, an increase from \n     $3,600,000,000 in 2002;\n       Whereas, according to the United States International Trade \n     Commission, implementing the United States-Colombia Trade \n     Promotion Agreement would boost exports from the United \n     States by an estimated $1,100,000,000;\n       Whereas, more than 90 percent of exports from Colombia to \n     the United States already enter the United States duty-free \n     under the Andean Trade Preference Act (19 U.S.C. 3201 et \n     seq.) and the Generalized System of Preferences under title V \n     of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2461 et seq.);\n       Whereas, according to the Office of the United States Trade \n     Representative, more than 80 percent of consumer and \n     industrial products exported from the United States to \n     Colombia will enter Colombia duty-free as soon as the United \n     States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement enters into force \n     and all remaining tariffs on such products will be eliminated \n     within 10 years after the Agreement enters into force;\n       Whereas, according to the Office of the United States Trade \n     Representative, the primary exports from the United States to \n     Colombia in 2008 were $2,600,000,000 in machinery, \n     $997,000,000 in mineral fuel, $974,000,000 in organic \n     chemicals, $969,000,000 in corn and wheat cereals, and \n     $950,000,000 in electrical machinery;\n       Whereas, according to the Office of the United States Trade \n     Representative, Colombia is the 15th largest market for farm \n     products exported from the United States, with the United \n     States exporting almost $1,700,000,000 worth of farm products \n     to Colombia in 2008;\n       Whereas, since 2006, the quantity of agricultural products \n     exported from the United States to Colombia has increased by \n     approximately 40 percent per year;\n       Whereas, according to the Department of Agriculture, 99.9 \n     percent of agricultural products imported into the United \n     States from Colombia enter the United States duty-free, but \n     no agricultural products exported from the United States to \n     Colombia currently enter Colombia duty-free;\n       Whereas, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation, \n     the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement would \n     increase sales of agricultural products produced in the \n     United States by $910,000,000,000 each year;\n       Whereas, according to the Department of Agriculture, more \n     than half of agricultural products exported from the United \n     States to Colombia will enter Colombia duty-free as soon as \n     the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement enters \n     into force and all remaining tariffs on such products will be \n     phased out over time;\n       Whereas the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion \n     Agreement will level the playing field for workers, \n     businesses, and farmers in the United States by making duty-\n     free treatment a 2-way street between the United States and \n     Colombia for the first time;\n       Whereas, in the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion \n     Agreement, Colombia agreed to exceed commitments made by \n     Colombia as a member of the World Trade Organization and to \n     dismantle significant barriers to services and investment \n     from the United States; and\n       Whereas, in the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion \n     Agreement, the United States and Colombia reaffirm their \n     obligations as members of the International Labour \n     Organization: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate--\n       (A) recognizes the historic successes achieved by the \n     President of Colombia, Alvaro Uribe, in rebuilding the \n     Government of Colombia, strengthening the institutions of \n     Colombia, and solidifying the rule of law in Colombia;\n       (B) congratulates President Uribe, the Government of \n     Colombia, and the security forces of Colombia for significant \n     successes in fighting the Revolutionary Armed Forces of \n     Colombia (FARC);\n       (C) recognizes the close ties between the United States and \n     Colombia in the fight against illicit narcotics, terrorism, \n     and transnational crime; and\n       (D) recognizes that the United States-Colombia Trade \n     Promotion Agreement is enormously advantageous for workers, \n     businesses, and farmers in the United States, who would be \n     able to export goods to Colombia duty-free for the first \n     time; and\n       (2) it is the sense of that Senate that--\n       (A) it is in the security, economic, and diplomatic \n     interests of the United States to deepen the relationship \n     between the United States and Colombia; and\n       (B) the United States should implement the United States-\n     Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement immediately.\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the United \nStates-Colombia Free Trade Agreement which was signed way back in \nNovember of 2006. On July 29, President Uribe will be visiting the \nUnited States to meet with our President, President Obama. The two have \npreviously met at the Summit of Americas in April, but this will be \nPresident Uribe's first time here under the new administration.\n  Today, as one Senator, I rise to express my hope for a continuing \nbond in our relationship with Colombia's President Uribe. I also rise \nto express some concerns that I will talk about. I am happy that \nPresident Obama recognizes the importance of our closest ally in South \nAmerica. I am also pleased President Uribe continues to seek a close \nrelation with the United States, for he is truly a courageous and a \nvisionary leader.\n  Coming to power in some of the darkest and most vicious days of a \nMarxist insurgency everywhere in that country, he has pulled Colombia \nback from\n\n[[Page S7101]]\n\nthe brink. President Uribe has driven the terrorists from much of their \nterritory in Colombia's cities, boosted the economy, and he has \nimproved Colombia's human rights record.\n  If an American President had achieved this much, some would be \nclamoring for him or her to seek a third term. The same is true in \nColombia, where despite term limits, Uribe is actually being petitioned \nto run again.\n  His achievements are very impressive. During President Uribe's time \nin office, the economy grew at an average rate of over 5 percent over \nthe past 5 years.\n  According to the World Bank, Colombia's GDP growth then grew 7.5 \npercent in 2007, far surpassing the average in Latin America. Ten \nmillion Colombians have been lifted out of poverty, unemployment has \nfallen from double digits--16 percent in 2002--to 9.9 percent in 2007.\n  Crime has been a historic problem in Colombia. Yet, under President \nUribe's stewardship, kidnapings have declined 83 percent, murders are \ndown by 40 percent, terrorist attacks are down by 76 percent. Every \nsingle one of Colombia's 1,099 municipalities now have a police \npresence. Finally, at long last, Colombia appears to be winning the war \nagainst the terrorists who have made life miserable for far too many \nyears.\n  Last summer, the world was treated to the images of smiling U.S., \nFrench, and Colombian hostages when a daring Colombian Army raid freed \nthem from the terrorists. These included three U.S. defense contractors \nand one hostage who had been held since February of 2002.\n  The U.S. State Department estimates that over 30,000 paramilitaries \nand terrorists have been disarmed and demobilized--an impressive \nnumber.\n  I look to the future in this relationship, but I will be very candid. \nI am concerned about the present. I speak of the Colombia trade \nagreement that is languishing in the executive branch. We should, in my \njudgment, be embarrassed by this inaction. I recognize the populism of \nopposing trade, but I cannot understand the opposition to the Colombian \nFree Trade Agreement. It levels the playing field for U.S. workers and \nfarmers and small businesses. Over 90 percent of Colombia's exports to \nthe United States already enter this country duty free. They have for \nyears, under the Andean Trade Preferences Act and other previous \nagreements.\n  Meanwhile, U.S. exports to Colombia face high tariffs. They can be as \nhigh as 35 percent, a tax on our goods going into Colombia. In spite of \nthese restrictions, Colombia is America's 27th largest trading partner.\n  An International Trade Commission study estimated that the United \nStates-Colombia Free Trade Agreement would boost U.S. exports by $1.1 \nbillion. Do my colleagues and others who oppose this deal think the \nU.S. economy is so robust it does not need another billion-dollar-plus \nmarket? Are things that rosy? I suggest not.\n  I come from a farm State where we are especially eager to open new \nmarkets. Virtually 100 percent of Colombia's agricultural products \nenter the United States duty free. Zero percent of U.S. agricultural \nexports enter Colombia duty free.\n  This FTA wipes out those differences. It levels the playing field. \nTariffs would immediately disappear for 80 percent of U.S. exports into \nColombia and the rest phase out over time. The potential for dramatic \nincreases in our exports, in my judgment, is very clear.\n  Consider this: Even with the tariff imbalance our agricultural \nexports to Colombia totaled almost $1.7 billion in 2008. In spite of \nall of the current tariffs, corn and wheat cereals are one of the major \nU.S. exports to Colombia. Last year we sold $969 million worth, as well \nas $2.6 billion in machinery.\n  By anybody's definition these are very big numbers, and on a level \nplaying field--which is what the FTA will do--they will be even bigger, \nwith a potential to create thousands of jobs in an economy that needs \nevery job.\n  These statistics clearly show the FTA we have negotiated with \nColombia is not a blind leap into the unknown. Colombia already \nessentially has free trade with us, an open border. This FTA levels the \nplaying field for America's farmers and ranchers and U.S. businesses.\n  Did you know more than 8,000 small- and medium-size businesses in our \ncountry export to Colombia? For them, the elimination of these tariffs \nwould blow open the door of opportunity.\n  Congress should not be in the business of creating hurdles for the \nUnited States overseas, nor should the executive branch. Yet here we \nhave a clear pathway to eliminate a huge hurdle with a simple nod of \napproval. Yet we have failed to act.\n  The economic justification speaks for itself, but it is just one of \nthe several compelling reasons to ratify this agreement immediately. \nPerhaps as persuasive is the political situation in Latin America. \nSince his rise to power in Venezuela in 1998, Hugo Chavez has \nreinvigorated the radical Latin-American left. He has formed a block of \nanti-American countries in South and Central America composed of Cuba, \nNicaragua, Bolivia, and, increasingly, Ecuador.\n  During an audacious raid on the Ecuador border, Colombian military \nunits captured evidence detailing the Venezuelan Government's extensive \nsupport for the terrorists. Venezuela has used its petroleum money to \nbuy friends and influence people throughout the hemisphere, and too \noften they have succeeded. Our friend in Colombia has stoutly resisted \nthis siren song. When too many other nations have drifted into cheap \nanti-U.S. populism, Colombia has stood strong, and has traveled \nprecisely the opposite way.\n  So while President Uribe is here in our Nation and is meeting with \nour President, I hope the President of the United States will do the \nright thing and stand firmly in support of completing the FTA that has \nbeen negotiated. It is time for the administration to show great \nleadership on this issue, which is at every level, in my judgment, just \ngood common sense.\n  However, Congress cannot shirk its responsibility for the lack of \naction on the Colombia FTA. While the administration needs to step to \nthe mound, Congress must step up to the plate and swing for the fences. \nThis agreement was signed and it was sealed and it was delivered two \nand a half years ago. It is an unbelievable opportunity for our \nfarmers, our ranchers, and our small businesses. It is waiting right \nhere at our doorstep. All it needs is our nod of approval.\n  That is why today I introduce a resolution recognizing the benefits \nof the Colombian Free Trade Agreement. I encourage my colleagues to \ncosponsor this resolution and to implore the leadership to allow it to \ncome to a vote.\n  Rarely has an initiative with benefits this crystal clear faced such \na rocky and uncertain road. The time to level the playing field for \nfarmers and ranchers and small businesses is here. It is upon us.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from \nNebraska on his resolution to recognize the importance of the United \nStates continuing to trade in the world, especially with our friends in \nLatin America, especially when they are already taking advantage of low \ntariffs with us and we are not taking advantage of low tariffs with \nthem. Our principal concern on the Republican side, and I am sure for \nmany Democrats, too, is the cost of living for middle-class families in \nAmerica. There are many issues that come before us that deal with \nthat--the level of taxes, the level of tuition, that we get Medicaid \nspending under control so States will be able to fund the Universities \nof Nebraska and Tennessee better--but another way to do that is to \ntrade with the world.\n  People walk into stores in America, and they are looking, today, in \nbad economic times, for low costs. Are we going to erect barriers and \nraise costs? Are we going to say to families who do not have many extra \ndollars that it is in our national interest to raise our costs? Are we \ngoing to keep out of our country people with products and ideas causing \nthem to keep our products and ideas out of their country? Are we that \nafraid of competing in the world?\n  We Tennesseans have been much better off since Federal Express \nstarted flying in China and Nissan started building cars in Tennessee. \nFederal Express employs 30,000 people in the Memphis, TN, area, and \nNissan just announced this week it is going to build electric cars, not \nin Japan but in Smyrna, TN. That is because we trade with the world. So \nthis creeping protectionism that we see is a threat to the middle-class \nbudget of every American.\n\n[[Page S7102]]\n\n  Senator Johanns has made an important step toward change.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/25/senate-section/article/S7102-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 31--PROVIDING FOR A CONDITIONAL \n ADJOURNMENT OR RECESS OF THE SENATE, AND A CONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT OF \n                      THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\n\n  Mr. REID submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

Con. Res. 32\n\n       Whereas consumers may continue to confront a variety of \n     problems with a reformed health care system;\n       Whereas those problems may range from difficulties in \n     choosing an appropriate health plan, problems with \n     calculation of premiums and cost-sharing, the possibility of \n     a denial of benefits, and issues with enrollment and access \n     to providers;\n       Whereas the Institute of Medicine estimates that as many as \n     30 percent of people in the United States suffer from health \n     treatment illiteracy;\n       Whereas the Office of Disease Prevention and Health \n     Promotion of the Department of Health and Human Services \n     reports that only 12 percent of the population can use a \n     table to calculate the share of health insurance costs for an \n     individual;\n       Whereas a study by RAND Corporation found that increasing \n     the ease of access to information regarding insurance \n     products and simplifying the application process would \n     increase purchase rates of insurance products as much as \n     modest subsidies would;\n       Whereas the reports from the Institute of Medicine, the \n     Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, and RAND \n     Corporation prove there is a need for a fundamental \n     improvement in the manner in which consumers learn about \n     insurance choices;\n       Whereas many consumers lack avenues or mechanisms to \n     present grievances both to the managers of health plans and \n     to external reviewers and fail to receive timely decisions \n     with respect to those grievances;\n       Whereas consumers often need expert guidance to pursue \n     claims for denied health care benefits and other coverage \n     disputes;\n       Whereas some States have documented a number of cases of \n     improperly rescinded health insurance policies, inappropriate \n     billing for out-of-network services, and fraudulent and \n     deceptive marketing of health plans;\n       Whereas the Federal Government lacks oversight mechanisms \n     to prevent health care coverage problems from recurring in \n     other States;\n       Whereas the appropriate resolution of a health coverage \n     complaint may involve multiple Federal and State agencies;\n       Whereas health plans sometimes make mid-year changes to \n     provider networks, benefit offerings, or other elements of \n     the plan important to enrollees;\n       Whereas people need assistance enforcing consumer rights in \n     the health care system; and\n       Whereas Federal laws have created successful models of \n     consumer assistance with health dispute resolution, such as \n     the Long Term Care Ombudsman program that assists nursing \n     home residents in every State and the Senior Health Insurance \n     Assistance Program that assists those eligible for Medicare: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that any health \n     care reform legislation should include, with respect to \n     health plans--\n       (1) support for consumer education and assistance with \n     enrollment, particularly for vulnerable populations, at both \n     the Federal and State levels;\n       (2) assistance for people asserting consumer rights;\n       (3) a strengthened system of consumer protections, \n     including--\n       (A) an appeal mechanism within a health plan, and an appeal \n     mechanism with an external entity independent of the health \n     plan, which could address a variety of coverage problems;\n       (B) coverage for emergency care without prior \n     authorization;\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/25/senate-section/article/S7102-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1365.

Mr. President, I would like to speak for a moment about a \npending nomination that is not necessarily the topic of dinner table \nconversations around the country, but is nonetheless very important in \nall our daily lives. I am speaking of the Chairman of the Federal \nCommunications Commission, the FCC.\n  Wireless phones, cable, and satellite television, Internet services, \nand local television and radio are a part of everyone's daily lives in \none way or another. And while we may all have a customer service issue \nfrom time to time, for the most part these industries and the products \nthey offer are a showcase of the freedom and innovation that has made \nAmerica the most dynamic economy and society in the world's history.\n  We have seen these innovations in dramatic ways in recent days with \nTwitter reporting, YouTube videos, and mobile updates from the streets \nof Iran. Of course, the most important element of this new technology \nis that it gives an unprecedented power to individuals to speak about \nand share their personal experiences--everyone is empowered and the \nindividual controls the message.\n  This is very important as it changes the media paradigm we have known \nfor a generation. We often hear the terms ``old'' and ``new'' media. It \nis more accurate to say ``centralized'' and ``personalized'' media. Not \nlong ago, the average American had access to only a handful of radio \nand television programming, a local newspaper, no Internet, no mobile \ntelephone service, no texting, and certainly no mobile broadband. In \nother words, the average person had far less access to information than \ntoday, and from far more centralized sources.\n  The changing communications landscape calls for a knowledgeable and \nforward-looking FCC; not one looking to regulatory structures of the \npast that will hamstring future growth and innovation. The President \nhas nominated Julius Genachowski to be Chairman of the FCC. While I \nbelieve he is very knowledgeable about today's communications \nlandscape, I am afraid he may have tendencies to direct the development \nof our private communications industries, particularly broadcast media, \nwith an eye towards the past.\n  Many of my colleagues have chosen to give Mr. Genachowski the benefit \nof the doubt, and are supporting his nomination. I believe he has \nenough votes to be confirmed as FCC Chairman. While I remain concerned \nthat Mr. Genachowski will take us backward, towards more government \ncontrol of media, more government interference in commerce, and, \nunfortunately, more government control of media content--I will not \nprevent his nomination from proceeding.\n  I will, however, be vigilant in the weeks and months ahead and will \nfight any effort that even appears to have the effect of limiting or \nmandating political speech on the airwaves. Mr. Genachowski has said \nthat, under his guidance, any rules that the Commission considers would \nbe through ``processes that are open, transparent, fair, and driven by \nfacts about the industry and the marketplace.'' I hope this is true and \npromise to hold him to his commitments.\n\n\n          Nomination of Robert S. Litt and Stephen W. Preston\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the \nconfirmation of Robert S. Litt to be the second general counsel of the \nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence. I also rise in support \nof the confirmation of Stephen W. Preston as general counsel of the \nCentral Intelligence Agency, to fill the vacancy in that office that \nhas existed since 2004. President Obama's decision to place these \ndistinguished lawyers at the helms of these vitally important legal \noffices is an essential step in ensuring that the intelligence \ncommunity operates within the rule of law.\n  On June 11, the Select Committee on Intelligence, which I am \nprivileged to chair, favorably reported the nominations by a bipartisan \n14-1 vote. The committee's support of the nominees is based on an \nextensive public record. We questioned them at an open hearing on May \n21. That day we also placed on our website their responses to our \nquestionnaire for presidential nominees and to additional prehearing \nquestions about the offices for which they have been nominated.\n  On June 5, we placed on our website their responses to a further, \nextensive round of posthearing questions. We also examined financial \ninformation that is available to the public through the Office of \nGovernment Ethics and confidential communications to the committee from \nthe nominees that supplement their public answers about how they will \napproach potential conflicts relating to their private law practices.\n  Mr. Litt is a graduate of Harvard University and Yale Law School. He \nclerked for Judge Edward Weinfeld of the Southern District of New York \nand Justice Potter Stewart of the Supreme Court. He served as an \nassistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York for 6 \nyears. He later became a partner at the law firm of Williams & \nConnolly. Then from 1993 to 1999, after a year at the State Department, \nhe held two important posts at the Department of Justice. There, after \nservice as a deputy assistant attorney general in the criminal \ndivision, he rose to be Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General. At \nthe DOJ, his responsibilities included FISA applications, covert action \nreviews, computer security, and other national security matters.\n  He has been a partner with the law firm of Arnold and Porter since \n1999 and has been active in intelligence and national security policy \nmatters through bar association and other public activities.\n  Stephen Preston is a graduate of Yale University and Harvard Law \nSchool. He clerked for Judge Phyllis A. Kravitch of the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the 11th Circuit, and joined Wilmer, Cutler, and Pickering, \nwhere he became a partner. From 1993 to 2000, Mr. Preston served in the \nDepartment of\n\n[[Page S7110]]\n\nDefense and the Department of Justice. At the Department of Defense, he \nwas a deputy general counsel and then the principal deputy general \ncounsel, which included a period as acting general counsel and later, \ngeneral counsel for the Department of the Navy. At the Department of \nJustice, he was a deputy assistant attorney general in the civil \ndivision. While at DOD, the chief counsels at the defense intelligence \nagencies reported to him, and while at the Navy Department he had legal \nand oversight responsibilities for the Naval Criminal Investigative \nService. He has informed the committee that in his DOD and Navy \npositions, he dealt with other national security agencies, including \nthe CIA.\n  Mr. Preston has been a partner at the law firm of WilmerHale since \n2001, dealing in both his practice and public and private activities \nwith national security matters.\n  The Director of National Intelligence has the statutory \nresponsibility of ensuring compliance with the Constitution and laws of \nthe United States by the Office of the DNI and the CIA and ensuring \nthat compliance by other elements of the intelligence community through \ntheir host executive departments. As the chief legal officer of the \nOffice of Director of National Intelligence, the general counsel has \nthe critically important responsibility of aiding the DNI in fulfilling \nthis mandate.\n  In providing legal advice to the DNI, the general counsel must have \ninsight into activities throughout the intelligence community including \nthose of the general counsel offices in the various intelligence \ncommunity elements. As we made clear during this nomination process, \nthe committee expects that the ODNI general counsel will be aware of \nand have an opportunity to evaluate all of the significant legal \ndecisions made throughout the intelligence community. The general \ncounsel also represents the executive branch in proposing and \nnegotiating legislative provisions for our annual intelligence \nauthorization bill, which is coming up, and for other legislation that \naffects the equities of the intelligence community. The first ODNI \ngeneral counsel, Benjamin Powell, played an indispensable role, for \nwhich our committee is deeply grateful, in working with the Congress on \nthe FISA Amendments Act of 2008.\n  The Central Intelligence Agency operates around the world outside of \nthe law of other nations but is required to operate in strict \ncompliance with United States law, including the Constitution, acts of \nCongress, and treaties made under the authority of the United States. \nThe CIA general counsel serves to ensure that compliance. Because of \nthe independent legal judgment the role requires, the position of CIA \ngeneral counsel is an extremely challenging one that requires a strong \nand principled leader. It has been the longstanding position of the \nSenate, as manifested in the recommendations of the Iran-Contra \nCommittees upon examining the significant failures they exposed, that \nit is essential that the CIA general counsel be confirmed by the \nSenate.\n  The CIA Office of General Counsel played a key role in the creation \nof the CIA detention and interrogation program. It provided significant \ninformation to the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of \nJustice. It participated in briefings to the National Security Council \nand to Congress. And it was in charge of interpreting and implementing \nthe Office of Legal Counsel's guidance to CIA interrogators in the \nfield.\n  An examination of the role of the general counsel's office in the \ndetention and interrogation program--something that the Intelligence \nCommittee's review of the program will explore--demonstrates how \nimportant it is that the office has a strong leader who applies both \nsound legal analysis and good judgment to the task of providing counsel \nto the Director.\n  As I mentioned earlier in these remarks, the nominees answered the \ncommittee's many questions both in writing and in testimony before us. \nIndividual members of the committee may have disagreements with \nindividual answers, and some of these were discussed in the committee's \nconsideration of both. To some extent, the nominees are at the \ndisadvantage of not yet knowing the often still classified context of \nvarious questions. I am confident that they will quickly learn.\n  Moreover, a nomination process is a two-way communication. We use it \nto learn about the nominees, but it is also a process in which they \nlearn about our concerns. Both nominees now have an abundantly clear \nidea, for example, of the importance we place on the law's requirements \nfor keeping the committee fully and currently informed. Of course, they \nwill also have the responsibility of implementing the clear commitments \nthat Directors Blair and Panetta have made to that cornerstone of \naccountability and oversight.\n  For both the ODNI and the CIA, the Nation needs a strong general \ncounsel of unimpeachable integrity and an unwavering commitment to the \nConstitution and laws of the United States. I cannot say that too \nstrongly. I am pleased that our committee has determined that the two \nnominees are both highly qualified and well suited to serve the Nation \nby providing counsel to the Director of National Intelligence and the \nCIA. I urge my colleagues to confirm them.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Foreign \nRelations Committee be discharged of PN587, the nomination of Daniel M. \nRooney to be Ambassador to Ireland; that the Senate then proceed to the \nnomination; that the nomination be confirmed and the motion to \nreconsider be laid on the table; that no further motions be in order; \nthat the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and \nthat any statements relating thereto be printed at the appropriate \nplace in the Record, as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Commerce \nCommittee be discharged from further action on S. Res. 199.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the resolution.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 199) recognizing the contributions of \n     the recreational boating community and the boating industry \n     to the continuing prosperity of the United States.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the Senate's passage \nof a resolution I submitted earlier this week with the cochair of the \nSenate Boating Caucus, Senator Burr. Our resolution recognizes July 1 \nas National Boating Day, and more importantly, recognizes the \nimportance of boating and fishing to our economy and our constituents.\n  I believe this resolution comes at a critical time. Like so many \nother industries, the boating industry has suffered during these tough \neconomic times. Last summer's high gas prices and this past year's \ncredit crisis has put many manufacturers and their dealers at risk. And \nthat endangers the hundreds of thousands of well-paying jobs that the \nboating industry provides.\n  Wisconsin is a microcosm of boating and fishing in America. With \naccess to the Great Lakes and thousands of acres of internal lakes and \nrivers, Wisconsin is home to more than 1.4 million anglers and a \ndestination for both boating and fishing related tourists. Beyond the \ntourism jobs generated by recreational boating, the boating industry \nhas a strong foothold in my State. Whether it's Mercury Marine in Fond \ndu Lac to SkipperLiner in La Crosse, boating manufacturers, suppliers, \ndealers and marinas account for thousands of jobs. In 2001, \napproximately $1 billion was spent in the State on fishing related \nactivities, according to a study conducted by the Fish and Wildlife \nService. Recreational boating is an equal partner to the sport fishing \nindustry, with more than $526 million being spent in 2003 on powerboats \nand accessories.\n  The importance of boating, however, extends well beyond its economic \nimpact. More than 59 million people spend time each year on our rivers, \nlakes, and coastlines. These are families spending time together and \nthey are people learning more about the natural resources our country \nhas to offer. The true impact of boating is immeasurable.\n  And that is why I am so pleased to join my colleagues in supporting \nthe resolution passed earlier today. I hope that on July 1--National \nBoating Day--both Members of Congress and the American people will \nreflect on the true importance of boating to our country.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and that if \nthere are any statements relating to this resolution, they be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 199) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 199\n\n       Whereas the recreational boating community in the United \n     States includes over 59,000,000 individuals;\n       Whereas the boating industry contributes more than \n     $33,000,000,000 annually to the United States economy, and \n     provides jobs for 337,000 citizens of the United States who \n     earn wages totaling $10,400,000,000 annually;\n       Whereas recreational boaters often serve as stewards of the \n     marine environment of the United States, educating others of \n     the value of marine resources, and preserving the resources \n     for the enjoyment of future generations;\n       Whereas there are approximately 1,400 active boat builders \n     in the United States, using materials and services \n     contributed from all 50 States;\n       Whereas recreational boating provides opportunities for \n     families to be together, appeals to all age groups, and \n     benefits the physical fitness and scholastic performance of \n     those who participate; and\n       Whereas, July 1, 2009, would be an appropriate day to \n     establish as National Boating Day: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the recreational boating community and the \n     boating industry of the United States for contributing to the \n     economy of the United States, benefitting the well-being of \n     United States citizens, and providing responsible \n     environmental stewardship of the marine resources of the \n     United States; and\n       (2) encourages the United States to observe National \n     Boating Day with appropriate programs and activities that \n     emphasize family involvement and provide an opportunity to \n     promote the boating industry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/25/senate-section/article/S7112-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7112-S7113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nPROVIDING FOR A CONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT OR RECESS OF THE SENATE AND THE \n                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\n\n  Mr. REID.
