Mr. President, around midnight last night I was in \nconversation with the President and some others, and the President \nindicated that this morning, unemployment numbers would come out, and \nthey would be somewhat scary. That was absolutely true. At 8:30 this \nmorning, the unemployment numbers were reported for January, and they \nhit a 16-year high of 7.6 percent. That is averaged across the United \nStates. Some places are much worse than that. My State of Nevada is an \nexample. We are the fifth highest unemployed State in the country. Some \nStates now have over 10 percent unemployment.\n  Mr. President, if this were the top and we were headed down, that \nwould be one thing, but it doesn't appear that is the case. It appears \nunemployment rates are going to get higher and higher. The business \ncrisis is growing worse and worse, housing problems have become more \ncomplex and more difficult, and the lending freeze has not passed. \nSmall businesses are shutting their doors.\n  In a Las Vegas paper today, to use an example, a book store in \nHenderson, NV--the second largest city in Nevada--had closed. The \npeople had invested their entire life's savings in this little \nbusiness--$350,000--and they are broke and the business is shuttered. \nThis is happening all over the country. In January alone, 600,000 \npeople lost their jobs. In Nevada, the unemployment rate is now over 9 \npercent. Leading economists are now comparing today's crisis to the \nearly years of the Great Depression.\n  Now, Mr. President, we are not in a depression. But as I mentioned \nyesterday, during the Great Depression stock market values went down 89 \npercent, unemployment was 25 percent, and millions of others were \nunderemployed. We are not there, but we have to do something to turn \nthis around or we will be there. That is why the American people are \nlooking at us to do something about it--to create jobs. That is what we \nneed to do.\n  Now, the package that President Obama has come up with is a mix of \ntax cuts and spending, and we are now\n\n[[Page S1774]]\n\nin the throes of trying to work something out to approve that plan. As \nwe mentioned yesterday, in the evening, the vast majority of the \nAmerican people know something has to be done. They approve of what \nPresident Obama is trying to do.\n  All economists--conservatives, moderates, and liberals--for example, \njust a week ago we met with Feldstein, Blinder, and we met with Zandi, \nJohn McCain's chief economic adviser, somebody from the old Republican \nadministrations, and a Democratic economist. They all said the program \nhas to be bold, and it has to create jobs. Experts at all points along \nthe political spectrum agree if we fail to take bold action, this \nrecession will last for many years into the future.\n  America is waiting to see what we are going to do in the next 24 \nhours. The world is waiting to see what we are going to do in the next \n24 hours. Everyone knows this crisis was not created by Barack Obama. \nHe has been President for a matter of a couple of weeks. The crisis was \ninherited from his predecessor. When this man, George Bush, took \noffice, for over a 10-year period there was a $7 trillion surplus. But \nthat is long since gone. Now, President Obama is taking the responsible \nsteps we need to take to begin the long road to recovery.\n  The first step is the bill before us, called the American Recovery \nand Reinvestment Act, which the House of Representatives has passed and \nwe have debated all this week. This is a critical day for our country \nand this Congress. Faced with this grave and growing economic crisis, \nas indicated by the unemployment figures that came out at 8:30 this \nmorning, the Democrats and Republicans must decide today whether they \nwill work together to come up with a plan and join the President on \nthis road to recovery.\n  Now, I have been very concerned we shouldn't be talking about names \non the Senate floor because sometimes it does more harm than good. But \nthere is a small group of Republicans who are trying to work to come up \nwith a solution. They have been genuine in their efforts. They have \nbeen responsible in their efforts. And while I don't agree with \neverything they are trying to do, I agree with the efforts they have \nmade.\n  We have made progress. We have made progress since last night. We \nhave been in a number of meetings already this morning. We worked into \nthe night last night, and I think we are going to be able to work \nsomething out. I feel very comfortable we can do that. If we succeed, \nthere is going to be a lot of credit to go around. If we fail, there is \ngoing to be a lot of blame to go around.\n  As I have indicated, our entire country will suffer and the world \nwill suffer. We are the country that drives the world economy. During \nthis week of floor debate, we have embraced good ideas, including tax \nrelief and other investments, from both parties. We will continue to \nembrace all efforts borne of good will to reach a bipartisan \ncompromise, but we are nearing the time when negotiations must be \ncompleted and action must begin.\n  So I urge my colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, to dedicate \nthis day to responsibly passing this legislation and sending it to the \nPresident so we can say we have marched down that road, that road to \neconomic recovery. There is no perfect solution to what we are \nattempting. There is no book you can check out of the library to say \nthis is what should be done. There is no group of economists we can go \nto and tell them to prepare a paper in the next couple of hours to give \nus direction as to what to do. We must do this on our own, and we will \ndo this on our own.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/06/senate-section/article/S1774-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

I am being a little bit futuristic, but between 5 p.m. \nand 7 p.m. today I am confident we will have something to vote on that \nwould be kind of the big picture of what we need to do to move this to \nconference.\n  I would be happy if my colleague, the Republican leader, wishes to \nrespond or to ask any questions or express any concerns that he may \nhave about the schedule. I haven't had the opportunity this morning to \ntalk to him about the schedule.

Mr. President, I have a brief opening statement, and \nthen I will be happy to confer with the majority leader after that, if \nhe is available.\n  From the very first moment of this debate, there has been strong \nbipartisan agreement on one thing: the original version of this bill \nwas too big and too unfocused to work. The President, Senate Democrats, \nand just about every single Senate Republican agreed this bill needed a \nmassive overhaul.\n  One Democratic Senator said he was very committed to making sure we \nget it scrubbed clean of many of these programs. Another Democrat said: \nIt needs some work; it needs some surgery. Virtually everyone agreed \nthis bill lacked focus, didn't create enough jobs, had too much \npermanent Government expansion, and was just way too expensive with the \nnational debt already reaching frightening new dimensions.\n  The morning papers suggest that, in the Senate, these bipartisan \nconcerns persist, and so do the concerns of most Americans. The more \nthe American people learn about the bill, the less they like it. \nAmericans realize a bill which was meant to be timely, targeted, and \ntemporary has instead become a Trojan horse for pet projects and \nexpanded Government.\n  We have a $1 trillion deficit. Our national debt exceeds $10 \ntrillion. Soon we will vote on an Omnibus appropriations bill that will \ncost another $400 billion, bringing the total to $1 trillion for \nappropriations this year alone--a new record. The President is talking \nabout another round of bank bailouts that could cost as much as $4 \ntrillion. When you include interest, the bill before us will cost \nnearly $1.3 trillion.\n  At some point, the taxpayers will have to pay all of this back, and \nthey are worried. Americans can't afford a trillion-dollar mistake, \nhowever well meaning the intent. At this point, that is what many of us \nthink this bill would be.\n  Republicans are ready to support a stimulus bill. That really hasn't \nbeen in question. But we will not support an aimless spending spree \nthat masquerades as a stimulus. The economy is in terrible shape. \nMillions are out of work. This morning's unemployment numbers are a \nfurther sign of the severity of the crisis. But putting another $1 \ntrillion on the Nation's credit card isn't something we should do \nlightly. We need to get a stimulus but, more importantly, we need to \nget it right.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/06/senate-section/article/S1774-4", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

(By 1 yea \n     to 96 nays (Vote No. 50), Senate earlier failed to table the \n     amendment.)\n       Udall amendment No. 359 (to amendment No. 98), to expand \n     the number of veterans eligible for the employment tax credit \n     for unemployed veterans.\n       Coburn amendment No. 309 (to amendment No. 98), to ensure \n     that taxpayer money is not lost on wasteful and \n     nonstimulative projects.\n       Sanders/Grassley modified amendment No. 306, to require \n     recipients of TARP funding to meet strict H-1B worker hiring \n     standard to ensure nondisplacement of U.S. workers.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this morning the Senate returns to work on \nits bill creating and saving millions of jobs. As the leader said, and \nwe all know, our work has rarely been more urgent.\n  Initial jobless claims have hit a 26-year high. I repeat: Initial \njobless claims, 26-year high. Last week, 626,000 people, each of them \nmothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, lost their jobs. That is \ntwo-thirds of the entire State of Montana--626,000 people in 1 \nweek. The number of claims by people continuing to apply for \nunemployment benefits reached a new record. With 4.8 people applying \nfor unemployment benefits, we need to respond. We need to complete this \njobs bill.\n\n  This past November, our Nation conducted a historic and meaningful \nelection. America voted for a new era. America voted for change. In \nkeeping with the call of our new President, the Senate has, this week, \nconducted itself with levels of openness and accommodation not seen for \nyears. I would like to underline that. This has been a very open Senate \nprocess. We have not seen this in a long time and I hope it continues \nand even grows. The managers have not filled the amendment tree. We \nhave not sought to blur issues with second-degree amendments. No tree, \nno second-degree amendments. Senators have gotten votes on their \namendments. The Senate has put in a long, full week and worked late \nnights. Yesterday, the Senate conducted six rollcall votes and adopted \nfive amendments with voice votes and we considered and processed \nnumerous other amendments.\n  We have now reached the point in this debate, in the adage familiar \nto most Senators, that everything has been said but not everyone has \nsaid it. I might underline that everything has been said many times but \nnot everyone has said it. I now call on my colleagues to show \nrestraint. I urge my colleagues to forgo offering amendments. I urge my \ncolleagues to allow the Senate to bring this matter to a close.\n  Pending now are seven amendments: The underlying Finance-\nAppropriations substitute amendment; the Murray amendment, No. 110, to \nstrengthen infrastructure investments; the Dodd amendment, No. 145, \nmitigating home foreclosures; the Coburn amendment, No. 176, on \ncompetitive bidding; the Udall amendment, No. 359, to expand the number \nof veterans eligible for the employment tax credit; the Coburn \namendment, No. 309, on particular spending prohibitions; and the \nSanders-Grassley amendment, No. 306, as modified, to require recipients \nof TARP funding to meet strict H-1B worker hiring standards.\n  I hope that in short order the Senate will be able to come to an \narrangement that will allow us to process the remaining Coburn, Udall \nand Grassley-Sanders amendments. After that, I hope the Senate will be \nable to address amendments by Senators Feingold and Conrad as well as \nthe pending Dodd amendment on our side, as well as equal numbers of \namendments on the Republican side. Then I hope the Senate will be able \nto address amendments by Senators Wyden and Menendez, as well as an \nequal number of amendments on the Republican side.\n  After that, we will seek, as much as possible, to allow a fair system \nfor the consideration of other Senators' amendments. We will address, \nfirst, amendments of Senators who are here and willing to offer their \namendments. But I renew my call for Senators to resist the temptation \nto offer their amendments. We are getting to that point where it is \nbecoming a point of diminishing returns. The amendments are coming to \nthe point where they do not need to be offered on this bill at this \ntime. This is just February. There will be plenty of other \nopportunities for Senators to offer amendments on other bills. We have \nto get this bill finished today. There will be a conference committee. \nThe managers will work with Senators in the conference to address their \nconcerns. Not everything needs to be said by everyone on the Senate \nfloor today. I urge Senators to forbear offering their amendments as \nmuch as possible.\n  We will continue to try to give Senators notice of what will be \ncoming up. Abraham Lincoln appealed to the ``better angels of our \nnature.'' I renew that appeal today. Let us work together today in the \nspirit of comity and cooperation that reflects the better angels of the \nSenate. Let us finish this bill today. I thank all Senators for their \ncooperation.\n  So we can work out an orderly procedure, I now suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nbetween now and 11:30 be for debate only, to be equally divided and \ncontrolled between the two leaders or their designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, what would \nthe manager contemplate at 11:30?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the idea is then to have votes on pending \namendments.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And then would it be agreeable to go back to some more \ndebate? There is a number of speakers who want to talk about the entire \nbill as well.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Well, obviously Senators can speak on those amendments, \nwhich includes the underlying bill. But I would hope we process those \namendments and then do the next set of amendments after that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I do not object.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I object.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I renew my request and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime between now and 11:30 be equally divided and controlled between \nthe two leaders or their designees.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 372\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I do not want to take more than 5 \nminutes, so let me know when 4 minutes is up.\n  I want to talk about an amendment I am going to put in. But, first, I \nthink I ought to remind the public at large that here we are on a \nFriday, there are lots of amendments being adopted. We have been told \ncordially by the majority that they will not fill the tree. But if you \nare in the situation where you have to have unanimous consent to get an \namendment up, it is tantamount to filling the tree. So I hope this \ndeliberative body is going to do what it should be doing. I hope we do \nnot see a bunch of quorum calls all day where the public back at home \nis looking at a blank screen that says ``quorum call'' when the Senate \ncould be working on dozens of amendments we have been waiting to bring \nup for a long period of time,\n\n[[Page S1776]]\n\nbecause that is a waste of the taxpayers' money.\n  If it is extremely important to get on with this legislation, and it \nis extremely important to get on with this legislation, we should not \nbe having anybody talk about stonewalling on any political party's \npart, when we are ready to do business, waiting to do business, have \nbeen waiting to do business, for a long time. We ought to be able to \noffer amendments.\n  I want to speak shortly then about an amendment No. 372. It is not \nthe most important amendment I have been waiting to bring up, but I \nhave spoken about that other amendment before. I want to bring up my \namendment No. 297. This one is 372. It merely says that any agency that \nreceives funds under this bill must comply with congressional requests \nfor records. That means our ability as individual Senators to get \nrecords for money that is going to be spent by Departments under this \nbill. It is an effort to ensure that the vision of transparency that \nPresident Obama expressed in his Inaugural Address to the Nation is \nfulfilled.\n  This is what the President said:\n\n       Those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to \n     account to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our \n     business in the light of the day, because only then can we \n     restore the vital trust between people and their government.\n\n  I agree. Of course, unfortunately, when my colleagues and I in \nCongress ask for documents from the executive branch, we are usually \nstonewalled with bureaucratic excuses and legalese regarding statutes \nthat were never intended to prevent Congress from gathering \ninformation.\n  This is not a criticism of the Obama administration, this is \ncriticism of previous administrations, Republican and Democratic. I \nwant to make sure it does not happen under this new administration. I \ndo not think it will, but this legislation will make that certain.\n  Sometimes even statutes with explicit exceptions allowing information \nto be given to Congress are used as excuses to keep the people's \nbusiness secret. So to ensure that Members of Congress can gather \ninformation, this amendment would simply impose an obligation on any \nagency that receives funds to comply with a request from a chairman or \nranking member of a committee or subcommittee of Congress.\n  If you support open Government, vigorous congressional oversight, as \nPresident Obama says he does, then you should support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 374\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have been talking for a couple of days \nnow about two amendments that if the American people knew we had the \noption to do this, they would be very enthusiastic about joining us.\n  We supposedly have a stimulus bill that should be coming in two \ncategories, one in tax provisions that would stimulate the economy, and \nthe other is in work that needs to be done. I am talking specifically \nabout highways.\n  I am the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. The chairman of the Committee, Senator Barbara Boxer of \nCalifornia, and I have introduced the amendment No. 374. To me it is a \nlittle bit naive to think we would have a bill that only has less than \n3 percent of the money that would actually go to highways and to the \nprojects that are ready, as they call them spade ready. So this would \nincrease that amount to $50 billion. But it is done in a rather unique \nway. The amendment would not take funds, only the funds that would be \nnot obligated within a year up to $50 billion from programs in the \nstimulus that are not spending or redirecting them to highways.\n  Now, I would assume that if something has been hanging around here \nfor 12 months, it is not going to be stimulating the economy \nimmediately. So that is what I want to bring up. I at least want to \nmake an effort--I would hate to think that after all of this we have \ngone through, that I did not even make an effort to get it up.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set the pending amendment aside for the \nconsideration of the Inhofe-Boxer amendment No. 374.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I object. We are under an agreement where \nwe speak on both sides and offer amendments later. So I respectfully \nobject.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 198\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is fine. I think I have 4 minutes left. I had \nanother amendment, which is amendment No. 198.\n  We had a rather unpleasant conversation on the floor yesterday with \nmyself and the junior Senator from West Virginia. It is regrettable \nbecause he would not yield for me to respond to accusations that were \nmade about me. I even suggested a point of order and was turned down.\n  The other amendment I had was one having to do with the subject we \ntalked about yesterday; that is, Guantanamo Bay. I have spent time down \nthere. I will not go on to the same things, because there is not time \nthat is given to me right now.\n  But what has happened, what is happening down there, this resource we \nhave had since 1903, is something we need today. We all know the \nconsequences and certainly even those individuals who want to close \nGuantanamo Bay know if that happened, you would still have to make a \ndecision of what to do with the some 110 detainees who are considered \nto be pretty hard-core terrorists.\n  Some people say they might be integrated into our U.S. court system. \nWe all know the rules of evidence are different and there is a \npossibility they could be released. I do not think anyone wants that. \nThere has been a list of some 17 installations within the United States \nto which these detainees might go. One of those happens to be in my \nState of Oklahoma, Fort Sill. We do not want that to happen. And I do \nbelieve that this is something that we are going to need, so I want to \nat least make the motion.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set the pending amendment aside for the \npurpose of considering amendment No. 198.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Under the agreement, we are going to alternate sides for \nspeakers. I want to ask the Senator from New Hampshire how much time \nshe wishes to speak.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, 3 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 528\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President and fellow Senators, I rise in support of \namendment No. 528, which has been cosponsored by Senator Schumer and \nenjoys the support of many of the Nation's top education groups, \nincluding the American Council on Education, the American Association \nof Colleges for Teacher Education, the National Association of \nIndependent Colleges and Universities, the American Association of \nState Colleges and Universities, the Association of American \nUniversities, and many others.\n  America's institutions of higher education are vital to building a \nskilled workforce and to developing leaders who can compete in the \nglobal marketplace. Unfortunately, many of our colleges and \nuniversities are feeling the effects of the current economic crisis. As \na former Governor, I understand that in these difficult times States \nare often forced to cut back on funding for critical programs such as \neducation.\n  My amendment would provide an additional $2.5 billion to the Higher \nEducation Modernization, Renovation, and Repair portion of the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The additional funds will bring \nthe total appropriation to $6 billion, the same amount as in the House \nbill. It will fund critical projects and instructional equipment at our \ncolleges and universities across the country.\n  This amendment is estimated to create an additional 71,000 jobs. As \nwe talk about this economic package, one of the things we have all been \nfocused on is how do we create jobs. This amendment would do that.\n  According to the National Association of Independent Colleges and \nUniversities, private colleges in 21 States report they have 572 \nprojects ready to\n\n[[Page S1777]]\n\ngo, totaling $4.5 billion. The funding in this amendment is targeted \nfor those shovel-ready projects that will have an immediate impact and \nspur economic growth on the local level. In New Hampshire alone, it \nwill provide an additional $10 million, money that can be spent on \nneeded projects such as rebuilding an arts building at Colby-Sawyer \nCollege, renovating a college and innovation center at White Mountains \nCollege, general infrastructure repair at the University of New \nHampshire, and a science building renovation at Franklin Pierce \nUniversity. This additional funding will benefit students and colleges \nacross the country and put many people to work.\n  I urge Members to join me in support of amendment No. 246.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe American Council on Education that lists those groups in support of \nthe amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                American Council on Education,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 4, 2009.\n     Senator Jeanne Shaheen,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Shaheen: On behalf of the nation's two- and \n     four-year, public and non-profit private colleges and \n     universities, we write in support of the amendment you have \n     offered to H.R. 1, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act \n     of 2009. This amendment would set the amount for \n     infrastructure renovation and repair projects at institutions \n     of higher education at the same level as provided for in the \n     House bill, immediately creating jobs in the short term, and \n     strengthening America's economic future by improving academic \n     capacity.\n       This funding is truly stimulative in nature. Public and \n     private colleges and universities undertake a substantial \n     number of infrastructure projects for academic facilities \n     every year. Because of the high cost of borrowing and sharp \n     declines in state and institutional budgets, many of these \n     projects have been delayed or canceled. As well, a number of \n     colleges have halted shovel-ready projects and frozen staff \n     salaries in order to ensure that they will have more aid for \n     needy families. While this is a prudent strategy, it can have \n     a negative economic impact on local communities, where \n     colleges are often the largest employer.\n       With more than 4,500 campuses across the country, higher \n     education is a strong presence in communities--urban and \n     rural, large and small. These projects have been identified, \n     developed, and are the very definition of ``shovel-ready.'' \n     If provided funding, such an investment would immediately \n     create jobs, boost local and regional economies, and build a \n     lasting improvement to academic capacity at our nation's \n     colleges and universities.\n       In addition to creating an estimated 71,000 new jobs, this \n     amendment would also address the disparities in funding among \n     states identified by the Congressional Research Service in \n     its analysis of the current Senate funding level.\n       We thank you for proposing this amendment and offer our \n     strong support for its inclusion in the final stimulus \n     package.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Molly Corbett Broad,\n                                                        President.\n       On behalf of: American Association of Collegiate Registrars \n     and Admissions Officers, American Association of Community \n     Colleges, American Association of State Colleges and \n     Universities, American Council on Education, Association of \n     American Universities, Council of Graduate Schools, EDUCAUSE, \n     National Association of College and University Business \n     Officers, National Association of Independent Colleges and \n     Universities, National Association of State Universities and \n     Land-Grant Colleges, National Association of Student \n     Financial Aid Administrators, United Negro College Fund.\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendments and send my amendment to the desk to be considered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues, on this \nside we have Senators Thune, Graham, Sessions, Coburn, and Alexander \nwaiting to speak. I would imagine that, given that, between now and \n11:30, hopefully, we could get most of those in between now and the \ntime for voting, of course observing the protocol of those being \nrecognized on the other side of the aisle.\n  While we are here in the Chamber discussing this issue, we all know \ndiscussions are being held behind closed doors between two or three or \nfour Republicans in order to try to get 60 votes in order to pass this \nlegislation. Obviously, the overwhelming majority of Republican \nSenators are opposed to the legislation. That same overwhelming \nmajority of Senators are in favor of stimulating our economy and \ncreating jobs.\n  How did we get here, and where do we go? We got here by the Speaker \nof the House saying: We won, so we wrote the bill. In the years I have \nbeen here, that is not called bipartisanship. Without the votes of 11 \nDemocrats and without the vote of a single Republican, the bill emerged \nfrom the other body and came over here. Again, through the \nAppropriations and Finance Committees, the bill was written without \nsignificant input or with negligible input from Senators on this side \nof the aisle. There is an old saying: If you are not in on the takeoff, \nyou will not be in on the landing.\n  We are up to approximately $1.2 trillion in the piece of legislation \nin front of us. The Congressional Budget Office yesterday said that \nthis legislation would increase employment by the end of the fourth \nquarter of 2010 by 1.3 million to 3.9 million jobs. I did the math. So \n$1.2 trillion, 3 million jobs, is $923,997 for each job. For 1.3 \nmillion jobs, which is the low end determined by the Congressional \nBudget Office, it is only $307,092 per job.\n  The American people are figuring out that this is not a stimulus \nbill. It is a spending bill full of unnecessary spending, unexamined \npolicy changes or policy changes that have been examined and rejected \nin the past, and, of course, tax cuts which do not stimulate the \neconomy.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record examples of the House spending \nprovisions and the Senate spending provisions which I find not only \nquestionable but obviously, in the view of any objective observer, \nunnecessary, unwanted, and, indeed, wasteful.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n      Examples of the House Spending Provisions (Are they really \n                             ``stimulus?'')\n\n       $1.7 billion to make upgrades in the National Park System.\n       $50 million in funding for the National Endowment of the \n     Arts.\n       $650 million to extend the DTV coupon program.\n       $6 billion for broadband and wireless services in \n     underserved areas.\n       $41 billion to local school districts, including a buy \n     American iron and steel requirement on the $14 billion School \n     Modernization and Repair Program.\n       $325 million to establish an ``innovation'' fund for \n     academic achievement awards to states and local education \n     agencies or schools.\n       $726 million for an after school snack program.\n       $39 billion to help unemployed pay for COBRA.\n       $44 million for repairs to USDA headquarters.\n       $209 million for agricultural research facilities.\n       $200 million to ``encourage electric vehicle technologies'' \n     in state and local government motor pools.\n       $600 million for new cars for the Federal government.\n       $300 million to provide rebates for buying energy efficient \n     Energy Star products.\n       $32 billion for energy and transmission system \n     improvements, including $11 billion for the Smart Grid \n     Investment Program.\n       $245 million to upgrade the computer systems at the Farm \n     Service Agency.\n       $200 million to repair and modernize U.S. Geological Survey \n     facilities and equipment.\n       $400 million to NOAA for ``habitat restoration''.\n       $70 million for the ``Technology Innovation Program'' at \n     NIST.\n       $10 billion for science facilities and research.\n       $3 billion for the National Science Foundation, including \n     $100 million to improve instruction in science, math, and \n     engineering.\n       $2 billion for NIH Biomedical Research.\n       $1.5 billion for NIH to renovate university research \n     facilities and help them compete for biomedical research \n     grants.\n       $462 million to enable CDC to complete its Buildings and \n     Facilities Master Plan.\n       $1 billion ``to minimize undercounting of minority groups'' \n     in the 2010 census.\n       $3 billion for a new ``Prevention and Wellness'' fund.\n       $600 million to increase the number of doctors, nurses and \n     dentists.\n       $20 billion for health information technology.\n       $1.1 billion for Amtrak and Intercity Passenger Rail \n     Construction Grants to improve speed and capacity.\n       $500 million to install Aviation Explosive Detection \n     Systems in airports.\n       $1 billion for Community Development Block Grants.\n\n[[Page S1778]]\n\n       $8 billion for loans for renewable energy power generation \n     and transmission projects.\n       $6.7 billion for renovations and repairs to federal \n     buildings.\n       $6.9 billion for Local Government Energy Efficiency Block \n     Grants.\n       $2.5 billion for Energy Efficiency Housing Retrofits.\n       $2 billion for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy \n     Research.\n       $2 billion for the Advanced Battery Loan Guarantee and \n     Grants Program.\n       $6.2 billion for Home Weatherization.\n       $2.4 billion for carbon capture and sequestration \n     technology demonstration projects.\n       $500 million for Industrial Energy Efficiency manufacturing \n     demonstration projects.\n       $300 million for grants and loans to state and local \n     governments for projects that reduce diesel emissions.\n       $98.527 million to support the Comprehensive National \n     Cybersecurity Initiative to prevent and address cyber \n     security threats.\n\n\n                     Examples of Policy Provisions\n\n       Requires TSA to buy 100K employee uniforms from U.S. \n     textile plants.\n       Legislation to give federal workers new whistle-blower \n     protections.\n       An exemption for yacht-repair companies from paying for \n     federal workers' compensation insurance to cover those hurt \n     on the job (an exemption sought for 6 yrs by the Marine \n     Industries Association of South Florida). Inserted by FL \n     Reps. Deborah Wasserman Schultz and Ron Klein.\n       Net neutrality: the bill ``includes language favoring open \n     access--so-called net neutrality--that telecoms have long \n     opposed.''\n       Unemployment: the House language ``secures an expansion of \n     unemployment insurance for part-time workers'' that Dems \n     ``have sought for more than a decade.''\n       Education: ``the stimulus aims more than'' $125B ``at \n     bolstering public education, an unusual federal intervention \n     in a sphere usually left to state and local governments.''\n       Public housing: $5B ``for the construction and repair of \n     public housing. One House GOPer ``depicts it as a quiet \n     reversal of a 30-year trend of the government extracting \n     itself from public housing construction.''\n       Health care: the bill expands COBRA and allows workers \n     older than 55, or those who have worked at a company for 10 \n     years, to keep their COBRA coverage until they qualify for \n     Medicare or find a new job. But ``among the plan's biggest \n     departures'' from past policy is ``allowing those who are \n     unemployed to enroll in Medicaid.'' That provision ``would \n     temporarily expand'' the program ``to allow millions of \n     unemployed workers to qualify for benefits.''\n       $20 Billion to spur the adoption of electronic medical \n     records, which would be, ``by far, the biggest government \n     infusion to enable medical information to follow patients \n     back and forth among doctors' offices, hospitals and other \n     providers.'' Starting in Oct. '10, ``hospitals, doctors and \n     others would be able to get increased payments from Medicare \n     and Medicaid for using such systems.''\n\n\n      Some of the Questionable Funding in the Senate Stimulus Bill\n\n       $20 million ``for the removal of small- to medium-sized \n     fish passage barriers.''\n       $400 million for STD prevention.\n       $25 million to rehabilitate off-roading (ATV) trails.\n       $34 million to remodel the Department of Commerce \n     Headquarters.\n       $70 million to ``Support Supercomputing Activities'' for \n     climate research.\n       $1.4 billion to green HUD assisted housing.\n       $100 million to teach children green construction skills.\n       $20 million for trail repairs in wildlife refuges.\n       $25 million for habitat restoration on wildlife refuges.\n       $198 million for a school food service equipment.\n       $120 million to upgrade WIC computer systems.\n       $23 million for repairs to National park Service trails.\n       $55 million for the Historic Preservation Fund.\n       $40 million to make Park Service offices more energy \n     efficient.\n       $150 million for facility improvements at Smithsonian \n     museums.\n       $75 million for smoking cessation.\n       $88 million for replacement of headquarters of the Health \n     Resources Services Administration.\n       $2.9 billion for the Weatherization Assistance Program.\n       $4.5 billion for Electricity Delivery and Energy \n     Reliability (ie modernizing the electricity grid).\n       $430 million for the DOE Science Program including $330 \n     million for laboratory infrastructure and construction and \n     $100 million is for computer research and development.\n       $1 billion for National Nuclear Security Administration \n     Weapons activities.\n       $20 million is for port modernizations in Guam.\n       $30 million is for water and wastewater infrastructure \n     needs in Guam.\n       $12 million is for electrical transmission line upgrades in \n     Guam.\n       $20 million to develop web-based programs for school lunch \n     programs to manage food orders.\n       $100 million for grants to state to assist with aquaculture \n     losses.\n       $300 million for diesel emission reduction grants.\n       $50 million to fund biomass utilization grants.\n       $100 million to repair Forest Service trails.\n       $20 million for retrofitting BLM offices to make them more \n     energy efficient.\n       $20 million for USGS groundwater wells and surface water \n     stations.\n       $85 million is provided for new USGS research equipment.\n       $25 million for abandoned mine site remediation on forest \n     lands.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The distinguished majority leader mentioned that \neconomists like Marty Feldstein said we need a stimulus. He certainly \ndid. He later said this was not the stimulus we need. There are a large \nnumber of economists saying that what we are doing is what I know we \nare doing, and that is to lay an unacceptable multitrillion-dollar debt \non future generations. If the purpose of this legislation is to create \njobs and get the economy going, why did we reject the trigger amendment \nyesterday which got 44 votes which said: Once we have two quarters of \npositive GDP growth, we are required to embark on spending cuts to stop \nmortgaging our children's futures.\n  If we keep running up these debts, history shows that we will have \ndebased the currency, printed more money. Hyperinflation takes place, \nwhich is, obviously, the greatest enemy of the middle class.\n  There are provisions such as the ``Buy American'' provision, Davis-\nBacon, a number of other provisions in the bill which have nothing to \ndo with jobs, nothing to do with stimulating the economy. In fact, \nDavis-Bacon and ``Buy American'' mean additional costs to the taxpayer.\n  The President, last night, speaking to the Democrats, said:\n\n       So then you get the argument this is not a stimulus bill. \n     This is a spending bill. What do you think a stimulus is? \n     That's the whole point.\n\n  The whole point is to enact tax cuts and spending measures that truly \nstimulate the economy. There are billions and tens of billions of \ndollars in this bill which will have no effect within 3, 4, 5 or more \nyears, or ever. We are talking about a lot of money.\n  I used to come to the floor and object to provisions that were \nthousands of dollars, then hundreds of thousands of dollars, then \nmillions--$50 million in funding for the National Endowment for the \nArts. All of us are for the arts. Tell me how that creates any \nsignificant number of jobs. An afterschool snack program is probably a \ngood idea. Do we really want to spend $726 million on it?\n  Here we are. My other colleagues want to speak, and so I will be \nspeaking later on. It is important that others do as well. But here we \nare. We are in a situation where the overwhelming majority of \nRepublicans--in fact, all--voted for both the trigger amendment and for \nour alternative, which was $421 billion in spending. There are behind-\nthe-scenes negotiations going on so that they can try to pick off two \nor three Republicans. You cannot call a bill bipartisan if it has two \nor three or four or even five Republicans out of 535 Members of \nCongress. You can call it an agreement, but you cannot call it a \nbipartisan agreement. That is not what the American people want today. \nYes, unemployment is up to 7.6 percent. The American people expect us \nto sit down together.\n  I see the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, the Senator \nfrom North Dakota. He probably knows as much about budget issues and \nspending as anybody. My recommendation is that he and others be \nappointed by both leaders to sit down in a room so that we can come out \nwith a bipartisan agreement. That means leadership. That means \ninvolvement, not just of a couple or three who may be in some respects \nnot reflective of the whole 41 Republican Members of the Senate.\n  Maybe we have to go back to square one. Maybe we should go back to \nthe beginning because it was flawed when it began, when the authors of \nthis legislation from the House said: We won, so we wrote the bill. \nThat is not bipartisanship.\n  I urge both Senator McConnell and Senator Reid to appoint a group of \nSenators to sit down together and hash this out. We share the same \ngoal, the same goal of stimulating this economy and creating jobs. We \nrealize we have to spend money to do it. But we also realize--most of \nus should realize--that if we mortgage our children's future, they \nalready have a $10 trillion debt; this is another trillion. There is \ngoing\n\n[[Page S1779]]\n\nto be an Omnibus appropriations bill coming down the pike. There is \ngoing to have to be a TARP 3. We are looking at spending as far as we \ncan see for which we do not have revenues.\n  We can have a modest--I say modest, I take that back. We can have a \nbill that is $400 or $500 billion. We can have a bill that truly \nstimulates this economy, with tax cuts that, in the view of economists, \ndo create jobs, not a one-time injection of sending people a check. \nThat didn't work the last time we did it under the previous \nadministration.\n  I urge colleagues not to send a message to the American people that \nwe have come out with a bill with 3 or 4 Republicans out of 535 Members \nof Congress. Let's try to sit down one more time, all of us, and come \nout with something that truly creates jobs, truly stimulates the \neconomy, and restores the faith and confidence and trust of the \nAmerican people in the Congress, which has badly eroded and is at \nhistoric lows. These are tough times. Let's act tough for a change and \nget something done, rather than have some partisan result which the \nAmerican people--certainly a significant percentage--will resoundingly \nreject because it does not have fiscal responsibility.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the chairman for his extraordinary effort and the \neffort of the chairman of the Appropriations Committee.\n  Maybe now is the time we need to have calm reflection on where we are \nand where we are headed. All of us know this economy is in desperately \nserious trouble. We had a report this morning. Nearly 600,000 jobs were \nlost in the previous month. That means in the last 4 months we have \nlost more than 2 million jobs. All indications are that we will lose \nmillions more jobs in this economy.\n  What must be done? Clearly, we need an economic recovery package. \nThere would be virtually unanimous agreement on that fundamental point.\n  What works? Allen Sinai of Decision Economics ran models with his \nwell-regarded econometric model that showed the things that work the \nbest. The fastest is government purchases of goods and services. The \nsecond thing that worked the best was transfer payments to States \nbecause States are otherwise going to cut their budgets.\n  Why do those things work the best? Because they inject money into the \neconomy the most rapidly and in a way that there is the greatest \nassurance that the money is spent. That is what is the key to a short-\nterm stimulus. Why? Because if we think about it, demand in the economy \nis falling. That is why GDP is dropping. That is why joblessness is \nincreasing. What do we do about it? We can't expect consumers to change \ncourse because they are worried about losing their jobs. We can't \nexpect corporations to increase demand because their orders are \nfalling. The only place to look for an increase in aggregate demand is \nto the Federal Government.\n  That then raises the question: What is the most effective way for the \nFederal Government to deploy its precious taxpayer dollars to give \nshort-term lift to the economy but not to burden us with increased debt \nlooking ahead?\n  That is why the first tests that were applied to this package were \nthat it be timely--that is, that it go into effect quickly--that it be \ntargeted on things that have the most bang for the buck, and that it be \ntemporary so it does not create a bow wave going forward that increases \ndeficits and debt when the economy, we hope, will be in recovery.\n  With that said, we also need to remember the lessons of the past. In \nthe Great Depression, Roosevelt took action in the 1930s to provide \nstimulus to the economy. Unemployment was at 25 percent. By 1937, \nunemployment was down to 12 percent. The stimulus was working. Then \nthey tried to balance the budget in 1937, and unemployment went back up \nto 19 percent.\n  So we have to be very careful about when we pivot and move back to \nreducing the deficit and the debt. There is nobody who is more acutely \naware of how important it is we address those long-term fiscal issues \nthan I am. I think anybody who has followed my career for 22 years here \nwould know I am very concerned about long-term debt.\n  Let's analyze this package. This package--now approximately $925 \nbillion--79.3 percent of it spends out in the first 2 years. Now, that \nis before we added a few things on the floor. So the numbers might \nchange a little bit, but that is roughly right: about 80 percent in the \nfirst 2 years. That means 20 percent is not in the first 2 years. So I \nsubmit to my colleagues, the first kind of test, the first kind of \nscreen we should apply is that one. But that is not dispositive because \nthere are certain investments we are going to make that have long-term \npayoffs for the American people, such as computerizing the health \nrecords of the American people, such as--and I would put this at the \ntop of the list--improving the electrical grid for America.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if I could have an additional 30 seconds \nto close.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield the Senator 30 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the chairman.\n  Let me say it is critically important we take action. It has to be on \na rational basis. It has to have criteria that apply to this package, \nthat will stand the light of day. But at the end of the day, we must \nact.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues have already \nnoted, the jobs numbers today were very bleak and should cause great \nconcern for all of us as we look at steps we can take to get this \neconomy growing again. But that is why the CBO report that came out \nyesterday also is so troubling because it indicated the Democratic \nproposal, the stimulus plan before us, would create as few as 1.3 \nmillion jobs--as many as 3.9 million, to be fair, but as few as 1.3 \nmillion jobs. Well, a trillion dollars is a terrible price to pay for a \nbill that may create as few as 1.3 million jobs over, I might add, a 2-\nyear period.\n  It also went on to say, the CBO report did, that it would reduce the \nGDP growth in the outyears. So not only does it create potentially a \nvery small amount of jobs--1.3 million over a 2-year period--but it \nalso diminishes the amount of GDP growth we would experience in later \nyears.\n  Now, if it, in fact, does create only 1.3 million jobs, if this \ntrillion dollar plan--again, all based on borrowing from future \ngenerations--does create as few as 1.3 million jobs, if you do the \narithmetic on that, if you spend $1 trillion, and you only create a \nlittle over a million jobs, that is $800,000 per job. Try and think \nabout how you can convince your constituents back in your home States \nabout the need to spend $800,000 to create a single job.\n  I mentioned this yesterday, but I will repeat it again: For the \npeople in my State of South Dakota, the average annual salary is about \n$30,000 per year. So to think about spending $800,000 to create a job \nis something that is going to be very hard to accept for a lot of \npeople around this country, which is why I believe, and so many people \naround the country are rallying and saying, this is the wrong direction \nin which to head.\n  I happen to agree with that assessment, and I think there are some \nthings that could be done that would make this process more fair in \nterms of including ideas that Republicans have to put forward but, more \nimportantly, to get a product that is more effective--more effective--\nat creating jobs at a lower cost.\n  Now, many of us have tried to improve this bill. I supported a McCain \namendment yesterday, a comprehensive approach that is much better in \nterms of addressing the issue and much better focused in terms of job \ncreation at about half the cost of the underlying bill, the majority \nbill we are debating today. So we tried to make this bill more focused \nand more fiscally responsible. I think putting the focus and the \nemphasis on job creation is the right place to be. But many of the \nefforts we have made to that end have failed. We have also offered \namendments to cut much of the wasteful spending out of this bill, most \nof which have been defeated.\n  So what I have sort of concluded is, as much as we tried to make this \na better bill by cutting wasteful spending,\n\n[[Page S1780]]\n\nby making the focus on job creation, by trying to reduce taxes on small \nbusinesses and middle-income taxpayers, which would get more money back \ninto the economy, and emphasize less spending on Government programs in \nWashington, DC, where the bulk of this is committed, that is a much \nbetter approach, and many of our amendments have been focused in that \ndirection. But, as I said, none have been accepted.\n  I have one more amendment I have filed and I hope to have an \nopportunity to call up. It is sort of a last-ditch effort to bring some \nreason to this whole debate. But what it essentially would do is take \nthe total cost of the Democratic bill--about $900 billion without \ninterest; $900 billion, when you add in the interest costs, as I said \nbefore, you get up to about $1.2 trillion or north of that, all of \nwhich is borrowed money, borrowed from future generations--but take \nthat total amount of $900 billion and divide it by every tax filer in \nthis country--anybody who files an income tax in this country--and \nbasically write them a check.\n  Now, it is probably surprising to most of us here what you could do \nwith that. But for an average individual filing a tax return in this \ncountry, you could write them a check for $5,143; for a couple filing \njointly, $10,286.\n  Now, to be fair, I also wrote the amendment so anybody making more \nthan $250,000 a year would not be eligible. I tried to make this so you \ncannot argue this is a tax cut for the rich. So anybody who makes more \nthan $250,000 would not be eligible. All filers who have under $250,000 \nin taxable income would be eligible under this amendment. You could \nactually write a check to an individual filing for $5,143 dollars; and \nto a couple filing jointly, a check for $10,286.\n  I think that is a lot of money in most people's family incomes and it \nmakes a lot more sense, in my judgment, than spending $900 billion on \nprograms that many of us know will not work, creating new bureaucracies \nin Washington, DC, at a very high cost per job. As I said, if the CBO \nnumbers are right on the low end--1.3 million new jobs--and you divide \nthat, do the arithmetic on that, you are talking, in round numbers, \nabout $800,000 per job. What kind of sense does that make?\n\n  It is pretty clear, in my opinion, and I think in the opinion of most \nof the American people, this is very misdirected in terms of the \nmission of this whole thing. The intention is great, but the substance \nof this particular piece of legislation is very flawed.\n  I would add one last thing; that is, we talk about economic models \nand analysis and methodology, but the President's own chief economic \nadviser put together a methodology about a year ago--a little over a \nyear ago--that said for every dollar of tax cuts you get a multiplier \nof 2.2 percent increase in GDP. So if you cut taxes by a dollar, GDP \nincreases by 2.2 times.\n  It seems to me, at least, that you can take that methodology--and it \nseems intuitive to most Americans--when you reduce their taxes, middle-\nincome families' taxes and taxes on small businesses, which create the \njobs in this country, you get a much better outcome in terms of GDP \ngrowth, in job creation, than sending a bunch of money into Government \nprograms here in Washington, DC, many of which, I might add, are new \nprograms that will not get up and be started for a very long time. \nThere will be a tail on them. As a consequence, you will not see the \nresult in the short period of time we are trying to target here--the \ntemporary approach to this--that actually creates jobs and helps pull \nus out of the economic crisis we are in.\n  That is an amendment I have filed. It takes that total amount--$900 \nbillion--breaks it down on a per-filer basis, and if you are an \nindividual filing, you can get a check for $5,143, and if you are a \ncouple filing jointly, you can get a check for $10,286.\n  But I wish to see us approach this in a different way. A lot of \namendments, as I said, have been offered--some good alternatives. The \nMcCain alternative we voted on yesterday makes a lot of sense to me. It \ndoes it at about half the cost, and is a lot more effective at creating \njobs. That was defeated, as have been all the other amendments we have \noffered to make this more fiscally responsible, more focused, and more \ntargeted on job creation.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nHawaii.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 309\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to express my concerns about \namendment No. 309 offered by the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Senator Coburn's provision prohibits spending any of the funds in the \nbill for casinos, golf courses, swimming pools, and other recreational \nfacilities. I think we can all agree these sound like laudable goals. I \nunderstand on its face this amendment would seem logical. But I want \nthe Senate to understand what it means as it applies to this measure.\n  Some of my colleagues might wonder why the House included this \nprovision in this bill, and why we do not think it makes sense. The \nHouse included $1 billion for the Community Development Block Grant \nProgram. Under that program, funds go straight to the cities, and \nmayors determine how to spend the funds.\n  When the Conference of Mayors presented their views to the country's \nleadership on how to stimulate the economy, the No. 1 program they were \nhoping to have funded was CDBG. But that program does not have \nsufficient safeguards. It can be used to construct recreational \nswimming pools or aquariums or to support museums. On occasion, CDBG \nfunds have been used for programs which some would say had questionable \nmerit.\n  To ensure that the Senate would not be supporting questionable \nprograms, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended no funds for \nthis program--no funds for CDBG. The House recognized that CDBG funds \nmight be used inappropriately if there were no prohibitions on \nquestionable programs, so it included the provision which Senator \nCoburn wants attached to this bill.\n  We do not need to include the provision because we do not have CDBG \nfunding in this bill. The mayors are precluded from funding the \nprojects prohibited by the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma. The \nSenate is already protected from possible abuse by denying the funding \nfor the program.\n  But let me offer another example of how the committee ensured that \nlocal funds could not be used unwisely. In the bill, the committee has \nincluded $2.5 billion for the Neighborhood Stabilization Program which \nis designed to improve blighted neighborhoods. However, it is true that \non occasion funds for this program had been used for community \ndevelopment of questionable merit. To avoid that problem, the \nAppropriations Committee recommended bill language under the \nNeighborhood Stabilization Program which only allows the funds to be \nused for replacement of housing. This limitation means the funds cannot \nbe used to build community centers or swimming pools.\n\n  We support the idea behind the amendment but not the amendment. \nFirst, we have not provided funds for programs which can be used \nfrivolously. Second, there are no earmarks in this bill. Third, there \nis no CDBG money in this bill. Fourth, the housing programs cannot be \nused for frivolous purposes.\n  Members might argue that you could include this amendment as an \nadditional safeguard. Well, consider this one example: Among other \nthings, the amendment would prohibit construction of swimming pools--no \nexceptions to that. We might all say we agree with that, but it should \nbe noted we do not direct the construction of any particular swimming \npool because that would be an earmark. Well, now comes the crunch. \nHowever, this bill contains $3.4 billion for needed construction of new \nand infrastructure innovation and repairs at existing VA hospitals. \nUnder the terms of this provision, the Veterans' Administration would \nnot be able to spend any of their infrastructure funding provided to \nthe Department on construction or renovation or therapeutic swimming \npools at spinal cord injury centers, trauma centers, and other VA \nmedical centers. These are very essential to the rehabilitation of \nthese wounded warriors.\n\n[[Page S1781]]\n\n  The Appropriations Committee is aware the VA has plans for many \nlegitimate construction projects, such as pools specifically used for \nmedical rehabilitation of wounded soldiers. These are not swimming \npools for the VA staff, but they would nonetheless be prohibited by \nthis amendment.\n  While I am confident this was not the intent of the amendment, it \nmost certainly could be the result. It is not the only example. Should \nour military be denied from building recreational facilities? Should \nthe Coast Guard be told not to build swimming pools where they practice \ntraining exercises? We expect these men to dive into cold waters in the \nArctic Sea and rescue men and women, so they need special training. Do \nwe want to argue that no funds be made available for fixing aging \nbuildings that are ready to crumble?\n  This amendment is a solution in search of a problem, and let's not \nforget the amendment causes problems. If adopted, this amendment would \ndeny our wounded veterans the physical therapy they need and deserve, \nand it could deny other needed programs to support training and quality \nof life for our military forces and their families. I sincerely \nrecommend we vote down this amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I see my colleague from South Carolina; \nperhaps he is ahead of me. If he is, I would be pleased to yield to \nhim.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Just for 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  The minority controls 1\\1/2\\ minutes at this point.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. A minute and a half.\n  Well, we are at a crossroads for a minute and a half.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, if the \ndistinguished manager would agree, for 5 minutes for the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, or we will go after the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time for \ndebate equally divided be extended until 12 noon and add in the other \ntime to be equally divided, so on that basis, there is more on this \nside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, I wish to thank the \nmanager of the bill for his generosity. I do not object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to thank Chairman Baucus and \nSenator McCain. I don't have anything Earth shattering to say. I do \nappreciate the additional time.\n  We are in on Friday. I think this is good for the country that we \nhave slowed this process a bit. It is not good for the country if we \ndon't act. The jobless rate is going up so we need to stimulate the \neconomy. Count me in for doing that. However, we don't need a headline \nthat says we rushed through $1 trillion in spending that would not \nstimulate the economy in an effective way but will run up the debt, \nwhich is already way too high.\n  I think we are at a crossroads, if I may say so, about how we \nproceed, not just on this bill but as a Congress and as a nation. I \nthink there are plenty of people over here--I can't give you a number; \npeople asked me about numbers--who would like to find a way through a \nbetter process to create a bill that would stimulate the economy in a \nreal way, through spending and tax cuts, and if it doesn't help the \neconomy in 2 years from a tax cut point of view or a spending point of \nview, then I would argue it doesn't meet the goal of stimulating the \neconomy. The spending may be worthwhile, but if it hits 3, 4, 5 years \nfrom now, then I think we missed the boat because we are not here to \nspend money blindly. We are here to stimulate the economy so the \njobless rates don't go up.\n  I think my dear friend from North Dakota gets this. There are tax \ncuts that may need to be looked at. I believe we need to do more than \ncut taxes, but we need a strategy. To me, the goal should be to get it \ninto the economy within 2 years. If you can do that through tax cuts \nand spending, that is the place to start. There are some items that are \nlong-term investments that would fit within 2 years but maybe could be \ntaken out and put in a separate bill because what is going to happen \nnext is the administration is going to ask us for hundreds of billions \nof dollars on top of the TARP money to generate support for the banking \nand financial sector, and they would be right to do so. So every dollar \nwe can focus in this bill to creating jobs in the short term through \ntax cuts and spending, and take these other long-term items out, is \nmore money we can put into housing and banking.\n  I don't think most Americans realize this is a three-legged approach \nin that the stimulus package is just one piece of the puzzle. Quite \nfrankly, it is the piece of the puzzle that is hard politically that \ndoes probably the least for our overall economic problems. If we don't \nfix housing and get credit flowing, we can flow all the money in the \nworld into a stimulus package. Let's don't throw any more good money \nafter bad.\n  We know we have to fix housing. We know we have to do something with \nbanking. When we talk about banking, we are talking about a hard sell, \ngiven the reputation of what has happened in TARP, for any Republican \nor Democrat to come back to the public and say: Give us some more money \nto fix banking. They are going to say: What the heck did you do with \nthe money we gave you before? We have a crisis of confidence growing.\n  So we are at a crossroads. I want bipartisanship. I couldn't agree \nmore with Senator McCain. He is a man who has walked the walk when it \ncomes to bipartisanship. He has taken a lot of criticism--so have I--\nfor reaching across the aisle on emotional issues to find common \nground. We don't have a process in place that reflects a way to get \ntrue bipartisanship. Just picking off a few votes is not going to solve \nour Nation's problems. We need strong bipartisan support for a stimulus \npackage that is targeted and focused on creating jobs in the near term \nbecause we are going to need strong bipartisan support to ask for more \nmoney for banking and housing.\n  Let's don't blow it here. Let's don't spend this goodwill that this \nnew administration has. I want to help this new President be successful \nin areas where our country needs to be successful. I am not talking \nabout tax cuts ideologically; I am talking about a focused plan to \njumpstart the economy through a stimulus bill that will draw \nbipartisanship. That is not where we are. The public wants us to be \nsmart, and they want us to work together. The product we have now is, \nin my opinion, not smart, and the process we created beginning in the \nHouse is not allowing us to work together. We have a chance to turn it \naround. Let's take advantage of it. Let's get it right so we can come \nback together to the public and fix housing and banking. If we mess it \nup with the stimulus package, if we split in different camps and we \ncreate a bill the public doesn't support on the stimulus package, we \nare going to ruin our ability as Members of Congress and the new \nadministration to fix the entire economy.\n  We are at a crossroads. Slow down, get it right. I yield back.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and the chairman of \nthe committee very much. I wish to talk today about an amendment I am \nhoping to offer. It is amendment No. 480. It relates to the funding of \nour national public land management agencies so they can create jobs \nand do the important work that needs to be done in their various \njurisdictions.\n  We have had a lot of talk about how it is important that we focus the \nfunds we have in this legislation on jobs that can be created quickly. \nWe have had lots of talk about how we need to focus these resources on \nthe real needs of the country and jobs where we can actively monitor \nthe decisions that are made so we know that the money is not being \nwasted. In my view, this amendment does all of those things. It is a \nproposal to add an additional $2.5 billion to funding for the National \nPark Service, for the Forest Service, for the Fish and Wildlife \nService, for the Bureau of Land Management, and for the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs to carry out the critical land and resource management\n\n[[Page S1782]]\n\nprojects they have identified that need to be carried out on our public \nlands.\n  Fourteen Senators joined me in cosponsoring the amendment: my \ncolleague, Senator Udall of New Mexico, Senator Boxer, Senator Wyden, \nSenator Merkley, Senator Cantwell, Senator Murray, Senator Baucus, \nSenator Tester, Senator Levin, Senator Stabenow, as well as Senators \nKerry, Leahy, Schumer, and Senator Udall from Colorado.\n  Now, the estimates we have from the various public land management \nagencies are that this additional funding would allow them to create an \nadditional 45,000 jobs between now and the end of the next fiscal year; \nthat is, the end of September of 2010. I have heard a lot of criticism \nthat the cost per job of this proposed legislation is too much, and I \nhave heard the $800,000-per-job figure thrown around. When you look at \nthis, all the figures I have indicated that we are talking about \n$56,000 per job for this next 2-year period. These jobs are vitally \nneeded and can be carried out quickly.\n  Let me give some examples of what I am talking about and what I think \ncould be done with this extra funding. One example in the National Park \nService is we need to complete the stabilization construction for the \nseawall at Ellis Island and the asbestos removal at the Statue of \nLiberty National Monument. These are projects that are underway but \ndon't have adequate funding to be completed. We need to repair trails \nat Olympic National Park. We need to replace substandard employee \nhousing at Grand Canyon National Park. I am sure my colleagues from \nArizona will recognize, having seen that substandard housing, that \nwould be a good use of public funds. We need funding for road repair \nand replacement at Bandelier National Monument in my home State of New \nMexico.\n  As far as Forest Service funding goes, much more funding is needed to \nthin the forests to reduce wildfire fuels and restore forest health. \nThis thinning work is labor intensive. It is work that requires \nchainsaw crews and heavy-equipment operators. These people are out of \nwork today. These people can be put to work very quickly doing this \nimportant work, and this forest thinning work protects our communities \nthat are located near these national forests from wildfires.\n  The Bureau of Land Management has a tremendous amount of work that \nneeds to be done with regard to reclaiming abandoned oil and gas wells \nand mine sites. In my State alone, we have 8,000 acres that are covered \nwith abandoned oil wells and hundreds of abandoned mines waiting for \nreclamation funding. Again, there are contractors and there are workers \nwho are anxious to have this work, if we would just fund it.\n\n  Regarding State and tribal wildlife grants, there are examples in my \nhome State where we need to install fish screens, replace culverts, and \nwe need to work in the Rio Grande area to restore cutthroat trout \nhabitat, and much work can be accomplished there.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that if we want to put \npublic funds into work that is important to the public and if we want \nto put public funds into projects that can create jobs quickly and \nstimulate the economy through that effort, I believe this amendment is \nideally designed to accomplish that. I hope very much that my \ncolleagues will support it.\n  There has been a lot of talk about how we need to reduce the size of \nthis overall legislation. I don't agree with that. Virtually all of the \neconomists--conservative and liberal--have all said, if anything, this \nlegislation is too small as it currently stands. But whatever the size \nof the legislation, this is the kind of job-creation funding in which \nwe ought to be engaging. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor 7 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask to be notified at 7 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, unemployment is rising, and it was not a \ngood month. We saw those numbers today, but it was not higher than \npeople have been expecting. But it is a very serious thing to have \nunemployment rising as it is, and we know it will continue to rise. I \nbelieve there are things we in Congress can do to help confront this \nproblem.\n  My Democratic colleagues are so committed to this legislation and \nsaying this bill will save and create jobs and it must be passed now \nand there can be no serious alteration in it. The question really is, \nfor the American people, what is in the national interest? What will \nserve this country best both now and in the long run? What is the best \ninformation we have to make realistic decisions? Finally, will the \nprojections we are hearing here actually work? Just to say the bill \nwill create jobs is not enough for us in Congress. We are not experts \nin all of this. We do have some experts we rely on, but we need to look \nat it carefully.\n  According to our Congressional Budget Office, in a letter written to \nBudget Committee Ranking Member Judd Gregg, whom the President has \nasked to serve as his Secretary of Commerce--dated February 4--\nremember, this is a bipartisan organization, and we rely on it for \nreliable data. We depend on it for objective advice. The new leader of \nCBO was selected in a bipartisan way. Our Democratic colleagues clearly \nhave a majority in the Senate, and they would not have approved the \nnominee if they didn't think he was a qualified person.\n  What did he say just yesterday? This is the truth, I think:\n\n       The Senate legislation would raise output and lower \n     unemployment for several years.\n\n  We certainly hope so. We don't want to spend a lot of money and not \nget any unemployment easing.\n  Then it goes on to say:\n\n       In the longer run, the legislation would result in a slight \n     decrease in the gross domestic product (GDP), compared with \n     CBO's baseline economic forecast.\n\n  The baseline economic forecast is without any stimulus package. We \ndon't have any stimulus package under current law. The baseline without \nthe stimulus package indicates it would do better over 10 years than if \nwe passed this bill. I know we are not running for election 10 years \nfrom now; we are running for election today, some people seem to think. \nBut I believe we have a responsibility to the long-term interests of \nthis country. It is stunning to me that this report says that over 10 \nyears, it would be a net negative. And GDP means jobs. If GDP is down--\ngross domestic product, which is all the goods and services produced in \nthe country--if that is down, jobs are down. If GDP is up, jobs are up.\n  What else does the letter say? It says this:\n\n       The macroeconomic impact of any economic stimulus program \n     is very uncertain.\n\n  So we don't know for certain whether we will get any impact at all.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       For those reasons, some economists remain skeptical that \n     there would be any significant effects, while others expect \n     very large ones.\n\n  Quoting from the letter again:\n\n       According to these estimates, implementing the Senate \n     legislation . . . would also increase employment at that \n     point of time [the fourth quarter of 2010, when we would \n     expect the results to be most pronounced] by 1.3 to 3.9 \n     million jobs.\n\n  Well, Senator McCain has already explained to us that he has run the \nnumbers on that. This is what it would be. The bill is scored at $1.2 \ntrillion-plus, and with additions, we think it is $1.27 trillion, one \nand a quarter, which is the largest spending package in the history of \nthis country or any country, in the history of the world, and much \nlarger than anything that has ever been approached. The entire 5-year \nIraq war has cost around $500 billion, just to give some perspective.\n  How much would that be per job? It would add 1.3 million jobs, \naccording to CBO. That is on the low end of the estimate. At that \nnumber and a $1.2 trillion deficit--remember, the bill is about $888 \nbillion, but with the CBO scoring, the interest on that over the 10-\nyear budget window, that means it would be $1.2 trillion-plus. So \nSenator McCain worked it out at $1.2 trillion. If you divide that out \nat 1.3 million jobs, it turns out to be about $765,000 per job. That is \njust plain mathematics. They\n\n[[Page S1783]]\n\nsay we are going to create jobs and the cost will come out on the lower \nend to about $765,000 per job. If you assume it creates jobs on the \nhigh end, 3.9 million jobs, it would be $255,000 per job.\n  This is just not good legislation, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 7 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nadditional minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the problem here is that this is not \ngood legislation. For the rest of our lifetime, this $1.2 trillion \ndebt--I think now really $1.27 trillion--will be a burden on our \nchildren for years to come, indefinitely. Every penny of this spending \nis debt. We are already in debt, so we are spending on top of our debt. \nThere is no way we can deny that. It is just not responsible. A \nsmaller, more targeted program, designed to spend out in 2 years, \ncreate jobs in an effective way, is something I think we can all \nsupport. This legislation--I truly believe we should not do it. I urge \nmy colleagues to study it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used his time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Am I correct that, \nfor the benefit of our colleagues, now the votes will be put off until \n1?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we may have to \nput off votes until 1 o'clock. That is not determined yet, but there is \na high probability of that. Around noon, we will ask for an agreement \nto speak for another hour.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the manager. I tell my colleagues that if it \nlooks as if we will not vote until 1, there will be time to come over \nand speak.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That will be the case.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. I thank him for \nhis good work on this legislation.\n  I have come to the floor to ask that the pending amendment be set \naside, and I ask for consideration of my amendment No. 201, which I \nhave at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, despite the objection, I hope to have \nthe opportunity later in the day to include this important amendment in \nthe bill. This amendment is cosponsored by Senator Bennett, Senator \nHatch, and Senator Kohl.\n  I first note that my amendment doesn't cost anything. It doesn't add \nany money to this bill. In fact, it saves money in the long term. My \namendment represents a bipartisan effort to strengthen an important \npart of the bill, which is the health information technology part of \nthe bill.\n  As we know, technology has transformed our country. I am encouraged \nthat this legislation we are working on would develop a national health \ninformation technology system and create over 200,000 new jobs doing \nit. If implemented thoughtfully, health information technology has the \npotential to reduce waste, rein in costs, stimulate innovation, and \nimprove quality.\n  As you know, Mr. President, Minnesota is a leader in the health care \ncommunity across this country, with the Mayo Clinic and countless other \nhospitals and clinics in our State. We have been recognized for the \nmeasured quality outcomes that have resulted from effective information \ntechnology implementation. So we know what we are doing in Minnesota.\n  In this bill, there are, as I mentioned, very good provisions for the \ndevelopment of health information technology. There are also some \nprivacy provisions, which are necessary and which I support. We \nrecently had a hearing on these provisions in the Judiciary Committee. \nOut of that hearing came this amendment. One of the things we \nrecognized was that one of the privacy provisions, which is well-\nmeaning, would have the effect of making it hard to collect data to \nimprove the quality of care, which is something Mayo Clinic does so \nwell. One example: You will save $50 billion in 4 years in this country \nin taxpayer Medicare spending if every hospital used the protocol Mayo \nClinic has used for the last 4 years for chronically ill patients. The \nreason they can do that is they collect data, so they know what the \nprotocol should be.\n  My amendment ensures that the quality assessment research necessary \nto improving our health care system is preserved.\n  As the bill currently stands, all forms of health care operations are \nsubject to regulations to be put forth by the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services. These regulations have the potential to impose varying \nlevels of restriction on the ability of doctors and nurses to share \ninformation.\n  While I support requiring authorization and the use of de-\nidentifiable data in many areas of the health care system, subjecting \nquality assessment activities to these regulations has the potential to \nlimit patient care and clinic research. That is the last thing we want \nto do now, as we are looking at collecting that information to spread \nthese protocols across the country to get better assessments of what \nhigh-quality care means. That is why Senator Hatch and Senator Bennett \nare cosponsoring this amendment with me.\n  I also note that this is supported by the American Hospital \nAssociation, as well as the Association of Medical Colleges.\n  With the United States spending $2.3 trillion per year on health \ncare, we must bring an end to the inefficiencies of the system. We need \nthe information--well-intentioned in the bill--but we must make sure \nthe work going on to share information continues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, at the conclusion of my remarks, I am going \nto ask unanimous consent to print in the Record some recent op-eds. I \nwould like to quote from some of them because they reflect the emerging \nconsensus of experts around the country as to what this so-called \nstimulus package is all about and what the results of it will be.\n  A couple of these I wish to talk about because they are from unlikely \nsources in the political spectrum. One might assume, for example, that \nthe Washington Post would be very supportive of moving forward with a \nso-called stimulus bill. But this morning in the Washington Post, there \nis a pretty significant question raised and a concern raised about \nwhether the bill should move forward as it is.\n  I am advised that because of the division of the time, rather than 15 \nminutes remaining, the Republicans have only 1 minute. That probably \nmeans I have about 30 seconds. What I will do, if we do extend the time \nas the manager indicated after noon, I will conclude my remarks at that \ntime, or if the Senator has some time now.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nbetween 12 p.m. and 1 p.m. be equally divided between Democrats and \nRepublicans for debate only.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator may continue.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the Democratic whip getting that \ncleared for everybody's sake and also for permitting me to continue to \nspeak. I appreciate it.\n  This Washington Post editorial quotes the President, first of all, \ncontending that the opponents of this bill are peddling the same failed \ntheories that helped lead us into this crisis.\n  I am one who is very skeptical about this bill. I am not quite sure \nwhat the President is accusing me of. What we asked is that a program \nbe built from the bottom up that would be targeted at helping people \nwho are in need, that would be targeted at helping to create jobs in a \nquick way, that will actually quickly create jobs that could stimulate \nthe economy and that will not put a burden on future budgets and on \nfuture taxpayers by creating new permanent programs and mandatory \nspending that takes a long time to spend out.\n  The Post then goes on to criticize the attempt of the President to \npin on all\n\n[[Page S1784]]\n\nof the opponents some ideological objection. As it notes:\n\n       . . . Ideology is not the only reason that senators--from \n     both parties--are balking at the president's plan. As it \n     emerged from the House, it suffered from a confusion of \n     objectives.\n\n  Here is the point I wish to emphasize. When the President talked not \nmerely of a prescription for short-term spending but a strategy for \nlong-term economic growth, here is what the Post says:\n\n       This is precisely the problem. As credible experts, \n     including some Democrats, have pointed out, much of this \n     ``long-term'' spending either won't stimulate the economy \n     now, is of questionable merit, or both. Even potentially \n     meritorious items, such as $2.1 billion for Head Start, or \n     billions more to computerize medical records, do not belong \n     in this legislation, whose reason for being is to give U.S. \n     economic growth a ``jolt,'' as Mr. Obama himself has put it. \n     All other priorities should pass through the normal budget \n     process, which involves hearings, debate and--crucially--\n     competition with other programs.\n\n  I think that is right. That is one of the things Republicans have \nbeen saying. Some of the spending in the bill may be perfectly \nmeritorious, but since this is emergency spending, it does not have to \nbe accounted for in either reduced spending elsewhere or new tax \nreceipts. It is simply added onto the budget deficit.\n  What the Post and what we and others have been saying is that \nspending with long-term consequences is nothing more than the kinds of \nitems we pass every year in the appropriations process, and it should \nbe subjected to that process.\n  The so-called stimulus bill should be reserved for those items that \nstimulate quickly. We have all heard the phrase ``timely, targeted, and \ntemporary.'' Part of the problem with the bill is that because it \ncreates new mandatory spending and it creates new permanent programs, \nit is not temporary. In the discretionary account, more than half the \nmoney does not even begin to be spent until the year 2011. I know all \nof us hope by 2011 we are out of this recession.\n  I think the Post's criticism is very valid. I urge my colleagues to \nlook at this a slightly different way. Rather than spending on programs \nthat seem like a good idea and may have long-term, positive \nconsequences, let's remove those items from this bill and focus \nstrictly on the items that would actually stimulate the economy.\n  There is a second op-ed piece that was written in my hometown \nnewspaper, the Arizona Republic, on February 6, by Bob Robb, a \ncolumnist there who is very erudite and a good economist. He criticizes \nboth Democratic and Republican ideas. He is an equal opportunity \ncriticizer. We all benefit from that critique of his from time to time. \nHere is what he says about the Democratic proposal:\n\n       The Democratic stimulus proposals are based upon a false \n     premise and a deceit.\n       The false premise is that all Americans are construction \n     workers.\n       The Democrats propose that the federal government build new \n     stuff for virtually everyone.\n       The Congressional Budget Office has already noted the \n     constraints that exist on government's ability to get \n     hundreds of billions of dollars of construction money out the \n     door quickly. But even that ignores the constraint from those \n     who would need to do the work.\n       Residential construction is, of course, in a deep slump. \n     Commercial construction not so much. And residential \n     construction workers are not easily redeployed to do \n     commercial and heavy construction. The skill sets are \n     different.\n       The deceit is that all this spending requires suspending \n     ordinary budget constraints to jumpstart the economy. Most of \n     the spending is actually in pursuit of long-term Democratic \n     economic growth strategies.\n       Democrats believe that the economy will perform better \n     long-term with significant additional government investments \n     in alternative energy sources, education, health care and \n     social welfare programs.\n\n  And we have heard that during this debate.\n  He goes on to conclude:\n\n       Democrats won the election and certainly have the right to \n     try to advance their long-term strategies. But there is \n     nothing about fighting the recession that justifies exempting \n     these long-term strategies from the most basic of budget \n     considerations: How are you going to pay for them?\n       Even without the stimulus package, the federal government \n     has already reached post-World War II records for spending \n     and the deficit as percent of GDP.\n       The primary economic effect of the Democrat's stimulus \n     proposals will be to inflate private sector commercial \n     construction costs and give the country an even more severe \n     fiscal headache.\n\n  That leads into the third op-ed by George Melloan in today's Wall \nStreet Journal that I will have printed in the Record. He is a \nrespected commentator and economist in these matters. I am not going to \nquote very much of his op-ed. The title of it is: ``Why `Stimulus' Will \nMean Inflation.''\n\n  He concludes, as did Bob Robb, that will be the result of all of this \nspending which is declared emergency but is not distinguishable from \nmost of the spending that we do in the ordinary appropriations process. \nBut his concern is that as we inflate the currency of our country, it \nwill be more and more difficult to get people to buy our debt, and the \nnet result could be increasingly costly debt financing.\n  As he notes, too, the credit for the rest of the economy will become \nmore dear as well and entitlements will go up instead of being brought \nunder control under this legislation. He predicts this will require the \nFed to create more dollars, and the end result will be severe inflation \nin our economy.\n  That is borne out by the fact that even though the legislation \npurports to end some of the mandatory spending programs after 2 years, \nthe cost of 10 years for these programs that will supposedly expire is \nwell over $1.3 trillion. I don't think very many of us believe that \nafter 2 years we are going to stop this mandatory spending. My \ncolleague, John McCain, offered a proposal. In fact, there were two. \nThe Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Thune, offered another one. The idea \nwas, once we are out of the recession, once we have had two quarters of \neconomic growth, then surely that is the time to stop all this so-\ncalled stimulus spending. That is, in effect, what the proposal said. \nIt was rejected by our Democratic colleagues. The reason is very clear: \nThey don't intend to stop. They intend to continue it, and that is \nanother $1.3 trillion that is not even factored into the cost of this \n$1 trillion-plus bill.\n  Take the $1 trillion deficit we have now, $1.3 trillion on the bill \nbefore us, another $1.3 trillion, and as Everett Dirksen said on this \nfloor a long time ago, pretty soon you are talking big money. We are \ntalking trillions of dollars, and we should not be in that position \ntoday.\n  Recently, the President spoke to some of our Democratic colleagues. \nHe said the Republicans criticize this bill as a spending bill. I am \nparaphrasing. He said: Of course, it is a spending bill; that is the \nwhole point. I understand what he was getting at. Many believe \nGovernment spending can stimulate economic growth, and I suspect in \ncertain ways that can be done. A lot of us believe those benefits are \nlimited and that there are better ways to stimulate economic growth. \nBut that is the Keynesian theory.\n  When the President says: Of course, that is a spending bill, that is \nthe whole point; he is acknowledging what we have been saying on this \nfloor for a week now, which is that this is a spending bill.\n  He would say: But it also stimulates. What I said yesterday was that \nis kind of a trickle-down theory. The Government spends $1 trillion, \nthrows it against the wall, and hopes some of it trickles down to \nactual families who need the support so they can then get their own \nbudgets in balance and, hopefully, have something left over to spend. \nThat is where ideas, such as those in the alternative proposed by my \ncolleague, Senator McCain, come into play because they actually help \nfamilies in a way that could also have a way of stimulating economic \ngrowth. That is what this package should be all about.\n  I will summarize it this way. This bill spends far too much money for \nfar too long a period of time without any requirement that it be offset \nin any way by reductions in spending or tax receipts, which is the \nnormal appropriations process and will inevitably result in inflation \nwhich robs every American and, in particular, retired Americans who \nhave to rely on their savings.\n  We have to consider the long-term consequences, and I hope the better \nRepublican ideas that have been, so far, pretty much rejected by our \ncolleagues\n\n[[Page S1785]]\n\non the Democratic side can be brought to the floor as amendments and \nwill be supported so there can be broader support for this legislation. \nIf it is adopted on virtually a party-line basis, that is not going to \nbe good for the country, and the end result will not stimulate the \neconomy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthree items. The first is an editorial in the Washington Post, February \n5, called ``The Senate Balks.'' The second is a column in the Arizona \nRepublic, dated February 6, ``Bad Stimulus Ideas All Around.'' The \nthird is a Wall Street Journal, February 6, George Melloan column, \n``Why `Stimulus' Will Mean Inflation.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 5, 2009]\n\n                            The Senate Balks\n\n       Today in The Post, President Obama challenges critics of \n     the $900 billion stimulus plan that was taking shape on \n     Capitol Hill yesterday, accusing them of peddling ``the same \n     failed theories that helped lead us into this crisis'' and \n     warning that, without immediate action, ``Our nation will \n     sink deeper into a crisis that, at some point, we may not be \n     able to reverse.'' A thinly veiled reference to Senate \n     Republicans, this is a departure from his previous emphasis \n     on bipartisanship. Still, as a matter of policy, Mr. Obama is \n     justified in signaling that the plan should not be tilted in \n     favor of tax cuts--and that the GOP should not waste valuable \n     time trying to achieve this.\n       However, ideology is not the only reason that senators--\n     from both parties--are balking at the president's plan. As it \n     emerged from the House, it suffered from a confusion of \n     objectives. Mr. Obama praised the package yesterday as ``not \n     merely a prescription for short-term spending'' but a \n     ``strategy for long-term economic growth in areas like \n     renewable energy and health care and education.'' This is \n     precisely the problem. As credible experts, including some \n     Democrats, have pointed out, much of this ``long-term'' \n     spending either won't stimulate the economy now, is of \n     questionable merit, or both. Even potentially meritorious \n     items, such as $2.1 billion for Head Start, or billions more \n     to computerize medical records, do not belong in legislation \n     whose reason for being is to give U.S. economic growth a \n     ``jolt,'' as Mr. Obama himself has put it. All other policy \n     priorities should pass through the normal budget process, \n     which involves hearings, debate and--crucially--competition \n     with other programs.\n       Sen. Susan Collins of Maine is one of the moderate \n     Republicans whose support the president must win if he is to \n     garner the 60 Senate votes needed to pass a stimulus package. \n     She and Democrat Ben Nelson of Nebraska are working on a plan \n     that would carry a lower nominal price tag than the current \n     bill--perhaps $200 billion lower--but which would focus on \n     aid to states, ``shovel-ready'' infrastructure projects, food \n     stamp increases and other items calculated to boost business \n     and consumer spending quickly. On the revenue side, she would \n     keep Mr. Obama's priorities, including a $500-per-worker tax \n     rebate.\n       To his credit, Mr. Obama continues to seek bipartisan \n     input, and he met individually with Ms. Collins for a half \n     hour yesterday afternoon. We hope he gives her ideas serious \n     consideration.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     Bad Stimulus Ideas All Around\n\n       The Democrats have some bad ideas for the stimulus bill. \n     The Republicans also have some bad ideas.\n       Unfortunately, the compromise might be to combine the bad \n     ideas of both parties.\n       The Democratic stimulus proposals are based upon a false \n     premise and a deceit.\n       The false premise is that all Americans are construction \n     workers.\n       The Democrats propose that the federal government build new \n     stuff for virtually everyone.\n       The Congressional Budget Office has already noted the \n     constraints that exist on government's ability to get \n     hundreds of billions of dollars of construction money out the \n     door quickly.

But the heart \n     of the problem was an overinvestment in housing, partially \n     induced by government subsidies. That was compounded by \n     imprudent lending to people without skin in the game in the \n     form of a substantial down payment.\n       So, what do Republicans propose? New, more massive federal \n     subsidies. Under their proposal, the federal government would \n     guarantee new mortgage rates of 4 percent. And don't sweat \n     that down payment. The federal government will give you a tax \n     credit of $15,000.\n       In the first place, existing mortgage rates are already \n     historically low. Moreover, home sales are trending up, \n     induced by deeply discounted prices.\n       The federal government could usefully reduce foreclosures \n     by guaranteeing the refinancing of existing mortgages so that \n     payments don't exceed a certain percentage of income.\n       By massively subsidizing new home purchases, however, \n     Republicans are basically proposing to reinflate the housing \n     bubble.\n       Republicans also propose to reduce the income tax rates on \n     the two lowest brackets. Rather than truly help low-income \n     Americans, who don't pay much in income taxes, the benefits \n     will primarily flow to the upper middle class, while \n     increasing the marginal tax rate increase faced by the middle \n     class.\n       Truly providing income support to low-income Americans, who \n     are most vulnerable in an economic downturn, would be \n     something useful the federal government could do, through \n     such things as temporary payroll tax relief and extended \n     unemployment benefits. But there's only a little over $100 \n     billion in such short-term assistance in the stimulus bills.\n       The country would be fortunate if Congress would just enact \n     those provisions and then call it a day.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 6, 2009]\n\n                  Why ``Stimulus'' Will Mean Inflation\n\n                          (By George Melloan)\n\n       As Congress blithely ushers its trillion dollar \n     ``stimulus'' package toward law and the U.S. Treasury \n     prepares to begin writing checks on this vast new \n     appropriation, it might be wise to ask a simple question: \n     Who's going to finance it?\n       That might seem like a no-brainer, which perhaps explains \n     why no one has bothered to ask. Treasury securities are \n     selling at high prices and finding buyers even though yields \n     are low, hovering below 3% for 10-year notes. Congress is \n     able to assure itself that it will finance the stimulus with \n     cheap credit. But how long will credit be cheap? Will it \n     still be when the Treasury is scrounging around in the \n     international credit markets six months or a year from now? \n     That seems highly unlikely.\n       Let's have a look at the credit market. Treasurys have been \n     strong because the stock market collapse and the mortgage-\n     backed securities fiasco sent the whole world running for \n     safety. The best looking port in the storm, as usual, was \n     U.S. Treasury paper. That is what gave the dollar and \n     Treasury securities the lift they now enjoy.\n       But that surge was a one-time event and doesn't necessarily \n     mean that a big new batch of Treasury securities will find an \n     equally strong market. Most likely it won't as the global \n     economy spirals downward.\n       For one thing, a very important cycle has been interrupted \n     by the crash. For years, the U.S. has run large trade \n     deficits with China and Japan and those two countries have \n     invested their surpluses mostly in U.S. Treasury securities. \n     Their holdings are enormous: As of Nov. 30 last year, China \n     held $682 billion in Treasurys, a sharp rise from $459 \n     billion a year earlier. Japan had reduced its holdings, to \n     $577 billion from $590 billion a year earlier, but remains a \n     huge creditor. The two account for almost 65% of total \n     Treasury securities held by foreign owners, 19% of the total \n     U.S. national debt, and over 3o% of Treasurys held by the \n     public.\n       In the lush years of the U.S. credit boom, it was \n     rationalized that this circular arrangement was good for all \n     concerned. Exports fueled China's rapid economic growth and \n     created jobs for its huge work force, American workers could \n     raise their living standards by buying cheap Chinese goods. \n     China's dollar surplus gave the U.S. Treasury a captive pool \n     of investment to finance congressional deficits. It was \n     argued, persuasively, that China and Japan had no choice but \n     to buy U.S. bonds if they wanted to keep their exports to the \n     U.S. flowing. They also would hurt their own interests if \n     they tried to unload Treasurys because that would send the \n     value of their remaining holdings down.\n       But what if they stopped buying bonds not out of choice but \n     because they were out of money? The virtuous circle so much \n     praised would be broken. Something like that seems to be \n     happening now. As the recession deepens, U.S. consumers are \n     spending less,\n\n[[Page S1786]]\n\n     even on cheap Chinese goods and certainly on Japanese cars \n     and electronic products. Japan, already a smaller market for \n     U.S. debt last November, is now suffering what some have \n     described as ``free fall'' in industrial production. Its two \n     champions, Toyota and Sony, are faltering badly. China's \n     growth also is slowing, and it is plagued by rising \n     unemployment.\n       American officials seem not to have noticed this abrupt and \n     dangerous change in global patterns of trade and finance.\n       The new Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, at his Senate \n     confirmation hearing harped on that old Treasury mantra about \n     China ``manipulating'' its currency to gain trade advantage. \n     Vice President Joe Biden followed up with a further lecture \n     to the Chinese but said the U.S. will not move \n     ``unilaterally'' to keep out Chinese exports. One would hope \n     not ``unilaterally'' or any other way if the U.S. hopes to \n     keep flogging its Treasurys to the Chinese.\n       The Congressional Budget Office is predicting the federal \n     deficit will reach $1.2 trillion this fiscal year. That's \n     more than double the $455 billion deficit posted for fiscal \n     2008, and some private estimates put the likely outcome even \n     higher. That will drive up interest costs in the federal \n     budget even if Treasury yields stay low. But if a drop in \n     world market demand for Treasurys sends borrowing costs \n     upward, there could be a ballooning of the interest cost line \n     in the budget that will worsen an already frightening \n     outlook. Credit for the rest of the economy will become more \n     dear as well, worsening the recession. Treasury's Wednesday \n     announcement that it will sell a record $67 billion in notes \n     and bonds next week and $493 billion in this quarter weakened \n     Treasury prices, revealing market sensitivity to heavy \n     financing.\n       So what is the outlook? The stimulus package is rolling \n     through Congress like an express train packed with goodies, \n     so an enormous deficit seems to be a given. Entitlements will \n     go up instead of being brought under better control, auguring \n     big future deficits. Where will the Treasury find all those \n     trillions in a depressed world economy?\n       There is only one answer. The Obama administration and \n     Congress will call on Ben Bernanke at the Fed to demand that \n     he create more dollars--lots and lots of them. The Fed \n     already is talking of buying longer-term Treasurys to support \n     the market, so it will be more of the same--much more.\n       And what will be the result? Well, the product of this sort \n     of thing is called inflation. The Fed's outpouring of dollar \n     liquidity after the September crash replaced the liquidity \n     lost by the financial sector and has so far caused no \n     significant uptick in consumer prices. But the worry lies in \n     what will happen next.\n       Even when the economy and the securities markets are \n     sluggish, the Fed's financing of big federal deficits can be \n     inflationary. We learned that in the late 1970s, when the \n     Fed's deficit financing sent the CPI up to an annual rate of \n     almost 15%. That confounded the Keynesian theorists who \n     believed then, as now, that federal spending ``stimulus'' \n     would restore economic health.\n       Inflation is the product of the demand for money as well as \n     of the supply. And if the Fed finances federal deficits in a \n     moribund economy, it can create more money than the economy \n     can use. The result is ``stagflation,'' a term coined to \n     describe the 1970s experience. As the global economy slows \n     and Congress relies more on the Fed to finance a huge \n     deficit, there is a very real danger of a return of \n     stagflation. I wonder why no one in Congress or the Obama \n     administration has thought of that as a potential consequence \n     of their stimulus package.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, again, I thank the manager of the bill and my \ncolleague Senator Durbin for allowing me to give these remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want everybody to remember these two \nnumbers: 99 percent, 79 percent; 99 percent, 79 percent. What are those \ntwo numbers? If you take the Finance Committee bill, the bill that is \nin this stimulus bill that the Senate Finance Committee wrote--the \nSenate Finance Committee wrote the tax portion of the underlying bill \nand also the aid to States portion.\n  Ninety-nine percent of the spending and the taxes combined in the \nFinance Committee portion of the bill will be spent out in the first 2 \nyears. Ninety-nine percent of the Finance Committee bill will be spent \nin the first 2 years.\n  For those who didn't quite get it, it didn't quite compute, I will \nsay it again. Ninety-nine percent of the Finance Committee bill is \nspent in the first 2 years--99 percent. Actually, if you want to break \nit down, it is a little more than that for taxes only because some \nreach to future years. Ninety-nine percent of the Finance Committee \nbill is spent in the first 2 years.\n  What is my authority on that? Some economists? It is the Joint \nCommittee on Tax and CBO, if you look at their numbers and combine \nthem, the Joint Committee on Tax and the Congressional Budget Office, \nthat is what it calculates to: 99 percent of the Finance Committee bill \nis spent in the first 2 years, according to the Joint Committee on Tax \nand according to the CBO, combining the two.\n  That is my first figure, 99 percent. What is my second figure? Does \nanybody remember it? What was my second figure? It was 79 percent. What \ndoes 79 percent represent? Seventy-nine percent represents the total \nspending of this bill in the first 2 years. The total spending, if you \ntake the Appropriations Committee and the Finance Committee and add \nthem together--79 percent of the total spending--in this bill is in the \nfirst 2 years, 79 percent. Now, what is my authority? The Congressional \nBudget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation. So I ask Senators to \ngo look at the Joint Committee on Taxation data, go to the \nCongressional Budget Office data. It is right there.\n\n  There are a lot of allegations and a lot of statements that are made \non the Senate floor by lots of Senators on both sides, and one of our \ngoals, clearly, is to try to get the facts. One of our goals is to \nlisten to the music as well as the words, to separate the wheat from \nthe chaff, and to get to what is really going on. What are the right \nnumbers?\n  Now, of course, no numbers are perfect, but what is close to being \nright or as close as we can tell as we seek the truth? I will tell you, \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation is probably one of the most unbiased, \nmost reputable bodies here. Now, some don't like their numbers. They \nwish their calculations would be different. But, clearly, they try \ntheir best. They do their best. It is a bipartisan organization that \nworks for both bodies of Congress, and they work for both political \nparties. They work for the Congress. It is not biased.\n  The Congressional Budget Office is not biased, and the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation is not biased. For those who are not familiar \nwith Washington speak, the Joint Committee on Taxation is an \nindependent professional group which advises the Congress on tax \nmatters and does tax calculations for the Congress on tax matters. The \nCongressional Budget Office basically issues lots of reports and \nadvises the Congress on spending items that are nontax items and \ncalculations and so forth. Again, it is bipartisan. It serves both \nbodies--the Congressional Budget Office. It is a very reputable body, \nas is the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  So, again, I want to repeat those numbers so it sinks in a little \nmore. The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Tax, \nadd the figures together, 99 percent of the Finance Committee bill, \nwhich is a large portion of the bill--I think it is about 60 percent of \nthe bill--is spent in the first 2 years. That is 99 percent--almost all \nin the first 2 years. If you take it all together, the Finance \nCommittee bill and add in the appropriations portion of the bill, 79 \npercent--almost 80 percent or almost four-fifths--is spent in the first \n2 years.\n  Now, Mr. President, we have to get moving. Our country is in deep, \ndeep, deep trouble. The American people want us to do something \nresponsible about all of this. We all know there are three parts to the \nproblem. One is the credit crisis--that is, credit is all frozen; banks \naren't lending--and there are lots of ways to address that. The second \npart of the problem is housing. We are struggling to get even more \nstimulus to housing. But a third major part of the problem is demand \nand spending. There is about a $1 trillion gap between our potential \neconomy in America and the real economy--$1 trillion. If we don't \naddress that gap between spending and demand, we are going to find \nourselves in such deep difficulty, with so many jobs lost, it may be \nequal to the Great Depression. We are not there yet, clearly, but we \ncould get pretty close if we don't take some pretty important actions \nhere.\n  Now, I have heard all kinds of speeches on this matter, whether the \nroughly $800 billion stimulus package is right or not right. I have \nbeen in rooms with conservative economists and liberal economists and \nmiddle-of-the-road economists, and they all agree $800 billion is about \nright, and it is needed--and it is needed. Some may quibble about some \nparts, and there have been a lot of Senators on the floor, \nrespectfully, Mr. President, who have been quibbling. They have not \nbeen seeing\n\n[[Page S1787]]\n\nthe forest for the trees. But I submit, if we keep our eye on the ball \nand keep our eye on the forest, we can get this bill passed and get it \npassed pretty quickly.\n  I just want to urge those Senators who say not very much is being \nspent out in the first years to go look at the Joint Committee on \nTaxation and the Congressional Budget Office and do the calculations. \nAgain, 99 percent of the Finance Committee package is spent in the \nfirst 2 years, and 79 percent of the total underlying bill is spent in \nthe first 2 years. I think that is pretty good. It is not perfect, but \nit is pretty good.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe time during the quorum call, if there is a quorum call, be equally \ndivided.\n  Frankly, I see the Senator from Tennessee is seeking recognition.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nhave come down to speak on this stimulus package before us, and I want \nto thank especially the colleagues on this side of the aisle for \ntalking about this particular package. I think most people in the \ncountry realize that housing and credit are the foundations of this \ncountry which need to be stabilized so that we can build our economy \nagain.\n  I know there are a number of people on both sides of the aisle who \nare working in a gang mentality right now, if you will, to try to make \nthis package better, and I certainly applaud people who work together \nin a bipartisan way to try to solve problems. In this particular case, \nthough, this stimulus package is nothing short of a disaster. I think \nto try to make it 10 percent better, while admirable, is not really \ndoing our country the justice it deserves.\n  I am one of those people, I guess, who likes to understand all the \nproblems together we are facing before taking action on one specific \naspect. I want to understand everything as it is. And I know the \nadministration is coming forth in the next week or so to talk about \ntheir solution to our financial crisis. I know there are many people in \nthis country who believe we have trillions of dollars of losses still \nleft in our financial system before we hit bottom. I think everybody in \nour country realizes that as housing continues to drop, it is not just \nhurting our economy directly, it is also dragging our financial system \ndown.\n  So, again, I appreciate those folks who are trying to work together \nto make this bill, which is a disaster, in my opinion, slightly better. \nI wonder if it wouldn't make more sense for us as a country to just \nwait for a week or two to hear the rest of the administration's plan as \nit relates to solving this problem. I think for us to rush out and put \nforth $1 trillion on spending on top of a projected $1 trillion \ndeficit, without fully understanding the other issues our country faces \nand how the administration plans to deal with these other issues, is \nincredibly imprudent.\n  It would be like a business person in a company knowing they have a \ncrisis at hand, and not fully understanding what all those components \nare, and sort of throwing the whole shooting match into one of those, \nknowing there are other things coming they haven't thought about.\n  We have Governors around the country from both sides of the aisle who \nare talking with us about what this is going to do to disrupt their \nStates because so much of this spending is programmatic. It has nothing \nwhatsoever to do with creating jobs. I have to be honest, I may be \nrare, but I don't understand how any of us could seriously talk about \naid to States when our Federal Government is in the situation it is \ntoday. States, generally speaking, run their States in appropriate \nways. But, truly, Governors on both sides of the aisle are wondering \nwhat they are going to do to the people coming after them because we \nare building this big fire hose of money coming into the States that \nthey have to spend in stovepipe ways that are going to cause their \nsuccessors to truly be in a very difficult situation.\n  Look, there are people on both sides of the aisle uneasy about this. \nThat is why this gang has been formed because there is tremendous \nunease, even on the other side of the aisle, on this package. Most \npeople support this--well, I will not say that--many people, I believe, \nare supporting this package to show support for this new President whom \nwe all want to see do well. We all want to see him be successful.\n\n  I have had friends in life who out of friendship to me supported \nsomething I was doing, when I would have much preferred, after the \nfact, their sharing with me that what I was about to do was a really \nterrible idea. Instead, they just went along, and I ended up probably \nnot doing as well as I might have done. I think there is tremendous \nunease in this body with this package, and I think there are a lot of \npeople who are holding their nose and supporting it out of support for \nthis President whom we all want to lead our country and this world \nsuccessfully.\n  I just urge people on both sides of the aisle to think about this, to \nvote their conscience, and not to just go along but, in fact, to stop \nand pause and look at all the issues we are going to be dealing with. \nLet's ask the administration to come forth and talk to us about the \npricetag of dealing appropriately with the credit markets, with \nhousing, and with, maybe, some directed spending on infrastructure or \nsomething that is not programmatic and would not disrupt the way State \ngovernments run.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the time, but I feel as though our \ncountry is getting ready to do something we will regret and generations \nafter us will regret. So I am concerned about where we are as a country \nwith our economy, and I feel as if we are using resources today so \ninappropriately when we are going to need those resources down the \nroad.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wonder if anybody on our side is seeking \ntime?\n  The Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, seeks 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and my friend, the Senator from \nMontana, the chairman of the Finance Committee. I thank him for his \nleadership and, frankly, for his strength of character and patience \nthroughout the long journey we have taken as a Chamber on this bill. \nWhen we get it done--and I think we need to get it done quickly--it \nwill be in no small measure because of his steadfastness in this time \nof national need.\n  Mr. President, one of the favorite metaphors that is used in time of \ncrisis is of a burning house. I wish I could find a different metaphor \nbecause that one is used so frequently. But, frankly, I can't find one \nthat better expresses what I would like to express in a few moments \nthis afternoon.\n  The fact is obvious: America's economic house is burning. A lot of \npeople are being hurt--600,000 people unemployed last month, the second \nmonth in a row that went over a half million people losing their jobs. \nFrom one report I heard, it was the largest number of people losing \njobs in 1 month in America in 35 years. I could go on with a lot of \nstatistics, but we don't need them. We have heard them in the debate \nbefore.\n  America's economic house is on fire. But I want to extend the \nmetaphor to us, those who are privileged to serve in the Senate. We are \nthe firefighters, if you will. And I fear there is a danger that what \nmay be happening is, while the house is burning, and we are on our way \nto try to put out the fire, we have stopped the truck because we are \narguing over what is the best way to get to the fire most quickly. In \nthe meantime, we are leaving the house burning and more people are \nbeing hurt.\n  Some people have suggested we go back to the beginning and start \nagain or that we wait, as my friend from Tennessee just said, until the \nadministration comes in with all its ideas for all of the responses to \nthe economic crisis we are in before we act on this one. That simply \ncannot happen because the need and the urgency of the need is too \ngreat. It is felt in individual lives, it is felt in macroeconomic \nstatistics, it is felt in the reports we hear, one after the other, of \ngreat American businesses doing worse than they did last year and \nterribly worse than they did 2 years ago. It is felt in the growing \nsigns of a deep global recession.\n\n[[Page S1788]]\n\n  It is clear that demand from the private and personal sector has \ndropped dramatically. Economists estimate about a $1 trillion hole in \nour economy. The proposal President Obama has made comes to us from the \nHouse. It is not all perfect, believe me, as I will say in a moment, \nbut it is $800 billion over 2 years. In fact, it is $800 billion over \nmore than 2 years. That means it is less than $400 billion the \nGovernment is injecting into the economy now, because the private \nsector will not, to try to kick-start the economy and protect people's \njobs and create new ones. That $400 billion into an economy that is $1 \ntrillion short is simply necessary and it is urgently necessary.\n  Here we are. H.R. 1 is before us. It is larger than some people want \nit to be. It contains items in it that do not appear, on first look, to \nbe directly related to economic recovery, stimulating the economy. I \npreferred originally--I said I thought the stimulus bill should be big, \nas big as the problem is; it should be as clean as possible; that is, \nit would be mostly job creating--public works, that kind of \ninvestment--and then it should be quick because the house is on fire \nand every day we do not do anything, more people suffer and it will be \nharder to get out of it. That is the challenge we have. Yet we, as the \nfirefighters, seem to be falling into some old habits, where we are \nargue about how to get to the fire when the house keeps burning.\n  In the midst of this, two of our colleagues, Ben Nelson of Nebraska \nand Susan Collins of Maine, have come together to form a bipartisan \ngroup, a gang--that gives a good name to the term gang--whatever you \nwant to call them, moderates, centrists, Independents--basically a \nbipartisan group that wants to find common ground so we can get the 60 \nvotes we need to pass this so we can get to the fire and help put it \nout so more Americans do not suffer. As part of this--and I have been \npart of this group--we have worked well together and we have been very \nopen and honest with one another. We have talked about cuts--I have--in \nprograms that I support deeply.\n  But I have two things in mind here. One is the urgency of the moment. \nI am going to have to yield on some things I wish to see in that bill \nto make sure we get something done quickly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I wonder if I could ask unanimous consent for 3 \nadditional minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Would the Senator be OK with 2?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Two? It is a deal. See, that is in the spirit of \ncompromise, in this case not bipartisan.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is compromising toward the intentions of the other \nside.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I am happy to do it.\n  Tough decisions had to be made by this bipartisan group. Why did we \nmake them? One, because the urgency is to get to 60. I wish we could \nget to 80 but it doesn't seem to be in the offing so I am going to do \neverything I can to get to 60 and hopefully a little over so we can get \nhelp to the American economy, American businesses, the American people.\n  Second, this is not the last appropriations bill. We have an omnibus \nbill coming. We have the regular appropriations process. We can come \nback and find other ways to deal with some of the real needs that will \nnot get quite as much as they get now in H.R. 1, to achieve results \nquickly.\n  That is my appeal to my colleagues. Let's not get dug in. This is not \na perfect bill, but it clearly is a very good bill and, most important \nof all, it is a proposal that will pump money into the American \neconomy, into the pockets of working Americans and businesses \nthroughout this country, that will kick-start the economy, protect \nmillions of jobs, and create millions of other jobs. There is nothing \nmore important than doing that right now.\n  Let's get together, let's support the bipartisan effort, let's shoot \nfor 80 but get over 60 so we can get to the fire together and put it \nout.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield time to the Senator from Michigan, \n5 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I apologize, I think Senator Lincoln was \nhere earlier. I didn't turn around far enough.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Finance Committee who I know is working so hard. There are so many \ndifferent pieces of this that are so important to the American people.\n  I want to take a moment, after listening to colleagues--today and \nthroughout the week--on the other side of the aisle, to talk about the \nfact that this package is strongly supported by the majority of our \ncaucus and I believe the majority of the American people who know we \nhave to do something different than what has been done for the last 8 \nyears.\n  We have been debating whether to go back to policies that have been \nin place for 8 years--tax policies that have been passed on a number of \noccasions, over the last 8 years, under President Bush and when our \ncolleagues were in the majority. We have seen those policies in place. \nWe have seen the results of those, and they didn't work. I wish they \nhad. My State of Michigan has the highest unemployment rate in the \ncountry, over 10.6 percent, heading up to 11 very quickly. I wish they \nhad worked because people in my State then would be working.\n  But that is not what has happened. The American people know that. The \nAmerican people understand we have to do something different. I \nremember in those debates in the last 8 years when we came forward \nsaying we need to put people to work by focusing on jobs directly, jobs \nrebuilding America, making sure we are focusing on jobs for roads and \nbridges and rebuilding water and sewer systems and rebuilding our \nschools and doing things that would directly stimulate the economy. But \nthose were rejected with the same arguments we are hearing now, the \nsame arguments.\n  We have talked over the last 8 years about the need to aggressively \nmove to the new green economy so we are not only tackling our \ndependence on foreign oil but creating jobs in this new green energy \nrevolution. There were the same arguments in opposition, on the other \nside of the aisle. We have put forward proposals to invest in our \npeople, proposals to make sure that people who are hurt by this \ndevastating financial and economic crisis--those who are unemployed or \nfearful of being unemployed, who cannot put food on the table and pay \nthe bills and pay their mortgage--can get help. Too many times that has \nbeen rejected.\n  We now find ourselves here. There was an election where those \npolicies were debated for a long time--not 1 year but 2 years. Those \npolicies the American people took a look at, both sets of policies, and \nthey said no. They said no to the policies of the last 8 years. They \nsaid no to inaction.\n  We all know we were talking 2 years ago about the fact that we had to \naddress the housing problem, subprime lending, or we were going to see \na rippling effect in the financial markets. There was inaction. Nothing \nhappened. We find ourselves in a position today where we are seeing \nsome 600,000 people now--that is the unemployment number for January; \n500,000 the previous month, 500,000 the previous month. It is only \ngetting worse and worse. Eleven million people in this country do not \nhave a job and that is only the people we are counting.\n  We come to this point where, yes, there is a difference. I commend \ncolleagues who are working together to get to the necessary 60 votes \nand are working in good faith. But fundamentally we have a difference \nin philosophy of how our economy should operate and, frankly, whom it \nshould help. Our proposal, this President's proposal, is to make sure \nthe majority of Americans, the overwhelming number of Americans who \nhave been left out of this economy in the policies of the last 8 years \nget an opportunity to participate with job, jobs rebuilding America, \njobs in the green economy, keeping our police officers on the streets, \nour teachers in the schools, retraining for the new economy and making \nsure people who have been hurt, devastated so much, get the help they \nneed.\n\n[[Page S1789]]\n\n  I urge us to join together in a new direction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, 5 minutes to the Senator from----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Unless Senator Alexander seeks recognition. We want to go \nback and forth to even things out.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I seek recognition for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield to the Senator on his time, on Republican time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, will you please let me know when 60 \nseconds remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will notify the Senator.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I have been listening to the debate as well. I think \nit is important that all our colleagues and the American people \nunderstand what we mean by bipartisanship, because there is a \ndisconnect between the tone I have been hearing for the last week from \nthe administration and from the majority and from the substance I have \nbeen hearing. Here is what I heard. I heard we are going to work \ntogether to try to deal with this economy. First we are going to have \nto stimulate the economy. We all know next week the Secretary of the \nTreasury is coming forward to do something about banking and then maybe \nabout housing. Then there is an appropriations bill, and then we have \nhealth care, which the Senator from Montana has been hard at work on. \nWe have a great many things to do.\n  So what do we mean by bipartisan? I thought what we meant, we thought \nwhat we meant, was that the President would define an agenda and then \nwe would sit down together and take our best ideas. The President put \nhis out there. We think we have a better idea. We said fix housing \nfirst. Housing got us into this mess. Housing can get us out of it.\n  So we offered a way to offer up to 40 million Americans a 4- or 4.5-\npercent mortgage, 30-year rate, saving them an average of $400 a month. \nWe brought it up. Senator Ensign proposed it. Not one single Democratic \nvote.\n  Senator Isakson has been offering an amendment for the last year and \na half to give $15,000 in tax credits to home buyers. That was \naccepted. I hope it survives the conference.\n  But the tone has changed overnight. Suddenly the President, instead \nof inviting us to work with him, is saying basically: We won the \nelection, we will write the bill. The attitude seems to be: Let's see \nif we can pick off one Republican or two Republicans or three \nRepublicans. Then the tone is, well, suddenly: The tired old ideas. I \ndidn't hear the President talk about his tax cut proposal for 2 years \nduring his campaign as a tired old idea. It is still a part of his \nproposal. It is also a part of our proposal.\n  We have offered ways to fix housing first. No. 1, we suggest letting \npeople keep more of their own money, as the President has suggested. \nSenator McCain's own bill, which received not one single Democratic \nvote, offered to spend $420 billion, and it included a cut in the \npayroll tax for 1 year and a cut in the lower rates of taxation.\n  Then we would like to do as Alice Rivlin, the former head of the \nBudget Office, suggested. We would like to take all of the spending \nthat does not create jobs now and put it off and do it later. If we are \ngoing to borrow money at a time when we are heavily in debt, it ought \nto be targeted, timely, and temporary.\n  Senator McCain yesterday offered legislation that received almost \nevery Republican vote but no Democratic votes, that would have made it \ntemporary. It would have said whatever spending we have, we will have \nit until the economy recovers. But once it starts to recover for 2 \nquarters--the gross domestic product goes up for 2 quarters, then the \nspending stops.\n  What has happened? This is the easy piece of legislation. This is one \nthat most of us agree needs to be done. What we were expecting in this \nera of bipartisanship, given the President's campaign and his comments, \nwas that he would offer his idea, we would offer ours, and we would put \nthem together and come up with a result.\n  Ours are: Fix housing first. That is not in the bill. Ours are: Make \nit temporary. They rejected that without a Democratic vote yesterday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute left.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Ours are: Let's get the spending off the bill that \ndoes not create jobs now.\n  My staff finds that only about $135 billion of the $900 billion goes \nto things that happen in the first couple of years--building roads, \nimproving national parks, other things that create jobs now.\n  The American people did not hear in the last campaign that the kind \nof change they were voting for was that the first thing we would do \nwhen we got to Washington is borrow $1 trillion, add it to the debt, \nand then take the position: We won the election, we will write the \nbill. If that is the tone, if that is the substance for the next \nseveral years, that will not make a very successful Presidency. That \nwill not be good for our country. We want this President to be \nsuccessful because we need him to be successful for our country to \nrecover.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I intended to offer an amendment to this \nbill to appropriate $1 billion to the Department of Energy Federal \nEnergy Management Program, FEMP. The funds would have been used to \nexpand the scope of energy savings performance contracts, ESPCs, and \nutility energy savings contracts, UESCs. In the last 10 years, 195 \nESPCs and UESCs have invested about $3 billion in Federal facilities \nand have produced about 28,500 jobs. The costs of these projects have \nbeen entirely repaid from savings.\n  The amendment was necessary and consistent with our stimulus goals \nbecause it would have multiplied the job creation and the energy \nsavings from every dollar of Treasury investment. In addition to \nproviding significant financial leverage, ESPC and UESC projects comply \nwith the standards the Congress established in section 432 of EISA--42 \nU.S.C. section 8253 (f)(1) through (f)(7)--for energy projects in \nFederal facilities: comprehensive energy and water conservation and \nefficiency measures, full utilization of renewable energy technologies, \nand transparency and accountability through long-term monitoring of \nproject savings.\n  The amendment I intended to offer would have given FEMP the incentive \nto quickly clear its pipeline of about $2.2 billion of shovel-ready \nprojects, to accelerate the pace of new project development so that we \nwould have another $3 billion of projects implemented in the next 2 \nyears, and enabled FEMP to expand the scope of the ESPC and UESC \nprojects by paying for the advanced metering and monitoring systems \nthat the Congress has mandated but not yet funded.\n  Based on the history of the ESPC and UESC projects, my amendment \nwould have assured that about $6 billion of projects would be \nimplemented, creating almost 60,000 jobs, at a cost to the Treasury of \n$1 billion. I, therefore, urge the Federal agencies that are receiving \nsubstantial new appropriations for energy projects to use the ESPC and \nUESC projects as models of what the Congress wants to see accomplished \nwith the taxpayers' dollars.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this morning we learned that another \n598,000 jobs were lost in the month of January. Our unemployment rate \nnow stands at 7.6 percent and will no doubt be higher still in the \ncoming months.\n  With that in mind, I would like to have printed in the Record an \nopinion piece authored by Steven Pearlstein that appeared in today's \nWashington Post. The piece does a much better job than I could hope to \ndo of explaining the basic economics of why increased Government \nspending in a time of recession is a good thing.\n  I encourage my colleagues to take a serious look at this opinion \npiece. In his final sentence, Mr. Pearlstein gives us all a crib sheet \nthat I think we all might want to pay a bit more attention to.\n\n       Spending is stimulus, no matter what it's for and who does \n     it. The best spending is that which creates jobs and economic \n     activity now, has big payoffs later and disappears from \n     future budgets.\n\n  As I have been saying all week, the $365.6 billion in spending that \nwe include in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act meets these \nsimple\n\n[[Page S1790]]\n\ncriteria. I again urge my colleagues to set aside partisan differences \nand work together on this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the opinion piece \nauthored by Steven Pearlstein printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 6, 2009]\n\n          Wanted: Personal Economic Trainers--Apply at Capitol\n\n                         (By Steven Pearlstein)\n\n       As long as we're about to spend gazillions to stimulate the \n     economy, I'd like to suggest we throw in another $53.5 \n     million for a cause dear to all business journalists: \n     economic literacy. And what better place to start than right \n     here in Washington.\n       My modest proposal is that lawmakers be authorized to hire \n     personal economic trainers over the coming year to sit by \n     their sides as they fashion the government's response to the \n     economic crisis and prevent them from uttering the kind of \n     nonsense that has characterized the debate over the stimulus \n     bill during the last two weeks.\n       At a minimum, we'd be creating jobs for 535 unemployed \n     PhDs. And if we improved government economic policy by a mere \n     1 percent of the trillions of dollars we're dealing with, it \n     would pay for itself many times over.\n       Let's review some of the more silly arguments about the \n     stimulus bill, starting with the notion that ``only'' 75 \n     percent of the money can be spent in the next two years, and \n     the rest is therefore ``wasted.''\n       As any economist will tell you, the economy tends to be \n     forward-looking and emotional. So if businesses and \n     households can see immediate benefits from a program while \n     knowing that a bit more stimulus is on the way, they are \n     likely to feel more confident that the recovery will be \n     sustained. That confidence, in turn, will make them more \n     likely to take the risk of buying big-ticket items now and \n     investing in stocks or future ventures.\n       Moreover, much of the money that can't be spent right away \n     is for capital improvements such as building and maintaining \n     schools, roads, bridges and sewer systems, or replacing \n     equipment--stuff we'd have to do eventually. So another way \n     to think of this kind of spending is that we've simply moved \n     it up to a time, to a point when doing it has important \n     economic benefits and when the price will be less.\n       Equally specious is the oft-heard complaint that even some \n     of the immediate spending is not stimulative.\n       ``This is not a stimulus plan, it's a spending plan,'' \n     Nebraska's freshman senator, Mike Johanns (R), said Wednesday \n     in a maiden floor speech full of budget-balancing orthodoxy \n     that would have made Herbert Hoover proud. The stimulus bill, \n     he declared, ``won't create the promised jobs. It won't \n     activate our economy.''\n       Johanns was too busy yesterday to explain this radical \n     departure from standard theory and practice. Where does the \n     senator think the $800 billion will go? Down a rabbit hole? \n     Even if the entire sum were to be stolen by federal employees \n     and spent entirely on fast cars, fancy homes, gambling \n     junkets and fancy clothes, it would still be an $800 billion \n     increase in the demand for goods and services--a pretty good \n     working definition for economic stimulus. The only question \n     is whether spending it on other things would create more \n     long-term value, which it almost certainly would.\n       Meanwhile, Nebraska's other senator, Ben Nelson (D), was \n     heading up a centrist group that was determined to cut $100 \n     billion from the stimulus bill. Among his targets: $1.1 \n     billion for health-care research into what is cost-effective \n     and what is not. An aide explained that, in the senator's \n     opinion, there is ``some spending that was more stimulative \n     than other kinds of spending.''\n       Oh really? I'm sure they'd love to have a presentation on \n     that at the next meeting of the American Economic \n     Association. Maybe the senator could use that opportunity to \n     explain why a dollar spent by the government, or government \n     contractor, to hire doctors, statisticians and software \n     programmers is less stimulative than a dollar spent on hiring \n     civil engineers and bulldozer operators and guys waving \n     orange flags to build highways, which is what the senator \n     says he prefers.\n       And then there is Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), complaining in \n     Wednesday's Wall Street Journal that of the 3 million jobs \n     that the stimulus package might create or save, one in five \n     will be government jobs, as if there is something inherently \n     inferior or unsatisfactory about that. (Note to Coburn's \n     political director: One in five workers in Oklahoma is \n     employed by government.)\n       In the next day's Journal, Coburn won additional support \n     for his theory that public-sector employment and output is \n     less worthy than private-sector output from columnist Daniel \n     Henninger. Henninger weighed in with his own list of horror \n     stories from the stimulus bill, including $325 million for \n     trail repair and remediation of abandoned mines on federal \n     lands, $6 billion to reduce the carbon footprint of federal \n     buildings and--get this!--$462 million to equip, construct \n     and repair labs at the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention.\n       ``What is most striking is how much `stimulus'' money is \n     being spent on the government's own infrastructure,'' wrote \n     Henninger. ``This bill isn't economic stimulus. It's self-\n     stimulus.''\n       Actually, what's striking is that supposedly intelligent \n     people are horrified at the thought that, during a deep \n     recession, government might try to help the economy by buying \n     up-to-date equipment for the people who protect us from \n     epidemics and infectious diseases, by hiring people to repair \n     environmental damage on federal lands and by contracting with \n     private companies to make federal buildings more energy-\n     efficient.\n       What really irks so many Republicans, of course, is that \n     all the stimulus money isn't being used to cut individual and \n     business taxes, their cure-all for economic ailments, even \n     though all the credible evidence is that tax cuts are only \n     about half as stimulative as direct government spending.\n       Many, including John McCain, lined up this week to support \n     a proposal to make the sales tax and interest payments on any \n     new car purchased over the next two years tax-deductible, \n     along with a $15,000 tax credit on a home purchase. These tax \n     credits make for great sound-bites and are music to the ears \n     of politically active car salesmen and real estate brokers. \n     Most economists, however, have warned that such credits will \n     have limited impact at a time when house prices are still \n     falling sharply and consumers are worried about their jobs \n     and their shrinking retirement accounts. Even worse, they \n     wind up wasting a lot of money because they give windfalls to \n     millions of people who would have bought cars and houses \n     anyway.\n       What adds insults to injury, however, is that many of the \n     senators who supported these tax breaks then turned around \n     and opposed as ``boondoggles'' much more cost-effective \n     proposals to stimulate auto and housing sales, such as having \n     the government replace its current fleet of cars with hybrids \n     or giving money to local housing authorities to buy up \n     foreclosed properties for use as low-income rental housing.\n       Personal economic trainers would confirm all this. Until \n     they're on board, however, here's a little crib sheet on \n     stimulus economics:\n       Spending is stimulus, no matter what it's for and who does \n     it. The best spending is that which creates jobs and economic \n     activity now, has big payoffs later and disappears from \n     future budgets.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I was recently approached, along with my \ncolleague Senator Shelby and leaders of the House Financial Services \nCommittee, by the Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation, Sheila Bair, with a request to increase the FDIC's \nborrowing authority from Treasury from the current $30 billion to $100 \nbillion, for use by the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund, and for \ntemporary additional borrowing authority to weather the economic \ncrisis.\n  The FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund, DIF, absorbs losses that result \nfrom the Corporation's obligation to protect insured deposits when \nFDIC-insured financial institutions fail. Insured financial \ninstitutions pay premiums that support the DIF and under current law \nthose premiums can be increased to cover any losses to the fund. At the \nend of the third quarter of last year, the fund held approximately $35 \nbillion.\n  Legislation to substantially and permanently increase this borrowing \nauthority has already passed the House, as part of the TARP legislation \npassed in January. A scaled back version of it was also incorporated \ninto financial services legislation ordered reported by the House \nFinancial Services Committee earlier this week. Treasury Secretary \nGeithner and Chairman Bernanke of the Federal Reserve Board have also \nrecently written to me underscoring their support for this request.\n  Since the FDIC's borrowing authority was last increased in 1991, the \nasset size of banks has tripled. Even more important, the financial \nsystem is under considerable stress, and the level of thrift and bank \nfailures has been rising. This line of credit is designed strictly to \nserve as a backstop to cover potential losses to the Deposit Insurance \nFund.\n  Though this statutory borrowing authority has historically never been \ntapped, and Chairman Bair has made clear she does not anticipate doing \nso, I agree with Chairman Bair, Secretary Geithner and Chairman \nBernanke that under current economic circumstances such an increase in \nborrowing authority is both prudent and necessary. While the current \nfund has substantial reserves, it is important that we increase this \nline of borrowing authority so that the FDIC has the funds available \nwhich might be needed to meet its obligations to protect insured \ndepositors and to reassure the public that the government continues to \nstand firmly behind the FDIC's insurance guarantee.\n  I had intended to try to incorporate a provision to increase FDIC \nborrowing authority into the Economic Recovery legislation, with \ncertain protections to\n\n[[Page S1791]]\n\nrequire concurrence from other federal officials--including ultimately \nthe President--in exigent circumstances, and at least on a temporary \nbasis. I sought to do this yesterday. Unfortunately, my Republican \ncolleagues made clear that they would object to this proposal at this \ntime. And, for this reason, I will not offer it today. However, I \nintend to work with them and those in the administration to craft a \nproposal that satisfies their concerns in order to ensure that the FDIC \nas the borrowing authority that it needs going forward.\n  I ask unanimous consent that copies of the letters from FDIC Chairman \nBair, Treasury Secretary Geithner, and Fed Chairman Bernanke be printed \nin the Record. I will continue to work to ensure that the FDIC has \nsufficient borrowing authority going forward to deal with a wide range \nof contingencies.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   Federal Deposit\n\n\n                                        Insurance Corporation,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 26, 2009.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your willingness to meet \n     with me to discuss a proposed increase in the borrowing \n     authority of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to \n     cover losses from failed financial institutions.\n       As you know, the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) \n     absorbs losses that result from the Corporation's obligation \n     to protect insured deposits when FDIC-insured financial \n     institutions fail. Insured financial institutions pay \n     premiums that support the DIF and those premiums can be \n     increased to cover losses to the DIF from failed bank \n     activity.\n       At the end of the third quarter of 2008, the DIF had a \n     balance of $35 billion available to absorb losses from the \n     failures of insured institutions. In addition, the FDIC has \n     announced premium increases that are designed to return the \n     DIF reserve ratio to within its statutory range in the coming \n     years. Because of our ability to adjust premiums, the FDIC \n     has never needed to draw on its $30 billion line of credit \n     with the Treasury Department to cover losses. Based on our \n     current assumptions, the FDIC should not need to draw on its \n     statutory line in the future. If it ever became necessary to \n     exercise this borrowing authority, the FDIC would ensure \n     repayment of any borrowing over time through assessments on \n     the banking industry.\n       Nevertheless, the events of the past year have demonstrated \n     the importance of contingency planning to cover unexpected \n     developments in the financial services industry. Assets in \n     the banking industry have tripled since 1991--the last time \n     the line of credit was adjusted in the FDIC Improvement Act \n     (from $5 billion to $30 billion). The FDIC believes it would \n     be appropriate to adjust the statutory line of credit \n     proportionately to ensure that the public has no confusion or \n     doubt about the government's commitment to insured \n     depositors. Therefore, we are requesting the borrowing \n     authority be increased to $100 billion. We also believe it \n     would be prudent to provide that the line of credit could be \n     adjusted further in exigent circumstances by a request from \n     the FDIC Board requiring the concurrence of the Secretary of \n     the Treasury.\n       As I stated above, the FDIC has never used its statutory \n     borrowing authority to cover losses and does not anticipate \n     doing so. However, the banking industry has grown \n     substantially since the current borrowing authority was \n     established. Appropriate adjustments to the current statute \n     would ensure that the FDIC is fully prepared to address any \n     contingency. I respectfully request that Congress increase \n     the FDIC's borrowing authority to provide additional \n     reassurance to depositors that the government stands behind \n     the FDIC's insurance guarantee.\n       If you have any questions regarding this issue, please do \n     not hesitate to contact me or Eric Spitler, Director of \n     Legislative Affairs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Sheila C. Bair,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                Board of Governors\n\n\n                                of the Federal Reserve System,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 2, 2009.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to join the Secretary of \n     the Treasury in expressing my agreement that the authority of \n     the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to borrow \n     from the Treasury Department should be increased to $100 \n     billion from its current level of $30 billion. While the FDIC \n     has substantial resources in the Deposit Insurance Fund, the \n     line of credit with the Treasury Department provides an \n     important back-stop to the fund and has not been adjusted \n     since 1991. An increase in the line of credit is a reasonable \n     and prudent step to ensure that the FDIC can effectively meet \n     potential future obligations during periods such as the \n     difficult and uncertain economic climate that we are \n     currently experiencing.\n       I also support legislation that would allow the Secretary \n     of the Treasury, in consultation with the Chairman of the \n     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System if Congress \n     believes that to be appropriate, to increase the FDIC's line \n     of credit with the Treasury in exigent circumstances. This \n     mechanism would allow the FDIC to respond expeditiously to \n     emergency situations that may involve substantial risk to the \n     financial system.\n       The Federal Reserve would be happy to work with your staff \n     on this matter, as well as on the other amendments under \n     consideration that would allow the FDIC more flexibility in \n     the timing and scope of assessments that it charges to \n     recover costs to the Deposit Insurance Fund in the event that \n     the systemic risk exception in the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Act has been invoked.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Ben S. Bernanke,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                Washington, DC., February 2, 2009.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd, \n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to express my support for \n     the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's (FDIC's) current \n     request to increase its permanent statutory borrowing \n     authority under its line of credit with the Treasury \n     Department from $30 billion to $100 billion. Since the last \n     increase in that authority in 1991, the banking industry's \n     assets have tripled. More importantly, the financial and \n     credit markets continue to be under acute stress, and the \n     level of thrift and bank failures has been rising. Although \n     the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund remains substantial at $35 \n     billion, and the FDIC has never needed to tap the existing \n     line of credit with the Treasury Department in the past, the \n     proposed increase in the limit is a reasonable and prudent \n     step to ensure that the FDIC can effectively meet any \n     potential future obligations.\n       The Treasury Department also supports the FDIC's request to \n     make future adjustments to the line of credit based on \n     exigent circumstances, but recommends that such future \n     adjustments require the concurrence of both the Secretary of \n     the Treasury and the Chairman of the Board of Governors of \n     the Federal Reserve System. This future adjustment mechanism \n     would provide an additional layer of protection for insured \n     depositors and enhance the confidence of financial markets \n     during this turbulent period.\n       The Treasury Department also supports the FDIC having \n     authority to determine the time period for recovering any \n     loss to the insurance fund resulting from actions taken after \n     a systemic risk determination by the Secretary of the \n     Treasury.\n       I hope that you find our views useful in the Committee's \n     consideration of the FDIC's request. Thank you for the \n     opportunity to share these views.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Timothy F. Geithner,\n                                        Secretary of the Treasury.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 427\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an amendment, \namendment No. 427, that Senators Bingaman, Isakson, and I offered to \nhelp mitigate the foreclosure crisis, which is at the root of our \neconomic downturn. Currently, foreclosures are being filed at the rate \nof nearly 10,000 a day; one in six homeowners are underwater; and a \nrecent study shows that U.S. homeowners lost a cumulative $3.3 trillion \nin home equity during 2008. Addressing the foreclosure crisis is key to \nrestoring growth to the economy.\n  According to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, the most effective \nway to reduce foreclosures is to restore positive equity by writing \ndown mortgage principal. In fact, the HOPE for Homeowners program \nrequires principal write-down for participation.\n  Yet, under current tax law, most people who get loan modifications \ninvolving principal reductions would have to pay taxes on the amount of \nthe loan forgiven. This is a significant barrier to people \nparticipating in effective loan modifications and a terrible burden to \nput on struggling families.\n  In 2007, the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act provided a tax \nexemption for forgiven mortgage debt if that mortgage debt was used \nexclusively to purchase or substantially improve the home.\n  However, many homeowners, including a majority of subprime borrowers, \ndid not get their current loans to buy a home. Rather, in many cases, \nthey were steered by unscrupulous mortgage brokers into high-cost \nrefinance loans with hidden features that they did not understand. In \nsome cases, these funds were used to pay health care costs, educational \nor other expenses. Many of these borrowers are now delinquent and \nseeking loan modifications. Too many will end up in foreclosure.\n\n[[Page S1792]]\n\n  These borrowers do not qualify for this current exemption. The threat \nof a large tax bill has dissuaded many homeowners from getting loan \nmodifications.\n  In fact, in their 2008 Annual Report to Congress, the IRS National \nTaxpayer Advocate wrote ``[we] recommend that Congress pass legislation \nto make it easier for financially distressed taxpayers to exclude \ncancelled [forgiven debt] from gross income.''\n  This amendment, by eliminating the income tax on all forgiven \nmortgage debt, would remove a significant obstacle to loan \nmodifications at a cost of $98 million over the next 10 years. This \nbenefit would still expire, as it currently stands, at the end of 2012.\n  In addition, I urge the IRS to ease the burden of complying with the \nreporting requirements that taxpayers face when claiming this \nexclusion.\n  In its 2008 Annual Report to Congress, the IRS's Office of the \nNational Taxpayer Advocate stated that current reporting requirements \n``are so complex that many and probably most taxpayers who qualify to \nexclude [QPRI] from their gross income do not do so.'' QPRI or \nqualified principle residence indebtedness is the technical term the \nIRS uses for tax exempt forgiven mortgage debt. One way the IRS can \nease this burden, is by allowing taxpayers claiming the exemption to \ncalculate the fair market value based on the appraisal value of the \noriginating loan, which should ease the tax filing burden on the \nmillions of Americans who were tricked by predatory lenders. In \naddition, the IRS should simplify the reporting requirement to claim \nthis tax exemption. Right now, taxpayers who claim the QPRI exclusion \nmust file a form, Form 982, that is not well known, is not supported by \nmost tax software programs or Volunteer Income Tax Assistance--VITA--\nprograms, and is extremely complicated. The IRS estimates that it takes \nthe average business taxpayer 10 hours and 43 minutes to complete this \nform.\n  The goals of this amendment are both to expand the definition of QPRI \nto include home equity indebtedness and also to relieve taxpayers from \nthe burden of filing any forms that they would not otherwise need to \nfile but for receiving the benefit of the QPRI exclusion. Specifically, \nI urge the IRS to change Form 1099-C, used for all cancelled debts, not \njust mortgage debts, to include ``check boxes'' for lenders to check \noff when they are forgiving debt that is ``QPRI'' under the new \ndefinition. These check boxes--similar to the check box currently \nprovided for debts discharged in bankruptcy should identify whether the \ntaxpayer is receiving QPRI debt forgiveness and should indicate whether \nthe taxpayer has lost their home, due to a foreclosure, short sale, or \ndeed-in-lieu-of-foreclosure, or will continue to own the home as a \nresult of a loan modification.\n  Check boxes that make clear whether the taxpayer has lost the home \nare important because a taxpayer should not be required to make \nadjustments to the tax basis of the home that they no longer live in. \nIf the homeowner continues to live in their home and the appropriate \nbox is checked, the Form 1099-C will provide the IRS with complete \ninformation about the basis adjustments that will be required due to \nthe QPRI exclusion at the time of the property's sale or disposition. \nThus, as in the case of bankruptcy, the Form 1099-C should provide the \nIRS with sufficient information so that the taxpayer will not be \nrequired to fill out a Form 982 or use the long form 1040 to claim the \nQPRI, and taxpayers who are exempt from filing tax returns will not \nhave to file returns solely to claim this exclusion.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to comment on my \ncosponsorship of an amendment to H.R. 1, the Economic Recovery Act, \nwhich would increase funding in the bill for mass transit by $6.5 \nbillion. I am cosponsoring this amendment, offered by Senator Schumer, \nbecause it will increase funding for ready-to-go public transit \nprojects that will create both jobs and transportation options. While \nthe underlying bill contains $8.4 billion for transit, public transit \nagencies across the Nation identified over $50 billion worth of \nprojects that could be put under contract within a 2-year economic \nrecovery bill, and $12.2 billion which could be implemented within 90 \ndays of Federal funding being allocated. I have heard from transit \nagencies across Pennsylvania that are ready to put people to work and \nimprove transportation options in their communities if Federal stimulus \nfunding is provided. An investment in public transit would also have \nthe benefit of reducing oil consumption and vehicle emissions in \ninstances where increased public transit capacity encourages a shift \nfrom automobiles.\n  However, despite my cosponsorship of this amendment due to its \npotential for stimulus and for improving transportation systems across \nPennsylvania and the Nation, I am not committed to voting for it \nwithout an offset. Since adopting this amendment would add $6.5 billion \nto the size of the bill and to the national deficit, an offset to \nreduce spending elsewhere in the bill by an equal amount would be \npreferable. We should make every effort to identify offset to reduce \nthe total size of the economic recovery bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 390\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate Committee \non Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I wish to speak to amendment \nNo. 390 which would hold recipients of the Troubled Asset Relief \nProgram, TARP, funds accountable for the promises they have made to \nAmerican taxpayers. This amendment would require that financial \ninstitutions, without major capital shortfalls, that receive TARP \nfunds, must increase lending to individuals and businesses--including \nsmall businesses--above their lending levels at the time they received \nFederal assistance.\n  This is a timely and vital amendment for those who are still unable \nto get financing for home and car purchases, business expenses, student \nloans and credit lines, including credit cards. Despite an investment \nof $700 billion in taxpayer funds for the purpose of addressing our \ncountry's major capital shortfalls, our citizens are still struggling \nto access capital. Recent reports from the Government Accountability \nOffice and TARP's Congressional Oversight Panel have indicated that \nbanks are not using TARP funds for lending, and more specifically, that \nlending to businesses and individuals has not experienced a noticeable \nincrease since Congress passed TARP late last year. Further, the \nFederal Reserve's Senior Loan Officer Survey for January indicated that \nU.S. lending institutions have further tightened their business lending \nstance in the past 3 months.\n  Congress's intent was for TARP to restore credit and liquidity to the \nfinancial system so that individuals and businesses can access the \ncapital upon which our system of commerce depends. It is vital to our \ncountry's economic recovery that TARP funds be used to spur lending and \nget capital flowing through our economy quickly, effectively and \ntransparently.\n  On January 29, 2009, I sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Timothy \nGeithner to express my concerns about TARP recipients not using Federal \nfunds for its intended use. I also expressed to Secretary Geithner my \ndisappointment in the Department's opposition to explicitly requiring \nfirms that received Federal funds in the first tranche of TARP \ndistributions to increase lending above baseline levels. The Treasury \nDepartment has refused to apply these conditions to TARP fund \nrecipients retroactively, despite an assurance by National Economic \nCouncil Director Lawrence Summers in a January 15, 2009, letter to \nCongress that, ``As a condition of federal assistance, healthy banks \nwithout major capital shortfalls will increase lending above baseline \nlevels.''\n  By taking Federal dollars and not adhering to Congress's intent, \nrecipients are adding to an already dire economic situation. We must \ndemand that TARP funds be used to spur new lending. Our amendment will \nmandate that as a condition of receiving TARP funds, financial \ninstitutions without major capital shortfalls must increase their \nlending above baseline levels. Additionally, the amendment contains a \nprovision requiring such financial institutions to immediately repay \nassistance provided under the TARP if the Secretary of the Treasury \ndetermines that they have not made sufficient progress toward achieving \nthese requirements.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to have \nthis amendment included in the stimulus bill to help ensure that \ntaxpayer funds\n\n[[Page S1793]]\n\nare used to judiciously rebuild our Nation's economy.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 525\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of Senator \nReid's amendment 525, which I cosponsored.\n  This amendment will improve renewable energy permitting and give \nrenewable energy companies grants to replace the renewable energy tax \ncredits.\n  Specifically, Senator Reid's amendment would appropriate $25 million \nto the Department of Energy and the Department of Interior to assist in \nrenewable energy permitting; establish pilot offices in Western States \nto focus on renewable energy permitting, to be funded with oil and gas \nroyalties; allow projects utilizing new renewable energy technology, \nnot just ``commercial'' technology, to apply for Federal renewable \nenergy loan guarantees; and establish a DOE grant program for renewable \nenergy development, to substitute for the solar investment tax credit \nand the renewable production tax credit.\n  Let me explain why this amendment is needed.\n  First, let me discuss permitting.\n  First, Senator Reid and I propose $25 million to assist in renewable \nenergy permitting. In California, BLM has more than 200 solar \napplications pending, and it has yet to complete a single application \nreview.\n  The Bureau is overwhelmed, and it needs a relatively small investment \nin resources to ensure that it can quickly analyze how these project \nproposals impact water resources, endangered species habitat, and \nwilderness areas. Without these resources, we simply will not build the \nrenewable energy projects that we need in the West.\n  In addition to adding financial resources, the amendment would \nestablish pilot offices in Western States to focus on renewable energy \npermitting.\n  Senator Tester and I introduced legislation to establish these \noffices, and BLM established them administratively in January. The \noffices would be funded with oil and gas royalties, to assure that they \nhave the resources necessary to process the rapid influx of \napplications.\n  Second, let me discuss financing.\n  The amendment would also modify the title 17 renewable loan guarantee \nprogram so that it may guarantee loans for emerging renewable \ntechnology, not just ``commercial'' technology.\n  Solar thermal facilities, the most advanced wind turbines, and \nenhanced geothermal projects are often the most economical renewable \nprojects available, but they are considered emerging because they are \nthe first of their type in the world.\n  The loan guarantee program in this legislation would exclude them. \nThis change allows them to compete with wind projects.\n  Finally, let me explain the need for a grant program to replace the \ncurrent tax credit system.\n  The amendment would establish a DOE grant program for renewable \nenergy development. Grants would equal the value of the solar \ninvestment tax credit or the renewable production tax credit, which it \nwould replace. For the next 2 years, renewable projects could claim the \ngrants at a time when tax equity markets simply cannot support \nsignificant renewable energy production.\n  Last year Congress made a significant investment in solar and other \nrenewable energy by passing a long term extension to the renewable \nenergy investment and production tax credits.\n  But renewable energy companies must go to big banks--JP Morgan, Wells \nFargo, or Bank of America--in order to use these tax credits, and today \nthose banks don't have profits and are sending renewable developers \naway emptyhanded.\n  The ``tax equity'' market has gone from $5 billion to $2 billion in 1 \nyear. One good wind developer recently told me he went to 42 banks and \ncouldn't find a partner.\n  The few banks still in the business are increasing their profit \nmargin. This is all transaction costs, benefiting the bankers and the \nlawyers who write these contracts but not renewable energy development. \nAs the bank's cut goes up, the cost of renewable energy goes up as \nwell.\n  As a result, solar and wind companies are contracting. Some have shut \ndown, some have scaled back, but no one is building renewable energy \ninfrastructure. We are losing both green jobs and the fight against \nclimate change.\n  The DOE grants program in this amendment would replace the tax \ncredits.\n  The shrinking tax equity market would no longer harm renewable energy \ndevelopers, who could get back to the business of shifting the United \nStates away from coal and gas towards renewable energy.\n  According to a study by Navigant Consulting in 2008, the 8-year \nextension to the solar investment tax credit should produce 276,000 \njobs by 2016.\n  Mr. President, 150,000 of these jobs were forecast to be located in \nCalifornia. If the freeze in the available credit for solar project \ndevelopment is allowed to continue, not only will these jobs not \nmaterialize, but current ``green jobs'' will be lost.\n  This legislation provides some assistance to renewable energy, but \nwithout this amendment, I fear the bill will not have its intended \neffect of spurring immediate construction of renewable energy projects.\n  Right now renewable energy projects--which are massive capital \ninvestments--are not being built. Developers face a series of problems: \nMany projects await permits from DOE, the Forest Service, and the \nDepartment of Interior. Developers cannot use tax equity markets in \norder to utilize Federal tax credits, and without these tax credits, \nprojects cannot secure private financing.\n  This amendment--put simply--addresses these three major challenges \nthat prevent us from building renewable energy projects in the United \nStates.\n  To address permitting, it establishes offices at BLM whose only job \nwill be to evaluate and issue permit decisions.\n  To address the tax issue, this amendment creates a DOE grant program \nthat should cost the Treasury nothing we didn't already expect to \nspend. But it will allow projects to proceed that would not be able to \nwithout it.\n  Finally, to address the credit crisis, this amendment modifies the \nloan guarantee program to assure that innovative ideas also qualify.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we consider the provisions of \nthis legislation that provide significant incentives for the adoption \nof health information technology I would like to take this opportunity \nto explain a seemingly technical element of the language. The term \n``qualified electronic health record,'' as defined in section 3000 of \nthe Public Health Service Act, as added by section 13101 of the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 is intended to include \ncomputerized provider order entry systems. Such systems are electronic \nrecords of health information on an individual. They include patient \ndemographic data and health information, such as medical history and \nproblem lists, including patient age, gender and allergy information as \nwell as laboratory reports. Computerized provider order entry systems \nalso have the capacity to provide clinical decision support such as \nmedication dosing and interaction alerts, to capture and query \ninformation related to health care quality such as changes in \nlaboratory values, and responses and reaction to medications, and to \nexchange electronic health information with, and integrate such \ninformation from other sources such as medication lists from a pharmacy \nor clinical information from a provider practice. Of course, the end \ngoal is development and implementation of comprehensive, integrated \nelectronic health records, and computerized provider order entry \nsystems are an important intermediate step.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, at this most consequential of \ntimes, in support of the amendment that I have submitted, together with \nSenator Pryor, on behalf of our Nation's struggling communities that \nare negatively affected by base closures or realignments. During even \nthe best of economic times, the closure or realignment of a military \nbase can devastate a local economy. With the gravity of our economic \ncircumstances--the most dire we have witnessed since the Great \nDepression--it is more difficult than ever for these communities to \nredevelop and stem job losses.\n\n[[Page S1794]]\n\n  My amendment would recognize that communities affected by base \nclosures and realignments face particular challenges in this dismal \neconomy and therefore special consideration should be given to provide \nassistance and relief under this stimulus act to those communities. I \nmust point out that this amendment would not create a preference or \nentitlement, but would remind all of the critical need to help \ncommunities impinged by the closure or realignment of military \ninstallations.\n  For instance, with the closure of Naval Air Station Brunswick, NASB, \nin my home State of Maine, the entire midcoast region of Maine will \nexperience profoundly negative economic consequences attributable to an \nestimated loss of 6,500 jobs and $140 million in annual income. Given \nthese challenging economic times, it is imperative that we make every \neffort to foster redevelopment in communities affected by base \nclosures.\n  I respectfully ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak about an issue of regional equity with \nregard to the recovery package and specifically about our forestry \nprograms. I strongly believe that in order for our forest economies to \nwork we must collaborate on national forestry whether it is Federal \nlands, or private lands. I am concerned that this proposal will \nstrongly benefit one region with Federal lands over those with private \nlands and strongly urge leadership to overhaul the structure of this \nproposal with regard to our forest economies.\n  Our Nation's forests are a strategic national resource which span \nfrom Maine to California and Alaska to Puerto Rico. Over 60 percent are \nin private ownership. In order to provide regional equity, it is \nimportant that within the broad categories of construction and wildland \nfire management, flexibility will be provided to address a wide range \nof actions all aimed at stimulating the Nation's economy. These include \nmaintaining and enhancing the Nation's forest products industry; \nhazardous fuels reduction; improvements in forest health; wood-to-\nenergy grants; rehabilitation and restoration activities on Federal, \nState, and private lands; assisting State and local fire agencies \nresponsible for wildfire preparedness and suppression, and urban and \ncommunity forest enhancements.\n  These activities can be accomplished through existing State and \nprivate forestry authorizations and programs. In order to address \ncurrent economic conditions, I believe this economic stimulus bill \nshould not require any matching funds and shall seek to maximize \neconomic activity, job retention, and creation.\n  I look forward to working with the Appropriations Committee chair on \nthis critical issue.\n  Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, I wish today, with Senator Landrieu, to \nfile this bipartisan and commonsense amendment that would strengthen \nthe innovative opportunities of small businesses who participate in the \nSmall Business Innovation Research, SBIR, and Small Business Technology \nTransfer, STTR, programs and help them receive funding provided in the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, H.R. 1.\n  Our amendment would require that any qualifying participating Federal \nagency allocate a percentage of its research and development funding \ngained from this economic stimulus bill to their respective SBIR or \nSTTR programs. The SBIR and STTR programs award Federal research and \ndevelopment funds to small businesses to encourage them to innovate and \ncommercialize new technologies, products, and services. These programs \nprovide more than $2 billion in Federal research and development \nfunding each year to small businesses, and the benefit to my State of \nMaine cannot be overstated. According to the most recent data, in \nfiscal year 2005, Maine's technology-based small businesses received \nmore than $4.5 million in SBIR total awards.\n  Since the SBIR program was created, small hi-tech firms have \nsubmitted more than 250,000 proposals, resulting in more than 60,000 \nawards worth approximately $19 billion. At a time when our national \neconomy is flagging due to failing financial markets and a correcting \nhousing market, the SBIR program is more essential than ever, if we are \nto capitalize on the groundbreaking capacities of our Nation's \npioneering small businesses.\n  Now, more than ever, we in Congress must do everything within our \npower to help small businesses drive the recovery of our economy. It is \nimperative that we do everything we can to stimulate our economy and \nthe small-tech firms of this Nation can help lead the way.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport this amendment and to provide all innovative small businesses \nwith opportunities to grow our Nation's innovative infrastructure.\n  Mr. President, the Tax Code currently requires small business owners \nto prepay their income taxes on a quarterly basis. To determine what is \nowed, the owners calculate 110 percent of the previous year's tax \nliability and then pay one-fourth of that amount each quarter of the \nfollowing year.\n  The purpose of requiring businesses to pay 110 percent of the \nprevious year's tax liability is so that the government is sure to \ncollect the taxes owed, even when businesses are growing. \nUnfortunately, our economy has been in a recession and climbing out of \nit is not likely to be quick. We are in a credit crunch and the cash \nflow of American businesses is slow. Because of the recession and the \ncredit crunch, the overpayment of quarterly income taxes by America's \nsmall businesses is both unnecessary and harmful.\n  It is unnecessary because in this recession there will be few \nbusinesses that meet the hurdle of a 10-percent rate of growth to match \na 10-percent overpayment of taxes. Perhaps bankruptcy lawyers will be \nable to meet or exceed this growth target, but having the Tax Code push \nmore customers their way is what I would like to avoid. Having small \nbusiness owners pay 110 percent of their 2008 tax liability imposes one \nmore cash flow burden that I fear could push small businesses into dire \nstraits.\n  Paying 10 percent more taxes than were owed for 2008 imposes a \nsignificant cash flow burden on small business. This additional tax is \nlikely to end up as an interest free loan to the U.S. Government \nbecause the excess tax will be refunded after the 2009 return is filed. \nIt makes no sense for small businesses to be floating the government an \ninterest free loan at a time when we are trying to find ways to \nalleviate their cash flow troubles and find ways to create or maintain \njobs.\n  I will offer an amendment to help small businesses with their cash \nflow and not require them to give the government an interest-free loan \nin 2009. The amendment is written so that on a quarterly basis, \nindividuals who earned less than $500,000 in 2008 and, earned more than \nhalf of their income from a business with 500 or fewer employees, would \ncertify to this information on their quarterly return. Then they would \nbe allowed to make quarterly payments of only 75 percent of their 2008 \ntax liability, rather than 110 percent. There are small business owners \nwho make less than $150,000 who are required to prepay 100 percent of \nthe previous year's liability who will also be allowed to make \nquarterly payments of 75 percent of the previous year's liability.\n  Small business owners are most often taxed as sole proprietorships, \nsubchapter S corporations or partnerships. In any of these forms of \nownership, the business income is reflected on each individual owner's \ntaxes. The amendment helps small business cash flow by not forcing the \nbusiness to make bigger distributions to help pay bigger quarterly tax \nbills. Not every investor in a partnership or a subchapter S \ncorporation is making their living running the business but this \namendment tries to get to those who need it most by requiring more than \nhalf of a taxpayer's income must be from businesses that have fewer \nthan 500 employees.\n  For businesses, like bankruptcy lawyers, who know they are having a \nbanner year, my amendment is silent. I do not require that they \nwithhold only 75 percent. They are free to continue voluntarily sending \nmore to the IRS to cover their expected good earnings and increased tax \nliability.\n  I do not have an estimate of the cost of this amendment from the \nJoint Committee on Taxation. However, I\n\n[[Page S1795]]\n\nwould expect the revenue estimate to be modest since this is a 1-year \ncash flow difference between taxes due quarterly during 2009 and the \nfinal tax bill that is due in 2010. Since the 110 percent payments \nwould have likely resulted in tax refunds in 2010, I wouldn't expect \nthere to be much revenue lost.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak on amendment No. 539 I am offering \nwhich could help to steer our economy toward economic recovery. There \nis no question that America's small businesses are the engine that \ndrives our Nation's economy, constituting 99.7 percent of all employer \nfirms, employing nearly half of the private sector workforce, and \ncreate three-quarters of net new jobs annually over the last decade. If \nan economic stimulus plan is to succeed, it must include a sharp focus \non job creation by small businesses. To that end, I humbly request that \nmy colleagues support this noncontroversial amendment that will ensure \nsmall businesses--our Nation's true job generators--will not be \nshortchanged at a time when the economy is struggling to grow and \ncreate jobs.\n  Mr. President, my amendment builds upon this initiative to underscore \nthe economic value of small businesses in Federal agencies across the \nboard. This measure would mobilize existing Federal loan guarantee \nprograms by requiring the heads of key agencies, including the \nDepartment of Agriculture; the Department of Energy; the Department of \nHomeland Security; the Department of Labor; and the Environmental \nProtection Agency, to work with the Administrator of the SBA to the \nmaximum extent practicable, to guarantee robust small business \nparticipation in each agency's respective loan programs.\n  As ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I wholeheartedly believe that small businesses play a \ncentral role in our economy and that the Federal Government should \nfoster a nurturing entrepreneurial environment that fully equips our \nsmall businesses with the tools not just to mitigate and stem this \neconomic crisis, but to be a catalyst for helping to address and \nultimately solve it.\n  That is why Senator Landrieu, the new chair of the Small Business \nCommittee, and I have called on President Obama, in a joint letter we \nsent on January 29, 2009, to sign an Executive order to elevate the \nAdministrator of the Small Business Administration, SBA, to Cabinet-\nlevel status within the first 100 days of his administration.\n  This designation will send a clear signal that small business will \ndrive our Nation out of this recession. The SBA is the primary agency \nwithin the Federal Government tasked with the responsibility of \nassisting small businesses, and it should have a seat at the table when \nit comes to revitalizing the economy, a top national priority. Frankly, \nin the past, the Federal Government has neglected to place enough \nemphasis on the resources and programs that could benefit America's 26 \nmillion small businesses.\n  The present economic crisis presents an opportunity to get capital \nnow to small businesses so they can create jobs now. This amendment \nwould take the swiftest path by mobilizing presently existing, \npresently funded Federal programs that have already been authorized by \nCongress, to include the interests of small business in their loan \nprograms.\n  I respectfully ask my colleagues on both sides of the political aisle \nto support this amendment to facilitate the strength of small \nbusinesses in helping our Nation create jobs and grow during this \neconomic crisis.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n\n                     Health Information Technology\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to ask a question \nthrough the Chair to my good friend from Massachusetts, Senator \nKennedy. Is my friend aware that the legislation before us today, the \nEconomic Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, contains a provision \nwhich would establish the Office of the National Coordinator for Health \nInformation Technology within the Department of Health and Human \nServices and instruct the National Coordinator to support and \nfacilitate the use of electronic health records for Americans?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is correct. There are a few provisions in the \nlegislation that address this issue directly. Subsection \n3001(c)(3)(A)(ii) of the bill tasks the national coordinator with \nupdating the Federal Health IT Strategic Plan to include specific \nobjectives, milestones, and metrics with respect to ``the utilization \nof an electronic health record for each person in the United States by \n2014.'' Subsection 3001(c)(6)(E) requires the national coordinator to \n``estimate and publish resources required annually to reach the goal of \nutilization of an electronic health record for each person in the \nUnited States by 2014, including the required level of Federal funding, \nexpectations for regional, State, and private investment, and the \nexpected contributions by volunteers to activities for the utilization \nof such records.'' In addition, subsection 3002(b)(2)(B)(iii) of the \nbill designates the Health Information Technology Policy Committee with \nthe task of making recommendations to the national coordinator for the \n``utilization of a certified electronic health record for each person \nin the United States by 2014.''\n  Mr. HATCH. It will come as no surprise to anyone to know that many \nAmericans will be skeptical of the creation of a national database and \ncentral repository of health records. Indeed, one group which is \nparticularly concerned with this provision would be those who do not \nuse medical treatment or interact with the health deliver services in \nthis country. Therefore, I would again ask my friend, through the \nchair, does the language in these subsections attempting to establish \n``the utilization of an electronic health record for each person in the \nUnited States by 2014'' require those who do not use medical treatment \nto go to a doctor for a physical examination in order to have an \nelectronic health record created?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No, it does not. Nothing in this bill should be \ninterpreted as requiring those who do not use medical care to have an \nelectronic health record, or requiring any individual to have an \nelectronic record. The intention is that the national coordinator will \nwork towards the goal of having all patients that utilize the services \nof ``health care providers,'' as defined in this act, to have available \nto them records in an interoperable electronic format instead of merely \nin paper form by the year 2014. Those who do not receive care and \nservices from ``health care providers'' will not be required to have an \nelectronic health record, nor will any individual be required to have \nan electronic medical record. This bill does not require the use of \nelectronic medical records, but seeks to make such records more broadly \navailable.\n\n\n        Direct and Guaranteed Farm Ownership and Operating Loans\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, while the current economic downturn did \nnot begin in rural America, the full brunt of the impact is certainly \nbeing felt by many of our farmers and small rural communities now. The \ndairy sector has been especially hard hit in Wisconsin and across the \nNation as evidenced by a call last week for the USDA to take additional \nactions to help remove a surplus of dairy products from our markets in \na letter led by the senior Senator from Wisconsin and myself and signed \nby 33 other Members including the distinguished chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee. A provision in the current legislation also \ntakes another important step to help soften the landing for farmers \nfacing drops in the prices they receive of approximately 50 percent as \nwe are seeing in dairy over the recent months. I am very appreciative \nof the fact that the Appropriations Committee includes critically \nneeded farm loan funding for direct and guaranteed ownership and \noperation loans for our Nation's family farmers who are struggling \nalong with everyone else through this economic recession. It is \ncritical they get access to the financing they need to stay in business \nand keep their operations intact. It is my assumption that the interest \nof both the Appropriations and the authorizing committee in having this \nfarm loan funding in the bill is to ensure that current farming \noperations and facilities can continue to operate and that small family \nfarms and beginning and minority farmers have access to capital to \nsecure new farming opportunities. I also think it is important to\n\n[[Page S1796]]\n\nensure that USDA loan programs such of these do not inadvertently \nencourage expanded production in sectors of agriculture, including \ndairy, where prices are depressed and farmers are trying to cope with \nrevenues below the cost of production prices. I hope to continue to \nwork with the chairman of both the Agriculture Committee and \nAgriculture Appropriations Subcommittee to oversee the utilization of \nthese funds to minimize any inadvertent negative effects if they exist.\n  Mr. KOHL. I appreciate my colleague's remarks. I was pleased to \ncollaborate with him on the dairy letter he just referenced, and I am \nglad to note his support for the work the committee has done to address \nthe credit demands confronting family farmers. My expectation is that \nthe USDA will utilize these resources in accordance with the programs \nand priorities set forth in the farm bill. Family farming and ranching \nbusinesses are facing many of the same challenges confronting our \nbroader economy and the operating and farm loans contemplated under the \nbill are extremely important.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would like to first thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee for working to include Farm \nService Agency loan program money in this bill. In the coming months \nfarmers will be applying for operating loans for the spring planting \nseason. They will face tighter credit standards from lenders. Some \nfarmers who were eligible for commercial credit last year may not be \neligible this year.\n  Access to adequate and affordable credit is vital to our Nation's \nfarmers and ranchers--particularly now. Like many people across the \nNation, farmers are feeling the impact of the economic downturn. The \ndecline in commodity prices, high input costs, and declining exports \nhave significantly strained producers' fiscal circumstances. It is \nimportant the money provided in this bill be used in accordance with \nthe priorities established in the farm loan programs and focus on those \neligible borrowers who are struggling to maintain their farming \noperations.\n  Regarding the recent sharp decline in dairy prices, I was pleased to \nwork my colleagues on the letter to Secretary Vilsack to help remove a \nsurplus of dairy products from the markets which they have both \nmentioned.\n\n\n                Comparative Effectiveness Research Funds\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I understand Senator Enzi has comments regarding the \nprovisions for comparative clinical effectiveness research included in \nThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 which is being \nconsidered in the Senate this week.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator. It is my understanding that the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 has in its health \nprovisions $1.1 billion in new funds for comparative clinical \neffectiveness research. This is an important issue to me as HELP \nCommittee ranking member. I am pleased to see that in its consideration \nof this bill, the Appropriations Committee made sure this research will \nevaluate comparative clinical effectiveness, not comparative cost-\neffectiveness. In addition, the committee's report language references \nprovisions of the existing comparative effectiveness research program \nat HHS that ensure that the agency developing comparative information \ndoes not use it to set national practice standards or coverage \nrestrictions. I also believe that comparative effectiveness research \nmust be conducted using an open and transparent process, and must \nconsider differences in how people respond to treatment. It is my \nunderstanding that the Comparative Effectiveness Research Act of 2008, \nwhich you introduced with Senator Conrad last Congress, is consistent \nwith these principles. I would like to see the $1.1 billion used \nconsistently with these principles, and ask that you advocate for these \nprinciples in conference.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator for his support of these principles. \nI agree with the Senator's summary of S. 3408, the Comparative \nEffectiveness Research Act of 2008, which would create a permanent \ninstitute to prioritize and provide for comparative clinical \neffectiveness research for the U.S. I support including short-term \nfunds for such research in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. \nI applaud the Appropriations Committee for clarifying that research \nshould evaluate comparative clinical effectiveness, not cost-\neffectiveness. And I agree that the $1.1 billion should be used \nconsistently with the principles in S. 3408 from the 110th Congress. \nSenator Conrad and I plan to reintroduce our bill because we still need \na long-term framework for this type of research in the U.S.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank Senator Enzi for his support of these principles. \nComparative clinical effectiveness research needs to be a permanent \npart of our health system. It is one of the ways we will improve health \ncare for all Americans. I look forward to working with him on this \neffort.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I appreciate the remarks of Senator Enzi. Comparative \neffectiveness research should focus on clinical outcomes and produce \ninformation that patients and providers can use to make better \ndecisions about their treatment options. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues on this important issue.\n  Mr. CARPER. Like my colleagues, I support comparative effectiveness \nresearch that builds on the principles set forth in S. 3408 from the \n110th Congress. Clinical comparative effectiveness research has the \ncapability of improving health care quality by advancing evidence-based \ndecisionmaking in our health care system. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues on this important issue.\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree that the primary focus of comparative \neffectiveness research should be clinical effectiveness not cost. We \ncan all agree that the ``one size fits all'' approach is the wrong \napproach for the American health care system. Based on our own personal \nexperiences we all know that what works best for one person, does not \nalways work the same for another. I look forward to working in a \nbipartisan and inclusive manner to come up with prudent legislation \nthat will not only help us realize the true potential of comparative \neffectiveness but also preserve patient choice and innovation--the two \nhallmarks of our health care system.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I would associate myself with the remarks of Senator \nEnzi, and would underscore that it is very important to require full \nopenness, transparency and accountability in how research priorities \nare set and how studies are conducted and communicated. Without this \nopenness, patients have no assurance that their voice will be heard in \nthe process, and no ability to understand how results are being used in \ndecisions that directly affect their health. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to ensure that strong provisions for openness, \ntransparency, and accountability are put in place.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank my colleagues for their efforts on this \nissue. I agree that comparative effectiveness research holds great \npromise to improve medical care by giving physicians and patients \nvaluable information on treatment options.\n  It is my understanding that the new Federal coordinating council \nincluded in the language is intended to coordinate the comparative \neffectiveness research efforts taking place across Federal agencies and \nwith funds we are providing in this bill. However, there is some \nconcern that the language, as currently written, allows the council to \nexpand its activities beyond mere coordination. I think my colleagues \nwould agree that the purpose of the council is to coordinate \ncomparative effectiveness research activities with the goal of reducing \nduplicative efforts and encouraging coordinated and complementary use \nof resources.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank Senator Feinstein for pointing that out. I agree. \nThe coordinating council should look across agencies to coordinate \nresources and activities of the federal government with respect to \ncomparative effectiveness research. Its charge should not go beyond \nthat. The language of the bill could be clarified to make that point \nclear. And I will support clarification of it in conference.\n\n\n                           Workforce training\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to engage my good friend, \nthe Senator from Iowa and the chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor, \nHHS, and Education Appropriations in a colloquy.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to commend my good friend on \nhis strong support for the education and\n\n[[Page S1797]]\n\ntraining of America's workers. As you know, I serve as chairman of the \nSenate Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety. The Senator and \nI have worked together on many initiatives on behalf of our workforce. \nThat is why I would like to clarify certain provisions contained in the \nbill before us today that pertain to job training for U.S. workers.\n  First, is it the Senator's understanding that the additional funding \nprovided through the Workforce Investment Act formula grants for adults \nand dislocated workers will be used predominantly for the direct \ndelivery of services to those who are the most heavily impacted by this \nrecession--the unemployed and the underemployed?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, the Senator's understanding is correct. I included a \nprovision in this recovery bill that reinforces the requirement in the \nWIA to use adult State grant funding to serve certain priority \npopulations, such as those with low incomes or on public assistance. I \nbelieve that we should target these funds on the delivery of services \nto those who have been adversely impacted by our recent economic \ncrisis. I also believe local workforce boards should utilize existing \nauthority to support needs-related payments to help engage individuals \nin training, if such support is appropriate and effective.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Is it also the Senator's understanding that the most \ninnovative strategies with proven effectiveness in putting people back \nto work in high demand occupations, including sector-based and career \npathways initiatives that are focused on green jobs, health care and \nother viable industries, should be utilized to the extent possible in \ncarrying out the delivery of these employment and training services?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Absolutely, it is essential that the workforce services \nprovided through this legislation, are delivered through the most \neffective means possible, ensuring that the unemployed and \nunderemployed are provided with relevant employment and training \nassistance that will enable them to find good, family sustaining jobs. \nIt is also essential that these programs provide the skills that are \nrelevant to local and regional employers that will help to rebuild our \nregional and U.S. economies.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. As my friend from Iowa knows, older workers have been \nparticularly devastated by our current economic downturn. A recent \nUrban Institute publication reported that job loss for older workers is \nat a 31-year high. Is it the intent of this legislation that older \nworkers will be a key population targeted for services with these \nadditional resources?\n  Is it further the understanding of the chairman that funding under \nthe adult formula grants will focus on serving individuals with \nmultiple barriers to employment, particularly those with low skill \nlevels, to obtain the education, skills training and support services \nthey need to obtain jobs in high demand occupations, particularly in \ngreen jobs, healthcare, and other viable industries?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is correct. As chairman of the Labor \nAppropriations subcommittee, I supported the $120 million in the \nrecovery bill for the senior community service employment program. \nThese funds will support employment and training opportunities for low-\nincome, older Americans. The funds benefit both older Americans hurt by \nthe current economic crisis and community service organizations \nstruggling to keep up with increased demand under decreasing budgets.\n  Individuals with multiple barriers to employment, including older \nworkers, those with low skill levels, and individuals with \ndisabilities, should indeed be an important focus of services for the \nfunding provided to the Department of Labor. Offering these workers, \nparticularly low skilled workers, the tools they need to secure good \njobs in new or growing industry sectors can help them enhance their \nquality of life and achieve economic self-sufficiency as a member of \nthe middle class.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. With regard to the funding for youth activities under \nthe legislation, is it the Senator's understanding that in addition to \nsummer and year-round employment opportunities, this funding may be \nused to provide related educational enrichment, including remediation, \nskills training, and supportive services that enable participants to \nwork in high demand occupational areas, such as in the green jobs and \nhealth care industries, with the goal that such employment and \nenrichment activities will lead to further education or employment?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is correct. While the primary purpose of this \nfunding is to provide meaningful paid work experiences for at risk \nyouth, educational enrichment, necessary skills training, and support \nservices that enable young people to participate and succeed in these \nand future endeavors are necessary and fully support the intent of the \nlegislation.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. In the workforce provisions under consideration, we \nprovide that training may be provided for jobs in high-demand \noccupations, through the award of contracts to institutions of higher \neducation, as long as a customer's choice is not limited. Is it the \nSenator's understanding that such training may include the provision of \nadult basic education or English language education services, as long \nas these services are provided in connection with a job for which the \nindividual is preparing? Is it the Senator's further understanding that \nthese services may be provided through community colleges and other \nhigh quality public programs that offer postsecondary education and \ntraining within a community or region?\n  Mr. HARKIN. My colleague is correct. This provision was included in \nthe recovery bill to facilitate the use of funds provided to train \nindividuals in the areas needed in their local community. It would be \nmy expectation that a very significant portion of the funds provided \nwould be spent quickly and effectively in training individuals in \nhealth care and other high-demand occupations, as well as emerging \n``green'' industries.\n\n\n                     Investing in America's Workers\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I would like to engage my friend and \ncolleague, the Senator from Washington State, in a colloquy.\n  I want to commend my good friend's work on behalf of America's \nworkers, including the growing number of workers who have lost their \njobs and need skill training and other services to secure good jobs in \nnew or viable industries, including those that are retrofitting \nthemselves to improve longer term global competitiveness. These \nindustries promote energy efficiency, energy conservation, and \nenvironmental protection in such industries as advanced manufacturing, \nauto, aerospace, health care, and others.\n  As Senator Murray has rightly stated during conversations on this \nrecovery bill, investing in job creation should be accompanied by \ninvestments in workers, an essential component to strengthening our \nNation's productivity and long-term competitiveness. These workers \ninclude the increasing number unemployed or underemployed individuals \nacross the country and the thousands of manufacturing workers who have \nlost their jobs, such as those in the aerospace industry and the \nautomotive industry. In her role as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee \non Employment and Workplace Safety, we have worked together to help \nworkers, particularly those in distressed industries, acquire the \nskills they need to secure family-supporting jobs in viable and \nemerging industries including the energy efficient and advanced drive \ntrain vehicle industry, the biofuels industry, and the energy-efficient \nbuilding, construction, and retrofits industries. That is why I would \nlike to clarify several provisions contained in the bill before us \ntoday that pertain to job training for workers. As the Senator knows, \nmy home State of Michigan has experienced major economic dislocations \nfrom manufacturing plant closures and industry layoffs.\n  I would like to first ask the esteemed Senator from Washington State \nif it is her understanding that worker training in these industries \nwould be eligible for consideration by the Secretary of Labor under the \nnational emergency grant and competitive grant funding sections of the \nworkforce provisions of this bill?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes, the Senator from Michigan State is correct. It is \nmy understanding that the Secretary of Labor will use these funds to \nhelp retool workers who have lost their jobs due to the recession and \ndeclining industries, including those in the green-\n\n[[Page S1798]]\n\ncollar industries the Senator mentioned.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Is it also the Senator's understanding that the most \neffective strategies in helping workers maintain and secure new jobs in \nemerging and viable industries, including the energy efficient and \nadvanced drive train vehicle industry, the biofuels industry, the \nenergy-efficient building, construction, and retrofits industries, and \nthe aerospace industry are those supported by strategic partnerships \namong State and local workforce boards; institutions of higher \neducation, including community colleges and other training providers; \nlabor organizations; industry; and economic development entities that \nuse sector or cluster-based training approaches for developing job \ntraining strategies and career pathway initiatives that lead to \neconomic self-sufficiency?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Michigan is correct and makes an \nimportant point. Effective strategies for helping workers retool for \njobs in viable industries should be informed by the critical \nstakeholders she noted. It is my hope that when distributing these \nfunds, the Secretary of Labor gives due deference to those eligible \nentities with strategic partnerships among representatives from the \naffected industries, labor organizations, workforce investment boards, \nelected officials, and institutions of higher education, including \ncommunity colleges and other training providers.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I would like to thank my distinguished colleague from \nWashington. I look forward to working with her in the future to ensure \nthat investing in America's workers remains a critical component of our \nnational economic recovery and growth strategy.\n\n\n                             Long-Term Care\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to enter a colloquy with my good \nfriend, the Senator from Montana, and the senior Senator from \nWisconsin, one of the chief authors of this amendment and the \ndistinguished chair of the Special Committee on Aging. I would like to \ntalk about the importance of investing in the long-term care workforce \nin order to provide good care for seniors and the disabled. \nSpecifically, I would like to discuss the inclusion of long-term care \nreforms in the health reform bill.\n  Chairman Kohl and I have worked together on the Long-Term Care Worker \nRecruitment and Investment Demonstration Program Amendment to the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 because direct care jobs \nare a 21st century growth industry. With the aging of the baby boomer \ngeneration, this workforce will need to grow substantially if we are to \nmeet the coming demand for both medical and nonmedical support services \ndelivered in the home and in small community residences, as well as in \nmore traditional nursing homes and assisted living facilities. However, \ntoday, we are not on track to achieve this goal.\n  In order to meet the future health needs of older adults and recruit \nand retain a stable and competent long-term care workforce, the \nCongress, State governments, and the Obama administration need to work \ntogether.\n  Mr. KOHL. We already have a shortage of health care workers who are \ntrained and devoted to caring for older Americans and those with \ndisabilities--a fact that is well documented in the report issued by \nthe Institute of Medicine last year. This shortage is one that will \nonly grow more desperate as our country ages rapidly. The United States \nwill not be able to meet the approaching demand for health care and \nlong-term care without a workforce that is prepared for the job.\n  Between 2005 and 2030, it is estimated that the number of adults aged \n65 and older will almost double from 37 million to over 70 million, \nincreasing from 12 percent of the population of the United States to \nalmost 20 percent of the population. So it is not surprising that the \nDepartment of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that personal \nor home care aides and home health aides will represent the second and \nthird fastest growing occupations between 2006 and 2016.\n  Only last week, the New York Times published an editorial concluding \nthat, ``With more jobs being lost all the time across the board--more \nthan 71,000 layoffs in the United States were announced on Monday and \nTuesday alone--there should be comfort in the fact that one sector, \nhealth care, continues to add jobs.'' I will ask to have this editorial \nprinted in the Record.\n  Government has a special obligation to care for vulnerable \npopulations. Inadequate training in geriatrics, gerontology, chronic \ncare management, and long-term care is known to cause misdiagnoses, \nmedication errors, and inadequate coordination of services and \ntreatments that result in poor care and are costly for the health care \nsystem as a whole. Yet personal and home care aides are not subject to \nany Federal requirements related to training or education, and States \nhave very different requirements for this key part of the direct care \nworkforce. Furthermore, Federal training requirements for nurse aides \nand home health aides have not been updated for more than 20 years. It \nis time to review and improve training standards for all direct care \nworkers. Current training protocols focus too much on tasks and too \nlittle on teaching how workers can deliver person-centered care. \nFurther, often training does not reflect the increasingly complex needs \nof the frail elderly. Inadequate training has been found to be a major \ncontributor to high turnover rates among direct care workers, while \nmore training is correlated with better staff recruitment and \nretention.\n  Equally important, the IOM report recommends that State Medicaid \nprograms increase pay and fringe benefits for direct care workers. \nInvestment in direct care jobs would significantly benefit our economy \nby providing greater economic opportunity to low-income workers, while \nalso strengthening health services for our aging and disabled family \nmembers and friends.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Long-term care is in need of rethinking. Right now it is a \nform of Russian roulette for many Americans who pray they can avoid it, \nand with it a fatal financial bullet. Under the current system, we are \nsending older Americans into a long-term care system that is more \nfragile than they are. States are staggering under the weight of \nprojected Medicaid long-term care costs and fear that they will face \neconomic calamity as their baby boom population begins to need \nservices. Similarly, the staggering weight of family caregiving for \nmany ``sandwiched'' adult children, who are caring for their children \nas well as their elderly parents with serious health problems, makes \nsome family members feel like they are staggering too.\n  Every 15 years, since the days of Harry Truman, health care advocates \nhave woken up, looked around, and said, ``This is the moment. This time \nmy dream of universal health care will be achieved.'' Then something \ngoes wrong. That vision is not returned by the powers that be, and the \ndream of finding a health care solution is dashed on the rocks of harsh \nreality.\n  That 15-year reawakening is upon us again, but this time I believe \nthis story might have a different ending because of the leadership of \nthe Senator from Montana and the commitments of Chairmen Kennedy and \nKohl and President Obama.\n  As we work together to tackle health reform and entitlement reform, I \nwant to work with you and Chairman Kohl to include thoughtful health \ncare workforce reforms. Long-term care has been too often overlooked as \nthe health care stepchild, and as we move into what I and many experts \nthink will be our next real window for health reform this year, it will \nbe important to make sure that long-term care is not left behind in the \nhealth reform debate.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I agree with my distinguished colleagues that as we work \nto reform our health care system it is important to consider how the \nhealth care workforce fits into these efforts. Creating a strong, well-\ntrained workforce is a critical part of adequately addressing the needs \nof older adults and individuals with disabilities. An estimated 69 \npercent of people turning 65 years old will need some form of long-term \nassistance as they age. Most individuals that need long-term care \nservices and supports prefer to receive assistance in their homes or \ncommunities. This demand and the need for direct care professionals \nwill only grow as the baby boom population turns 65.\n  Various studies suggest present and future shortages of \nparaprofessionals and health care professionals. Effective recruitment \nand retention strategies are needed. Training programs should be \ndesigned that address the competencies required of a 21st century\n\n[[Page S1799]]\n\nworkforce. As part of this effort we also should look at the skills of \nthose currently delivering long term care services.\n  The purpose of health reform is to achieve a high-performing health \nsystem. Achieving this goal requires an investment in our health \nprofessional and paraprofessional workforce.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the chairman for his recognition of this important \nissue. I look forward to working with him during our consideration of \nhealth care reform this year.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank Senator Wyden and Senator Baucus for their \nattention to these important policies and look forward to working with \nthem in the weeks ahead.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the editorial to which I \nreferred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times; Jan. 28, 2009]\n\n                       Caring for the Caregivers\n\n       With more jobs being lost all the time across the board--\n     more than 71,000 layoffs in the United States were announced \n     on Monday and Tuesday alone--there should be comfort in the \n     fact that one sector, health care, continues to add jobs. In \n     December, employers added 32,000 health-related positions.\n       Unfortunately, one of the fastest-growing areas within the \n     health care field--home care for the elderly--also is one of \n     the lowest paid and most exploitable.\n       Outdated labor rules from 1975 allow home care aides to be \n     defined as companions, which exempts their employers, usually \n     private agencies, from federal standards governing overtime \n     and minimum wages. As the population has aged, however, \n     demand for home care has grown and the work has evolved far \n     beyond companionship. It is not uncommon for home care \n     workers to perform significant housekeeping chores and to \n     help their elderly clients move, dress and eat, make sure \n     they take their medicines and go to doctors' appointments.\n       In its last days in office in 2001, the Clinton \n     administration proposed a revision to the labor rules to \n     allow federal protections to apply to personal home care \n     aides, but the Bush administration promptly threw that out \n     and reasserted the status quo. A 2007 Supreme Court ruling \n     upheld the rules, and a push that year by House and Senate \n     Democrats to pass a bill to update the law went nowhere.\n       According to the Labor Department, personal and home care \n     aides are expected to be the second fastest-growing \n     occupation in the United States from 2006-2016, increasing by \n     51 percent, slightly behind the expected growth in systems \n     and data communications analysts.\n       Most home care aides are women, low income and minority, \n     and many of them are immigrants. Some states have taken steps \n     to provide them with basic labor protections. Efforts to \n     unionize home care workers in some states also has led to \n     wage gains and better conditions. But the progress is \n     incomplete without a federal law to recognize and protect the \n     home care work force. It is unconscionable that workers who \n     are entrusted with the care of some of the nation's most \n     vulnerable citizens are themselves unprotected by basic labor \n     standards.\n       It is also unwise, because poor pay for long hours leads to \n     high turnover, which undermines the quality of care. Turnover \n     also drives up the cost of providing home care--a needless \n     drain on Medicaid, which pays for many home care services. \n     And that is not the only way that poor quality home care jobs \n     end up costing taxpayers. Nearly half of home care workers \n     rely on food stamps or other public assistance, so taxpayers \n     ultimately compensate for their low pay and inadequate \n     benefits.\n       Of necessity, job creation and job quality will be the \n     focus of the Obama administration in 2009, and, most likely, \n     for many years. The Department of Labor could rewrite the \n     rules to extend federal protections to home care workers. Or \n     Congress and the White House could work together to pass a \n     law granting those protections. Either way, the point is to \n     ensure that home care, a 21st-century growth industry, \n     creates good jobs.\n\n\n                             trial projects\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as the Senate works to boost our ailing \neconomy, I want to clarify that funding provided to the National Park \nService for trail projects would not be limited to only certain trails. \nThe bill provides $158 million for the operation of the National Park \nSystem, of which $23 million is recommended in the report for deferred \nmaintenance of trails. I understand this funding could be used for any \ntrails in the National Park System, including the eight National Scenic \nTrails. Is that correct?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is accurate. The $23 million in funding for \ntrail maintenance could be used for any of the eight National Scenic \nTrails in this country. Many of these trails are in disrepair, have \nunsafe crossings and uncompleted sections that could be repaired with \nthis funding, creating jobs and generating economic value for \nsurrounding communities.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The North Country National Scenic Trail, the longest \nscenic trail designed in America, traversing seven States including the \nState of Michigan, has great needs and could use the funding provided \nin this economic recovery package. In Michigan alone, the North Country \nNational Scenic Trail has maintenance needs totaling $2.5 million that \nhave been postponed for too many years. These trail upgrades and \nmaintenance projects would put people to work right away and spur \nadditional economic activity. I was concerned the report accompanying \nthe economic recovery bill could be misinterpreted to limit this \nfunding to so-called units of the National Park System. Only three of \nthe eight National Scenic Trails have unit status, and limiting funding \nin that way would be arbitrary and unfair. I believe this funding \nshould be available for any NPS-administered National Scenic Trail, \nwhether designated as a unit or not, for trail construction, \nrehabilitation and maintenance. Is that the Senator's intent as \nchairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, and I believe the \nsponsor of the language?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes, that is our intent. All of the National Scenic \nTrails would be eligible for this funding, which would create jobs, \ngenerate economic value, and provide healthy recreational \nopportunities.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank Chairman Feinstein for including this funding and \nclarifying its use.\n\n\n                   wastewater infrastructure funding\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, at this time I would like to discuss a \nletter Senators Wyden, Feingold, McCaskill, Schumer, Levin, Stabenow, \nand I sent to the Appropriations Committee arguing for an increase in \nwastewater infrastructure funding in this legislation. My colleagues \nand I believe it necessary to pay special attention to projects that \nare known as combined sewage overflows, or CSOs. As Senator Feinstein \nknows, combined sewage overflows are very expensive projects that many \nof our nation's older sewer systems are required to complete in order \nto separate storm water run-off from sanitary sewer systems. In fact, \nour hard-pressed cities and small towns are facing billions of dollars \nin costs to address this problem.\n  We supported the infrastructure amendment offered by Chairman \nFeinstein and Chairman Murray to add an additional $7 billion to the \nbill for clean and drinking water projects. We also strongly support \nthe $4 billion included in the underlying bill for clean water \ninfrastructure. Would Chairman Feinstein agree that the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency should make funding for CSO projects \none of its Recovery Act priorities?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. First, I would like to commend my colleagues for \nbringing this important matter before the Senate. EPA estimates that \ncombined sewage overflows are responsible for releasing more than a \ntrillion gallons of untreated and undertreated wastewater into our \nNation's water bodies every year. I believe that additional funding \nprovided through the Recovery Act for the Clean Water State Revolving \nFunds program will help alleviate the combined sewage overflow problem. \nI share the Senator's belief that the EPA should strongly encourage the \ncompletion of combined sewage overflow projects and I look forward to \nworking with the Senator to address this serious problem in the years \nahead.\n  Mr. BROWN. We sincerely appreciate the Senator's leadership on this \nmatter. In my State of Ohio over 80 communities, from small towns like \nMingo Junction and Defiance, to big cities like Akron and Cincinnati, \nmust invest over $6 billion to complete combined sewage overflow \nprojects. Without assistance, ratepayers will be faced with \nskyrocketing bills, public health is at risk, and our lakes, streams, \nand rivers will remain polluted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 1 p.m. \ntoday, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the following \namendments in the order listed; that no amendments\n\n[[Page S1800]]\n\nbe in order to these amendments prior to the vote; with 2 minutes of \ndebate prior to each vote, equally divided and controlled; with 10-\nminute vote limitations after the first vote in the sequence: Sanders \namendment No. 330, as modified; Coburn amendment No. 309; Udall \namendment No. 359; Coburn amendment No. 176.\n  Further, that upon disposition of the above-listed amendments, the \nSenate then consider the following amendments and that they be \nconsidered in rotating fashion back and forth to each side; that no \namendments be in order to these amendments prior to a vote in relation \nto the amendments: Conrad-Graham No. 501; Dodd No. 145, and that when a \nvote is scheduled in relation to amendments Nos. 501 and 145, the vote \nwould occur first on 501; Cantwell amendment No. 274, with the \nmodification which is at the desk; Feingold amendment No. 485; Grassley \namendment No. 297; Enzi amendment No. 293; Vitter amendment No. 107; \nBunning amendment No. 531; Wyden amendment No. 468; and Thune amendment \nNo. 538.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, there is no objection on this side. We \nappreciate the accommodations of the manager of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I wish to a say special thanks to \nChairman Baucus as well as Chairman Inouye. Having been given the task \nof working hard, their staffs have been amazing in coming together and \ntrying to produce a package that will be a job creator, a stimulus to \nour economy, a recovery to the economic crisis we face in this great \nNation. They have done a tremendous job with the time they have been \ngiven.\n  Of course, we are all here because we believe we have something to \nadd to that process and to that solution. I come today to speak briefly \nabout a couple of amendments I have.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Vitter of \nLouisiana be added as a cosponsor of my amendment No. 199.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 199\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. The amendment I will be offering here today, along with \nSenators Cornyn, Murray, Pryor, and Vitter, will bring relief to the \nforest products industry, which has been devastated by the downturn in \nthe housing market.\n  My colleague from Tennessee has just spoken about the housing issue, \nthe concerns we have there. Well, it has had a devastating effect on \nour timber industry as well. This industry is an integral part of the \neconomy of many Southern and Northwestern States. In my home State of \nArkansas, the forest products industry is a foundation of our economy, \nour culture, our way of life, and particularly those living in rural \nAmerica.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank my good friend from Mississippi for that kind \nstatement.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for purposes of a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Absolutely.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, would it be in order at this point to lock \nin a time to speak after the tranche of votes?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest that we agree to 5 minutes in \nrotating fashion for each side and that Senator Kerry be first \nrecognized after the votes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Are we limited to 5? Would it be possible to get 10 \nminutes?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will say 10 minutes. I want to hold it to four speakers \nuntil we get a better handle on what is going on.\n  Mr. KERRY. I appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  More than 50 percent of Arkansas land is forested. Much of this is \nsustainably managed to create products we use every single day. In \naddition, there are jobs associated with the growing of the forests and \nthe manufacture of these great products we manufacture here at home. \nMore than 32,000 Arkansas men and women work in our woods and at our \nsawmills and our paper mills. These are good jobs located in our small \nrural communities, making a huge part of the fabric of this country. \nThese are jobs that we must protect.\n  During this economic crisis, the forest products industry has \nsuffered immensely. Since 2006, the industry has lost more than 181,000 \njobs or roughly 14 percent of its workforce. The lumber side has been \nparticularly hard hit, with a 20-percent drop in employment. In \nArkansas, the impact has been even greater.\n  Our amendment will help our domestic timber industry remain \ncompetitive and will help ensure against further domestic timber \nmanufacturing job losses. We are talking about job creation. We are \ntalking about job recovery. We are talking about ensuring that we do \nnot lose any more of these vital jobs in rural America that sustain \nthis country.\n  It would extend provisions enacted in the farm bill set to expire \nthis year which help large integrated and small family-owned companies, \nas well as the shareholders of timber REITs. In short, the amendment \nwould provide a uniform 15-percent rate for cutting timber and \nadditionally would reform the timber REIT rules.\n  This policy change has strong bipartisan support. It has passed the \nSenate in the past and will do a great deal to protect our timber jobs \nright here at home.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this amendment to \nprotect the jobs we have in rural America in our timber and forest \nproducts industry.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 249\n\n  Mr. President, I would also like to touch on the second amendment I \nwill offer. It is a 2-year, 5-percent rural home health add-on.\n  Access to health care, particularly in home health services that help \nkeep chronically ill and disabled adults out of institutions, is a \ncritical issue facing rural America. We put a benefit add-on to rural \nhome health back in early 2000. We have lowered that add-on. But the \nfact is, it expired again on December 31, 2006, and has not been \nreinstated.\n  The National Association for Home Care and Hospice estimates that the \n5-percent rural add-on would create approximately 2,500 jobs in rural \nAmerica, not to mention the people who would be served.\n  In many rural areas, home health agencies are the primary caregivers \nfor homebound beneficiaries who have limited access to transportation \nand other supportive resources. The negative effects of losing the \nrural home health add-on include agencies having to reduce their \nservice areas and some agencies having to turn away high-resource-use \npatients.\n  Rural home health agencies are at a greater disadvantage than their \nurban counterparts. Rural agencies are often smaller, they have fewer \npatients. This means they have fixed costs that are spread over a \nsmaller number of patients and visits, increasing overall per-patient \nand per-visit operational cost, not to mention the travel expenses, the \ninput costs they have getting to these patients. With what we have seen \nin the increase in the roller coaster ride of gasoline prices, that \nalso is added in. Rural agencies also have more difficulties hiring or \ncontracting with rehabilitative therapists, requiring the use of nurses \nto provide these vital services. Given the nationwide nursing workforce \nshortages, rural agencies must offer competitive wages compared with \nhospitals and agencies located in urban areas in order to recruit and \nretain qualified workers.\n  This is about keeping jobs, making sure these jobs are in rural \nareas, but also servicing patients who truly need these types of \nservices. These are great job creators, job sustainers, and great \nservices to the people of this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 14 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n\n[[Page S1801]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Finance Committee. I have had very little to do with this bill in \nthe sense of writing it. I think most of us feel somewhat the same way. \nI am growing increasingly concerned about the bill, as to whether it is \nreally going to be a stimulus. I come from a State which has more \npeople unemployed today than the population of a dozen States; a State \nwhere the breadlines are growing, where the need for assistance is \ngrowing, where the State has a huge deficit, where counties are unable \nto fund their operating maintenance, where all capital projects have \nstopped, and where the State is now furloughing employees. I think \nwhile we dither, Rome burns. This crisis is so multidimensional and the \ndominoes are falling so much more rapidly than any of us thought and \nthey are pushed from so many different points.\n  The fact is that people cannot get credit--credit for your big \ncorporations to open a new hotel; credit, if you are a small employer, \nto pay your payroll. Credit remains frozen. The housing crisis \ncontinues to work its problems.\n  What, in my view, a stimulus is not, candidly speaking, is a tax \npackage. I do not believe in this economy tax cuts are stimulus. The \ncurrent state of the package, as I understand it, is that tax cuts are \nroughly 40 percent of the package; 20 percent is local assistance, \nState and local assistance; 15 percent is safety net spending; 15 \npercent is infrastructure spending--that is all--and 10 percent is \nother spending.\n  I do not know how many jobs are going to come out of this because it \nis my belief that people's buying patterns have changed.\n  This morning, a number of my colleagues talked about a report from \nthe Congressional Budget Office, and what they did not do is they did \nnot quote from certain parts of it. I would like to quote on what they \nfound. Here it is:\n\n       A dollar's worth of a temporary tax cut would have a \n     smaller effect on GDP than a dollar's worth of direct \n     purchase or transfers, because a significant share of the tax \n     cut would probably be saved.\n\n  As a matter of fact, we have evidence of that. Last year, we approved \nmore than $130 billion in tax cuts, primarily through a $600-per-person \ntax refund. After all of that money was spent in two tranches going \nout, there was little or no perceptible impact on the economy.\n  But we do not learn. In fact, study after study shows that upper \nincome taxpayers are less likely to spend the refund checks they \nreceive than those with low incomes.\n  According to a recent CRS analysis, tax cuts are likely to have a \n``diminished stimulus effect.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 additional \nminute.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I point out that at the end of the day, I think there \nhave been some significant layoffs. All along the retail industry, \nwhether it is Starbucks or whether it is various retail establishments; \nlike Gottschalks department stores--38 stores in California--going into \nbankruptcy; whether you have banks closing; whether you have Macy's \nlaying off 10,000 people, buying patterns have changed. I read a study \nwhere people are not buying as much toothpaste. That is an indication \nthat there is an angst out there, a worry about this economy.\n  The point of this package is to get jobs out to people. I reserve the \nright, at the end of the day, to vote against a package that I don't \nthink puts those jobs out there. That is my point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in order to clarify some confusion that \nmay exist as to what the proceedings are after the first group of \nvotes, let me ask unanimous consent that the request I further \npropounded with respect to that period be vitiated. Instead, I ask \nunanimous consent that following the next group of votes, there be 20 \nminutes available, equally divided in the usual form, for debate only.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa questioned State aid \nprovisions in our substitute so I wish to take a few moments to explain \nthem. When our country was founded, there was a great debate about the \nroles of the Federal and State governments, and our Founding Fathers \ndebated which should be more powerful. Should it be the States or the \nFederal Government? Which should retain what privileges and how to \nensure an effective union of the States? Alexander Hamilton, the first \nSecretary of the Treasury, advocated for the Federal Government to buy \nthe States' Revolutionary War debt. The idea was controversial, but the \nmerits of the proposal have proven sound.\n  In the year 1790, there were two main reasons he suggested the \nFederal Government assume State debt. First, the Federal Government was \nin a better position to issue and sell bonds to satisfy the debt. \nSecond, the assumption of State debt would serve to rally local \neconomic interests to promote broader national goals.\n  Many things have changed since 1790, but some things remain the same. \nDuring recessionary periods, State revenue suffers. Unlike the Federal \nGovernment, States must balance their budgets. Just as in 1790, the \nFederal Government was still in a better position to assume the debt.\n  These difficult times also call for unity among the States. Every \nState is suffering, but we must band together to help those among us \nwho are worse off. We need to hold back our personal interests and \nfocus instead on our national interests.\n  In addition to the arguments set forth by Hamilton over 200 years \nago, modern economists tell us that State fiscal relief is an effective \nmeans to stimulate the economy. Economists also advise that targeted \nrelief to those most in need--not based on circumstances of States' own \nmaking but based on true measures of distress--is the best measure of \ndistribution. The bill before us today provides much-needed relief to \nevery State with a temporary increase in the Federal match rate for \nMedicaid expenses. The bill also provides additional aid targeted to \nStates facing the most precarious fiscal situations, measured by an \nincrease in unemployment. This temporary assistance will help States \navoid having to make tough choices, like whether to make significant \nbudget cuts or raise taxes, both of which could make this economic \ncrisis worse.\n  It is important we strike a balance in this bill between spending too \nlittle and too much. Some of my colleagues are worried that we are \nspending beyond what is needed and will end up passing along too much \ndebt to future generations. This package is significant, but the risk \nof doing too little has been overlooked. In fact, I think the risk of \ntoo little is worse than the risk of too much. During times of economic \ndistress, Medicaid suffers from the blows of a one-two punch; that is, \nwhen State revenues are lowest, the demand for Medicaid is the highest. \nIf we do not give States enough money, States won't be able to protect \ntheir Medicaid programs against the blows thrown by the economy. That \nmeans fewer services will be available to fewer people at a time when \nthe need is increasing. We are talking about low-income health care. \nThis is about people who are thrown off Medicaid because States are \nfinding that is the best way to balance their budgets. That is not \nright.\n  Giving States more money than they need won't stimulate the economy. \nIn order to stimulate the economy, this money must be spent quickly, \nand it must go toward job creation or protection of vulnerable \npopulations. To be stimulative and get the economy moving again, State \nfiscal relief must prevent any exacerbation of an already bad \nsituation. By preventing Medicaid cuts, this bill does that.\n  This bill makes sure we will not see a big increase in the number of \nAmericans without health insurance. We must remember that having so \nmany uninsured Americans is not without cost, let alone the personal \ntragedy. Instead, the cost of caring for the uninsured has shifted to \nthe insured. It is in all our best interests to prevent more Americans \nfrom losing their health insurance. This package, I believe, has the \nright balance--it is not perfect, but it is pretty close--giving States \nenough support without giving them too much.\n\n[[Page S1802]]\n\nThe State fiscal relief provisions will not eliminate State budgetary \ndifficulties. That is for sure. But they will provide a cushion, not a \nfull cushion but a partial cushion. This package will not fix \neverything, but it is a big step in the right direction.\n  While not all States have responded to the economic downturn in the \nsame way, no State is immune to the impact of a national recession. \nLooking back on past recessionary periods, we can see that some States, \noften those with large commerce-based economies, feel the blow faster \nand earlier than others. The impact on States with commodity-based \neconomies, on the other hand, is often delayed. The difference between \ncommerce-based States and commodity-based States is more delay in \ncommodity-based States. Because no two States will experience the \nimpact of the recession at precisely the same time or to exactly the \nsame extent, it is important the relief be targeted to those States \nthat are most in need and when they need it.\n  In 1790, some States had already paid off their Revolutionary War \ndebt. But it was important to the Nation as a whole that all States be \nrelieved. On top of a generous across-the-board increase for all \nStates, this package provides additional aid to those States with high \nunemployment. The basic formula is based upon the wealth of the State, \nbut the bonus on top of it is based on unemployment.\n  If a State's unemployment continues to increase, the State may \nqualify for even more relief. Unemployment is an effective measure of a \nState's fiscal condition. Often when people lose their jobs, they also \nlose their health insurance. This places a higher demand on Medicaid. \nIt is estimated that a 1-percent increase in unemployment increases \nenrollment in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program by 1 \nmillion people. Let me repeat that. A 1-percent increase in \nunemployment increases enrollment in Medicaid and the Children's Health \nInsurance Program by 1 million people. Increasing the FMAP \npercentages--that is the Federal share--is the quickest way to get \nrelief to the States. In addition to preventing cuts to Medicaid, this \naid will provide for much-needed economic activity. People will be more \nproductive. Jobs will be saved. Industries that rely on and contribute \nto the strength of our health care system will remain sound. This \nprovision will not only improve the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, \nbut it will also improve the fiscal health of each State. This is a key \nelement of any attempt to pull the national economy out of its \nrecession.\n  We have done this before, and we know it is effective. In the year \n2003, we provided $20 billion in State fiscal relief, evenly split \nbetween grants and an FMAP increase. That is the Federal Medicaid \nshare. The FMAP increase proved successful in preventing planned \nMedicaid cuts and restoring some previous cutbacks. However, an \nanalysis by the Urban Institute found we could have done a better job \nback in the year 2003.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the chairman has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for an additional 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the other side is granted 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent for 5 more minutes, evenly \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. However, an analysis by the Urban Institute found we \ncould have done a better job back in the year 2003. Despite the \nimmediacy and complexity of the situation, the fiscal relief was \ndelayed and uniform. Some States were forced to take action before \nrelief was available. Because the economic downturn of each State \nvaried, some States didn't get enough assistance, and some States got \nassistance at the wrong time.\n  Let's learn from our mistakes. The partially targeted approach of \nthis package will be better. It will give all States some assistance, a \nmethod that is effective and simple. But it will also give more money \nto States with the greatest need, which will help ensure we get the \nbiggest bang for our buck.\n  These are difficult times, but our country is resilient. We are proud \nas Americans of our resiliency. We must draw on the wisdom of our \nFounding Fathers and stick together. We are more than a country. We are \na union of States. Let us remember the good judgment of Alexander \nHamilton and come together as a nation to help each of our States.\n  Over the Presiding Officer is our national motto, ``e pluribus \nunum.'' It could not be more appropriate than at this moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to return to the Congressional \nBudget Office report in response to the remarks of the Senator from \nMontana again to the Congressional Budget Office. It says the \nlegislation would result in a slight decrease in gross domestic \nproduct. It said it would increase employment at the end of the fourth \nquarter of 2010 by 1.3 million to 3.9 million jobs. I urge my \ncolleagues to do the math. This is a $1.2 trillion bill. If it creates \n1.3 million jobs, that is $923,000 per job. If it creates 3.9 million \njobs, that is $307,000 of taxpayer dollars.\n  As the President stated last night, this is a spending bill. He is \nright. I agree with him. It is a spending bill. Most of us were under \nthe impression that what we wanted was a job creation and economic \nstimulus bill. We can pass spending bills all the time. We do it all \nthe time. We have laid a $10 trillion debt on future generations of \nAmericans. Very interestingly, the report continues:\n\n       Senate legislation would reduce output slightly in the long \n     run, CBO estimates, as would other similar proposals. The \n     principal channel for this effect is that the legislation \n     would result in an increase in government debt. To the extent \n     that people hold their wealth as government bonds rather than \n     in a form that can be used to finance private investment, an \n     increased debt would tend to reduce the stock of productive \n     capital. In economic parlance, the debt would ``crowd out'' \n     private investment. CBO's basic assumption is that in the \n     long run, each dollar of additional debt crowds out about a \n     third of a dollar's worth of private domestic capital.\n\n  This is something that has been abundantly clear for years and the \nreason why we don't have socialism in this country, because the \nGovernment is less efficient in using dollars than the private \nenterprise system is. Perhaps more alarming than anything else, the \nreason why it was so disappointing is we did not pass the trigger. That \nwas an amendment we voted down, actually with a couple of Democratic \nvotes, that provided that once the economy recovers, we have to be on a \npath to a balanced budget. CBO estimates that by 2019, the Senate \nlegislation would reduce gross domestic product by .1 percent to .3 \npercent. In other words, we will not grow the economy in the long run \nunless we get our fiscal house in order.\n  Why are the American people unhappy? Why is it that my office and \nothers are inundated with phone calls? Because we put in unnecessary \nand even wasteful and nonproductive programs to the tune of billions \nand billions of dollars: $300 million dollars for Violence Against \nWomen Act grants to the Department of Justice because ``as job losses \nloom and the economy worsens, service providers across the country are \nreporting an increase in calls related to domestic violence.'' I am \nglad to fund any program that would help address the issue of domestic \nviolence. But it is not creating jobs. We will hear from the other side \nabout how worthwhile this long list of porkbarrel projects is, but the \nfact is, they don't create jobs. That is what we are supposed to be \ndoing in a ``stimulus'' bill.\n\n  I want to comment again: We all know there are negotiations going on \nnow of the called ``Gang of 18.'' I was one of the Gang of 14. That was \n7 Republicans, 7 Democrats. That is bipartisan. Now it is 15 Democrats, \n3 Republicans. That is not bipartisan. If they come up with an \nagreement, then it will mean 3 Republicans out of 535 Members of \nCongress have supported this unnecessary, wasteful bill that could have \nbeen so much better.\n  It started out wrong, when the Speaker of the House said: We won, so \nwe write the bill. And it is ending up wrong because we have not done \nwhat we need to do and has been the product of a true bipartisan \nagreement, and\n\n[[Page S1803]]\n\nthat is to sit down together, Republican and Democrat.\n  Mr. President, I want to close by pointing out, again, we want to \nhave legislation that stimulates this economy. But we want it to \nstimulate the economy and not mortgage the future of our children and \nour grandchildren by the kind of fiscal profligate spending that is \nembodied in this legislation to the tune--it goes higher as we speak--\nof over $1 trillion.\n  I am told Monday we are going to have another TARP proposed--another \none. How many trillions? We are setting some kind of record, and there \nis no fiscal discipline.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to consider carefully--consider \ncarefully--this legislation. The American people have figured it out. \nLet's figure it out.\n  (Disturbance in the Visitors' Galleries.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Expressions of approval or disapproval are not \nallowed in the Chamber.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. For my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, for the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma the \nremaining 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the question we need to ask ourselves is, \nWhat is the real problem we have in the economy? And what is the best \nway of fixing it? Not whether somebody looks good or looks bad. How do \nwe do what is in the best long-term interest of the country?\n  The problem with this bill, once you really see it--and even a $100 \nbillion smaller bill--is, it does not address the real problem. We are \ngoing to be treating symptoms, and we are going to be highly \ninefficient as we do that. We say we want to have a stimulus bill. Yet \nwhat we are going to do is stimulate a baseline increase in the budget \nevery year from now on of at least $124 billion, probably closer to \n$300 billion, because we have not done what we say we are doing with \nthis bill.\n  The other thing is, the fear that is driving this bill and what might \nhappen if we do not hurry up and get a bill is probably the worst \nmotivation we could have. The real fear we ought to have is, have we \ndone it right and have we not created a situation in which generations \nthat follow us, especially the next two, will say: What were they \nthinking? Why didn't they do it right? Why didn't they target the money \ntruly to stimulus instead of creating this worst of all habits--which \nwe are now going to ensure that the States pick up and learn from us. \nIt is a virus. It is a virus we have that says: You do not have to \nworry about what it costs in the long run. You do not have to target \nit. You do not have to be efficient. You do not have to look at \nprograms and make sure they are working. You do not have to have \nmetrics.\n  Now that the States are in trouble, we are going to absorb a portion \nof the problems the States have because they have not been fiscally \nprudent, and we are going to say: We are going to bail you out. Well, \nthink about what that says to State legislators all across the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana has 1 minute.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I do not see any speakers here. I will \nyield back that time, unless the Senator from Vermont wishes to speak.\n  I yield back that time so we can get to the vote.\n  I yield back the time.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 306, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is now 2 \nminutes of debate on the amendment No. 306, as modified, offered by the \nSenator from Vermont, Mr. Sanders.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  This amendment, as modified, is being cosponsored by Senator Grassley \nand has been cleared by both sides. This amendment simply requires \nrecipients of TARP funding to meet strict H-1B worker hiring standards \nto prevent displacement of U.S. workers.\n  I thank Chairman Baucus for working with me on changes to my original \namendment, and I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I urge Senators to accept this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified.\n  The amendment (No. 306), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 309\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is now 2 \nminutes of debate on amendment No. 309, offered by the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is a simple amendment that says we \nought to have a priority of what we do. It is not about being against \nswimming pools, zoos, museums, or anything else. It is about saying to \nthe American people we are going to prioritize the spending on this \nlegislation.\n  What this amendment does is prohibit money to go to low-priority, \nlow-infrastructure things. We have 233,000 bridges in this country that \nare in trouble--233,000. Instead of spending money planting trees along \na causeway, what we ought to be doing is fixing the bridge that is on \nthat causeway.\n  So this amendment is designed to prohibit money going into these \nareas so we will have money next year and the year after that, or maybe \nredirect money within the bill to actually do something we are going to \nhave to spend money on anyhow, rather than do something that is \noptional and low priority.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to express my concerns about \namendment No. 309, introduced by the Senator from Oklahoma. Senator \nCoburn's amendment would add a provision to this bill which was \nincluded in the House-passed bill.\n  The provision prohibits spending any of the funds in this bill on \ncasinos, golf courses, swimming pools, and other specified recreational \nfacilities. I think we can all agree these sound like laudable goals. \nAnd I understand that on its face this amendment may seem logical, but \nI want the Senate to understand what it means as it applies to this \nbill.\n  Some of my colleagues might wonder why the House included this \nprovision in their bill and why we don't think it makes sense.\n  The House included $1 billion for the Community Development Block \nGrant, CDBG, program. Under that program, funds go straight to the \ncities and mayors determine how to spend the funds. When the Conference \nof Mayors presented their views to the country's leadership on how to \nstimulate the economy, the No. 1 program they were hoping to have \nfunded was CDBG. But the CDBG Program does not have sufficient \nsafeguards. It can be used to construct recreational swimming pools or \naquariums or to support museums. On occasion CDBG funds have been used \nfor programs which some would say were of questionable merit.\n  To ensure that the Senate would not be supporting questionable \nprograms, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended no funds for \nthis program. The House recognized that CDBG funds might be used \ninappropriately if there were no prohibitions on questionable programs, \nso it included the provision which Senator Coburn wants to attach to \nthe Senate bill.\n  We do not need to include the provision because we do not have CDBG \nfunding in this bill. The mayors are precluded from funding the \nprojects prohibited by the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma. The \nSenate is already protected from possible abuse by denying the funding \nfor the program.\n  Let me offer a second example of how the committee ensured that local \nfunds could not be used unwisely. In the bill, the committee has \nincluded $2.5 billion for the Neighborhood Stabilization Program which \nis designed to improve blighted neighborhoods. However, it is true that \non occasion funds for this program have been used for community \ndevelopment that was of questionable\n\n[[Page S1804]]\n\nmerit. To avoid that problem, the Appropriations Committee recommended \nbill language under the Neighborhood Stabilization Program which only \nallows the funds to be used for the replacement of housing. This \nlimitation means the funds cannot be used to build community centers or \nswimming pools.\n  We support the idea behind the amendment but not the amendment. \nFirst, we have not provided funds for programs which can be used \nfrivolously. Second, there are no earmarks in this bill. Third, there \nis no CDBG money in this bill. Fourth, the housing programs cannot be \nused for frivolous purposes.\n  Members might argue you could include the amendment as an additional \nsafeguard. Well, consider just this one example. Among other things, \nthe amendment would prohibit the construction of swimming pools no \nexceptions. It should be noted that we do not direct the construction \nof any particular swimming pool that would be an earmark.\n  However, this bill contains $3.4 billion for needed construction of \nnew and infrastructure renovation and repairs at existing VA hospitals. \nUnder the terms of this provision the VA would not be able to spend any \nof the infrastructure funding provided to the Department on \nconstruction or renovation of therapeutic swimming pools at spinal cord \ninjury centers, trauma centers, or other VA medical centers.\n  The Appropriations Committee is aware that the VA has plans for many \nlegitimate construction projects such as pools specifically used for \nmedical rehabilitation of wounded soldiers. These are not swimming \npools for VA staff, but they would nonetheless be prohibited by this \namendment.\n  While I am confident this was not the intent of the amendment, it \nmost certainly could be the result. It is not the only example. Should \nour military be denied from building recreational facilities? Should \nthe Coast Guard be told not to build swimming pools where they practice \ntraining exercises? Do we want to argue that no funds should be \navailable for fixing aging buildings?\n  This amendment is a solution in search of a problem. But, Mr. \nPresident, let's not forget that the amendment causes problems. If \nadopted, this amendment could deny our wounded veterans the physical \ntherapy they need and deserve, and it could deny other needed programs \nto support training and quality of life for our military forces and \ntheir families.\n  I recommend that you vote against this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. COBURN.

Mr. President, I voted against Senate amendment No. 309 \nbecause the language of this amendment was too broad and would have \nexcluded funding for important projects in California that will create \njobs, help our veterans, promote tourism, protect our natural \nresources, and stimulate the economy.\n  If the Coburn amendment had prevented economic recovery money from \ngoing to casinos, I would have supported the amendment. Gaming \nfacilities and casinos do not deserve to receive funding in this bill.\n  But by prohibiting funds for parks, highway beautification projects, \nand other community projects, the Coburn amendment would have \neliminated from funding consideration important job-creating \ninitiatives throughout California.\n  It is important to note that there are no earmarks in this bill. No \nparks, community centers, casinos, swimming pools, or similar projects \nreceive direct funding in the recovery bill.\n  But there are some important investments that the Coburn amendment \nwould prevent Federal, State, and local leaders from allocating \nresources to, such as construction and rehabilitation projects in State \nparks--which create jobs and protect natural resources--and highway \nbeautification projects--which create jobs and help stimulate local \neconomies.\n  One example of how the Coburn amendment would prevent funding for \nworthy projects involves disabled veterans. There is $3.4 billion in \nthis bill for construction and renovation of Veterans Administration \nhospitals. Because of the Coburn amendment, the VA will not be able to \nspend any of the funding it receives on construction of therapeutic \nrecovery pools at trauma centers, spinal cord injury centers, and other \nmedical centers for disabled veterans to use when recovering from \ntraumatic injuries.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 359\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is now 2 \nminutes of debate on amendment No. 359, offered by the Senator from New \nMexico, Mr. Udall.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. The current language in the substitute \namendment provides a tax incentive to employers hiring veterans who \nhave been discharged from the armed services in 2008, 2009, and 2010.\n  My amendment would expand this tax incentive to employers to include \nveterans discharged from the armed services between September 2001 and \nDecember 2010, including veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom and \nOperation Iraqi Freedom.\n  This group of veterans has a 6.1-percent rate of unemployment. \nExpanding the tax incentive to employers will help ensure that we do \nnot leave these veterans out in the cold. It ensures that employers are \nencouraged to hire these men and women and to put them back to work. I \nhope my colleagues will join me in adopting this amendment. I thank \nboth sides for working with me on this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

We have 10 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Nebraska, followed by the \nSenator from Iowa, will have 5 minutes. If I can ask the distinguished \nmanager, my understanding is that after the 20 minutes, there will then \nbe a period for filing amendments and debate.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. After the 20 minutes, there then is a period during which \nSenators can call up their amendments, but they are only amendments \nthat have been agreed to by an earlier UC.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the manager.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise to elaborate on a couple points I \nmade a day or so ago on this stimulus package.\n  Many in this body and constituents across Nebraska know I am a former \nmayor, a former city counsel person, a former county commissioner, and \na former Governor. I have had the opportunity to govern during very \ngood times when the revenues were available. I have had the opportunity \nto govern during very tough times, where we were trying to figure out \nhow to balance our budget.\n  I point out, again, that in the State I come from, we not only have \nto balance the budget, but we are prohibited by our Constitution from \nborrowing money. So the State has no debt.\n  I have been in those positions, the beneficiary of programs such as \nthis package but much smaller programs. I have never been, nor has \nanyone else been in the history of this country, the beneficiary of a \nspending bill this large. To describe this as large is not to do \njustice to the discussion. This is enormous.\n  I am sure what is happening across the country in mayors' offices and \nGovernors' offices as they try to figure out how to deal with this \nmassive amount of money that is being dedicated to what I would argue \nare valuable programs in the normal budget process--Medicaid, \neducation, special education, parks facilities, whatever it is, \nalthough we addressed that with an amendment--what is happening is \nthis: mayors and Governors are looking at their budgets and they are \nrecognizing that there is money that is going to come in huge amounts \nfrom the Federal Government. So they are looking at their capital \nimprovements process in their budget and they are saying: What is it \nthat I can now take my local dollars or my State dollars and set to the \nside and fund with this massive amount of Federal spending that is \noccurring that is going to rain down on my local government or my State \ngovernment?\n  As I said, these are valuable programs, there is no doubt about that. \nI funded all these programs at one point in my life. What I suggest to \nthis body is you are not going to get any kind of stimulative impact \nfrom what you are trying to accomplish. The Governor or the mayor is \nsimply going to look at these dollars as found money, and they are \ngoing to take their State and local dollars, set them to the side, and \nspend the Federal dollars, and no stimulation will happen to the \neconomy. No new jobs will be created. In fact, I would even suggest you \nwill be very hard pressed in the year or 2 years of this stimulus \npackage to even find a new project that would not have otherwise been \nfunded through the normal State or local process.\n  I also wish to talk about one last piece of this that is very \nimportant, and we acted on this with an amendment. But I need to say \nsomething that is very important because this needs to survive whatever \nprocess is left, and that is this whole issue of competitive bidding.\n  This is a massive amount of money. The temptation to ignore the \ntransparency of the bidding process is simply going to be too great \nunless we act, not only today but as this process goes forward. The \ntemptation to allocate this money with the transparency of the bidding \nprocess will take control and literally we will be looking back and we \nwill be fighting this and recognizing that money got doled out, it got \nhanded out without any kind of transparency in the competitive bidding \nprocess.\n  I have been there in those offices, where I have had members of the \nadministration come in and say: Governor or mayor, we need to waive the \nbidding process.\n  Let me wrap up with this thought. These are valuable programs. I have \nfunded these programs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts. Actually, I prefer they use the remaining 5 minutes on \nthe other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, many folks on the other side of the \naisle claim that spending is better stimulus than tax relief for \nworking men and women. This is certainly not a unanimous opinion among \neconomists, so I would share some recent economic research that \nanalyzes data--not building models--to answer the question of whether \nspending or tax relief is more effective for economic stimulus.\n  Christina Romer, who is the Obama administration's Chair of the \nCouncil of Economic Advisers, and David Romer, from the University of \nCalifornia at Berkeley, find that $1 of tax relief raises the gross \ndomestic product by about $3. Robert Hall, from Stanford, and Susan \nWoodward, who is chair of Sand Hill Econometrics, find that $1 of \nGovernment spending raises gross domestic product by about $1. Andrew \nMountford, from the University of London, and Harold Uhlig, from the \nUniversity of Chicago, conclude that deficit-financed tax relief works \nbetter than either deficit-financed or balanced-budget Government \nspending increases to improve the gross domestic product. These experts \ncalculate that each $1 of tax relief amounts to $5\n\n[[Page S1806]]\n\nof additional gross domestic product 5 years after the shock of \nrecession. Olivier Blanchard, who is the chief economist at the IMF, \nand Roberto Perotti, from IGIER University, assert that a combination \nof both tax increases and Government spending increases has a strong \nnegative impact on private investment spending.\n  In addition to the opinions of these economic experts, a look back at \nthe picture that developed following the 2003 tax relief is also very \ninstructive.\n  After the 2001 recession ended, both the economy and labor markets \ncontinued to sputter. But a significant turnaround occurred soon after \nthe passage of the 2003 tax relief bill. Following nine straight \nquarters of decline, business investment grew at an annual rate of 6.6 \npercent between the enactment of the 2003 tax bill and the start of the \ncurrent recession. Similarly, a period of job growth following the 2003 \ntax relief was the longest streak of monthly job growth on record.\n  We have spent a lot of time in this body discussing the balance \nsheets of financial institutions. The balance sheets of families and \nindividuals throughout the country have been suffering significantly as \nwell. From the third quarter of 2007 to the third quarter of 2008, the \nnet worth of households and nonprofit organizations has dropped by $7.1 \ntrillion, or 8.9 percent.\n  Families and individuals who receive tax reductions will likely save \nsome of their tax cut to pay down household debt. Some erroneously \nsuggest that this is bad for the economy. Quite to the contrary. When \npeople pay down their debt, their credit improves. Improved credit \nleads to freeing up bank lending. Reduced debt for families and \nindividuals also increases the amount of long-term income available for \nspending. So we should not look at households improving their balance \nsheets as a bad thing economically.\n  Finally, evidence suggests that permanent tax reductions are more \nlikely to be spent by consumers than one-time stimulus checks or \ncredits. Our focus should be on permanent tax relief to get the engine \nof our economy running.\n  Our economy is like the Titanic, and while it continues to go down, \nthe only proposal on the other side is to spend over $700 billion to \nbuy new deck chairs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of the \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n  Who wishes to yield time? The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman for his \nefforts on this bill and on this issue as a whole.\n  I have been listening for the last few days to our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle talk as if the last 8 years hasn't happened, as \nif they have no responsibility for it, and then come back to the floor \nof the Senate today, and in the last few days, with proposals that have \nalready been tested and, frankly, proven hollow and empty and \ninadequate. It is kind of surprising to me to see the absence of common \nsense that has been at the center of the arguments over the course of \nthe last couple of days.\n  Let me give an example. We keep hearing about how the spending, \nspending, spending is too big and it is a problem. In fact, spending \nitself, we have heard in the arguments, is not going to solve this \nproblem. Well, over 40 States in this country now have budget \nshortfalls--40 States--and the Governors in those States are already \ncutting essential services. They face the choice of cutting police, \nfire, teachers, and other critical services. The fact is that as they \ncut, those people are not able to pay mortgages, not able to go to the \nstore and buy whatever it was they planned to buy, because they are out \nof a job and therefore lacking cash. They may even become at risk for \nforeclosure on their homes. So if you want to contribute to toxic \nassets, the best way to do it is to continue to adopt the policy that \nyou don't put cash into the hands of Americans.\n  Now, that alone is not going to solve the problem. The normal debt \nratio of a household in our country is about--income to household \ndebt--50 percent. Right now, the average household in America is \ncarrying a debt-to-income ratio of about 150 percent. And if all you do \nis give a tax cut that puts cash into the hands of people--which I \nunderstand, incidentally, our proposal does give a tax cut--if that is \nall you do, a large percentage of that is going to simply go to paying \nfor past acquisitions, for past services provided. It is going to be \nused by taxpayers to pay off their credit card bills, to pay their \ndebt, but it isn't going to create the kind of spending and consumption \nthat is at the heart of the American economy.\n  Mr. President, 72 percent of American GDP comes from consumption. \nUnless we recognize how you stop the tailspin and begin to turn things \naround, we are ignoring reality. I have heard a lot of talk about we \nought to do a tax cut, we ought to do a tax cut. I have supported many \ntax cuts during my years here, and there are tax cuts in this proposal. \nBut a tax cut is nontargeted. If you put a tax cut into the hands of \neither a business or an individual today, there is no guarantee they \nare going to invest their money. There is no guarantee they are going \nto invest their money in the United States. They are free to invest \nanywhere they want, if they choose to invest.\n  Let's look at that. When you have a tailspin in the economy, as we do \ntoday, and confidence is declining, as it is today, if you are a banker \nand if somebody comes in to borrow money from you, you have to look at \nthe prudent lending practices and standards by which you are going to \nmake that loan. In today's climate, the inclination of a prudent banker \nis not to make the loan. Why? Because they see consumerism contracting, \nbecause they see the tailspin in housing, because they see the lack of \nnew building, new contracts, and you are locked into a vicious cycle--\nnot a virtuous cycle, a vicious cycle, a downward cycle. This effort is \nto break that cycle.\n  Almost every major economist has suggested that it is going to take a \nvery significant component of that ugly word ``spending'' in order to \nprime the pump and begin to shift the psychology and turn things \naround. Now, is that all we need to do? No. And President Obama has \nsaid that is not all we need to do.\n  To the Senator from Tennessee, who has been talking about housing and \nyou have to stop the housing slide first, let me say to him \nrespectfully that I sat in the White House a year ago with Secretary \nPaulson, President Bush, and Vice President Cheney, and I was the only \nperson in the room who said: Mr. President, if you are going to do a \nstimulus now, you ought to put housing into this package. And I turned \nto the Secretary and I said: Mr. Secretary, you could be negotiating \nright now to keep people in their homes at a fixed mortgage rate and a \nnew valuation, and you should do it. And their heads nodded, and they \nsaid: That sounds like a good idea.\n  Gordon Smith and I came back to the Senate, and we put in a $15 \nbillion provision in the Finance Committee, which passed the Finance \nCommittee 20 to 1. It came to the floor of the Senate, and guess what. \nThe very people who are here on the floor now saying we have to do \nhousing stripped it out of that provision. The President and the \nadministration opposed it. And for 9 months they sat there while 10,000 \nhomes a day were being foreclosed, and they allowed us to slide into \nwhere we are today. So when I hear my colleagues come and say we have \nto fix housing now, they are about 10 months to a year late on that \neffort. They have created, because of their indifference a year ago, a \nsituation where it is out of control. Every major economist in the \ncountry is now telling us: You have to stop the fall.\n\n  If 40 States in our country are facing a predicament, it is incumbent \non us to help those States not lay off those firefighters, not lay off \nthose teachers, and help them go with a readymade project.\n  I have heard colleague after colleague say: Well, what job is going \nto be created through this spending? Well, let me tell you very \ndirectly. If you have a shovel-ready project, we can put that into \nplace tomorrow. There are thousands of them across the country ready to \ngo.\n  We have a $1.6 trillion infrastructure deficit. While other countries \nhave\n\n[[Page S1807]]\n\nbeen investing in high-speed rail transportation, schools, and other \nparts of their economy, we haven't. We have been giving tax cuts to the \nwealthiest people in the country. And the price of that is that today \nwe have the largest gap between the middle class and the wealthy that \nwe have ever had in this country. The fact is, none of those people are \nguaranteed to invest that money in any of the new projects the way we \nare. So Government--yes, Government--has the ability to be able to make \na decision that the private sector won't necessarily make today.\n  I have supported almost every private sector effort through here over \nthe years. I have supported 100 percent a zero capital gains reduction \nso that we could excite investment and venture capital into new \nenterprises with respect to energy and alternative fuel and new \nmaterials and nanotechnology and communications and artificial \nintelligence--all the things that would provide the high value-added \njob base of the future for our country. And most economists will tell \neach of my colleagues, without a party label, that if we were to invest \nnow in those future efforts, we would be creating a much stronger base \nfor our jobs in the future.\n  That is what this seeks to do. This bill, this stimulus effort, seeks \nto break the downward cycle and encourage investment in those kinds of \nproducts that provide a high value-added job and strengthen America's \neconomy for the long run.\n  The fact is that doing the stimulus and doing housing aren't going to \nfix this crisis either. The truth is that the majority of our banks in \nthis country are fundamentally insolvent. Paul Krugman has referred to \na number of large banks as zombie banks because their assets and \nliabilities are almost either even or negative. But if you look at \nthose assets in many of them, they are in the toxic category. And if \nthey legitimately mark their books today at the value of the \nmarketplace, they would not be, according to most standards, solvent.\n  So we are going to visit on this floor within a short period of time \nhow we are going to recapitalize the banks. This effort will not be \nsatisfied with what we are doing here alone. But I guarantee you, every \nday that we dawdle, every day we keep this going, forgetting about \nreality and debating what are old and, frankly, discredited approaches \nto the economy, we are going to create more toxic assets, more people \nare going to lose their jobs, and more confidence will be lost as we \ncontinue to go down.\n  Frankly, the difference between $50 billion on this bill or $100 \nbillion--let's get it moving--that is not going to make the difference \nto the economy. What will make the difference to the economy is whether \nwe express on this floor a real understanding of what is happening and \na real concentrated effort across party lines to address it. That is \nwhat the American people are waiting for.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 seconds.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  I hope we are going to get to the common sense that is at the center \nof this and do what we need to do for the American people quickly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 107\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the second \nVitter amendment I have at the desk, which I am very hopeful will be \nvoted on later in the day. As I have explained on the floor of the \nSenate several times in this debate, I am one of those folks, very \nconcerned that overall this so-called stimulus bill is just a long \nlaundry list of Washington big government spending programs, not \nanything focused or disciplined that will really create jobs in the \nshort term in this economy. But my amendment I am discussing now is \nfocused on a very specific item in that long laundry list that I \nbelieve is not only unproductive but is truly offensive, given the \nhistory of the last several years. That is an item of almost $2.25 \nbillion in the present underlying Senate bill that could go toward \nneighborhood stabilization, that would be available for nonprofit \ngroups, including ACORN, to access. I might add, that figure in the \nHouse bill is $4.2 billion with at least $100 million virtually \nearmarked for nonprofit groups such as ACORN.\n  Why do I find this so objectionable and so offensive? Two simple \nreasons. No. 1, this would further part of the Government policy that \ngot us in this mess to begin with, that started on the housing side by \nencouraging so much subprime lending that led to enormous, and in fact \npredictable, defaults that started this decline. No. 2, I believe with \nregard to a group such as ACORN, this is little more than a political \npayoff because ACORN acted as a truly partisan organization in their \ncampaign activities for the last several years, including this fall, \nand was guilty of egregious fraud with regard to voter registration \nactivities.\n  Let me take point No. 1 first. We all know many factors led us to \nthis current economic crisis. But one of them, one big one, was \ncertainly Government policy and Government programs--and there was a \nlot of it--that built up and encouraged the subprime lending mess. \nCertainly, major funding over several years that went to ACORN and \nsimilar groups was exactly part of that. Are we going to learn from our \nexperience and at least stop that policy, stop that encouragement of \nsubprime lending that could not be supported, that led to more and more \nforeclosures and a plummeting housing market, eventually a plummeting \neconomy overall? Are we going to stop that and correct it? With this \nsort of money in the stimulus bill available to a group such as ACORN, \nin fact, we would be advancing even more of that bad policy.\n  Make no mistake about it, that is exactly the sort of housing \nactivity ACORN focuses on, what they are known for, what they are proud \nof. Let me give one clear example to make the point, which is from the \nNew Mexico chapter of ACORN, New Mexico ACORN Fair Housing. They \nreceived a grant of about $100,000, among others, in 2007. They got \nthis grant for a very specific program with the title, ``How To Take \nAdvantage Of Subprime Mortgages.''\n  I give them an A for truth in advertising. That is exactly what they \nwere about in New Mexico and across the country, how to take advantage \nof subprime mortgages which encourages stuff--let's build it up--and, \nin fact, they helped build it up and, in fact, it cratered. As you \nknow, that has been ACORN's housing mission in communities around the \ncountry.\n  My second point is perhaps even more fundamental, which is that ACORN \nhas been guilty of egregious fraud and politicization of what they do \nwith taxpayer funds for several years, including the last election \ncycle. We should not be sending more taxpayer dollars to them in light \nof this history. I would go so far as to say the effort by some to do \nthat is little more than political payoff.\n  What am I talking about? I think we have heard these stories from the \npast campaign: registering thousands of voters who were either asked to \nregister multiple times or people who were registered without their \nknowledge or the registering of voters who outright did not exist. That \nwas a very common practice by this organization. ACORN employees have \nadmitted to it, who told sad stories of feeling incredible pressure to \nregister voters to meet completely unrealistic quota numbers. That is \nsad indeed.\n  A good example is Washington State where felony charges were actually \nfiled against seven persons for committing the single largest case of \nvoter fraud in the State's history. This was in response to the King \nCounty Canvassing Board's revocation of 1,762 allegedly fraudulent \nvoter registrations submitted by ACORN. In this case the prosecuting \nattorney told the board that six ACORN workers had admitted to filling \nout registration forms with names they found in phone books the \nprevious October. ACORN further actually agreed to reimburse King \nCounty $25,000 for all the investigative and other costs they had to \nbring to that case. Not exactly innocent mistakes but outright voter \nregistration fraud.\n  Fraud and criminality are nothing new to the organization. As we have \nread in 1999 and 2000, nearly $1 million was embezzled by Dale Rathke, \nbrother of the ACORN founder, through faulty credit card charges and \nother means.\n  Given this very clear history, a history of promoting one of the main \nproblems that led us to this mess in\n\n[[Page S1808]]\n\nthe subprime market, a history of being a political organization and in \na very partisan way committing outright voter and voter registration \nfraud, I do not think we should be putting taxpayer dollars in this \nstimulus bill which can go to and benefit ACORN.\n  My amendment is very plain and very simple. It says no money in the \nstimulus bill can go to--will go to, under any circumstances, ACORN.\n  I look forward to a debate and vote on this amendment. I will be \nasking for a rollcall vote on this amendment so we can get a strong \nsense of the Senate on the record, particularly if this issue proceeds \nto conference.\n  Mr. President with that, before I yield the floor, I ask that the \namendment be made pending.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Objection. That is not allowed in this agreement. I am \nsorry.\n  I misunderstood. I thought you wanted a queue for a vote.\n  Mr. VITTER. No, I would like the amendment pending.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. You can call up your amendment and it will be made \npending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 107 to amendment No. 98.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: Prohibiting direct or indirect use of funds to fund the \n     Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN))\n\n       On page 431, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS BY OR FOR ACORN.\n\n       None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     by this Act may be used directly or indirectly to fund the \n     Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now \n     (ACORN).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, there are a series of amendments under the \norder under which Senators can call up specified amendments. I would \nlike to go back and forth, Republican and Democrat and so forth. I also \nurge Senators to enter into time agreements for their speeches when \nthey call up their amendments. I urge us now to move to amendment No. \n501, called up by Senators Conrad and Graham.\n  Let me ask Senator Conrad what kind of time agreement might be \nreasonable for him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask my colleague, Senator Graham, how much time would \nhe need?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Ten minutes each?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Montana please repeat \nthe agreement?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent the time on the Conrad-Graham \namendment be limited to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I shall \nnot, I wonder if the distinguished senior Senator from Montana could \ngive me some idea regarding the broadband amendment which I had \npending, when it would be coming up.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I might say to my good friend from Vermont, there is a \nprevious order entered into which listed amendments under which \nSenators could call up their amendments. I think it is about 10 or 12, \nroughly. I do not see the name of the Senator on this list.\n  Following disposition of this list, we will then enter a different \nperiod when different action can be taken by the Senate. I would have \nto consult with the leader to see what he wants to do following \ndisposition of this list.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as I said, I shall not object, but I note I \nhave been trying for several days, since the time I submitted that \namendment, to bring it up. It will require a slight modification, \nagreed to by both the Republican and Democratic side. I just want to \nhave some idea when it might come. I have no objection to the unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I also \nhave an amendment on the E-Verify system that I believe very strongly \nshould be voted on or perhaps accepted. It is in the House bill. I \nwonder what kind of confidence Senator Baucus can give us. That would \nbe a matter that would be voted on. It is not in the next group of \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I say to my friend, there are many Senators who \napproached me, asking if we could take up their amendment following \nthis list of amendments now. I cannot give a specific answer to any \nSenator at this point except to say that we will go through this list \nwe are on right now under which Senators can call up amendments, and I \nwill be consulting with the leader to try to figure out what is the \nnext order of business. I will make it as fair as possible. I think the \nSenator will acknowledge that all day long--yesterday--we have gone \nback and forth to try to make it fair for both sides. But I cannot say \nwhat the exact procedure will be following the disposition of these \namendments. I will try my very best to accommodate the Senator, as I \nwill every other Senator, but I have to consult with the leader first \nto know what that is.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Baucus. I know he has an incredibly \ndifficult job in working through all of this. I would say, I am uneasy \nabout this. I will not object now, but I do want to have some assurance \nthis very important amendment would at least have a right to have a \nvote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate that very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I renew my request that the time on the Conrad-Graham \namendment be limited to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I think we had 10 minutes each.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I misunderstood. Ten each. That is the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, is there some time in \nopposition to the amendment?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is a good question.\n  Five minutes to the Senator from Connecticut to speak in opposition \nto the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request as modified? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from South Carolina is \nrecognized.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 501, as Modified, to Amendment No. 98\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I believe we have a modification of the \namendment at the desk. I ask that be incorporated. It is amendment No. \n501. I ask it be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The clerk will report the amendment as modified.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina, [Mr. Graham], for himself \n     and Mr. Conrad, proposes an amendment numbered 501, as \n     modified, to amendment No. 98.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To limit wasteful spending, to fund a systematic program of \n   foreclosure prevention, to be administered by the Federal Deposit \n             Insurance Corporation, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 6, strike lines 1 through 4.\n       On page 37, strike lines 1 through 5.\n       On page 37, line 10, strike ``$9,000,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$8,800,000,000''.\n       On page 37, line 13, strike ``not'' and all that follows \n     through ``libraries:'' on line 16.\n       On page 44, line 18, strike ``$300,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$275,000,000''.\n       On page 44, line 25, after the semicolon insert ``and''.\n       On page 45, line 2, strike ``; and'' and insert a period.\n       On page 45, strike lines 3 through 5.\n       On page 57, line 10, strike ``$1,169,291,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,069,291,000''.\n\n[[Page S1809]]\n\n       On page 57, line 14, strike ``$571,843,000'' and insert \n     ``$531,843,000''.\n       On page 57, line 18, strike ``$112,167,000'' and insert \n     ``$92,167,000''.\n       On page 57, line 22, strike ``$927,113,000'' and insert \n     ``$887,113,000''.\n       On page 92, strike lines 1 through 20.\n       On page 93, line 7, strike ``$9,048,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$8,048,000,000''.\n       On page 93, line 12, strike ``$6,000,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$5,000,000,000''.\n       On page 93, line 23, strike ``$7,000,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$6,000,000,000''.\n       On page 95, strike lines 1 through 8.\n       On page 123, line 9, strike ``$3,250,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$2,050,000,000''.\n       On page 123, strike line 18 and all that follows through \n     page 124, line 9.\n       On page 124, line 10, strike ``(3)'' and insert ``(2)''.\n       On page 124, line 13, strike ``(4)'' and insert ``(3)''.\n       On page 124, line 15, strike ``(5)'' and insert ``(4)''.\n       On page 125, line 1, strike ``(6)'' and insert ``(5)''.\n       On page 127, line 23, strike ``$1,088,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,000,000,000''.\n       On page 127, line 24, strike ``of which'' and all that \n     follows through ``and'' on page 128, line 3.\n       On page 128, strike lines 8 through 22.\n       On page 130, strike lines 4 through 10.\n       On page 213, line 22, strike ``$64,961,000'' and insert \n     ``$59,476,000''.\n       On page 213, line 25, strike ``; and'' and all that follows \n     through ``initiatives'' on lines 25 and 26.\n       On page 137, line 17, strike ``$5,800,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$5,325,000,000''.\n       On page 139, line 22, after ``funds:'' insert ``Provided \n     further, That none of the amounts available under this \n     paragraph may be used for the screening or prevention of any \n     sexually transmitted disease or for any smoking cessation \n     activities.''\n       On page 391, line 5, strike ``$79,000,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$62,150,000,000''.\n       At the end of division A, add the following:\n\n       TITLE XVII--FORECLOSURE PREVENTION MORTGAGE MODIFICATIONS\n\n     SEC. 1701. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title--\n       (1) the term ``Corporation'' means the Federal Deposit \n     Insurance Corporation;\n       (2) the term ``Chairperson'' means the Chairperson of the \n     Board of Directors of the Corporation;\n       (3) the term ``Secretaries'' means the Secretary of the \n     Treasury and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, \n     jointly;\n       (4) the term ``program'' means the foreclosure prevention \n     and mortgage modification program established under this \n     section; and\n       (5) the term ``eligible mortgage'' means an extension of \n     credit that is secured by real property that is the primary \n     residence of the borrower.\n\n     SEC. 1702. LOAN MODIFICATION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--The Chairperson shall establish a \n     systematic foreclosure prevention and mortgage modification \n     program, in consultation with the Secretaries, that--\n       (1) provides lenders and loan servicers with compensation \n     to cover administrative costs for each eligible mortgage \n     modified according to the required standards; and\n       (2) provides loss sharing or guarantees for certain losses \n     incurred if a modified eligible mortgage should subsequently \n     redefault.\n       (b) Program Components.--The program established under \n     subsection (a) shall include the following components:\n       (1) Exclusion for early payment default.--To promote \n     sustainable mortgages, loss sharing or guarantees under the \n     program shall be available only after the borrower has made a \n     specified minimum number of payments on the modified \n     mortgage, as determined by the Chairperson.\n       (2) Standard net present value test.--In order to promote \n     consistency and simplicity in implementation and auditing \n     under the program, the Chairperson shall prescribe and \n     require lenders and loan servicers to apply a standardized \n     net present value analysis for participating lenders and loan \n     servicers that compares the expected net present value of \n     modifying past due mortgage loans with the net present value \n     of foreclosing on such mortgage loans. The Chairperson shall \n     use standard industry assumptions to ensure that a consistent \n     standard for affordability is provided, based on a ratio of \n     the borrower's mortgage-related expenses to gross monthly \n     income specified by the Chairperson.\n       (3) Systematic loan review by participating lenders and \n     servicers.--\n       (A) Requirement.--Any lender or loan servicer that \n     participates in the program shall be required--\n       (i) to undertake a systematic review of all of the eligible \n     mortgage loans under its management;\n       (ii) to subject each such eligible mortgage loan to the \n     standard net present value test prescribed by the Chairperson \n     to determine whether it is suitable for modification under \n     the program; and\n       (iii) to offer modifications for all eligible mortgages \n     that meet such test.\n       (B) Disqualification.--Any lender or loan servicer that \n     fails to undertake a systematic review and to carry out \n     modifications where they are justified, as required by \n     subparagraph (A), shall be disqualified from further \n     participation in the program, pending proof of compliance \n     with subparagraph (A).\n       (4) Modifications.--Modifications to eligible mortgages \n     under the program may include--\n       (A) reduction in interest rates and fees;\n       (B) term or amortization extensions;\n       (C) forbearance or forgiveness of principal; and\n       (D) other similar modifications, as determined appropriate \n     by the Chairperson.\n       (5) Loss share calculation.--In order to ensure the \n     administrative efficiency and effective operation of the \n     program and to provide adequate incentive to lenders and loan \n     servicers to modify eligible mortgages and avoid unnecessary \n     foreclosures, the Chairperson shall define appropriate \n     standardized measures for loss sharing or guarantees.\n       (6) De minimis test.--The Chairperson shall implement a de \n     minimis test to exclude from loss sharing under the program \n     any modification that does not lower the monthly loan payment \n     to the borrower by at least 7 to 15 percent, at the \n     determination of the Chairperson.\n       (7) Time limit on loss sharing payment.--At the \n     determination of the Chairperson, a loss sharing guarantee \n     under the program shall terminate between 5 and 15 years \n     after the date on which the mortgage modification is \n     consummated, as determined by the Chairperson.\n\n     SEC. 1703. ALTERNATIVE COMPONENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Chairperson may, with the approval of \n     the Secretaries, and after making the certifications to \n     Congress required by subsection (b), implement foreclosure \n     prevention and mitigation actions other than those authorized \n     under section 1702.\n       (b) Certification to Congress.--The Chairperson shall \n     certify to Congress that the Chairperson believes the \n     alternative foreclosure mitigation actions would provide \n     equivalent or greater impact or have a more cost-effective \n     impact on foreclosure mitigation than those authorized under \n     section 1702.

The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 501\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will try to make this as quick as \npossible. This is as a result of the ``gang of two.'' I would encourage \neverybody here to form your own gang and see if you can save some money \nand do some good for the taxpayer. But it has been a real pleasure \nworking with Senator Conrad, who is the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, who knows more than I will ever hope to know about this, and \nhas probably forgotten more than most of us know about budgeting and \nspending.\n  We have looked at this bill, and we have similar concerns. One of the \nthings we agree on, I think pretty strongly, is that no amount of \nstimulus package, no matter how well constructed, is going to solve the \nNation's problems unless you do something about housing and banking.\n  We found some common ground on the housing part. Sheila Bair, who is \nthe Director of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, who was \nallowed to stay in her position by President Obama--and I compliment \nhim for doing that; she is a very smart lady--she has been telling \npeople throughout the country that there is a way to get ahead of the \nforeclosure problem if she had some money to modify mortgages that are \ntroubled. So what we have done is we have answered her call. She has \nindicated to us, through a letter, and what we have done is taken \n$22.725 billion, transferred it to her organization, and she will be \nable to use that money to deal with service providers to renegotiate \nmortgage loans that are underwater or about to go into default, make \nsure that the overall payments of the mortgageholder are no more than \n31 percent so people can afford it. The lender and investors would be \nrequired to achieve reductions through a combination of interest rate \nreduction, extended amortization, and principal forbearance.\n  In other words, she tells us if we gave her this amount of money, she \ncould sit down with the private sector and do the following:\n\n       This proposal is no silver bullet. But we do estimate that \n     it could reduce projected foreclosures by some 1.5 million, \n     assuming the program would last around 14 months.\n\n  Now, let me say that again. Some 1.5 million Americans, with this \namount of money, in her opinion, could avoid having their homes \nforeclosed on. I don't have names and faces, but imagine for a moment \npeople you know. That is a very big deal to me. And the money, $26-plus \nbillion, is taken out of the underlying bill. We offset it. And as a \ncompliment to my friend from North Dakota, it took us about 3 minutes \nto find offsets in this bill.\n  What we are able to do is we took a $75 billion fund for States that \nwas undesignated spending, no real rhyme or reason how it will \nstimulate the economy in the near term, and we said, wait a minute, we \nknow $16.85 billion, if given to the FDIC organization, Ms. Bair, if \nthey got $16 billion of that pot of money, they could save 1.5 million \npeople from foreclosure. If we would do that, it would help the housing \nmarket in general.\n  Again, my colleagues, we can print money until the press breaks. If \nyou do not deal with housing and banking, we are never going to shore \nup this economy. This is, I think, a very responsible amendment. We \ncould do a lot more with this bill. But we have the ability to transfer \nfunds from the underlying bill to the FDIC that could be used in a way \nto work with the private sector financial managers to help 1.5 million \npeople from going into foreclosure in the next 14 months.\n  I am very proud of the amendment. I am sure it is no silver bullet, \nas she indicates, but it shows you what we can do around here if we \nkeep our eye on the ball. At the end of the day, whatever amount this \nbill comes out to be, we have done very little for housing and nothing \nfor banking.\n  Our dear friend, Senator Dodd, on the Banking Committee, knows, and \nthe rest of us should know, that if you do not get credit flowing, if \nyou do not shore up housing, there is no amount of stimulus in the \nworld that is going to bring this economy back.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment, because it \nwill help Americans in the near term save their home from foreclosure. \nIt is responsibly spent, and the offsets, I think, are reasonable.\n  I will let my friend from North Dakota tell you about the stimulative \neffect of the offsets to our economy versus the stimulative effect of \nthe protection of housing of our amendment.\n  With that, I yield to my friend from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank Senator Graham from South Carolina for teaming up \non this amendment. I think it is critically important that this \namendment be adopted, because it goes right to the heart of the \nfinancial crisis we are facing.\n  Housing is right at the center of the economic meltdown that is \noccurring, and precious little is being done in this economic recovery \nbill to address it.\n  I salute Senator Isakson for his amendment the other night, because \nthat is the other half of a package I think makes sense for housing. \nThe Isakson amendment broadens the credit, an amendment that I offered \nin the Finance Committee that was adopted. Now we have the second piece \nof the puzzle, that is, to address foreclosures.\n  Some will say, we will wait. We will do this in the TARP. Well, No. \n1, there is not sufficient funding in TARP to deal with housing and the \nfinancial sector. In fact, the testimony before the Budget Committee--\nSenator Graham heard it, I heard it--said we are going to need $300 to \n$500 billion more in the TARP for the financial sector, without \naddressing at all the housing crisis.\n  I say to my colleagues, I urge my colleagues to think very carefully \nabout this prospect. We know this economy cannot recover without \nhousing being healthier, and without the financial sector being \nhealthier.\n  This amendment addresses housing, and it does it by reallocating \nfunding, not adding more money to this package, but reallocating money \nwithin the\n\n[[Page S1811]]\n\npackage. It is fully paid for, $22.8 billion that is needed to have the \nFDIC go forward with its plan to reduce foreclosures in America.\n  The Senator from South Carolina said it well. The letter from Sheila \nBair makes it clear. This amendment, under her estimate, would avert \n1.5 million home foreclosures in this country. I do not think we should \nwait. I do not think we should count on a TARP plan that is already \nunderfunded to deal with the financial crisis as the basis for funding \nthis approach. I think we should do it here. I think we should do it \nnow. And I think we should do it in a way that is paid for.\n  There is a certain level of expectation that occurs when a package \ncomes over from the House, and various allocations are made. The \nproblem is, that is not going to be the final bill leaving this \nChamber. That is clear. So adjustments are going to have to be made. \nPriorities are going to have to be determined.\n  I assert to my colleagues, housing ought to be certainly one of the \nhighest priorities to be addressed in any economic recovery package. \nThere are other things in this legislation that may be meritorious, may \nbe good, some of them stimulative, some of them less so. We have tried \nto focus on those things that are of questionable value in terms of \nstimulus. We started with the so-called stabilization fund. Now \nGovernors are going to get several hundred billion dollars under this \nplan. But one part of it, the economic stabilization fund, constitutes \na slush fund if ever there was one.\n  There are absolutely no strings attached. Governors can use it for \nany purpose. We have reduced that by some 70 percent. That is the \nbiggest pay-for here. Then we have taken other items that have become \nthe object of ridicule, $400 million for sexually transmitted diseases, \n$75 million for smoking cessation, and on it goes, things that are of \nquestionable value with respect to stimulus, things that, some of them, \nhave very slow spend-out rates. In one of them, only 17 percent of the \nmoney is spent in the first 2 years, so 83 percent is beyond 2 years.\n  We have tried to be careful and judicious with respect to the pay-\nfors to fund what I think has to be a critical priority.\n  Mr. President, how much time have I consumed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to say this before we give Senator \nGraham another chance, and then we are happy to hear Senator Dodd's \nconcern. This is a critical moment for this bill. Are we going to \naddress one of the two major crises facing this country, or are we \ngoing to largely say wait for another day? Wait for another day. Wait \nfor the TARP funds that are already oversubscribed.\n  There is about $300 billion left in TARP funds. The testimony before \nthe Budget Committee was crystal clear, from economists across a broad \nspectrum, Republicans and Democrats, that you are going to need another \n$300 to $500 billion in the TARP to deal with the financial crisis.\n  I say to my colleagues, if we want to deal with something fundamental \nwith respect to housing, here is our opportunity to do so.\n  I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has 4\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as I understand the TARP funding \nsituation, we are somewhere in the $310 billion range in terms of funds \nleft. I voted for TARP. It was a very tough vote for all of us. And the \nfirst $350 billion, let's put it this way, I do not think inspired a \nlot of confidence in the American people. I was told we were going to \nbuy toxic assets with the money, that we were going to get those bad \ndebts off the balance sheets so people could lend money. Unfortunately, \nmost of the money went to banks. And I do not have any idea what bank \ngot what, and I have no idea what they did with the money. I know the \nchairman of the Banking Committee is trying to figure that out.\n  The confidence level of the American people in us is pretty low right \nnow. Do we understand what we are doing and how are we going to get \nthere? I can assure you there is going to be more money requested for \nhousing and banking.\n  Every dollar we spend in the stimulus package that is off the mark is \nborrowed money, and it is going to make it harder to get new money for \nhousing and banking. So, dear colleague, the next time we go to the \nAmerican people and ask them to trust us with more of their money to \nfix banking and housing, they are going to judge us by TARP and this \nstimulus package. I am afraid we are not doing very well in their \nsight. This amendment will help in a small way. We can do a lot more.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Bond be added as \na cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record the letter from Sheila Bair to me and Senator Conrad about \nwhat this would do for housing: 1.5 million people would avoid \nforeclosure if this program were enacted for 14 months. That is a \npretty good use of money.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   Federal Deposit\n\n\n                                        Insurance Corporation,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 4, 2009.\n     Hon. Lindsey Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: This letter is in response to your \n     inquiry regarding the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation \n     proposal to reduce unnecessary foreclosures by providing \n     partial guarantees against future loss for distressed \n     mortgages that are restructured to provide affordable \n     payments over the life of the loan. We believe the best way \n     to address the problem of unnecessary foreclosures in scale \n     is to provide appropriate economic incentives for the \n     systematic restructuring of unaffordable mortgages into \n     affordable, sustainable obligations.\n       Specifically, our proposal would require lenders and \n     mortgage investors to restructure unaffordable mortgages into \n     loans with payments no greater than 31 percent of the \n     borrower's income. Lender and investors would be required to \n     achieve these reductions through a combination of interest \n     rate reductions, extended amortization, and principal \n     forebearance. In return, the government would agree to share \n     a portion of the losses if the loan later defaulted. In \n     developing this proposal, we have drawn from our long \n     experience in restructuring the troubled loans of failed \n     banks into performing assets, thereby enhancing their value \n     on sale. As millions of unnecessary foreclosures drag down \n     home prices and harm our economy, we believe there is an \n     urgent need for a federal program to provide appropriate \n     incentives for loan modifications as an alternative. More \n     widescale loan restructuring would help our economy and \n     preserve homeownership, while making good business sense as \n     the value of a performing mortgage will generally be greater \n     than that of a foreclosed home.\n       This proposal is no silver bullet, but we do estimate that \n     it could reduce projected foreclosures by some 1.5 million, \n     assuming the program would last around 14 months. The \n     projected costs of the program are $24.4 billion or less.\n       The enclosed document from our website provides additional \n     details about our loss sharing proposal. Please let me know \n     if we can provide additional information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Sheila C. Bair,\n                                                         Chairman.\n       Enclosure.\n\n  FDIC Loss Sharing Proposal to Promote Affordable Loan Modifications\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       Although foreclosures are costly to lenders, borrowers and \n     communities, the pace of loan modifications continues to be \n     extremely slow (around 4 percent of seriously delinquent \n     loans each month). It is imperative to provide incentives to \n     achieve a sufficient scale in loan modifications to stem the \n     reductions in housing prices and rising foreclosures.\n       Modifications should be provided using a systematic and \n     sustainable process. The FDIC has initiated a systematic loan \n     modification program at IndyMac Federal Bank to reduce first \n     lien mortgage payments to as low as 31% of monthly income. \n     Modifications are based on interest rate reductions, \n     extension of term, and principal forebearance. A loss share \n     guarantee on redefaults of modified mortgages can provide the \n     necessary incentive to modify mortgages on a sufficient \n     scale, while leveraging available government funds to affect \n     more mortgages than outright purchases or specific incentives \n     for every modification. The FDIC would be prepared to serve \n     as contractor for Treasury and already has extensive \n     experience in the IndyMac modification process.\n\n\n                 Basic Structure and Scope of Proposal\n\n       This proposal is designed to promote wider adoption of such \n     a systematic loan modification program:\n       1. by paying servicers $1,000 to cover expenses for each \n     loan modified according to the required standards; and\n\n[[Page S1812]]\n\n       2. sharing a proportion of losses incurred if a modified \n     loan should subsequently re-default\n       We envision that the program can be applied to the \n     estimated 1.4 million non-GSE mortgage loans that were 60 \n     days or more past due as of June 2008, plus an additional 3 \n     million non-GSE loans that are projected to become delinquent \n     by year-end 2009. Of this total of approximately 4.4 million \n     problem loans, we expect that about half can be modified, \n     resulting in some 2.2 million loan modifications under the \n     plan.\n\n\n                       Details on Program Design\n\n       Eligible Borrowers: The program will be limited to loans \n     secured by owner-occupied properties.\n       Exclusion for Early Payment Default: To promote sustainable \n     mortgages, government loss sharing would be available only \n     after the borrower has made a minimum number of payments on \n     the modified mortgage.\n       Standard NPV Test: In order to promote consistency and \n     simplicity in implementation and audit, a standard test \n     comparing the expected net present value (NPV) of modifying \n     past due loans compared to the strategy of foreclosing on \n     them will be applied. Under this NPV test, standard \n     assumptions will be used to ensure that a consistent standard \n     for affordability is provided based on a 31% borrower \n     mortgage debt-to-income ratio.\n       Systematic Loan Review by Participating Servicers: \n     Participating servicers would be required to undertake a \n     systematic review of all of the loans under their management, \n     to subject each loan to a standard NPV test to determine \n     whether it is a suitable candidate for modification, and to \n     modify all loans that pass this test. The penalty for failing \n     to undertake such a systematic review and to carry out \n     modifications where they are justified would be \n     disqualification from further participation in the program \n     until such a systematic program was introduced.\n       Simplified Loss Share Calculation: In order to ensure the \n     administrative efficiency of this program, the calculation of \n     loss share basis would be as simple as possible. In general \n     terms, the calculation would be based on the difference \n     between the net present value of the modified loan and the \n     amount of recoveries obtained in a disposition by \n     refinancing, short sale or REO sale, net of disposal costs \n     as estimated according to industry standards. Interim \n     modifications would be allowed.\n       De minimis Test: To lower administrative costs, a de \n     minimis test excludes from loss sharing any modification that \n     did not lower the monthly payment at least 10 percent.\n       Eight-year Limit on Loss Sharing Payments: The loss sharing \n     guarantee ends eight years of the modification.\n\n\n                         Impact of the Program\n\n       The table below outlines some of the basic assumptions \n     behind the scale of the plan and its expected costs. To \n     summarize, we expect that about half of the projected 4.4 \n     million problem loans between now and year-end 2009 can be \n     modified. Assuming a redefault rate of 33 percent, this plan \n     could reduce the number of foreclosures during this period by \n     some 1.5 million at a projected program cost of $24.4 \n     billion.\n\nProjected Number of Cost of Loan Modifications Under FDIC Loss Sharing \n                                Proposal\n\n       1.6 million total loans 60+/90+ past due now\n       GSE loans make up about 13 percent of problem loans at \n     present\n       Net: 1.4 million non-GSE problem loans at present\n       3.8 million new total loans 60+/90+ past due by y.e. 2009\n       Assume: GSE loans make up 20 percent of new problem loans \n     through y.e. 2009\n       Net 3.04 million new non-GSE problem loans through y.e. \n     2009\n       Total non-GSE problem loans through y.e. 2009: 4.44 million\n       Modify 1/2, or 2.22 million loans\n       Avg. loan size $200,000\n       Total book value of loans modified = $444 billion\n       Avg. program cost (FDIC assumptions) = 5.5 percent\n       Est. total program cost = $24.4 billion\n       Assuming redefault rate of 33 percent, almost 1.5 million \n     foreclosures avoided\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. First, let me begin by thanking both of my colleagues from \nNorth Dakota and South Carolina for their interest in the subject \nmatter.\n  Now, as I pointed out, 2 years ago tomorrow, I think it was, February \n7, 2007, as the new chairman of the Banking Committee, I held my first \nhearings, and the first hearings were on the foreclosure crisis.\n  At that time, a fellow by the name of Eakes testified before the \ncommittee and predicted 2.2 million foreclosures in the country. He was \nscoffed at all across the country for having such an outrageous \nprediction.\n  In fact, the criticism was correct. It was an outrageous prediction, \nbecause it was not 2.2 million, it is now 8 million.\n  I see my friend from New Jersey, Bob Menendez, who was at that \nhearing 2 years ago today. And he predicted a tsunami, were his words--\nI will never forget them--of how foreclosures were occurring in the \ncountry. And again, people laughed and ridiculed and suggested that we \nwere somehow predicting things that were never going to happen.\n  We have all learned, painfully, the results. We are in the pickle we \nare in today because we didn't respond to the foreclosure crisis at the \ntime. This is a major problem that deserves major attention. When we \nwrote the so-called TARP legislation in September, we required four \nthings. I won't bother with the first three; they were accountability, \ntaxpayer issues. One of the four points was to mitigate against \nforeclosures. We have learned, painfully over the last number of weeks, \nthat virtually nothing was done about foreclosure mitigation with the \noriginal $350 billion tranche.\n  My concerns--and I appreciate immensely the effort we are finally \ngetting some attention to this issue and looking for resources--are the \nfollowing: One, I am not sure foreclosure mitigation ought to be a part \nof a stimulus package. You can make a case for doing something about \nforeclosures, but that is why we have the TARP program. It is not only \nthe financial system. They are, of course, interrelated. It is not like \nthere is a housing issue and a financial system at risk that are \nseparate issues. They are the same issue, the foreclosure issue and the \nfinancial mess.\n  I am going to be offering shortly, along with Senators Reid and \nMartinez, legislation that requires that of the $310 to $350 billion in \nthe second tranche, that $50 billion be dedicated to foreclosure \nmitigation because that was what the intention was originally. While I \nam attracted to the proposal made by Sheila Bair at FDIC--and I mention \nthat in the amendment as one of the ideas, but there are a number of \nideas. I say, respectfully, to both my good friends, Senators Graham \nand Conrad, as I read the amendment, it would require the adoption of \nthe Sheila Bair approach. To me, that is worrisome because it is one \nidea but not the only idea, to allocate $20-some-odd billion to one \nidea at a time when we ought to be looking at various ideas that might \nactually work to mitigate foreclosures. She believes $25 billion would \ndo 1.2. She thinks $50 would double that number to 2.2 or close to 3. \nWe have a lot of numbers that get thrown around here.\n  My point is, it ought to be something we try not to congressionally \nmandate. We are good at a lot of things in the Congress, but when we \nstart micromanaging ideas such as this, we get ourselves into trouble. \nThat is why, hopefully, we have smart people out there who will \nconsider ideas and manage them well. But up here, when you try to set \naccounting standards or rigidly determine a particular formulation, I \nget uneasy.\n  The amendment we will offer goes beyond foreclosure mitigation. We \nalso clean up HOPE for Homeowners, which we all supported last summer--\nalmost all of us did--as a way to try and also deal with foreclosure \nmitigation. My concern would be that the adoption of this amendment \nwould preclude the adoption of the second amendment. I, respectfully, \nsuggest that what we have offered as our second amendment is a more \ncomprehensive approach.\n  I have held 82 hearings. I see my friend from Kentucky, Senator \nBunning, a member of the committee. We spent a lot of time over the \nlast 2 years on these issues. We haven't all agreed every time on \neverything--but 82 hearings and meetings, a third of which were on this \nsubject matter alone. I know we all respect each other for doing the \njobs we try to do. But having spent this much time trying to figure out \nwhat is the best answer, it seems to me TARP resources ought to be \nused, stimulant money ought to be used for job creation. Not that I \nwouldn't like to have extra resources to deal with this. We ought to \nhave a broad approach so we are not rigidly locked into a \ncongressionally mandated formula.\n  I won't bother to address offsets. My colleagues are trying very hard \nto do what we all ought to do and that is to pay for various things. I \nwill let others go down the list and whether they like or dislike the \nvarious offsets.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n\n[[Page S1813]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I find myself sort of in an awkward position. I don't want \nto be in the position of disagreeing with trying to do something about \nforeclosure mitigation. But we end up doing this and the next and we \nget to 75 or in excess of $75 billion for this particular issue, we are \ngetting excessive, it seems to me, without knowing whether a smaller \namount might achieve the job. If we are mandating it with two \nprovisions, then we are excluding resources that could be used for \nother things, including job creation, which is the debate about the \nstimulus package. My friend from North Dakota and I have talked about \nthis privately, and I thank my colleagues for raising the issue. I \ntruly have mixed emotions about this because I like what they are doing \non the one hand, but I am concerned that as between the two choices--\nthe one Senators Martinez, Reid, and I will offer and this one--I think \nwe offer a more comprehensive one, one that relies on greater \nflexibility and uses TARP money rather than stimulant money to achieve \nthe result.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes to ask a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I agree completely with my colleague's \nsentiments. Why, in this hard fought bill, where we don't have enough \nmoney for everything else and we are all worried about it and we know \nwe have money from the TARP, $50 to $100 billion promised to deal with \nhousing, why take the money out of here when we need it for \ninfrastructure and for middle-class tax cuts and all the other things. \nI ask my colleague, in effect, to the people being foreclosed upon, is \nthere any difference if we take the money out of TARP or take the money \nout of this stimulus, even though we know there is a huge difference to \nall the other people who will suffer $20 billion in cuts? Is there any \ndifference, in effect, on their lives and on how we can help them?\n  Mr. DODD. There is only in this sense. This bill has a specific \nrequirement that a particular plan be adopted and funded with this \nproposal. I admire Sheila Bair's proposal, but we also recognize there \nare others. At the same time, if we are dealing with foreclosure \nmitigation but not getting that person who is probably in foreclosure \nbecause they may have lost a job, if we don't make it possible for them \nto get back to work because we minimize the resources in the stimulus, \nsaving their home but not saving their job ends up with sort of a very \nmixed message.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Excellent point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I submit we will not save people's jobs or \ntheir homes unless we have a comprehensive strategy to address both. \nThe problem with the economic recovery package is there is precious \nlittle in here that does anything about the housing crisis. We hear the \nassurance that we can take the money from the TARP. The problem is the \nTARP, by testimony before the Budget Committee, is oversubscribed as it \nis.\n  Let's do the math. There is about $300 billion left in the TARP. The \ntestimony before the Budget Committee is, we need $300 to $500 billion \non top of that $300 billion just to deal with the financial crisis. \nThat doesn't leave any money for the housing crisis. Here we have \nbefore us a vehicle to face up to foreclosures. Senator Dodd is \nabsolutely right. I remember well his holding a hearing on \nforeclosures. I remember well his coming to this floor with \nlegislation. I remember well filibuster after filibuster against \ndealing with it. Now is the time. We should not wait to take on the \nforeclosure crisis in America. More foreclosures, more homes lost, more \npeople unable to pay, more banks have their capital impaired, fewer \nloans being made, more jobs lost. This is an opportunity to deal with \nthe housing crisis and to have it paid for and to have it paid for out \nof economic recovery funds.\n  I don't know how I would explain to my constituents that housing \nwasn't a key part of an economic recovery package.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I retain that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If I believed we could fix housing and the banking \nsituation with $310 billion, I would sit down and withdraw the \namendment. I don't think we can. I am trying to help. As to my friend \nfrom New York, if you think it is more important to spend $400 million \nto deal with sexually transmitted diseases than it is to save 1.5 \nmillion homes, vote against us. I have an offset here. Go through this. \nIf you think this is a better use of money than allocating money to \nsave people from losing their homes, vote no. We are not in a perfect \nworld. We are in a miserable world. We have a stimulus package that has \nvery little to do with stimulating the economy and a lot to do with \ngrowing the Government. We have a housing problem and a banking problem \nthat are going to cost a lot more than $300 billion. That is what we \nare trying to say to our colleagues. The problems are massive. The \nspending bill is too large. We are trying to create some sense of \npriorities and urgency. So the $16 billion slush fund that is not going \nto create any job, if you think it is better to have that than it is to \nsave 1.5 million homes from foreclosure with a program that Sheila Bair \nthinks will work, let's do it.\n  I wish to work with Senator Dodd to improve the funding available to \ndeal with foreclosures. This is not a silver bullet, but it will help. \nWe have our priorities mixed up. We have a spending bill that doesn't \ncreate jobs. It grows the Government. We don't have enough money to fix \nhousing and the underlying banking problem because we have been \nincompetent with the first $350 billion. I am not blaming anybody. I am \ntelling America the worst is yet to come, and we are wasting money and \nwasting time. This is not a perfect world. This is a Congress making it \nup as we go. I would like to get some rhyme or reason as to what we are \ndoing. This amendment has a rhyme or reason about what we are doing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that 10 more minutes be allocated \nto the Conrad-Graham amendment, equally divided, because there are some \nwho still want to speak in opposition to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Who \nyields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee who \nis managing the bill. Maybe I will just take a few minutes. I \nunderstand we have another colleague who is on his way and wants to \nspeak.\n  The comment was made that this amendment requires us to use the \nSheila Bair approach. Let me say, in this whole crisis, the Government \nofficial who shines the brightest and the best has been Sheila Bair. \nShe is the person who has warned us that this tsunami of foreclosures \nwas coming. She is the one who warned us of the financial crisis. She \nis the one who had the most consistent track record about dealing with \nit and dealing with it effectively. Institution after institution she \nhas taken over, under the rules and the law, have been dealt with in \nthe most economically rational way.\n  Now she has come forward with a plan that observers and economists of \nevery stripe have said is outstanding. It has the best prospects for \nsuccess at preventing people from losing their homes.\n  This is much more than numbers on a page. When we talk about 1.5 \nmillion people not going through foreclosure if our amendment is \nadopted, according to Sheila Bair and her professional staff, 1.5 \nmillion people, this is much more than that number. Think of what is \nhappening in those families, when they have the sense they are going to \nlose their homes and start through a legal process that sucks them \ndown. I read yesterday what was happening in courts locally as people \nwent in facing foreclosure, the absolute desperation of the people, the \nconfusion, the chaos in their lives. With this amendment, we have a \nchance to avert 1.5 million\n\n[[Page S1814]]\n\nAmerican families from going through foreclosure. It is paid for. It is \npaid for in the least painful way.\n  Let me conclude on the notion of waiting for TARP. The TARP funds are \nsimply insufficient to deal with the financial crisis and the housing \ncrisis. There can be no question. I predict right here, right now, this \nadministration will be coming to us in the weeks ahead asking for \nbetween $400 and $500 billion more of TARP funds just to deal with the \nfinancial crisis. Senator Graham was there. We had three of the most \noutstanding economists in the country, Democrats and Republicans, \ntelling us exactly that. To hope and pray that somehow the TARP funds \nare going to be the savior for housing foreclosure is not something I \nwould want to count on.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does the Senator agree with me that whether we can get \nthe public to buy into $500 billion, $400 billion more, has a lot to do \nwith their confidence level in how we are spending their money through \nthe TARP and through the stimulus package? We are trying to improve \ntheir confidence level by having offsets that make sense; does he agree \nthat is the purpose?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think it is just fundamental that one way to build \nconfidence with the American people is to show them we are using their \nprecious taxpayer dollars in the highest priority areas and we are \ndoing it in a responsible way--not adding to deficits and debt, not \ncreating a huge bow wave for the Federal budget going forward. Some of \nthe items we have taken out only spend out 17 percent in the next 2 \nyears; 83 percent is beyond.\n  So I hope my colleagues are listening carefully to this debate \nbecause this one really matters. Mr. President, 1.5 million homes can \navoid foreclosure.\n  Let me say, we have not locked in a rigid approach on the FDIC \nproposal on dealing with foreclosures. We have allowed them to make \nmodifications in their plan so it can take in the best ideas of others. \nBut I think every observer, every economist who has looked at the FDIC \nplan has confirmed what Sheila Bair has told us in writing today: that \nthis amendment, voted on today, could help prevent 1.5 million people \nfrom losing their homes and creating a further downdraft in this \neconomy--more foreclosures, more banks cannot lend, more jobs lost. \nThat is exactly what an economic recovery package should be about.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I retain?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes for the proponents of the \namendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield whatever time my colleague from New \nYork would need.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Three minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President, and I thank my friend from \nConnecticut, our leader and chairman of the Banking Committee, for his \ntime and his words.\n  Let me be clear to my colleagues, this is not about whether you want \nto help people who face foreclosure. It has been a fight I have been \nmaking since a year and a half ago, when Senators Brown and Casey and I \nput money into the appropriations bill of 2008 for counselors. Nor is \nit about the priorities of where you should cut that specifically are \nlaid out by my friend and great chairman of the Budget Committee, \nSenator Conrad. This is very simple common sense. We are sitting here. \nA bill may not even pass because we cannot decide where we can make \ncuts. We have some who want a number lower. We have some who want a \nnumber higher. The fights are over important issues such as education \nand health care and roads and broadband and all of the things we think \nwe need to get this economy working again--some short term, some long \nterm.\n  We all agree with that. We all agree with helping those who need help \nbecause their homes may be foreclosed upon. However, the reason I think \nwe should have an overwhelming vote against the amendment of my good \nfriend from North Dakota is simple: The money comes from the wrong \nplace.\n  We have $50 billion to $100 billion in the TARP--the second half of \nthe TARP--that has been committed by President Obama to do the very \nthings my colleague wishes to take out of the stimulus bill. Why don't \nwe wait? We are going to have an announcement early next week about \nthose moneys. Wouldn't it be foolish to take those moneys out of this \nbill when we are so hurting and we have so limited money? It is as if \nwe have seven children in a bed and enough blanket for five and there \nis a struggle as to whose feet are going to be stuck out or who is not \ngoing to be covered? Wouldn't it be embarrassing if next week the \nadministration announces they are taking this very money out of the \nTARP? It just does not make any sense, in my judgment, in my humble \njudgment.\n  So I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, whatever side they \nare on. If they think the money should not be taken out of the specific \nlist Senator Conrad has compiled, if they think it should go to \nforeclosure and come from something else----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, would my colleague have 2 more minutes? \nAre we limited in time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. We are limited, Mr. President.\n  I am sorry. The Senator is managing the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this is, obviously, a discussion that has \nprovoked a bit more discussion than I think any of us anticipated, and \nit is a worthwhile discussion. So I ask unanimous consent that there be \nan additional 10 minutes because I know there are several other Members \nwho want to be heard on this amendment, and certainly my colleague from \nNorth Dakota may request some additional time as well. We may not use \nit all, but to give us enough time to flesh this out, if we can, I ask \nfor 10 additional minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is that equally divided?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes, equally divided. I do not know how much time we will \nneed, but just to--and I will yield whatever time my colleague from New \nYork needs. Two minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  So under the amendment of my friend from North Dakota, the money \nwould not come from the banks but come from all these programs we like. \nUnder the next amendment that will be offered by the chairman of the \nBanking Committee, the Senator from Connecticut, the money will come--\ninstead of going to banks, it will go directly into foreclosure. If we \ndo what the Senator from North Dakota wants, there is going to be $150 \nbillion to $100 billion more going to the banks.\n  I think many of us think that money that was in the first $350 \nbillion was not wisely spent. If we do what the Senator from \nConnecticut will propose shortly, the money will not come out of \neducation and health care and broadband, but it will come out of giving \nmore money to the banks. So if you want extra money for the banks, the \namendment from the Senator from North Dakota is in order.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to my friend from \nSouth Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The point I am trying to make, I say to the Senator, is, \nI may be wrong, but I do not believe the remaining amount of money in \nTARP--$310 billion, I believe it is--will take care of what we need to \ndo with our banking problem and our housing problem. Am I wrong?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I think my colleague may not be wrong. \nBut I would add this, given that it is my time: Whether we only need \n$200 billion or $310 billion or $500 billion or $600 billion more, \nlet's take the money we have out of this pocket, which is not being \nspent well, from the banks, and use it instead of money out of this \nhardly fought economic recovery bill. That is my basic point.\n\n[[Page S1815]]\n\n  I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  I hope, with a great deal of respect, we will reject the amendment \noffered by the Senator from North Dakota and then do the same thing but \ntake the money from the banks by supporting the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Connecticut.\n  I yield the floor and yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have heard now from the Senator from New \nYork that we should wait to deal with foreclosures--we should wait. \nWell, that is the opportunity that is before us. We can make a choice \non this amendment. We can wait some more to deal with foreclosures or \nwe can take action today.\n  Sheila Bair, the much respected head of the FDIC, has said that if \nour amendment passes, we can avert 1.5 million Americans from being \nforeclosed upon. You want to wait on that? What are you going to wait \nfor? You are going to wait to take the money out of the TARP when there \nis insufficient money in the TARP to deal with the financial crisis, \nmuch less the housing crisis and the financial crisis?\n  Look, this is the curious sort of Washington math that has us in deep \ntrouble. We talk about using money that has already been spoken for, \nand somehow we are supposed to use it twice, maybe three times. I \nsuggest it is much better to act now and to use real money to pay for \nit rather than be counting on a fund that is already oversubscribed.\n  Now, this notion of waiting leaves me cold. Mr. President, 1.5 \nmillion people are out there facing foreclosure, and those families \ncould have the foreclosure averted if we act. This is not the time to \nwait. This is the time to act.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If our colleagues looked at the items we are using to \noffset, do you agree with me, I say to the Senator, not only could most \nof these items wait, it would be probably good we never spent the money \nat all?\n  So when you talk about priorities between 1.5 million people who \ncould be saved from foreclosure in 14 months with this money versus \nwhat we are offsetting--and only 17 percent of the offset money, I say \nto the Senator, I believe, is spent in the first year--the $22 billion \nwe give to the FDIC to manage foreclosures would save 1.5 million homes \nin 14 months.\n  So I would argue we are not shortchanging anyone by offsetting this \nmoney, that what is in the offset not only could wait, a lot of it \ncould wait till hell froze over because it makes no sense to spend it \nto begin with.\n  So it is not as if we are robbing somebody with a useful program. We \nhave looked into this $800 billion, $900 billion--whatever it is--bill, \nI say to the Senator, and we are astonished to find that maybe there is \nsome money in here that does not make a whole lot of sense in terms of \nstimulating the economy, saving housing or banking, and I think we have \ndone a pretty good job of offsetting it.\n  I would ask my colleagues one simple question, and I will end with a \nquestion to the Senator from North Dakota. If you assume we are going \nto be asking the American people for more money to fix their housing \nproblem and their banking problem, the question I have is, one, why \nwait when we can do something now? And why would you put what is in \nthis bill in this offset ahead of housing? I just do not understand \nthat. Do you, as the Senator from North Dakota?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  I really do not. I really do not understand the logic of waiting. We \ncould take action today, action that is paid for, and save money out of \nthe TARP fund that is already oversubscribed. It is as clear as it can \nbe, there are not sufficient funds in the TARP to do all that is being \ndemanded of it. I do not know how anything makes more sense or is of a \nhigher priority in an economic recovery program than to avert \nforeclosure. It ties directly to jobs because if a house is foreclosed \non, all the houses in the neighborhood lose value. Then what happens? \nThen more homes are upside down.\n  Already, one in every four or one in every five homes in America is \nupside down. They owe more than the house is worth. If more houses go \nthrough foreclosure, more homes lose value, more people start not to \nmake their payments, the banks have less capital, they are less able to \nlend, businesses are less able to carry on their activity, more jobs \nare lost, and more foreclosure occurs.\n  The critical thing is to break the chain. That is the opportunity \nthis amendment presents.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first of all, acting now or acting later--\nassuming we vote on this amendment offered by my friends from South \nCarolina and North Dakota, within minutes after that, I will be \noffering the amendment that would require that the $50 billion come out \nof the TARP money. I do not know what delay we are talking about.\n  We are promoting the same piece of legislation. The money has already \nbeen appropriated to deal TARP, so it is there. So the question is not \nabout delaying one in favor of the other. The question is, Which pot do \nyou want to draw from?\n  This is sort of a disconnect amendment. We were debating a stimulus \npackage, I thought. Maybe we are not. I know there is some debate about \nthat in the Chamber.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I hate to do this because I hate it when \npeople do it to me, but I just want to ask a question, if I could.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield to my colleague for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I think the Banking Committee chairman has a major \ndilemma on his hands, at no fault of his own. If I thought $310 billion \nwould do it, I would not be here. I think you are going to need more \nmoney, and if you take 50 out of the TARP, you are going to have \nwhatever the math is left, and that is still not enough.\n\n  So what we are trying to do is get money for housing and taking it \nout of a bill that I think has a lot of room to be offset. I am trying \nto help, not hurt. I think you are going to need both.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my colleague. I \nonly have 1 minute. I have not been directly involved in the Finance or \nAppropriations Committees, but I have listened to the debate over the \nlast several days, and I think the debate is this: Is this bill a \nstimulus bill? If it is a stimulus bill, we are talking about job \ncreation. Is it a foreclosure bill? Maybe we changed the debate. If it \nis a foreclosure debate, I thought I was on something else. So if we \nwant to talk about putting people to work and simultaneously now we are \ngoing to take $23 billion out of the stimulus bill and put it in \nforeclosure mitigation, it seems to me this is a different debate.\n  I would just say to my colleagues as someone who has chairmanship \nwith jurisdiction over TARP at this point: No, the money has not been \nallocated. In fact, we have the Secretary of the Treasury coming to our \ncommittee on Tuesday to describe exactly what their intentions are with \nthe $310 billion to $350 billion, and I don't know what it is yet.\n  This much I will tell you. I went through all the debate and the \ndiscussion last fall with the previous administration, and we as a body \nsaid: We want you to do three or four things with that money, one of \nwhich is foreclosure mitigation. I got the commitments, all the \nhandshakes, and not a nickel of it was spent on it. I am assuming this \nnew crowd may be a bit different on that subject matter. But if you \nwere to ask me whether I have a commitment that any of that $310 \nbillion or $350 billion is going to be spent on housing, my answer is I \ndon't know.\n  I have an amendment with Senator Martinez and Senator Reid in a \nminute that mandates that $50 billion go to foreclosure mitigation out \nof the TARP funds. No debate any longer, you have to do it. You know, \nburn me once, burn me twice--we all know the expression. So I am not \ngoing to run the risk\n\n[[Page S1816]]\n\nof watching another TARP come along and end up going to Citi and Bank \nof America and everyone else and nothing happening on foreclosure \nmitigation.\n  So it is a choice we have to make. We have a stimulus bill to do \nsomething about job creation. That is the debate over the last week. \nMany of my colleagues on the other side have raised issues about \nwhether we are spending money to actually create jobs in the country. \nThat is a legitimate debate. But you can't on the one hand complain \nabout this bill because it doesn't create jobs and then offer a $24 \nbillion amendment that doesn't do anything about jobs. It deals with \nforeclosure.\n  Now, if you are going to take $75 billion and dedicate it to a \nsubject matter that can be handled with a lot less, that is a waste of \nmoney. So it is a matter of choices. We are bypassing each other. The \ndebate is about stimulus.\n  Now, $16 billion, $17 billion of the money comes out of one fund for \nStates. My colleagues ought to look at this. There is a lot of other \nspending. I am not going to pretend to understand this; I don't serve \non the committee. I respect those who think some of this is unnecessary \nspending. But $17 billion going back to the States for job creation, I \nwould remind my colleagues, is what they cut out of the bill if this \namendment is adopted. I suspect the States all across this country may \nbe counting on some of that for job creation, maybe not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Equally divided.\n  Mr. DODD. Well, then 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. We are going round and round on this, but I find this \ndebate--again, I want to make the point that I am grateful to both of \nmy colleagues for raising the issue of foreclosures in housing. I find \nmyself somewhat at cross-purposes because, on the one hand I agree with \nwhat they are trying to do; on the other hand--I say this \nrespectfully--I think we are undermining our cause by approaching it \nthis way. We are diminishing the effect of the stimulus bill by doing \nsomething on housing, which is a legitimate issue but is not the \nsubject of the debate of the underlying bill, and we are simultaneously \npotentially denying our opportunity to mandate that this new \nadministration dedicate resources within the TARP to deal exactly with \nthe underlying cause of the economic crisis.\n  So that is the real choice involved. Again, I say it is an awkward \ndebate and argument. I know Senator Inouye and others wish to be heard \non these appropriations issues and, particularly, I suspect the $16 \nbillion to the States. I will let my colleagues make that case. I know \nSenator Inouye would like some time on that to address that issue. But \nthat is the real point in a sense. I have listened to my colleagues say \nthis bill is loaded up with things that don't effect job creation, and \nI would say, respectfully, by insisting upon foreclosure mitigation in \nthis bill, it seems to me we are just contributing to the very \narguments being made about the underlying criticism of the legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, there are very few Members for whom I have \nhigher regard or greater affection than the Senator from Connecticut. \nSo I say that I could not more profoundly disagree when I hear him say \nforeclosure mitigation has nothing to do with jobs.\n  Why is this economy in free fall? Well, one central reason is the \nhousing crisis. Foreclosures are a symptom of the underlying disease, \nand if you don't treat it, this body is getting sicker and sicker and \nsicker. The Senator offers as an alternative to take $50 billion out of \nthe existing TARP fund. The problem is the existing TARP fund doesn't \nhave enough money for the purpose for which it was created, which was \nto deal with the fiscal crisis.\n  So this has everything to do with economic recovery. It has \neverything to do with jobs. It has everything to do with strengthening \nthe economy. I know Senator Graham is seeking recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Connecticut has \nasked a very good question. What are we doing here? Are we trying to \nspend TARP money? Well, apparently we are going to do that next. I \nthought we were stimulating the economy.\n  The President said this is a spending bill. Well, all spending \ndoesn't stimulate the economy: $400 million for sexually transmitted \ndisease research and $75 million to get people to quit smoking--those \nthings don't stimulate the economy in the near term. They may be very \nworthwhile. You have issues with TARP. I didn't think we were going to \ncome over here and divide TARP. I am with you, Senator Dodd, I don't \nthink you have enough money.\n  What I want to do with my colleague from North Dakota is to let the \nbody know we are spending a lot of money--more than any American can \nappreciate--on things that don't stimulate the economy. If you want to \nget our economy back on its feet, take some of the money we are going \nto waste in this bill and put it into a program that will save 1.5 \nmillion people from foreclosure. I think it is smart to do that now. I \nthink it is smart to look at TARP and maybe grow the fund if it is \nnecessary.\n  That is the point. This bill has lost focus. For one person it is \nspending. For the other person it is rearranging TARP. For us it is \ntrying to save housing. I don't think we know what we are doing. I \nthink we need to understand we don't have enough money in TARP to fix \nAmerica's problems with housing and banking, and every dollar we waste \nhere and what we are taking out of this bill is purely waste, in my \nopinion.\n  To help housing is smart. If you don't think it is smart, vote no. I \nwill respect you. But this whole process has gotten out of hand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to remind my colleagues there \nare a number of Senators waiting to propose amendments, and I think \nthis amendment has been very much debated. I look forward to Senator \nBunning and Senator Grassley and other Senators who are waiting to \npresent amendments.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona is absolutely \ncorrect. It has been a good debate we have had on the Dodd-Conrad-\nGraham issue.\n  The next amendment that can be called up on the list would be on the \nRepublican side of the aisle. I don't know who wants to call up his \namendment next, but someone on the Republican side of the aisle should \ndo so, and I am hoping perhaps we could enter into some kind of time \nagreement.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, 5 minutes for me.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Say 10 minutes equally divided; is that all right?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, which \namendment are we talking about?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Grassley No. 297. There would be a time limit for debate \nonly, no vote on the amendment.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. How much time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Ten minutes equally divided has been the suggestion.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Could we move that to 20 minutes equally divided?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. We could, equally divided.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would just as soon leave it at 5 \nminutes because we have all of these other colleagues. We just spent an \nhour on one amendment, and we have plenty of people on both sides of \nthe aisle. I think we ought to be tolerant toward our colleagues and \nmake this debate very short. If you want me to do it in 4 minutes, I \nwill do it in 4 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate that, but unfortunately there are Senators \non this side of the aisle who want to speak in opposition, and the \ntotal time they want to use is more than 4 minutes. I will hold it to \n20 minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, I think 5 minutes on this \nside and 10 minutes on your side.\n\n[[Page S1817]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate that, but if we don't get an agreement, it \nis going to be longer. So discretion being the better part of valor, I \nsuggest 20 minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 297 to Amendment No. 98\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, amendment No. 297 is an FMAP amendment. \nThis amendment is about $2.3 billion of the $87 billion that is in this \nbill for Medicare. There will be no less money spent in Medicare \noverall. It will still be $87 billion. We are talking about the $87 \nbillion and the formula as to how it is divided.\n  Let me ask my colleagues a question: If Congress is going to give \nStates $87 billion in Medicaid funds, shouldn't the formula be fair? \nThe exceedingly complex formula in this bill is simply not fair to \ncertain States. It is not fair to States with low unemployment rates or \nStates that have not seen the recession hit full force yet, and for \nthose States where the recession hasn't hit, it is just around the \ncorner. For instance, in the Midwest agricultural areas, we tend to be \ncountercyclical. We tend to be lagging when we hit recession. Yet we \nwill be coming along into recession when the other parts of the country \nare recovering.\n  Now, those States I just mentioned that have low unemployment, as an \nexample, will see less of the $87 billion than other States. My \namendment gives each State a flat 9.5-percent increase in their FMAP \npayments, and the States can choose which 9 consecutive quarters in any \n11-quarter period best fits the economic needs of their State. That is \na better, more fair way to spend the $87 billion.\n  This amendment is budget neutral. According to data provided by the \nGovernment Accountability Office, my amendment redistributes about $2.3 \nbillion of FMAP spending in the bill. Almost 75 percent of that \nredistribution comes from four States: California, Illinois, \nMassachusetts, and New York. With a redistribution, nearly 75 percent \nof which comes from four States, 34 States will receive more Medicaid \nFMAP funds under this amendment.\n  If Congress is going to spend $87 billion on States through Medicaid \nFMAP, I believe we have to do it more fairly.\n  I wish to quickly run through the States that will do better so you \ncan decide if you want your State to have more money or less money. \nMore money will go to Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, the District \nof Columbia, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, \nLouisiana, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, \nNew Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, \nOklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, \nVermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.\n  Before I yield the floor and reserve my time, under the unanimous \nconsent agreement that has been entered into, I call up my amendment \nNo. 297 and make it pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 297.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide the same temporary increase in the FMAP for all \nStates and to permit States to choose the period through June 2011 for \n                        receiving the increase)\n\n       Beginning on page 714, strike line 1 and all that follows \n     through page 725, line 14, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 5001.

The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I wish to submit a question to the \nSenator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I ask Senator Grassley, is it accurate to say that my \nState of Kentucky will get an additional $92 million in Medicare funds \nif the Senator's amendment passes; if the amendment fails, that money \nwould go to California, Illinois, Massachusetts, and New York?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, from the figures I have, the Senator is absolutely \nright. That number is that amount.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I first would point out that in the \nGrassley amendment the amount of Medicaid money--not Medicare money but \nMedicaid--is not affected. What is affected and what is at stake is the \nformula.\n  Do you give it across the board to every State equally or do you give \nthe majority of it across the board but you keep a part of it, which \ngoes to States that are particularly distressed?\n  In 2006, the GAO issued a report that said two major things: 1, the \nbest measure of Medicaid distress is unemployment; 2, it is more \nefficient to target funding to States with the greatest need. That is a \nfact. We all know that.\n  This bill accomplishes those very clear recommendations made by the \nGAO. It ties Medicaid relief to unemployment and it targets relief to \nStates that need it the most.\n  The Grassley amendment would make Medicaid relief less efficient and \nprolong the budget woes in States experiencing the greatest economic \ndistress. I think it is a matter of fairness and not complicated. It \ndoesn't attack the integrity of the Medicaid Program itself.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Grassley amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to \nSenator Grassley's amendment, which removes the targeted assistance for \nthe temporary increase in Federal Medicaid funding contained in this \nbill.\n  It is well established that Medicaid enrollment increases in direct \nrelation to unemployment growth. For every percentage increase in \nunemployment, States see an additional 1 million people seeking \nMedicaid assistance. I find it deeply troubling that at a point when \nhealth care is most needed, Minnesota and other States will not be \ngiven the assistance the situation demands.\n  By eliminating the portion of assistance that is targeted based on \nStates' unemployment rates, Senator Grassley's amendment would \nsignificantly reduce assistance for States facing the largest increases \nin their unemployment rates and the largest budget deficits.\n  Instead of providing aid to those who need it most, his amendment \nprovides relief for States that are, in some cases, even enjoying a \nbudget surplus. Nineteen of the 20 States facing the smallest increase \nin unemployment would get more assistance under this amendment. Is that \nan effective use of Federal money? At a time when we should be focusing \nall our efforts on ways we can best spend taxpayer dollars, sending aid \nto States that have less need doesn't make sense.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider this. This is about accountability to \nthe people of this country. This is about targeted assistance. We have \nheard a lot about targeting spending, putting spending where we need \nit. This is also about targeted assistance to the States that need it \nmost.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  The Presiding officer. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise in very strong opposition to this \namendment. It is interesting--I guess the arguments for and against \nthis bill move, depending upon your point of view, especially those who \nare against the bill overall. They have certain standards, and then \nthey obliterate those standards when it doesn't work for them. For \nexample, targeting. What does the Government Accountability Office say? \nThey say targeting is important.\n  According to a letter from the GAO--Members of Congress implied that \nit is more efficient to target funding to States with what? Greater \nneed. That larger amounts of funding are needed to get the same \nstimulative effect if an across-the-board approach is used. With less \ntargeting, more funding goes to States with less need; less funding \ngoes to States that need it the most. So much for it being targeted. \nThe Government Accountability Office says targeting means you want to \ndo it the way that was devised originally--by the way, this came over \nfrom the House with a 50/50 proposition. Then the chairman of the \nFinance Committee said, well, let's try to work that out in a more \nconciliatory way and put it at 60/40. Amendments were offered that made \nit 80/20. We are talking about States that have higher unemployment, \nmore people who don't have a job, who cannot put food on the table, and \nat the end of the day find themselves in desperate need. So States with \nhigher unemployment clearly have a greater need for assistance. The \nhigher the State's unemployment, the more people qualify for Medicaid \nand the less revenue a State has to pay for those increased Medicaid \nrolls.\n  Therefore, increases in unemployment, which is where the underlying \nbill is, and was even in a greater way, is the recognition. It is not \nabout just spreading the wealth across the process and, more \nimportantly, spreading the amount of taxpayer money across the\n\n[[Page S1819]]\n\nprocess; this is about targeting where greater numbers of people are \nunemployed. States like my own that have high percentages of \nunemployment, would be happy to give you the unemployment in your \nStates and not realize it in our States at higher levels. But it seems \nto me the way this is being pursued--this particular amendment--by \neliminating targeting, that reduces assistance to the States with the \nworst economic problems and thus the greatest need for relief.\n  So by eliminating the portion of assistance targeted based on a \nState's unemployment rates, the amendment significantly reduces \nassistance for States facing the largest increases in their \nunemployment rate. That doesn't make sense. In addition, this \namendment, at a time in which we are saying we want it to be \nstimulative--and I have heard arguments on how the money doesn't get \nout there quickly enough--well, this amendment permits the States to \ndelay by 6 months, potentially reducing the stimulative effect of this \nportion of the legislation.\n  Finally, 19 of the 20 States facing the smallest increase in \nunemployment would get more assistance under this amendment--a little \ncounterintuitive. If the State has more unemployment, it would get less \nmoney. For all of those reasons, and because this is already \ndramatically shifted in the way my colleague from Iowa wants, this \namendment should be defeated both in the Nation's interest, in the \npursuit of targeted and stimulative and, at the same time, basic \nfairness.\n  I reserve whatever time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am going to tell the Senator from New \nJersey that I agree with him totally on part of the money that is in \nthis $87 billion. He is absolutely right on his argument for $10.8 \nbillion of the money that is in there. That is the money we have had \nthe CBO say is going to be spent for Medicaid for the unemployed. But \nwhat about the other $75 billion or $76 billion? We don't apologize for \nit somehow. It is a slush fund to States.\n  There is no rationale for that part of the money to go out under the \nsame circumstances as the result of the recession--the fact that people \nare going to need more medical care. I ask him to consider that the \nSenator is right for a small part of this $87 billion--$10.8 billion of \nit--but wrong about the remaining amount of it. So that is why I have \nmy amendment as a matter of fairness for money being distributed to the \nStates, unrelated to unemployment, or medical care that is needed \nbecause of unemployment.\n  I want to spend my few minutes telling you what States benefit: \nAlabama, $41 million; Alaska, $45 million; Arizona, $58 million; \nArkansas, $99 million; District of Columbia, $43 million; Georgia, $31 \nmillion; Idaho, $16 million; Indiana, $29 million; Iowa, $128 million; \nKansas, $61 million; Kentucky, $92 million; Louisiana, $158 million; \nMaine, $23 million; Maryland, $1 million; Mississippi, $102 million; \nMissouri, $51 million; Montana, $25 million; Nebraska, $52 million; New \nHampshire, $22 million; New Mexico, $86 million; North Carolina, $54 \nmillion; North Dakota, $25 million; Ohio, $78 million; Oklahoma, $86 \nmillion; Oregon, $4 million; South Carolina, $47 million; South Dakota, \n$24 million; Tennessee, $32 million; Texas, $547 million; Utah, $59 \nmillion; Vermont, $2 million; West Virginia, $86 million; Wisconsin, \n$55 million; Wyoming, $13 million.\n  I think what we are talking about here is a matter of fairness for \nthose States--for the portion of the FMAP that doesn't need to be \nneeded except for medical care for the unemployed. The part going to \nStates under the FMAP formula needs a more fair distribution.\n  I will yield back my time.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I reserved the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Then I will not yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I appreciate what my distinguished \ncolleague from Iowa is trying to do--bring more money to his State. The \nquestion is whether it is fundamentally fair. The answer is no.\n  Let me tell you the States that will get hit pretty badly here: \nCalifornia, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, \nMassachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, \nRhode Island, Virginia, and Washington, to name a few.\n  The fundamental question is whether we are going to live to this \ncredo of whether targeted is important or whether timely is important. \nWell, we have the Government Accountability Office saying that the way \nwe are doing it--the way that would be undone by the Senator from Iowa \nwould undo the targeted; it would undo the ability to have the greatest \nimpact to be stimulative. In essence, it would hurt States that have \nthe greatest need. We are one country. I often have voted for issues \nthat have very little benefit for my State, but I understand that at a \ngiven moment in time, they are in the greatest interest of the country. \nAgriculture is one example, and there are others. The bottom line is \nthat we have rising numbers of people, higher unemployment rates, more \ndemand on Medicaid, and less opportunity for individuals to be able to \nget the resources in States that are already cash strapped. I have \nlistened to moral hazard. There has been no talk about that. We want to \nteach the States a lesson now. There was no talk about moral hazard \nwhen the regulators were asleep at the switch and Wall Street was \ngetting billions. You want to teach States a lesson now? You are going \nto hurt people. This amendment will hurt people who otherwise would \nhave resources under the bill that have already been adjusted to give \nStates such as my colleagues' more research.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, GAO's argument about targeting applies \nto decreases in Medicaid due to the recession. This isn't about \ntargeting. This is seven times more than is needed for Medicaid. I will \nagree to targeting for that $10.8 billion. The rest should be more \nfairly targeted.\n  This amendment should be a simple vote. The complex funding formula \nfor spending the $87 billion in Medicare in this bill is not fair. It \nshould be a flat increase to all States.\n  That is what my amendment does. Thirty-four States do better with the \nformula under my amendment. So you can vote to give your State its fair \nshare or, if you vote against it, you are voting not to give them that \nfair share.\n  I yield the floor. As long as the other side's time is used up, I \nyield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in the spirit of agreement, there will now \nbe an amendment on the Democratic side. I suggest Senator Cantwell be \nrecognized for the purpose of calling up her amendment. I ask the \nSenator to agree to a time agreement of 10 minutes equally divided. I \nthink it is going to be accepted.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Five minutes equally.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Ten minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 274, as Modified, to Amendment No. 98\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I call up amendment No. 274, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senator Hatch and \nSenator Bingaman, for helping us work on this modified language--\nSenator Bingaman, particularly--related to plug-in vehicles. I thank my \ncolleagues who have worked on additional amendments as part of this \nqualification of the ITC manufacturing credit; conservation bonds in \nthe underlying bill that I know my colleague, Senator Feingold, has \nworked on; Senators Bingaman and Carper on a technical fix to carbon \nsequestration; I know the Senators in the Northeast and the Northwest \nhave worked on provisions of existing modifications to the wood stove \namendment we helped in the 2007 bill; and my colleagues, Senators \nSnowe, Feinstein, Bingaman, and Kerry on updates for the enhancement \neffectiveness of home energy efficiency in the Tax Code.\n  I think all of these things make for a very important amendment for \nthe stimulus package because it is about immediate stimulus and it is \nabout job creation, both in the near term and the opportunity for \ntremendous job creation in the long term.\n  The underlying amendment deals with the issue of creating and \nexpensing for those who invest in plug-in battery technology or \ncomponents. The United States currently is the leader in research and \ndevelopment of battery technology. Unfortunately, the number of \nmanufacturing facilities in the United States that take advantage of \nthat R is zero--zero opportunities currently in manufacturing in the \nUnited States.\n  What we know around the globe is that countries, such as China, have \nover 250,000 people working on battery technology and over 150 \npartners. We know Europeans and others are quick to work on this \ntechnology. Why? Because many people believe we are going to make this \ntransformation off fossil fuel and on to cars powered by our \nelectricity grid. So we know we are moving in that direction, but we \nare not doing anything to provide incentives so that manufacturing can \ntake place in the United States.\n  I am not talking necessarily about domestic manufacturers. I am not \nsaying we are not talking about them. We are talking about making \nsure--whether it is Toyota, whether it is Tesla Motors, or someone not \neven on the horizon today, or what is happening in Detroit--that the \nUnited States does not continue to import their battery technology but \nstarts manufacturing in the United States.\n  This is a great opportunity for us in manufacturing to complement the \nITC manufacturing credit that went to\n\n[[Page S1826]]\n\nother renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, to bring some \nof that manufacturing into the United States. I think that provision is \ntremendously important, but I say to my colleagues on the Senate floor, \nI cannot think of a bigger opportunity for job creation in the future \nthan helping to make this transition off fossil fuel and on to the \ngrid. If we fail to make this step now, we will be as dependent on \nforeign battery technology as we are on Mideast fossil fuel today. We \ndon't want to make that mistake.\n  We know in the small business provisions of this bill, we are giving \nexpensing opportunities so that with the depreciation rate takedown, \npeople will make more investments now. That is the same thing we are \ndoing here, making investments in plug-in technology to stimulate job \ncreation around this technology and help us with millions of long-term \njobs and an opportunity to get off fossil fuel and deliver for our \nconstituents a cheaper source of transportation in the future.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I support the Cantwell amendment. Frankly, \nin the regular order, somebody who opposes the Cantwell amendment \nshould be speaking. I will take a little of her time. It is a good \namendment, and I hope it gets adopted. I don't think anybody wants to \nspeak in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask the manager if I might have 2 \nminutes. Just 2 minutes. I would like to respond.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Fine.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, from what we understand so far, one part \nof this bill is $9 billion. It scores at $9 billion. We have a strong \ncommitment to hybrid automobiles. I have supported that in the past. We \nare dealing with that issue in the Energy Committee. As I understand \nit, this is spending in addition to what is already in the bill. I \nthink that is going to cause concerns.\n  I ask my colleagues to be cautious about signing on to a bill that \nhas not gone through committee and represents such a huge expenditure \nof money that is unpaid.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Does the Senator from Washington have time remaining?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, in response to my colleague, the notion \nof plug-in technology was discussed in the Finance Committee. We \ndecided to offer this amendment on the floor instead. We know the \neconomic opportunity we are going to lose by not making this investment \nis great.\n  What is so unique about this is that it is stimulative now, it is job \ncreation, and it, as the President says, puts us in a position in a key \ntechnology area in which we know the United States wants to be \ncompetitive. I believe it is a very winning proposition for the \nstimulus bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, briefly, I appreciate Senator Cantwell. \nI know she is one of the leaders in the effort to reduce our dependence \non foreign oil and reduce emissions. But I will note, the amount of \nmoney going into hybrids reaches a point where we have to be careful.\n  Diesel engines get about 40 percent more mileage than regular \ngasoline engines. Europeans have half their vehicles in diesel. We have \nabout 3 percent. We have to be careful when we have this kind of \nincentive that it is going at the best possible thing.\n  I am not prepared to say this is not the best way to do it, for sure. \nI believe the Energy Committee and maybe EPW ought to be able to have \nhearings on this before we make such a dramatic change.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I urge the Chair to recognize Senator \nBunning to call up his amendment.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I would like 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Ten minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Ten minutes for Senator Bunning.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Ten minutes to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. The Senator can give whatever time he chooses to the \nother side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 531 to Amendment No. 98\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 531.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Bunning] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 531 to amendment No. 98.\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To temporarily increase the limitations on offsetting \nordinary income with capital losses and to strike the 5-year carryback \n                      of general business credits)\n\n       On page 464, strike lines 2 and 23, and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 1141. TEMPORARY INCREASE IN PERSONAL CAPITAL LOSS \n                   DEDUCTION LIMITATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1211 is amended by adding at the \n     end the following new subsection:\n       ``(c) Special Rule for Taxable Years Beginning in 2009.--In \n     the case of a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2008, \n     and before January 1, 2010, subsection (b)(1) shall be \n     applied--\n       ``(1) by substituting `$15,000' for `$3,000', and\n       ``(2) by substituting `$7,500' for `$1,500'.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2008.\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, our economy is ailing--everybody knows \nthat--and the symptoms are a sharp drop in consumer spending and a \nlarge rise in unemployment. As many of my colleagues have already \nobserved, this bill treats the symptoms only and it does it so \nineffectively.\n  There are some Democrats, even in the White House, who agree with \nthis. Just the other day, one House Democrat said his leadership ``does \nnot care'' what is in the bill; ``they just want to pass it and they \nwant it to be unanimous.'' They don't care. That is just shameful.\n  The unemployment statistics we are seeing are just staggering. Never \nin our history have we seen job cuts at the rate and severity we are \nseeing today: over 500,000 losses per month for the last 5 months. Over \n600,000 in losses were reported just last Tuesday.\n  This bill really does very little to help businesses keep people \nemployed. It gives the poorest Americans $500 in cash and the prospect \nof a government job on a construction site, but it does not get to the \nheart of the problem in the private sector.\n  It is our responsibility on behalf of every child who will pay for \nthis massive amount of spending in this bill to get the solution right, \nand we can do better, much better.\n  One of the best economists in this country--one who predicted this \ncrisis in advance--said recently that he believes most U.S. banks are \ninsolvent. Their equity has been wiped out due to the massive leveraged \nbets related to housing. Unfortunately, bank regulators, such as Tim \nGeithner, Ben Bernanke, and Alan Greenspan, failed to properly assess \nthe danger to the economy presented by these irresponsible bets.\n  Many experts are now acknowledging what I have said for years: that \ncurrency manipulation by China and other countries fueled the credit \nbubble in the United States and Europe that drove up housing prices to \nunsustainable levels.\n  As a direct result, many households are now insolvent as well. They \nare carrying mortgage debts that exceed the value of their homes, and \neven with the $500 from the make work pay credit, they will not go out \nand spend it until the problem is addressed.\n  This amendment I am offering today will address a major injustice in \nthe Tax Code that many taxpayers will encounter for the first time this \nyear. This problem will drive the effective tax rates of many taxpayers \nto European confiscatory levels at the worst possible time. I am \nreferring to the limit on capital losses.\n  Since the peak of the markets in 2007, investors have lost $7.5 \ntrillion in wealth. More than half of this amount is in taxable \naccounts. If we do not adjust the limits, taxpayers will be unable to \ndeduct real economic losses\n\n[[Page S1827]]\n\nfrom their income tax, and this will result in higher effective tax \nrates.\n  Two respected economists have recommended my amendment as a way to \nstimulate the economy. In an article in the Wall Street Journal titled \n``Let's Stimulate Private Risk Taking,'' economists from Harvard \nUniversity and the University of Chicago wrote that my amendment would \nstimulate risk taking by rewarding the downside of new investments and \nincreasing the upside.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 21, 2009]\n\n                  Let's Stimulate Private Risk Taking\n\n                (By Alberto Alesina and Luigi Zingales)\n\n       In virtually all economics classes, including those taught \n     by the many excellent economists on the Obama team, the idea \n     of government spending as an engine for growth is not a \n     popular topic. Yet despite their skepticism of Keynesianism \n     in the classroom, when it comes to public policy, these \n     economists happily endorse a large stimulus package that \n     could bring our deficit to 10% of GDP. Why?\n       One explanation is that these economists think this \n     recession is an extraordinary one. In normal recessions--the \n     argument goes--an increase in discretionary government \n     spending is unnecessary and even counterproductive. But in \n     the event that a recession becomes a depression, a Keynesian \n     stimulus package might work.\n       There are certainly economic models that show how \n     government spending can shift the economy from a bad \n     equilibrium (where people do not search for jobs because they \n     do not expect to find them, and firms do not invest because \n     they do not expect to sell), to a good equilibrium (where \n     people search for jobs, and firms invest and generate demand \n     for their goods).\n       But this particular recession is unique not in its \n     dimensions, but in its sources. First, it is the result of a \n     financial crisis that severely affected stock-market \n     valuations. The bad equilibrium did not originate in the \n     labor market, but in the credit market, where investors are \n     reluctant to lend to risky firms. This reluctance is making \n     it difficult for these firms to refinance their debt, forcing \n     them to default on their credit, further validating \n     investors' fear. Thus, the problem is how to increase \n     investors' willingness to take risk. It's unclear how the \n     proposed stimulus package would help inspire investors to do \n     so.\n       The second reason this recession is unusual is that it was \n     caused in large part by a significant current-account \n     imbalance due to the low savings rate of Americans (families \n     and government). Even assuming that more public spending \n     would increase private consumption--a big if--such a measure \n     would cause even more imbalance.\n       So how do we stimulate the economy without increasing the \n     already large current-account deficit? It's not easy, but \n     here is an idea: Create the incentive for people to take more \n     risk and move their savings from government bonds to risky \n     assets. There is no better way to encourage this than a \n     temporary elimination of the capital-gains tax for all the \n     investments begun during 2009 and held for at least two \n     years.\n       If we fear this is not enough, we can temporarily increase \n     the size of the capital loss that is deductible against \n     ordinary income. This will reduce the downside of new \n     investments and increase the upside.\n       More savings need to be invested, and firms need an \n     incentive to invest in order to help aggregate demand in the \n     short term and promote long-term growth. The best way to do \n     this is to make all capital expenditures and research and \n     development investments done in 2009 fully tax deductible in \n     the current fiscal year.\n       A large temporary tax incentive may be just enough to jolt \n     investors from their current paralysis to take action. Such a \n     switch will also be fueled by the temporary capital-gains tax \n     cut mentioned above, which will motivate people to move their \n     savings from money-market funds to stocks, increasing \n     valuations, investments and confidence.\n       Many are concerned about what we can do to help the poor \n     weather this crisis. Unlike during the Great Depression, we \n     have an unemployment subsidy that protects the poor from the \n     most severe consequences of this recession. If we want to \n     further protect them, it is better to extend this \n     unemployment subsidy than to invest in hasty public projects. \n     Furthermore, tax cuts have a much better effect on job \n     creation than highway rehabilitation.\n       No doubt, it is much easier to sell the public and Congress \n     a plan for more public works than tax cuts, particularly \n     while Main Street despises Wall Street--with some good \n     reason. But the role of a good economic team is to \n     courageously propose the right economic policy, even when it \n     is unpopular. The role of a president is to sell it \n     politically, as real change we can believe in.\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, since 2007, investors have lost $1.7 \ntrillion in stock market values. Nearly half these losses are taxable \naccounts and their owners are subject to a $3,000 limit on capital \nlosses.\n  The way this limit works is that no matter how much money you lose in \nstocks or real estate, you are only allowed to deduct $3,000 per year \nagainst other income. The remaining loss is ignored.\n  Given the state of the markets, millions of taxpayers have stock \nlosses that far exceed $3,000. Nevertheless, the Tax Code will treat \nthese people as though they earned much more during the year.\n  For an example, a family that earns $100,000 and pays $30,000 in \nFederal and State taxes has a tax rate of 30 percent. If the family \nloses $40,000 in savings and it is only able to deduct $3,000, it will \npush the family's effective tax rate up to 48.5 percent.\n  The $3,000 fixed limit on capital losses was last adjusted in 1976. \nBefore the midseventies, the tax writers in Congress were not as \nknowledgeable about what inflation can do to savings as we are \ntoday. It was common for Congress to write dollar limits into the Tax \nCode without any thought of what inflation would do to its value in \nfuture years. Since 1977, inflation has eroded the value of the limit \nby more than 71 percent. My amendment would adjust the limit for \ninflation, increasing it to $15,000 for any losses incurred this year.\n\n  When I offered this amendment in the Finance Committee, Chairman \nBaucus committed to addressing the problem on a permanent basis \nsometime this year. I welcome this opportunity to work with him on this \nlong-term overdue problem.\n  My amendment also reduces the cost of the bill by about $4.9 billion \nbecause I am also striking a remarkable provision that for the first \ntime would allow corporations to use tax credits even if they have no \nincome. This is nothing more than corporate welfare and Soviet-style \nindustrial policy. Never before has this body endorsed a refundable tax \ncredit for corporations. This one costs a staggering $10.9 billion. It \nis bad policy and the money should be spent on broad-based individual \ntax relief that will stimulate our economy.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment to ensure that \ntaxpayers do not experience an increase in tax rate in the depth of \nthis recession we are now in.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky has an \ninteresting idea, an interesting proposition, and we did discuss it in \ncommittee. I did say in the committee that I think it is an issue that \nshould appropriately be addressed, and I again thank the Senator for \nbringing up this issue.\n  I suggest that we now go to Senator Feingold for the purposes of \noffering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Wisconsin is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 485 to Amendment No. 98\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside so that I may call up amendment No. 485.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 485 to amendment No. 98.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To clarify that certain programs constitute a qualified \n     conservation purpose for qualified energy conservation bonds)\n\n       On page 457, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n       (b) Clarification With Respect to Green Community \n     Programs.--Clause (ii) of section 54D(f)(1)(A) is amended by \n     inserting ``(including the use of loans, grants, or other \n     repayment mechanisms to implement such programs)'' after \n     ``green community programs''.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nStabenow as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment is based on my Community \nRevitalization Energy Conservation\n\n[[Page S1828]]\n\nAct, S. 222, and I am very pleased to be joined by the Senator from \nMichigan in offering it.\n  This amendment will address our energy and economic challenges while \nputting Americans to work. Supporting energy efficiency improvements to \nAmerica's homes and businesses is one of the smartest ways we can face \nthese challenges to create jobs and reduce our energy consumption.\n  The goal of this amendment is to decrease energy consumption, create \ngreen jobs, and increase the number of energy efficient projects by \nreducing the significant cost barriers, such as the prohibitive upfront \ncosts to homeowners and businesses who want to make improvements to \ntheir homes and buildings.\n  Aggressively pursuing energy efficiency will help put us on a path \ntoward energy security. Presently, buildings account for 40 percent of \ntotal U.S. energy consumption and 70 percent of U.S. electricity \nconsumption. In order for us to decrease our reliance on fossil-based \nfuels, this has to change. We can achieve 20 to 30 percent energy \nreduction through better insulation, lighting, and HVAC equipment and \ncontrols. Potentially, we have the opportunity to save over $200 \nbillion through building efficiency alone.\n  The economic recovery package increases the bond limit for the \nQualified Energy Conservation Bond Program, which supports conservation \nupgrades to buildings. It does that by taking that number from $800 \nmillion to $3.2 billion. I support this provision, and the Feingold-\nStabenow amendment builds on it by modifying the Qualified Energy \nConservation Bond Program to include conservation in private buildings \nusing a financing mechanism that would eliminate the prohibitive \nupfront costs of energy efficiency improvements between homeowners and \nbusinesses.\n  Meanwhile, the amendment would allow State and local governments to \npromote energy efficiency products by use of electric and water \nutilities as intermediaries. By using utilities as intermediaries, \nhomeowners and businesses incur no upfront costs and they can then \ngradually pay back the cost of the energy efficiency retrofits through \ntheir electricity or water bills at a rate that does not exceed what \nthey have historically paid.\n  For example, if a monthly water bill before improvements is $150, and \nwith the improvement the energy costs are down to $110, at most a \nhomeowner or business would pay $40 more monthly toward paying off the \ncost of the energy efficiency building retrofits which were made \npossible by this program.\n  This has worked. Already several States and cities, including Hawaii, \nMichigan, Berkeley, CA, and Babylon, NY, are beginning to tackle the \nissue of energy efficiency in residential buildings. In my home State \nof Wisconsin, efforts are already underway in Milwaukee to use this \nnovel financing mechanism to promote energy efficiency. In partnership \nwith the Center on Wisconsin Strategy, the city is pursuing Me2, or the \nMilwaukee Energy Efficiency Program. Initial estimates from the Center \non Wisconsin Strategy suggest that if you could retrofit nearly all of \nthe existing housing stock in Milwaukee, an initial investment of just \nunder $250 million, it could result in annual energy savings of over \n$80 million.\n  All of these efforts to conserve energy require investments in time \nand money. By combining efforts on two of our greatest challenges, \nenergy and employment, we can create a great opportunity. Energy \nefficiency and conservation are, of course, in our national interest \nfor our long-term economic well-being, for the health and safety of our \ncitizens and the world as we mitigate the effects of climate change, \nand for our independence and security as well.\n  This amendment is endorsed by many key groups, including the Apollo \nAlliance, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, Air \nConditioning Contractors of America, National Electrical Contractors \nAssociation, and the Plumbing-Heating-Cooling Contractors National \nAssociation.\n  I thank the Senator from Montana, Senator Baucus, for working with me \non this amendment and for his support on the amendment. I urge my all \nof my colleagues to support it. It will support green jobs and help get \nour economy on the right track.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest that Senator Thune be recognized \nfor the purpose of offering his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 538 to Amendment No. 98\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana, the \nmanager of this bill, for yielding and for the opportunity to offer \nthis amendment.\n  As I have indicated, I will start by saying I am very uncomfortable \nwith the notion of spending almost $1 trillion--over $1 trillion if you \ninclude interest--on this undertaking when, in my view, it is not \ntimely, temporary, and targeted--as has been suggested should be the \ncriteria for this legislation--but, rather, it is slow, unfocused, and \nunending. As a consequence of that, as I said, I am very concerned \nabout the size of this and I am very concerned about the substance of \nit.\n  I don't believe we ought to spend this amount. I have supported \namendments, including Senator McCain's amendment, that were \nsignificantly smaller in terms of the size, much more, in my judgment, \nfiscally responsible, much more targeted and focused on job creation, \nand doing the types of things I believe will help get the economy \ngrowing again. Unfortunately, those amendments--those amendments I have \nsupported, and I have even offered a substitute of my own--have all \nfailed.\n  I say that to preface my comments as I offer this amendment, to make \nthe point that I am not in favor of or supportive of this size of \nspending and this size of borrowing from future generations in order to \naccomplish what, in my judgment, are very questionable job creation \ngoals--frankly, I think based on the CBO study we saw yesterday, very \nquestionable goals in terms of what this might achieve.\n  I have concluded, however, that with all the amendments that have \nbeen offered, many of which are amendments that in my view would reduce \nsome of the wasteful spending in this bill, some of which would refocus \nit more toward tax relief, more toward infrastructure, and more toward \nhousing--things I think are important in this debate--I have concluded \nthat the way to perhaps shape this is to offer an amendment that, \nfrankly, will clarify what the difference is in this debate. Because I \nthink it all comes down to who spends this money: does Washington spend \nit or do the American people spend these dollars that are going to come \nin?\n  If we are going to commit to spending $936 billion, what my amendment \nessentially would do is to say that the $936 billion ought to be \ndivided evenly among people who file income tax returns in this \ncountry. There are 182 million filers, all of whom would have a \nsignificant tax cut if you took a $936 billion pricetag and divided it \nup among those 182 million filers.\n  My amendment I think also illustrates the simplicity of this debate, \nbecause this is nine pages long. This amendment is nine pages long. The \nunderlying bill is 735 pages long. It takes 735 pages, I would argue, \nto go through all the various types of spending programs that are \ncreated in this bill, many of which are new programs that are going to \ncreate liabilities and obligations for the taxpayers well beyond the \nso-called targeted period in which this assistance is designed to take \neffect. But my nine-page amendment basically spells out a clearer \noption that I think we ought to rally around.\n\n  Again, as I said before, it is very straightforward. If you are a \ntaxpaying person in this country, if you are someone who files an \nincome tax return--and there are 182 million filers in America--and you \nmake less than $250,000--if you have $250,000 or less in terms of \nadjusted gross income--then you would be eligible for, if you are a \nsingle filer, $5,143 in terms of a tax cut or tax rebate in 2009. This \nwould all spend out in 2009. If you are a married couple filing a joint \nreturn, you would get a tax cut totaling $10,286 in 2009.\n  One of the Democrat arguments for the $1 trillion stimulus is they \nbelieve the GDP will shrink by that amount in the near future, \nprimarily because of a decrease in consumer spending, which accounts \nfor approximately 70 percent\n\n[[Page S1829]]\n\nof gross domestic product. This amendment would inject $936 billion \ninto the economy by the end of 2009 in the form of a recovery rebate \nfor middle-class tax filers. These tax cuts total approximately 6 to 7 \npercent of our gross domestic product.\n  Consumers and taxpayers, not government bureaucrats, would determine \nhow to spend this money. Consumers could decide to make a downpayment \non a new home, purchase a new car, get ahead of day-to-day bills, or \nsave and invest for the future. I suggest this is a far more efficient \nway of stimulating the economy relative to improving fish barriers or \ndesigning polar ice breakers or purchasing supercomputers for climate \nresearch.\n  One of the primary arguments my colleagues on the other side, I am \nsure, will make against this amendment is that most consumers decided \nto save their tax rebates in 2008 rather than spend the checks they \nreceived in the amount of $600 for a single filer and $1,200 for \nmarried filing jointly. Well, first, this economic recovery rebate is \nmuch larger, which increases the likelihood of a positive impact on \nconsumer spending.\n  Second, with the advent of the financial crisis, we are at a very \ndifferent situation relative to January 2008. Even if individuals \nchoose to save half of this tax cut, that would mean a $450 billion \ninfusion of capital into our banking system, which would also help \nstabilize our financial institutions, and that is a critical part of \nour economic recovery.\n  I believe the American people are tired of business as usual in \nWashington. I think the stimulus package we have before us is a perfect \nexample of how Washington works. It is loaded with a lot of spending, \nin many cases, as I said before, spending on new programs and a lot of \nspecial interest spending. I hope my colleagues will listen to the \nAmerican people, who I think are following this debate and are, \nfrankly, outraged with the size of the stimulus plan and the notion \nthat it is going to be spent on many of the things they find \nobjectionable. I argue that the American people should be given the \nchoice between a 9-page, very simple and straightforward approach to \nthis, which puts money back in their pockets--in fact, a lot of money; \n$5,143 if you are a single filer and $10,286 if you are a married \ncouple filing jointly--or a 735-page bill which includes spending for \nall kinds of things that in my view are not going to be successful when \nit comes to creating jobs or helping get this economy back on track.\n  That is the amendment. It is very straightforward. It is very simple. \nIt takes $936 billion and divides it by 182 million tax filers. If they \nmake under $250,000 year it gives them a tax rebate in the amount of \n$5,143 for a single filer, $10,286 for a married filer filing jointly, \nmarried couple filing jointly.\n  I yield the floor. I ask my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Has the Senator offered the amendment?\n  Mr. THUNE. Let me say, if I have not already, I ask it be pending. It \nwas filed at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am reminded of the great Baltimore Sun \njournalist H.L. Menken who said for every complicated problem there is \na simple solution--and it is usually wrong.\n  We have a complicated problem: how to get our country going again. \nWith all due respect, this is a very simple solution and, with all due \nrespect, it has deep problems.\n  What are they? First of all, there are 49 million Americans who will \nnot get any tax break from this proposal. Who are they? They are the \nAmericans who are working, but they do not earn enough income to pay \nincome taxes. Therefore, they get no deduction. They are not paying \ntaxes. They are not in the 5-percent bracket. They are not in the 10-\npercent bracket. They just do not earn enough to pay income taxes. So \nwhen you talk about reducing taxes, giving rebates to those Americans \nwho pay taxes, those 49 million Americans who are working, who pay \npayroll taxes, will get no break. Their taxes are not reduced.\n  I say that because the amendment strikes the whole bill. As I \nunderstand the amendment, it takes the amount of the bill and adds it \nback to taxpayers. The rebate goes to the taxpayers?\n  Mr. THUNE. Will the Senator yield for a clarification?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am happy to.\n  Mr. THUNE. I appreciate the question because I think that is one of \nthe arguments that have been made against a lot of the tax amendments \nwe have filed. This was drafted in a way so it is refundable, so all \nthe Americans that you are talking about would also receive that \nbenefit.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I might say, Mr. President, reclaiming my time, this \namendment strikes the underlying bill. What about States taking people \noff Medicaid, called FMAP? This bill gives about $86 billion to States \nso they can keep people on Medicaid, so they are not thrown off \nMedicaid. What about all the dollars in here that go to help build \nroads and highways and bridges?\n  Earlier, I asked my colleagues to remember two figures. What were \nthey again--99 and 79. What is that? Just to repeat, 99 is the percent \nof dollars in the Finance Committee portion of this bill that are spent \nin the first 2 years; 99 percent of the whole Finance Committee bill is \nspent in the first 2 years. That is CBO, and it is Joint Tax. It is \ntheir figures. Just do the math.\n  The other figure I mentioned was 79--79 percent. What does 79 percent \nrepresent? All of the dollars in the whole bill, the Finance Committee \nbill and the Appropriations bill, total it all up--99 percent of the \ntotal bill will be spent in the first 2 years; 99 percent of the \nFinance Committee bill, 79 percent of the whole bill.\n  Next question: how efficiently are those dollars spent? I have just \nestablished that most of the dollars, by far, are going to be spent in \nthe first 2 years--by far. The next question: How efficiently? To what \ndegree will those dollars create jobs? A day or two ago the \nCongressional Budget Office released a letter that discusses the \neffects of this bill on jobs, on job creation. The letter says:\n\n       For all of the categories that would be affected by the \n     Senate legislation, the resulting budgetary changes are \n     estimated to raise output [and jobs] . . . albeit by \n     different amounts . . . [as follows.]\n\n  What does that say? Without taking too much time, it makes it very \nclear more jobs are created when we spend dollars for the purchase of \ngoods and services. According to CBO--that is a quote:\n\n       Direct purchases of goods and services . . . tend to have \n     large effects on GDP.\n\n  What tends to have less of an effect? I know it is a mantra, I know \nit is ideology, but the fact is, what has less effect, to be honest \nabout it, is tax cuts. And the higher the income bracket, according to \nCBO, the less stimulative effect on the economy.\n  For example, let's take AMT: 1-year tax cuts for people who pay the \nalternative minimum tax. What is the stimulative effect? There is a \nrange. CBO does not know the exact amount, but it is a range between 10 \ncents on the dollar and 50 cents on the dollar. That is how much goes \nout into the economy. Not very much.\n  What is the range for purchase of goods and services by Uncle Sam, \nbetween $1 and $2.50; for transfers to State and local governments for \ninfrastructure, between $1 and $2.50; for transfers to State and local \ngovernments not for infrastructure, between 70 cents to $1.90 on the \ndollar.\n  Get this: unemployment benefits, between 80 cents on the dollar and \n$2.20 on the dollar. Payments to persons for unemployment benefits has \na much greater stimulative effect, by far, than does reduction in \ntaxes. I mentioned already the effect of AMT.\n  My only point, it is interesting to hear what the Senator from South \nDakota is saying, and I appreciate him correcting me by saying that 49 \nmillion Americans who otherwise do not pay income tax would also get a \nrebate. I am not sure the size of the rebate. I guess everybody gets \nthe same amount, whether you are an individual or you are married. But \nwe can create a lot more jobs by structuring the payment as it is in \nthis legislation.\n  A lot of time and thought has gone into it. Virtually every--I will \nnot say every. The bulk of economists, mainstream economists, will say \nclearly that the job creation effect is much greater with \ninfrastructure than it is for tax cuts. You like to have tax cuts. \nPeople like to have dollars in their pockets. But the goal is \ninfrastructure. It is job creation. Spend it early. I might add, I \ndon't know the exact percentage, but a large portion of this bill is \nalready tax cuts. It is large. I think it is 40 percent--40 percent of \nthis bill is tax cuts. I don't think all the bill should be tax cuts. \nRather, it should be spread out in a little more complicated way, \nfollowing the advice of the Baltimore Sun journalist, H.L. Menken.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask the manager, do we have a time \nagreement on this amendment?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. There is no time agreement, I say to my friend.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could the parties agree to a time agreement?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I think we are finished on this one unless the Senator \nfrom South Dakota wants to make some remarks.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield, Mr. President.\n  Mr. THUNE. Just a couple of points, if I might. I appreciate the \nobservations of the Senator from Montana regarding the amendment, but I \ndo want\n\n[[Page S1831]]\n\nto make a couple of corrections. One, of course, is we did apply this \nin a way that it is refundable so everyone benefits from it. It is \ndelivered in a very straightforward way. It doesn't matter where you \nare on the income scale, as long as you make under $250,000 a year. I \nmight add, as well, people who make above that amount, I agree, \nprobably are less likely to spend than are those who make under that \namount. But this was capped. Eligibility for this refund is based upon \nhow much you make. Your adjusted gross income has to be less than \n$250,000 a year. So it is not skewed toward the rich. It does skew \ntoward those who are more likely to spend these dollars and put them \nback into the economy.\n  I still believe when you start talking about over $5,000 for a single \nperson, over $10,000 for a couple, that is real money to most families, \nand I suggest a lot of that money is going to be spent. Granted, there \nwill be some who will put it away and save it. As I said before, I \ndon't think that is necessarily a bad thing. We ought to encourage \nsaving, and furthermore it will help get liquidity in the banking \nsystem. If they put half into the banks, that is $450 billion that will \ngo into the banking system of our country.\n  Just with respect to the multiplier effect--there are lots of \ndifferent analyses that have been done, spending versus tax relief. I \ndraw, of course, on history. If you look back, in the 1960s under \nKennedy, 1980s under Reagan, more recently under President Bush, the \nimpact when you reduce the marginal income tax rate, when you reduce \nthe taxes on investment and job creation, in most cases you get more \nrevenue and not less, and you also get a better return in terms of jobs \ncreated. In fact, the President's own economist, Dr. Christina Romer, \nback in March of 2007 did a study that suggested for each dollar of tax \ncut, you get a 2.2 multiplier effect. In other words, for each percent \nof GDP that you reduce taxes, you get 2.2 times that in terms of \neconomic growth.\n\n  So I simply say, again, when you are allowing American families to \nkeep more of what they earn, and particularly when you start talking \nabout the amounts that we are discussing here, and when you cap it at \n$250,000 for eligibility so it is not a tax cut for the high end, for \nthe rich--it is for people who are actually more likely to need it, to \nbe able to do all the things they have to do to keep their families \ngoing on a daily basis--and you also write it in such a way so that it \nis refundable so income-tax payers on the lower end of the income scale \nare also eligible for it, as the Senator from Montana noted, and it is \ntrue--it is a very simple approach if you are going to do this--\nsometimes I think the simple approach is the best approach.\n  Arguably, 9 pages versus 735 is in the underlying bill. It is a small \namount of ink and print by this city's standards. But it is a very \nstraightforward approach which I think the American people will \nunderstand and appreciate because they are going to receive this, \nrather than having this money, all this money we are going to be \nborrowing from future generations, going into spending programs from \nwhich they may not derive any benefit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is time to go to the next Senator. I \nmight say, the language of the amendment offered by the Senator from \nSouth Dakota, the language says an eligible individual is one who has \nfiled a tax return. Many people who work don't file tax returns because \nthey don't make enough money, so a lot of people are getting left off.\n  Next, I suggest the Chair recognize Senator Dodd from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 501\n\n  Mr. DODD. I see my good friend from Arizona and my friend from \nOregon. They have been patient. We debated my amendment already so I am \njust going to be very brief.\n  Senators Conrad and Graham and I were discussing the Conrad-Graham \namendment. I talked about the alternative idea that I am proposing with \nSenator Martinez and Senator Reid of Nevada, and that is to acquire in \nthis bill--I realize it doesn't relate to the funding in this bill--it \nwould require that $50 billion of TARP money that will now be allocated \nbe dedicated to foreclosure mitigation, including looking at the Sheila \nBaird FDIC proposal, but not exclusively so. Also, as a second part of \nthat amendment, I suggest some alterations to the Hope For Homeowners \nProgram that we think would make the program far more effective than it \nhas been.\n  Despite the good intentions of its authors last summer, myself \nincluded, it has not produced anywhere near the results we desired. \nThese were suggested by Treasury and others who thought it would help \nmake it more attractive to those in foreclosure.\n  At the appropriate time, myself and Senators Martinez and Reid will \noffer this amendment. Again, I say to my good friend Senator Conrad and \ngood friend Lindsey Graham, I respect the effort they are making. I \ndon't think what they are talking about in the stimulus bill is \njustified when we can do it out of TARP, and the money that is being \nsuggested should be more focused on stimulation and job creation.\n  For those reasons, I oppose the Conrad amendment. I remind my \ncolleagues this amendment that Senator Martinez and I will be offering \nis the right approach for us to be taking regarding TARP funding, which \nwas dedicated initially, at least in part, toward foreclosure \nmitigation. We are going to require it statutorily, lest there be any \ndoubt in the minds of those managing the program what our congressional \nintention was when we passed it back late in October.\n  Mr. President, with that, I apologize for taking any time at all and \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I don't see Senator Enzi. He was next entitled to offer \nhis amendment, so I urge the Chair to recognize Senator Wyden to offer \nan amendment.\n  Senator Enzi is on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask, again, is there a time agreement \nthat would be reasonable?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask Senator Enzi if he is agreeable to, say, a 5-minute \nlimitation on his amendment.\n  Mr. ENZI. I have no problem with 5 minutes. I do not think there is \nanyone in opposition. I will try and keep it under 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 293, as Modified, to Amendment No. 98\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I call up amendment number 293, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This is an extremely important bill for the section that \ndeals with Health IT. Senator Kennedy and I have been working on that \nfor 3 years as well as many others in this Chamber. If we are going to \nhave health care in this country that improves, we are going to have to \nhave Health IT, and I think everybody realizes that.\n  We have tried to come up with a mechanism for getting \ninteroperability. We have had good success on that without being able \nto get the bill passed that we have been working on for 3 years.\n  But there is a provision that moves Health IT along in this bill, but \nit needed some modifications so it actually would work. I am ever so \npleased people on both sides of the aisle, particularly Senators \nBaucus, Kennedy, and Grassley, have helped and worked on this. The \nreason there had to be a modification was a little while ago we were \nable to clear up one more difficulty in that bill.\n  Without this, it will not work well. There are still other things \nthat ought to be done with it. There are still other things I would \nlike to have with Health IT. There are some things in there that I \nwould not like to have. But this is the part we were able to get \nagreement on in order to make it work a lot better.\n  The Certification Commission for Health IT, or CCHIT, has done a lot \nof great work to accelerate the adoption of health IT by creating a \ncredible, efficient certification process. Many companies have already \nbegun voluntarily participating in the certification process. This \nsystem is working and is putting us on the right path to \ninteroperability. Unfortunately, CCHIT is concerned certain details of \nthe underlying bill will cause an ``unintended slowdown in the adoption \nof health IT''. This amendment allows CCHIT to continue their current \nmission without changing their priorities. CCHIT sent me a letter \nstating ``the amended language makes the path forward much clearer, and \nwill build on current health IT momentum rather than disrupting it''.\n  This amendment puts the standards section back on the right track by \nbuilding upon the progress of Secretary Leavitt and the Bush \nadministration. Secretary Leavitt worked tirelessly to create the \nAmerican Health Information Community, AHIC, a public-private \npartnership designed to ensure the Government and the private sector \ncould work together on interoperability standards. Under Secretary \nLeavitt's leadership, the AHIC recently transitioned into the National \neHealth Collaborative, a voluntary consensus standards body.\n  I strongly support the collaborative and I want to ensure it is able \nto continue. The bill before the Senate, however, threatens to ``take'' \nthe assets of the collaborative and nationalize the collaborative. My \namendment prevents that from happening. I have been working with the \nleaders of the collaborative and they ``strongly support my proposed \namendment''.\n  The amendment will also ensure that Federal investments in IT comply \nwith technology standards harmonized by the Healthcare Information \nTechnology Standards Panel and certified by the Certification \nCommission for Health IT, and at a minimum this bill should accelerate \nthe work of those two entities rather than delay it.\n  My amendment also makes other changes that were included in the \nbipartisan ``Wired for Health Care Quality Act'' that were left out of \nthe bill before us today. Those changes include making sure the \nmembership of the Health IT Standards Committee and the Health IT \nPolicy Committee is balanced so that no single sector of the health \ncare industry influences the actions of the committees. The amendment \nalso specifies an appointment process for the HIT Policy Committee and \nadds back a lot of the other ``good government'' provisions that were \nincluded in the ``Wired Act'' but left out of this bill.\n  In order for health IT to achieve this potential, however, it must be \ndone right. It must be interoperable, and the standards of \ninteroperability should be defined by standards developed by all the \nstakeholders. Consensus will help prevent Government bureaucrats from \nmandating the equivalent of Beta Max standards in a VHS world, while \nassuring doctors and hospitals that their IT purchases will not be like \ninvesting in compact discs the day before iTunes launched.\n  I strongly believe all of these changes are critical to ensuring we \ndon't backtrack on the progress we have made. I want to be clear \nthough, I would have preferred to continue working with the other bill \nauthors of the Wired for Health Care Quality Act. The ``Wired Act'' \ntook a much more fiscally sustainable approach with regard to \nresponsibly funding health IT for providers experiencing financial \nhardship. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated 90 percent of \nproviders will adopt health IT by 2030 without spending any Federal \ndollars. This bill spends roughly 28 billion in hard-earned taxpayer's \ndollars to achieve that same 90 percent adoption rate, a few years \nearlier. This is not a wise use of the taxpayer's dollars and I do not \nsupport these provisions.\n  I feel the ``Wired Act'' also did a better job balancing patient \nprivacy with proper access to health information. If information is \nwrapped up in so much red tape that doctors and their staff are not \nable to access it when they need it, patients will suffer and costs \nwill increase. It will take time and hard work, but we must find the \nright balance so patient care does not suffer.\n  In closing, I would like urge all members to support this amendment. \nI have been working on this amendment with members from both sides of \nthe aisle and I believe it reflects a bipartisan agreement. We need to \nmake sure we continue the progress we have made rather than backtrack.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, Senators are working to limit the cost of \nthe stimulus legislation. This bipartisan amendment that I offer with \nSenator Snowe and Senator Lincoln, holds down the cost of the stimulus \nlegislation by bringing back to the taxpayers billions and billions of \ndollars.\n  This amendment provides a way to quickly return to taxpayers much of \nthe $18 billion that has been paid out in excessive bonuses to \ncompanies under the Troubled Asset Relief Program.\n  Americans were horrified recently to learn that Citigroup and others \nthat had received extensive Federal support had paid out billions of \ndollars in excessive bonuses. This bipartisan amendment makes it clear \nit is not enough to say the excessive Wall Street bonuses were wrong, \nit makes clear they have to be paid back.\n  Our amendment gives those companies that receive Federal bailout \nmoney and pay the unjustified large bonuses a choice: Pay back the cash \nportion of any bonus paid in excess of $100,000 within 120 days of the \namendment's enactment, or pay an excise tax of 35 percent on what is \nnot returned to the Treasury.\n  The money can be repaid by the financial firms buying back the \npreferred stock the Federal Government owns in these companies or in \nany other fashion the institution chooses.\n  Senator Snowe, Senator Lincoln, and I have received extensive legal \nanalysis with respect to this amendment. It is clear our approach \npasses constitutional muster. Recently, I had printed in the Record a \nletter to me from Edward Kleinbard, head of the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, on this matter.\n  I also wish to thank Mr. Kleinbard and his very professional staff \nfor their analysis of this legislation. No other bipartisan bill \nproposed in either this body or the other body would force the \nrepayment of these bonuses and actually protect the taxpayer. This \namendment has real teeth, and it is supported by colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  Let me close by saying, first, I wish to thank the distinguished \nchairman of the Finance Committee and our wonderful staff. They have \nbeen so gracious, as always, to assist me on this. I would close by \nsaying I think the President summed it up. The President said these \nbonuses ``were shameful.'' Now it is time for us to do our job and pass \nlegislation with teeth that requires that these bonuses are repaid and \nthe taxpayers are protected.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Snowe, Senator Lincoln, and \nmyself in supporting a bipartisan approach in this area. It is \nparticularly relevant this afternoon.\n  I see my colleague and friend, a former chair, Senator McCain on the \nfloor. He has done yeoman's work in terms of blowing the whistle for \nunjustifiable Federal spending. This is a bipartisan way, colleagues, \nto hold down the cost of the stimulus legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 468 be made pending. I \nknow of no opposition at this point. No colleague has spoken in \nopposition and urge my colleagues to approve it. My sense is, it can \nprobably be done on a voice vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n\n[[Page S1836]]\n\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think that concludes all the amendments \non the list. We are now awaiting an attempt to drop a unanimous consent \nrequest so we can start voting on those amendments. That is in the \nprocess right now. Pending the completion of that list, it is probably \nadvisable that we keep the Senate open for debate equally divided until \nthe hour of 5 o'clock.\n  If we get the consent agreed to before then, we can ask to vitiate \nthat agreement where debate be allocated equally so we can propound the \nother consent.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time until 5 o'clock be time \navailable for debate only, equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I probably \nwill not object, if I understand the Senator from Montana, we most \nlikely will have a vote about 5 o'clock.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. We will try to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to share a few thoughts about \nwhere we are. The enormity of the legislation that is before us can \nhardly be comprehended. The bill, with interest, scored by the \nCongressional Budget Office, is $1.25 trillion. That is more than twice \nas much as the 5-year Iraq war has cost. It is the largest expenditure \nin the history of this country or any country in the history of the \nworld.\n  Remember, we have a big budget. We are spending a lot of money, too \nmuch money, most people think, in our normal budget. Every penny of \nthis money is debt. We do not have the money to pay for it. We already \nare in deficit. This increases the size of that deficit.\n  It increases the interest we will have to pay on it. I would note the \nCongressional Budget Office, which is our nonpartisan group, hired a \nnew Director--the Democrats have a majority, but it is a bipartisan \nselection, so, of course, he is approved by everybody, a good leader.\n  Their numbers show the interest on the debt today, this year, will be \n$195 billion. We are very fortunate because low interest rates, in the \nvery short term, are out there today. But by 2014, when you add the \nstimulus package into that, we will be looking at a deficit of $440 \nbillion each year and thereafter. It could be higher if interest rates \ngo higher. That is the equivalent each year of the Iraq war, for \nexample--almost.\n  This is how big the numbers are. I think the American people \nunderstand what is happening. They are very uneasy. I talked to my 90-\nyear-old shut-in aunt a little earlier today. She said: Who do they \nthink is going to pay that money back? That is a pretty good question, \nis it not?\n  Let me give perspective to my colleagues on how big and how dangerous \na condition our economy is in. These are numbers that are important. \nBack in 2004, that is when we had the largest deficit ever, after 9/11, \nafter the Iraq efforts and the slowdown in the economy, it hit $413 \nbillion.\n  President Bush was roundly criticized by members of this body, many \non the other side who are supporting this trillion-dollar bill, for \nallowing the deficit to go to $413 billion. That was 3.6 percent of the \ntotal gross domestic product in America, to give some perspective. But \nwe whittled it down a little bit. In 2005, it dropped to $318 billion; \nin 2006, $248; and in 2007, the year before last, the budget deficit \nfell to $161 billion.\n  I am a member of the Budget Committee. I kept an eye on that. I felt \nlike we were going in the right direction. I thought we were. It was \n1.2 percent of GDP. I felt the deficit was heading in the right \ndirection. We were not there, but I was pleased.\n  Then, last year about this time, President Bush decided we were \nheading into economic troubled waters and that we should stimulate the \neconomy. They came up with an idea to send everybody a check. I am sure \nmost people enjoyed receiving their checks. They went out, though, and \nit cost us over $150 billion right there.\n  It was all debt because, see, we were already in deficit. It just \nabout doubled the deficit to $455 billion last year. Now, this is what \nthe Congressional Budget Office says the deficit will be this year, \nwhen we complete the fiscal year, September 30, how much it is going to \nbe for 2009.\n  Well, the numbers--you can see what a dramatic thing it is--total \n$1.4 trillion, almost three times as much as the largest debt we have \never had in the history of the Republic.\n  Now, this is scoring about $200 billion-plus, a little over $200 \nbillion out of the financial bailout, that $700 billion. They are \nsaying that will be lost during this period of time.\n  We will lose that much on that. They are scoring money for Freddie \nand Fannie, bailing out those institutions that helped get us in this \nfix. Add this gray area down here, this is the stimulus. They are \nprojecting out of the trillion dollars we would have 232 sent this \nyear. The Freddie and Fannie and the Wall Street bailout, the $700 \nbillion, they are scoring right now as a one-time cost. The next year, \nwith those one-time costs out, we are still over a trillion, $1.16, \nalmost $1.2 trillion. These are huge numbers, and they impact us so \nseverely. They will burden us forever, and we are not going to pay this \nback. We are just going to borrow the money and pay the interest on it. \nThere is no way in our expectation that we will get the money to pay \nthis debt back.\n  Therefore, we should listen to what the Congressional Budget Office \nwrote. They conclude that the effects of this legislation would \n``diminish rapidly after 2010.'' They say that over the 10-year period, \nthe stimulus package ``would be a net negative to the economy.'' They \nsay that the gross domestic product over 10 years will be less if we \npass this bill than if we don't.\n  We all want to do the right thing. I had a feeling that this was not \ngood legislation in the long run. That is why I have been opposed to \nit. People I respect questioned it. Now we have our own independent \nCongressional Budget Office issuing a report yesterday, saying that \nover 10 years, already, we would be hurt by the legislation more than \nbenefited. Then think about the next 10 years or the next 10 years or \nthe next 10 years. A lot of people living today will still be alive 30 \nyears from now. I probably won't be one of them. But I will just say \nthat they are going to be feeling the negative pressure of the interest \nburden every year for as long as we can foresee. It portends dangerous \ntimes.\n  Where does the money come from that will pay this debt? That is what \nan interesting article in the Wall Street Journal today, written by \nGeorge Melloan, asked:\n\n       As Congress blithely ushers its trillion dollar \n     ``stimulus'' package toward law and the U.S. Treasury \n     prepares to begin writing checks on this vast new \n     appropriation, it might be wise to ask a simple question: \n     Who's going to finance it?\n\n  Where does the money come from?\n  He goes on:\n\n       That might seem like a no-brainer, which perhaps explains \n     why no one has bothered to ask.\n\n  He makes the point that right now we have low interest rates. He then \nsays:\n\n       Congress is able to assure itself that it will finance the \n     stimulus with cheap credit. But how long will credit be \n     cheap? Will it still be when the Treasury is scrounging \n     around in the international credit markets six months or a \n     year from now? That seems highly unlikely.\n\n  Senator Conrad, chairman of the Budget Committee, a fine Member of \nthe Senate, really worried about the debt, a Democratic leader and a \nfine leader in the Senate, passed out an article in the Budget \nCommittee the week before last from the New York Times.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent for 30 more seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The article said that China's trade surplus with the \nUnited States had dropped from $50 billion a month to $20 billion a \nmonth. They are going to spend more on their own economy. The question \nis, How could they buy more and more and more of our debt, even if they \nwanted to, when they don't have the money to do so? It portends higher \ninterest rates, as Mr. Melloan wrote.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S1837]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. While we had a lull in the offering of amendments, I \nthought I would come to the floor and speak about two amendments I \nwould like to have considered later on this evening as we continue with \nthis debate on this important bill. First let me say that there are \nsome really exciting opportunities in this bill to move our country \nforward, to give people hope and confidence that this Government \nfinally, after many years of inaction and negligence, is ready to act \nand try to be as focused as possible on creating and sustaining jobs, \nstrengthening our financial sector, and thawing the capital markets, \nnot just for what it means to Americans but for the world.\n  A group of us have been trying through the week to reach out to \nMembers on the other side and to live up to the call of the new \nPresident to try to build this bill from the center, to try to build \ncommon ground, to open dialog, to try to reach some accommodation so we \ncan do this together. I have found in my time in the Senate that some \nof the best things that have been accomplished have been accomplished \nin that way.\n  I wanted to speak for a minute and publicly thank Senator Nelson for \nhis leadership, the Senator from Nebraska, who has worked so very hard \non this. I would like to also mention others who have been part of this \neffort--Senator Bayh and Senator Tester, Senator Lincoln, Senator Webb, \nsome of the new Senators who have joined us, Senators who have now \nseveral terms of experience, Senator Carper, Senator Begich from \nAlaska, and others, Senator McCaskill. I have been part of this group \nas well, working to try to forge some common ground.\n  When this bill came out of the Senate Appropriations Committee--and I \nam a member of that committee--we were told that there could be some \nwork done on the floor to improve it. Our group took that to heart and \nsaid: Could we trim out some of the fat, add in some muscle, add in \nsome focus, and reach out to the other side?\n  There were Republicans who voted for the bill in committee. The \nranking member, Thad Cochran, gave support to the chairman, Senator \nInouye, and said: I am moving this bill forward in an effort to see if \nwe can improve it.\n  We have made some significant improvements on the floor over the last \nweek. It has been tough--late nights, early mornings--but we are going \nto continue that work. I am proud of the work of this centrist group, \nwhich is getting larger, not smaller, Members who come from the east \ncoast and the west, the South and the Midwest, across geographic \nbounds, working with Members on the other side. The Senators from Maine \nhave been particularly helpful, both on Appropriations and Finance. \nThere have been other Senators I have enjoyed working with on many \nissues, whether it is coastal issues or Corps of Engineers issues. \nHopefully, this centrist group will come together.\n  Unfortunately, there are a few Members--and maybe a few too many on \nthis floor--who, no matter what showed up, no matter if it was the \nperfect bill, would still say no because they don't want to move \nforward. I hope that a majority of us would heed the President's call \nand pull together and try our very best to move this debate forward.\n  In the last minute and a half I have, I want to mention two things \nthat could slightly improve. Again, there are some good things in this \nunderlying bill, but I still think we need to cut out a great deal. \nHopefully, we can come to some arrangement. It needs to be a \nsubstantial adjustment so that we can take out some fat and add some \nmuscle. As we are adding some muscle, I suggest that we add some \ninfrastructure funding in a broader array.\n  We all think highways are a great way to get people back to work, \ninvest in brick and mortar and highways. But we also think that about \nrevolving-loan funds, particularly for smaller cities and parishes and \ncounties in other States, parishes in Louisiana--we have a huge \nbacklog--waterways. And this is what I want to stress for the last \nminute or so.\n  I realize when you poll, highways always poll very high because we \nare always on them, roads and highways. In some parts of the country, \nmass transit and high-speed rail will poll well, particularly on the \nnortheast corridor, because a lot of people ride trains.\n  But I come from a place where there is a lot of water. Where I come \nfrom, there are levees. Sometimes they hold and sometimes they don't. \nBut not many people get on the other side of those levees, so they \ndon't always see these waterways that make our commerce move, that \nsupport the manufacturing base and the business base of this country. \nSometimes we forget that we need to invest in not just highways and not \njust rail, which is very important, but also our waterways. That is why \nI have an amendment pending that will add a billion dollars to the \nCorps of Engineers for restoration and water projects. I hope we can \ntake that up.\n  I commend Byron Dorgan, the chairman of our committee, for adding \n$4.6 billion because there was nothing in the bill when it started, and \nnot just for Louisiana but for Illinois, for Washington State, for \nFlorida. These ports, inland waterways, are very important. There is a \nbacklog of $61 billion. I know there is about $15 to $20 billion in the \npipeline, but there is $61 billion in backlog. I think adding a little \nbit more for the Corps of Engineers and restoration projects for the \nGreat Lakes, for the Gulf of Mexico, and for other areas would be \nimportant.\n  I also think it is not just hiring welders and carpenters and \nconstruction managers that is important, but some of our Members have \nsaid we should invest in the National Science Foundation because hiring \na scientist is a good thing to build a new experiment or to build a new \nway. It is not just building brick and mortar. So the National Science \nFoundation, in my view, is very much part of the new infrastructure of \nAmerica because it is not just about steel and concrete and \nshipbuilding and fabrication. The new infrastructure is also about \nintellectual property, and it is also about strengthening our \nscientific investments.\n  Our group feels that a broader infrastructure piece that would not \nonly be about highways but about waterways, about high-speed rail, \nabout investing in the scientific base of our country would be an \nimportant investment to make.\n  I know my 5 minutes has passed. I know we have a vote at about 5 \no'clock. I look forward to working with my colleagues in a team spirit \nto see if, as we progress, one or two of these amendments could be \noffered.\n  I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, there are some procedural situations on \nthe other side of the aisle, and I understand that, and I will \ncertainly be patient while those are resolved. I would just like to say \nwe have been following a procedure today that seems to be largely \nsatisfactory to most Members: that we consider a body of amendments \nthat are considered and then voted on en bloc or as a series. I hope we \nwould be able to continue that. There are, I believe, eight pending \namendments. We could vote on those and then move on to other \namendments. It is a procedure we have been following throughout the \nday. I hope we continue it and continue to make progress on the bill.\n  So I note the Senator from Montana is not on the floor, nor is \nleadership. But I hope the leadership would come out soon and give us \nan idea as to what the plans are for the remainder of the evening and \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wish to make a few comments based \nupon the hearing we had this morning----\n\n[[Page S1838]]\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, will my colleague from Kansas yield for \njust a moment?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Sorry?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Will my colleague from Kansas yield for a moment?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yield for what?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. For a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes, I will be happy to.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nfrom now until 5:30 be for general debate purposes only and that it be \nevenly divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I believe I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas has the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, as I was stating----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, might I ask the Senator from Kansas, how \nlong do you wish to speak?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Probably less than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. OK. Thank you. Fine.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, as I was mentioning, we had a hearing \nin the Joint Economic Committee this morning on Bureau of Labor \nStatistics numbers for this past month of January. They are not good, \nobviously. There are nearly 600,000 job losses taking place. What has \nhappened up until about 3 months ago--the crisis was centered in \nhousing, primarily, as everybody knows. Then it spread out to the rest \nof the economy. Then we have seen that spread out, make more impact, \nnow getting to unemployment rates that have been rising substantially \nduring those past 3 months.\n  Obviously, the economy is ailing. Everybody knows that. American \nfamilies are suffering. But there are two things I want to bring out \nfrom this study that I think are a little bit different, and I hope my \ncolleagues are watching these particular items.\n  There are two sectors in the economy that are still producing jobs. \nIt is in health care, and it is in education. Obviously, we wish they \nwere producing more jobs in those sectors, but the point of the matter \nthey were making and saying is that these two sectors are doing well \nwithout stimulus. They are continuing to move on forward.\n  It would be my hope that as people move forward on this process in \nthe stimulus bill, we would say: Let's target in and focus on the areas \nthat are not creating jobs, that have lost a huge number of jobs, and \ntarget much more of our effort there rather than in areas such as \nhealth care and education that have continued to produce jobs.\n  The auto industry--Senator Mikulski and I had an amendment that was \nadopted that, if this gets to conference, I would hope would be \nmaintained in conference, of taking interest on a new car purchase in \n2009 and allowing that interest to be tax deductible. That would be \nsomething that would stimulate a sector of the economy that is \nobviously in great trouble. And while we have limited resources, we \nneed to target it to areas that have difficulty and not areas that are \ndoing relatively well compared to the rest of the economy and do not \nneed stimulus, areas that are performing and look as if they are going \nto be able to continue to perform. So with the limited resources we \nhave, we have to target and get into those areas that actually need to \nbe stimulated and stimulate the economy in those zones.\n  I was just reading an article on the front page of the New York Times \ntoday. They were talking about Japan's lost decade that a number of \npeople have cited with pretty extensive writing: infrastructure \nprojects that did not produce yield, and then they were left with 10 \nyears of pretty radical Government spending and not much to show for \nit; and only with global economic activity picking up did the Japanese \neconomy pick up out of that, and then they were left with this towering \ndebt.\n  Point No. 1 on this issue is that for those sectors performing \nrelatively well--although not great--let's take those stimulus dollars \nand focus them into areas that are not performing, like in the auto \nindustry or in housing, which is where this started. I think that is a \ngreat point we need to do.\n  The second point on this--we just put out a paper on this on the \nRepublican side of the Joint Economic Committee--is that we need a \nstimulus, and we need it to be a stimulus, and we need to have some \ncriteria of stimulus. A number of people have studied this and looked \nat past experiences in this country and other places, and I would \nsimply ask my colleagues, let's make sure to put all of those proposals \nthrough a stimulus grid and ask, does it actually produce stimulus, \ndoes it actually create jobs, and not have a multiple set of targets \ntaking place of, well, OK, we want to do this in the energy field, we \nwant to do this in the environment field, we want to do this in other \nfields. All of these are fine objectives, but right now the economy is \nin this crisis situation, and that is what we have to have as a laser \nfocus.\n  I have seen too many times around here where we get a multiple set of \ntargets and we do not hit any of them very well. We have one target: We \nhave to get the economy going again. We have one job, and we probably \nhave one bullet the size we are talking about with this one. We can \nonly hit one target with this, and we need to hit that target.\n  In looking at these tax multipliers, President Obama's Chair of the \nCouncil of Economic Advisers has done studies on this and found that \nthe tax multiplier from tax cuts is nearly 3 to 1--every $1 of tax cuts \nproducing $3 of GDP activity. I have other papers--and I am going to \nsubmit those for the Record--showing the efforts for stimulus packages \nthat are focused on Government spending have as low a yield as $0.33 \nper $1 of economic activity spent on them. We cannot at all afford to \nhave that low of a yield on a Government spending package. We have this \nfrom studies from Robert Hall of Stanford and Susan Woodward, the chair \nof Sand Hill Econometrics, and a Harvard study by Robert Barro, showing \na multiplier of 0.8 in some of the Government spending.\n  My point in saying all this is I think there is a stimulus package to \nbe had out there that has 75, 80 votes for it from the Senate. I think \nwe have to slow up and get that package that gets that number of votes \nand have one criteria for it: Does it stimulate the economy? And if it \ndoes not have a multiplier of at least 1.5--I think it should be 2, but \nif it does not have a multiplier of at least 1.5, we should not be \ndoing it because what if we are 6 months down the road and this spreads \ninto another sector or we have more banking problems, and you need \nresources again, and you have already piled up this level of debt, and \nyou are going to add more to it, and you do not have another bullet in \nthe chamber to be able to do it?\n  A simple taking of a couple more weeks to get this hit on the \ntarget--it is far more important that we hit the target, that we have 2 \nor 3 more weeks to target in on it. We have good models, and there is \ngood will to do this. The pleas from these hearings we had this morning \non the unemployment rate say we have to hit the targets and the sectors \nthat need it, not the targets and the sectors that do not need it as \nmuch as in some of these manufacturing pieces and some of the \nconstruction pieces that are there.\n  Our economy is ailing, American families are suffering. They are \nlooking to us to help get the economy moving again without dooming \nfuture generations to decades of economic stagnation and decreased \nopportunity. Just like the patient who counts on his doctor to \nprescribe the right medication when he is ill, the American people are \ncounting on us to deliver the right medicine--medicine that will help \nthe economy recover.\n  I am concerned that we are on the verge of prescribing the wrong \nmedicine for the economy. The medicine we are on the verge of \nprescribing--a permanent and significant increase in the size of \ngovernment--may well leave our economy buried under a mountain of debt \nwith no appreciable impact on improving the long-term health of our \neconomy and little actual short-term ``stimulus.''\n  Time and again during this debate, Members of this body have taken to \nthis floor to proclaim that tax cuts don't stimulate the economy and \ncreate jobs. We have been told that spending is more effective at \nstimulating\n\n[[Page S1839]]\n\neconomic growth than reducing tax burdens as though that were settled \neconomic fact.\n  However, the multipliers cited are more the result of how the macro \nmodels are constructed than they are from any statistical analysis of \nthe data. These models are built upon the assumption that spending by \nthe Government is more effective in stimulating the economy than tax \nrelief to individuals and their families. When you construct an \neconomic model with assumptions that ensure large multiplier effects \nfrom Government spending--guess what--you get large effects from \nGovernment spending: multiplier in, by assumption, multiplier out.\n  But the consumer doesn't necessarily march to the tune of an \n``omniscient government,'' and might save some of the money instead of \nspending it all. Well, if we think that an American family might save \nhalf of any relief we give them, why not double the amount we give them \nand get the type of multiplier effects we want. Let the American \npeople, and not the Government, choose. I have a basic problem with the \nbasic notion that the Government is a better allocator of resources \nthan American families. Yet, we hear these multipliers bandied about as \nthough they represented settled economic fact.\n  That simply is not the case. In fact, there is a good deal of recent \neconomic research that analyzes data as opposed to building models on \nKeynesian assumptions.\n  I want to briefly cite a couple of examples of that research--\nresearch that looks at historical data and experience, not results \nproduced by theoretical models of the economy.\n  First, and some of my colleagues have alluded to this, Christina \nRomer, President Obama's Chair of the Council of Economic Advisors and \nher husband, David Romer of the University of California at Berkeley, \nfound a tax multiplier of about three--a dollar of tax cut raises the \ngross domestic product, GDP, by about three dollars.\n  In a recent paper published by the National Bureau of Economic \nResearch, Andrew Mountford of the University of London and Harald Uhlig \nof the University of Chicago, evaluated the effectiveness of three \npolicy options. Let me quote from their findings:\n\n       We find that deficit-financed tax cuts work best among \n     these three scenarios to improve GDP, with a maximal . . . \n     multiplier of five dollars of total additional GDP per each \n     dollar of the total cut in government revenue five years \n     after the shock.\n\n  They found a maximal multiplier of 5.33 after 14 quarters for a \ndeficit-financed tax cut. What did they find the maximum result of \ndeficit-financed Government spending was? Mr. President, 0.65-- after \none quarter.\n  Robert Hall of Stanford and Susan Woodward, the chair of Sand Hill \nEconometrics, find a general Government spending multiplier of about \none. Robert Barro of Harvard recently noted in the Wall Street Journal \nthat his research showed a 0.8 multiplier for war-time spending. When \nhe attempted to estimate directly the multiplier associated with \npeacetime Government spending, he got a number insignificantly \ndifferent from zero.\n  While the other side is fond of criticizing the 2001 and 2003 tax \ncuts, they often forget that they produced revenues that were greater \nthan estimated by CBO before they were passed. There is no question \nthat private investment and the jobs market improved dramatically and \nquickly after the passage of the 2003 tax cuts. Capital repatriated to \nthis country from abroad skyrocketed when we had a 1-year reduction in \nthe tax on earnings brought back to this country from abroad.\n  I want to impress upon my colleagues that these multipliers that are \ncited to support broad increases in spending are not supported by much \nsolid academic research. They are supported by models whose assumptions \nlargely drive the result.\n  Now I want to turn briefly to one aspect of this spending bill that \nneeds some emphasis. The proponents talk about creating jobs. This bill \nspends large amounts of money on worthwhile programs such as education \nand healthcare. This morning, the BLS reported that payroll employment \nin the education and health services sectors increased by 54,000 during \nJanuary 2009. Payroll employment in those sectors has registered \npositive growth for 52 consecutive months. During that period, payroll \nemployment in those sectors has increased by 2,164,000. Over the past \nyear, payroll employment in the education and health services sectors \nhas increased by 530,000.\n  It is not the education and health services sectors that need \nstimulus to create jobs; it is already creating them. We should be \ntargeting sectors that have suffered severe declines, like the motor \nvehicle and parts subsector where employment has declined by more than \n20% in just the past year and 40% since January 2001. We should be \nlooking at data to target incentives for enterprise to create jobs that \nare permanent and part of private-sector activity, not Government.\n  We need to also be careful to avoid reinflating the bubble. The \nconstruction sector lost 111,000 jobs in January and has seen 935,000 \njobs lost over 19 consecutive months of decline. Yet even with that \ndecline, construction-sector jobs are within 1 percent of January 2001 \nprehousing-bubble levels. We need to make sure that we aren't simply \ncreating temporary Government funded jobs that will vanish and leave \nAmerican families in the same situation they find themselves in today.\n  Lastly, I want to again address this concern over the fact that \nconsumers might save tax reductions or equivalently pay down debt. This \nbill takes the approach that consumers won't do the right thing and \nrush out and spend the money. What is wrong with a family making the \ndecision to improve its balance sheet rather than recklessly spend what \nthey might not be able to afford? The household and nonprofit sectors \nlost $7 trillion in net worth between the third quarter of 2007 and the \nthird quarter of 2008. We have poured hundreds of billions into helping \nbanks improve their balance sheets, but when a taxpayer chooses to do \nwhat he believes is best for his family, somehow we manage to criticize \nthat.\n  Rushing to pass a bill because of the fear that support is slowly but \nsurely fading under the face of pressure from the American people is a \nfoolhardy exercise. We should act with due speed, but not haste. Let's \ntake this bill down, send it back to committee, and focus on creating a \nbill that will stimulate the economy and does not use the current \ncrisis to shoehorn permanent expansions of Government programs into a \nstimulus bill under the guise of stimulus.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman.\n  Earlier today we adopted an amendment that prohibits appropriations \nunder this act to aquariums or zoos or beautification projects or other \nsuch entities, and Rhode Island was specifically targeted by the \nSenator who offered that amendment. He mocked a zoo that belongs to the \ncity of Providence that would be, I think, a potential area of support \nfrom this bill. He mocked a tree-planting program within the city of \nProvidence.\n  I urge my colleagues, at their leisure, to reconsider the wisdom of \nthat vote, perhaps in conference.\n  The Roger Williams Park Zoo is a wonderful facility. Children come \nthrough it to get educated through schools. People are employed there. \nIt opens minds to the wonders of nature. It has wonderful science \nprograms. And it's a municipal business that is run for the benefit of \nthe people of Providence. And it needs work. As long as it needs work, \nas long as cities are broke in this economy, I don't understand why one \nwould single out a zoo as opposed to the Department of Motor Vehicles \nor some other structure that might need repair. Why take that job away?\n  Is the Senator who offered this so infallible? Does he know so much \nabout other States he has never even visited that he can impose his \nviews? I would never dream of suggesting that I know more about towns \nand cities in Oklahoma than the local political establishments of those \ntowns as to what is wise. I really think that that is a mistake.\n  If a city needs tree planting and that brings real jobs and it puts \npeople and their trucks and their trees and their\n\n[[Page S1840]]\n\nnurserymen to work, and if it provides shade, and it provides \ngreenness, and if it absorbs carbon, and if it engages in traffic \ncalming, there are all sorts of good reasons why people would want to \ndo that. Why is it necessary for one Senator to tell the city of \nProvidence that he knows better, having never visited?\n  And, finally, we don't have an aquarium, but there was a story in the \nNew York Times about ``Japan's Big-Works Stimulus.'' It talks about a \nbridge they built with their stimulus money. As to the bridge, here is \nwhat they say:\n\n       ``The bridge? It's a dud,'' said Masahiro Shimada, 70, a \n     retired city official who was fishing near the port. ``Maybe \n     we could use it for bungee jumping,'' he joked.\n\n  Here is what he concluded:\n\n       Among Hamada's many public works projects, the biggest \n     benefits had come from the prison, the university, and the \n     Aquas aquarium. These had created hundreds of permanent jobs \n     and attracted students and families with children to live in \n     a city where nearly a third of residents were over 65.\n\n  Of the hundreds and hundreds of projects Japan did for stimulus in \nHamada, the three best included an aquarium--and we have ruled that out \nbecause one Senator from a State far from Rhode Island who has never \nbeen to my State purports to know more about what we should do in our \ncities than we do ourselves.\n  I urge that we have a little bit of the spirit of Ben Franklin at the \nclosing of the discussion over the Constitution when he urged all of \nthe Members who were present to doubt a little bit of their own \ninfallibility so that we can get together and get something done. I \nurge the Senator who proposed this amendment to doubt a little of his \nown infallibility, and I urge that we have a little bit more confidence \nin our own local judgments about what might actually provide the most \nbang for the buck.\n  I thank the chairman for allowing me this moment and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nOhio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, later this evening or tomorrow, I will \noffer an amendment that will put money back where it belongs: into the \npockets of retirees who earn those dollars and who will spend those \ndollars. I wish to thank Senator Voinovich, my colleague from Ohio, as \nwell as Senator Durbin from Illinois, Senators Schumer and Gillibrand \nfrom New York, and Senator Casey from Pennsylvania for joining me in \nthis effort.\n  Our amendment would drive economic activity and confront a policy \nthat has blindsided too many American retirees--retirees from all over \nthe country, from many sectors of our economy.\n  Mr. President, 44 million Americans rely on the Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation--PBGC--to protect their retirement income in \ntoday's volatile economic climate. When pension plans are terminated, \nthe PBGC steps in. Six hundred forty thousand Americans are covered \nunder the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. It is a crucial \ninstitution to maintaining a decent standard of living for American \nretirees. But in administering pension plans, the PBGC can pay out \nbenefits for years, based on preliminary estimates of the guaranteed \namount. Determination of the final benefit amount routinely takes \nseveral years to calculate and sometimes results in ``overpayments.''\n  I wish to put this term in context. When the PBGC takes over a \npension--when a corporation, in essence, dumps its pension on the PBGC \nwhich it has paid premiums into--it is a government agency but one that \nrelies on premiums paid by companies--when PBGC takes over a pension, \nbenefits are routinely cut--dramatically cut--for retirees. So if you \nare receiving $2,000 a month from your company, it declares bankruptcy, \nyou are thrown into the PBGC, you don't get $2,000 a month, you get \nappreciably less, sometimes $800 $900, $1,200, $1,400--way less a month \nthan you were getting before. So when PBGC makes a mistake with these \noverpayments, they don't make retirees flush, they are dollars at the \nmargin that reflect the difference between initial and final pension \nbenefits. In other words, most retirees covered under PBGC are \nreceiving significantly lower pension payouts with or without these \ntemporary overpayments, so it is never good news for the retiree. They \nare virtually never getting what they were promised by their company \nwhen they worked for that company and after they retired from that \ncompany.\n  Retirees have no control over the amount they are paid by PBGC. They \nhave no control over when PBGC will come up with final benefit \ndeterminations or whether these determinations will be different from \nthe initial estimates. But they are still required to pay the price for \nany difference between estimated and actual benefits, and that price \ncan be steep.\n  Let me share a story. For privacy's sake, I am going to use first \nnames only. Richard owes $53,415.60. He was told when he was working in \na steel mill that he would get a monthly pension benefit of around \n$2,400. When PBGC assumed trusteeship, he was told he would get a \nbenefit of $1,088. Now he is being told that he will get $325 minus a \nrecoupment deduction of 10 percent, yielding $292 before taxes. Now, \nRichard, as I said, was initially getting a pension when he retired--a \npromised pension, a commitment, a pledge from this company of $2,400. \nThat was the promise. That was the covenant he had. Now, because of all \nof this, he is getting $292 before taxes.\n  Louis. Louis put in nearly 34 years at Republic Technologies in \nLorain, OH, where I lived for many years. PBGC has informed him he will \nbe paying back pension money until he is 95 years old.\n  These are Ohio stories, but Ohioans are not the only ones who have \nbeen hit with pension cut after pension cut after pension cut. Not only \nRepublic Technology retirees such as Richard and Louis, but retirees \nfrom Oneida, Pillotex, Bethlehem Steel, Huffy, Penn Traffic, National \nSteel, Reliable Insurance, U.S. Air, Eastern Airlines, Pan Am, Delta, \nUnited Airlines--retirees from all of those companies have been \nblindsided by overpayment recoupment.\n  Our amendment is simple. It gives a little relief to the 30,000 \nretirees whose pensions are being garnished by PBGC.\n  Under our amendment, these retirees receive a simple reprieve from \nPBGC requirements for 24 months. Their pensions wouldn't be garnished \nand they wouldn't be liable for those dollars--now or ever. If we want \nto stimulate the economy, giving a few dollars back to retirees who \nnever thought they would lose them and who desperately need them is an \nexcellent way to do it.\n  Conservative estimates place the cost of this amendment at $20 \nmillion. Those dollars will go straight into the pockets of American \nretirees to be spent immediately in our country, and it will help the \neconomy, and it will certainly help those thousands of retirees.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there will be votes later on this evening. \nWe are going to have a Democratic caucus starting in 7 minutes, at \n5:30. We hope to complete that in 45 minutes or thereabouts, but \ncaucuses sometimes don't work out as quickly as we wish. We will come \nback after that and hopefully at that time work toward disposing of \nthese amendments that are now pending. We have a number of them that \nneed to have votes.

Madam President, earlier today, the Labor Department \nannounced that the unemployment rate had gone up very high. We now find \nthe housing crisis is worse, with lending freezes still upon us, and \nsmall businesses are shutting down as we speak. Job losses are \nsignificant this month alone; that is, the month of January, with \n600,000 jobs lost, and the month of February is starting to be even \nworse than January as far as layoffs. In Nevada, the unemployment rate \nhas gone well over 9 percent.\n  Leading economists are now comparing today's crisis to the early days \nof the Great Depression. We are doing everything we can to make sure \nthis severe recession we are in does not become another Great \nDepression, and we are a long ways from a Great Depression. The Great \nDepression saw the stock market drop 89 percent, and 25 percent of all \nAmericans were unemployed, with millions of others underemployed. But \nwe do not want this recession we are in to march into a depression, and \nthat is why we have worked all week to come up with a solution to these \nproblems, to try to help jump-start this economy.\n  President Obama himself acknowledged that his plan wasn't perfect. I \nhave to be very candid with everyone here. I have learned a lot in the \nlast few days by people coming in good faith and saying what is in here \nshould not be in here and, on a few occasions, listening to what was \npropounded by those who have come up with this bipartisan agreement, we \nhad to swallow real hard, but it was all done in good faith. This is a \nvery critical juncture in time for our great country. It is an \nimportant time for the Congress. Faced with this grave and growing \neconomic crisis, we are now close--closer--to joining President Obama \nin helping turn the economy around.\n  I think the process here has been very good. We have had a large \nnumber of amendments debated and voted upon. The managers have worked \nvery hard. Senators Baucus and Inouye, with their counterparts, have \nmoved through a lot of amendments. It has been an open process. Some of \nthe votes have been difficult votes to take. But now we are at a point \nwhere people of good will are going to move forward and complete this \nwork. The question of when we do it is certainly something we are \nconcerned about, but we are going to do it--if not tonight, in the next \nday or so.\n  I express my appreciation to a Senator on our side of the aisle--\nSenator Ben Nelson--who took this difficult assignment on our side to \ncome up with something we could pass, is the best way to say it. There \nwere a number of Senators who worked with him on this side of the \naisle, a number of Senators who worked with Senator Collins on the \nother side of the aisle. I am not going to run through all the people \nwho worked on this, but from my perspective Senator Nelson and Senator \nCollins are the two people who got us to where we are now, with great \nwork by others. I hope I don't offend anyone by not mentioning them, \nbut from my perspective tonight there are four people who need to talk \nabout this. But for them, we would not be in a position where we could \nmove forward to try to help the American people: That is Senators Ben \nNelson, Susan Collins, Arlen Specter, and Joe Lieberman.\n  So, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent--and certainly if the \nRepublican leader cares to say anything, but I wish to get this consent \nrequest entered first. If he wants to say something before the time \nbegins on these other individuals, he certainly has that right. He can \ndo it beforehand, if he wants, but I want to get this out of the way.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Ben Nelson be recognized for 10 \nminutes; that Senator Susan Collins be recognized for 10 minutes; \nSenator Arlen Specter be recognized for 15 minutes; Senator Lieberman \nbe recognized for 10 minutes; and that the Republicans, following these \nstatements by these four Senators, have equal time--that is 45 \nminutes--to be divided any way they feel appropriate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that be approved; and I preface it by saying \nif Senator McConnell has anything to say before the time starts running \non these four individuals and the other individuals, which is going to \nbe about 90 minutes, and I am sure he does, I ask unanimous consent \nthat following the statement of the Republican leader that this consent \nbe granted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I may \nnot object, but I wish to ask the distinguished majority leader if we \ncould alternate the speakers over that same period of an hour and a \nhalf.\n  Mr. REID. I would say that we are alternating. We have four people \nwho have put this arrangement together. I think it would be appropriate \nfor the whole body to listen to what the arrangement is. I think it \nwould certainly be more understandable to do it that way, and we have \ntwo Republicans and two Democrats. So I think that would be fair. If my \nfriend would allow us to do that, I think it would be good for the \nbody.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. That is certainly not alternating speakers in terms of \nposition on the amendment, and I would again suggest we do what we \nvirtually always do and alternate speakers with regard to the pending \nissue, which is this new amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend, through the Chair, wouldn't it be better \nif people who responded to these four Senators had some idea what the \nagreement was? That would seem to be so much more logical, and I hope \nmy friend would allow us to proceed in that manner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I also note that I see my friend stood to be recognized, \nMadam President, but we have gone out of our way to protect everybody's \nright. We haven't tried to blindside anyone. We have listened to all \nthe amendments. We have been fair with all the time. I can't imagine \nwhy my friend would want to do this. My Senators need to know what this \nagreement is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I will not object. I wish to respond to \nthe majority leader through the Chair and say I am very eager to \nunderstand all of the details of this proposal, and I will be doing \nthat by getting a copy of the proposal and digesting it over a \nreasonable period of time over the weekend, since it is a trillion \ndollar proposal. But I will not object to that specific request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I rise this evening to speak \nabout the need for Congress to support substantial and swift-acting \nhelp for our Nation. These days, all too often when tuning into the \nnews, we cringe--layoffs, job losses, poor earnings, business closings, \nState fiscal problems, foreclosures, global financial troubles, and the \nworried faces of so many Americans.\n\n[[Page S1842]]\n\n  Our great Nation is mired in the worst economic downturn since the \nGreat Depression. My State of Nebraska, usually late to recessions, has \nbeen caught by the crisis too. Thousands of Nebraskans have lost their \njobs or been laid off. Many business owners are worried, and the \neconomic downturn is affecting everyone's budget and wallet and \noutlook. One of the strongest Nebraska values is our work ethic. But \nright now, a lot of Nebraskans just want to show up for work tomorrow \nor hope for a better job in the future.\n  That is why I have been pleased to work with my good friend, Senator \nSusan Collins, and a bipartisan group of Senators to address this \ncrisis now, to find a plan that creates jobs and restores America's \neconomic strength. We have reached an agreement on a bipartisan plan \nthat does that. With so much at stake, however, and the costs to our \nchildren and our grandchildren so high, it is important that we get it \nright.\n  The economic recovery bill we support today fuels two powerful \nengines: major tax cuts for the middle class and to create jobs, and \ntargeted investments in America's infrastructure and job growth. Our \nbipartisan group worked long and hard, going line by line, dollar by \ndollar, to reduce spending from the original bill. We trimmed the fat, \nfried the bacon, and milked the sacred cows. The savings to the \nAmerican people, to taxpayers, is $110 billion--hardly the trillion \ndollars that was just mentioned.\n  The total package is $780 billion. The remaining bill consists of tax \ncuts for the middle class and specific job-creating investments, \nproviding long-lasting economic benefits.\n  I truly thank my colleagues from across the aisle, my good friends \nand partners in this effort, Senator Susan Collins and Senator Arlen \nSpecter and my good friend from Connecticut, Joe Lieberman, for their \nwork. Also, we had the support of a number of our colleagues, including \nthe Presiding Officer, on this side of the aisle. I guess I can \naffectionately call all of us the Jobs Squad. They made nonstop efforts \nand held nonstop meetings to do this work this week. They never lost \nhope, no matter whatever the word was on the street or the fact that \nthere was maybe one or two or more leaks of information. We would never \nlose hope. Their guidance and their wise counsel were invaluable as we \ncontinued to work to advance and develop this consensus today.\n  Our plan pared back a very substantial amount of money that we \nbelieved didn't belong in a bill called a stimulus package that was \ndesigned to fix our economy. If we look at these proposals, many of \nthem will work well in a budget or in another bill, but we did not \nthink they deserved to be in this particular bill which was about jobs, \njobs, jobs. If we ask taxpayers to support it, as we are, they deserve \nto get the biggest bang for their buck. The remaining plan will \ngenerate new jobs, save jobs, and expand job opportunities all across \nAmerica as it also boosts our economy.\n  We recognize our plan is not perfect, but I believe it is both \nresponsible and realistic. It is stimulative and timely and can help \ndeliver economic recovery to the American people soon.\n  The tax cuts in the recovery plan will reach 95 percent of all \nAmericans, providing direct assistance for struggling middle-class \nAmerican families and to businesses so they can create or preserve \njobs. The robust $350 billion in tax cuts will put a lot of money in \npeople's pockets, money to buy a car, a refrigerator, a student's \ncollege education, or equipment for better products. Some say we do not \nhave enough tax cuts. That $300 billion I just mentioned is the exact \nsame amount Congress overwhelmingly approved in 2003, under the \nprevious administration, to help the economy at that time.\n  Our country cannot wait another day for another approach. The \nAmerican people expect us, their elected representatives, to pull \ntogether in crisis, to do the best we can, and to take appropriate \naction. We may not have a choice about the need for a major stimulus \neffort, but our bipartisan group has made tough choices, and we have \nimproved the economic recovery bill. I believe President Obama and \ncolleagues all across Capitol Hill, on both sides of the aisle and both \nsides of this wonderful Capitol, will see this as a serious and \neffective effort to return America to prosperity.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenator Nelson, Senator Specter, and Senator Lieberman, in offering a \nbipartisan compromise on the stimulus proposal that is before us. This \nproposal is the culmination of much deliberation and debate by so many \nof our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I realize some of my \nRepublican colleagues who were involved in the deliberations ultimately \nhave decided not to support the compromise, but their debate, their \nideas helped inform the compromise we are presenting tonight.\n  Our country faces a grave economic crisis, and the American people \nwant us to work together. They do not want to see us dividing along \npartisan lines on the most serious crisis facing our country. That is \nwhy so many of us have worked night and day to try to come up with a \nstimulus package that would be a considerable improvement over the \nHouse-passed bill and would help boost our economy and create and \npreserve jobs.\n  I could not vote for the House-passed bill. Laden with unnecessary \nexpenditures, it was a Christmas tree upon which every Member, \nvirtually, had hung his or her favorite project. It was bloated, \nexpensive, and ineffective. This compromise greatly improves the bill. \nIt will help our economy recover from a dangerous recession. It will \nhelp Americans throughout this country who are struggling because they \nhave lost their jobs.\n  Every day we hear more reports of massive job losses. Just today we \nlearned our country lost nearly 600,000 jobs in January alone. The \nunemployment rate exceeds 7 percent, its highest level in more than 16 \nyears. Unemployment in my home State of Maine is now 7 percent--again, \na 16-year high. Just today in Maine we learned that another paper mill \nhas been forced to lay off 140 people for at least a month because they \ndo not have enough orders to keep the workers on the job. These are not \njust cold statistics. These are not just jobs. These are hard-working \nAmerican people who need our help, who deserve a stimulus package that \nis targeted, effective, and bipartisan. That is why I have worked so \nhard with a bipartisan group of my colleagues to come up with a \nresponsible plan that will jump-start our economy and help improve the \nlives of hard-working people.\n  This debate is not about Republicans or about Democrats. It is not \nabout our new President winning or losing. It is about helping the \nAmerican people. Surely we ought to be able to come together to advance \nthat goal.\n  I have maintained since the beginning of this debate that in order to \nbe effective, the money included in this package has to be able to be \nspent quickly to put more dollars into the taxpayers' pockets, and it \nhas to be targeted and directed to projects that will really help. That \nis what we have done.\n  As my colleague from Nebraska has pointed out, we have reduced over \n$110 billion in unnecessary spending from this bill. We have cut that \naway. Is it perfect? No. Every compromise reflects choices that are \nnecessary to bring people together. But this bill is an enormous \nimprovement over the House bill. It cuts away many projects that are \nworthwhile projects but which do not belong in a stimulus package \nbecause they have nothing to do with turning our economy around and \ncreating and saving jobs.\n  There has been a lot of talk from outside groups about our slashing \nthe spending in this bill. We took a targeted approach. We did cut \nspending, even for programs we all support because they belong in the \nregular appropriations process. They are good programs, but they are \nnot programs that will stimulate the economy.\n  So we focused on the following programs:\n  We included $45.5 billion for infrastructure projects--roads and \nbridges that are needed throughout our country that are ready to go, \nthat will put people to work, and that will leave lasting assets in \ncommunities across this country. We helped to fund some water and sewer \nprojects that are the\n\n[[Page S1843]]\n\nresults of unfunded Federal mandates which are needed to improve public \nhealth but impose a real burden on struggling communities and States.\n  We included $4.4 billion to improve our electric transmission through \na smart grid that will help us to transmit alternative sources of \nenergy.\n  We included $87 billion in targeted temporary increases in the \nFederal Medicaid matching rate. This will help our States avoid deep \ncutbacks in health care coverage for some of our most vulnerable \ncitizens.\n  We included $6 billion for special education. If you talk to schools \nthroughout this country and you ask them how you can most help them, \nthey will say: Start fulfilling the Federal promise to help fund \nspecial education for children with special needs. It is a promise we \nmade back in the 1970s that we have never kept. We put in funding for \nspecial education. That will help communities across this country, and \nit will help retain teaching jobs as well.\n  We also included nearly $4 billion in Pell grants to help our \nneediest students go to college.\n  We have included funding for a 1-year fix in the alternative minimum \ntax, which unfairly imposes an increased tax on middle-income families. \nThere are tax incentives for small businesses, the true job creators in \nthis country. They will be helped by this bill. There is tax relief for \nlow-income and middle-income families. That is so important, to help \nthose families who are truly struggling right now, and it will help \nboost consumer demand as well.\n  We took a careful, thoughtful, comprehensive approach. We got rid of \nfunding for such projects as $870 million for pandemic flu \npreparedness. That is something that may be needed but doesn't belong \nin a stimulus package. We made a number of cuts like that, difficult \ncuts but important, so that we could keep to the purpose of this \npackage.\n  This has been an extremely difficult deliberation, but I believe we \nhave an obligation to start solving the problems facing this country. \nThe American people do not want to see partisan gridlock. They do not \nwant to see us divided and fighting. They want to see us working \ntogether to solve the most important crisis facing our country. That is \nwhat we have done. That is why we have presented this compromise.\n  Again, I thank not only my colleagues, Senator Nelson, Senator \nSpecter, and Senator Lieberman--all of whom have worked so hard--but \nothers whose input and insights were invaluable in crafting this \npackage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I begin with the enormously serious \neconomic problems facing the United States: an unemployment rate which \nis rising, 4,100,000 jobs lost last year, thousands of people losing \ntheir jobs every day; recognizing the very heavy psychological factor \nwhich is at work, cited for the destruction of consumer confidence; and \nthe eyes and the ears of the world are on the United States, on the \nU.S. Government, and on the Senate tonight to see whether we will be \nable to respond to the magnitude of the problem.\n  The psychological impact, if we were to reject some activist \napproach, I think would be devastating, not only on Wall Street and on \nMain Street but all across the face of the globe.\n  Based on the telephone calls which I have gotten in my office, this \nis a very unpopular vote. Perhaps the tide will turn. But the calls are \nmounting from one end of the political spectrum saying there are too \nmany expenditures, and the calls are mounting on the other end of the \npolitical spectrum saying there is not enough money being spent on the \nproposal which we are advancing tonight.\n  Perhaps the tide will turn on reflection and an analysis of the \nprogram which we are setting forth. Perhaps the tide will turn as \nexemplified by the letter issued today from the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, principal spokesman for corporate America and principal \nspokesman for conservative America.\n  The Chamber says this:\n\n       Therefore, this legislation, because the economy continues \n     to deteriorate, the Chamber is for the bill because it \n     supports pro-growth tax initiatives. The Chamber is for the \n     bill because it applauds the inclusion of tax relief. The \n     Chamber is for the bill because many of the spending-side \n     provisions of the legislation will also provide stimulus to \n     get Americans back to work focusing on infrastructure \n     spending for roads, rails, public transportation, aviation, \n     inland waterways and ports.\n\n  I have already noted certain grave concerns which I have and one is \nthe rush to judgment, which we are a part, and perhaps a necessary \npart. When President Obama came to speak to the Republican Caucus \nrecently, when my turn came to ask a question, I said: Why are you \nwedded to February 13? That is too fast to digest a bill of this \nmagnitude.\n  I said we had passed a $700 billion bailout bill, TARP, where we did \nnot know what was in the bill. We did not have the regular order of \nhearings, questions, and cross-examination or committee work on the \nmarkup line by line with the committee report. We did not even have \nfloor debate.\n  We made a lot of mistakes. They were compounded by the administration \ncarrying it out. I voted against the release of the second $350 \nbillion. I said: Mr. President, let's not do it again. There is nothing \nmagical about February 13 before we start the week of recess for \nPresidents Day.\n  The President responded, emphasizing the severe nature of the \nproblem, and not telling us all, which he has told us privately, about \nthe serious problems which he sees or his advisers see for any delay at \nall. So we are responding to his timetable. I do not like it, but I am \nresponding to it.\n  There are other aspects of this bill which give me heartburn. There \nis a lot in this bill which ought to be part of the regular \nappropriations process. I served for 10 years as chairman of the \nsubcommittee funding the Departments of Health and Human Services and \nEducation. I have fought hard for many of the items that are in this \nbill but ought not to be in this bill. They ought to be part of the \nregular appropriations process where we set an overall budget and we \nfight them out on priorities.\n  But they are here because the administration and the bill proposed by \nthe committee has seen fit to include them. There are many who are \ncriticizing the amendment which we are offering here this evening. They \nsay there are cuts in important programs. Well, that is wrong. There \nare not cuts in important programs. If this bill is not passed, there \nwill not be any appropriations. So you start from zero on Head Start, \nand you start from zero on child development.\n  It is true we have made some reductions in the size of the \nappropriations, but that is not a cut. For example, on childcare, the \ncommittee bill has $2 billion, and we have seen fit to put $2 billion \nin. Well, if we do not have 60 votes, childcare does not get any \nadditional sum. My preference would be to handle it in regular order.\n  Head Start is in the committee bill for $2.1 billion. It is going to \nhave $1.05 billion.\n  Title I in the committee report has $13 billion and will retain $12.4 \nbillion. Special education has $13.5 billion, and we left it all in \nbecause that is a Federal mandate. It is different.\n  The National Institutes of Health has $10 billion, including the \nSenate amendment. This is an item that has special significance to \nSenator Harkin and myself as our lead in raising NIH funding since 1994 \nfrom $10 billion to the present number of approximately $30 billion. \nNIH will produce 70,000 jobs, according to the head of the National \nInstitutes of Health.\n  Now, what have we accomplished in the amendment which is being \noffered now? This bill, in coming to the floor, and these figures are \npretty close. They are hard to be exact. The bill starts with $885 \nbillion. There were add-ons on the floor of $53 billion. The bill, as \nit is being reported is $780 billion. So we have reduced the \nexpenditures by $105 billion. That is a lot of money.\n  That is something which makes everybody angry. But that is a position \nyou are in if you are a Senator. People are unhappy because they did \nnot get the full amount for the committee report, although absent this \nbill they would get zero additional. People are unhappy on spending too \nmuch money, but it is imperative, as I see it, that we do something \nvery substantial.\n  There are reasons to argue that this is a bad bill. I am not saying \nit is a bad bill, I am saying there are reasons to argue it is a bad \nbill. But I do not believe there is any doubt the economy would be \nenormously worse off without\n\n[[Page S1844]]\n\nit. That is the kind of a choice we have to make.\n  Personally, I would prefer not to be on the edge of the pin, as so \nfrequently is the case in this body. But I do believe we have to act, \nand I believe that under all the circumstances, this is the best we can \ndo and we ought to do it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank my friends, Senator Ben \nNelson of Nebraska, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, Senator Arlen \nSpecter of Pennsylvania, for their eloquent comments. I thank them for \ntheir leadership. I thank them for their courage. I am honored to be in \ntheir presence. All of America is indebted to them for what their \nleadership, on behalf of this unifying amendment, will mean to the \npeople of our country.\n  Tonight the Senate is passing a test. It is not as hard a test as the \ntest millions of Americans are facing every day in this terrible \neconomic crisis our country is going through. It is not as hard as the \ntest facing the families whose mothers and fathers have lost their jobs \nor whose children cannot afford to go to college or whose employers \ncannot afford to give them the health care benefits they have had.\n  I could go on and on. It is the American people who, in the midst of \nthis economic crisis, greater than any we have faced since the Great \nDepression, are facing the most serious test every day. But their test \nnow confronts the Senate, the House, this Congress, the President, our \nGovernment with another test.\n  Are we able to come together and give the American people, the \nAmerican economy, American businesses, American workers, the help that \nthey can get from nowhere else, to get this economy of ours moving \nagain, to protect jobs and to create jobs. The help is not going to \ncome from the private sector; it is not there. It is not going to come \nfrom the personal consumption that normally drives 70 percent of our \ngross domestic product; it is not there. You do not need to be an \neconomist to understand that.\n  People see it in their own lives: lost jobs, fear that their jobs \nwill be next, an anxiety so deep they will not buy what they need, \nbusinesses that are constantly laying off people. It has been referred \nto, but here it is today, 600,000 Americans lost their job last month, \nJanuary of this year.\n  So the only place help can come from for this economy now is the \nFederal Government. The question is, Would we rise to the test? I think \ntonight, thanks to some very strong leadership from Senator Nelson, \nSenator Collins, some really courageous work by the two of them, and \nSenator Specter and others in both parties, we are going to show \ntonight that the U.S. Government passes the test.\n  As a result, we will then help the American people pass the test, \nrestore their hope, protect their jobs, create new jobs, give them more \nmoney in their pockets as their payroll taxes go down. This journey we \nhave been on this week, very intense, very emotional, very difficult, \nwas never about winning or losing, it was about governing.\n  Would we be able to find common ground to get 60 votes to pass this \nlegislation so critically needed by the American people. Tonight we are \ngoing to do it. It was not easy, but we are going to do it, and it \nshould give us all in this Chamber hope as we go on to confront the \nnext problems and challenges we will face: health care reform, climate \nchange, entitlement reform to secure the retirement of the American \npeople in future years.\n  The bill that came to the floor, as has been said, was a very strong \nand good-faith effort. But many of us on both sides of the aisle, both \nparties, even a couple of Independents, felt there were some things in \nit that though very well intended, could not be justified as part of an \neconomic stimulus package.\n  On another level, what was clear as a result is that the proposal, as \nit came to the floor, simply did not have the 60 votes it needs to get \nadopted. You cannot get anything done, I was told a long time ago when \nI went into Connecticut politics, by a wise and seasoned politician: \nYou cannot get anything done for the people who were good enough to \nsend you to serve unless you pass legislation.\n  It is great to give a beautiful speech, but a beautiful speech \ndoesn't protect anybody's job. It doesn't put more money into the \npaycheck. It doesn't provide health care or hope.\n  In what looked like another moment of failure, inability to lead, \ninability to govern, inability to help the people of our country who \nare suffering now as they haven't suffered for a long time, a gang was \nformed. I must say, as a teenager I never got to join a gang. The \nSenate has given me an unexpected opportunity to join some good gangs. \nIt shows if you live long enough, as the old saying goes, you \nexperience anything. This wasn't a gang of 14. This was a gang of \npeople who wanted to get the economy moving again--Democrats, \nRepublicans, and Independents. But it took two people with the guts to \nstep forward and form it, lead it: Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska and \nSenator Susan Collins of Maine. A lot of others of us came together. We \nworked very hard. We worked openly. We worked honestly. We had a common \ngoal, as has been said; $110 billion has been cut out of this program.\n  Our Republican colleagues offered an amendment that would have cut \nthe original program down to $411 billion. Senator Collins, in our \nmeetings with one another, came in with a proposal of $620 billion. The \nbill, as it came to the floor, was $885 billion. We compromised. That \nis always the way anything gets done in an American legislative body \nbecause we represent this extraordinarily diverse country. We come with \ndifferent philosophies, different backgrounds, different \nconstituencies. If you try to get everything you want, you won't get \nanything for anybody who was good enough to send you here to represent \nthem.\n  So through some steadfast, patient, creative leadership from Senator \nNelson and Senator Collins, we moved forward and, ultimately, today \nhave come up with this agreement. This actually cuts over 20 percent of \nthe money recommended for spending by the Appropriations Committee, but \nit comes very close to the $800 billion President Obama has quite \nrightly said this country needs to make this stimulus work. We have a \n$1 trillion gap in our economy this year. This $780 billion will be \nspent over 2 years. Frankly, we need that, and probably more, to get \nthe economy going in the way we want it to be going.\n  I wish to say a special word of thanks and admiration for Senator \nCollins and Senator Specter. They differed from the majority of the \nmembers of their party. I have been in that position. It is no fun. It \nis lonely. It is not that anybody is right--we think we are right--it \nis just that people come to a different decision about what the \nnational interest requires. Both of our colleagues and others on the \nRepublican side have put what they think to be the national interest \nahead of party interest. I think what we are doing here tonight will be \na tremendous help to the people of this country.\n  A lot of our colleagues on the Democratic side are accepting less \nthan they thought was necessary to do the job. They are compromising \ntoo. They are compromising because they want to get something done, and \nthey know, as they watch the economic indicators and the human \nsuffering changing every day, getting worse and worse every day, that \nit is urgent we do something now.\n  So we come together tonight to prove we are capable of governing, we \nare capable of leading, we are capable of reaching across party lines \nto get things done when the American people need it most. I am proud to \nbe here. I am grateful to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I \nam encouraged that what we have done tonight will set an example for \nwhat we can do for the rest of this session. The leaders of the gangs \nmay change. The Members may come and go. But we only get things done \nhere if we build bridges across the aisle. That is what we are \ncelebrating tonight.\n  Ultimately, as I said, there were no winners or losers. This is not \nabout winning or losing. There is a winner tonight. It is the American \npeople. They deserve it.\n  The leader set up this time for debate. Therefore, I ask unanimous \nconsent that this period of time be for debate only.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S1845]]\n\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Reserving the right to object, the previous UC, as I \nunderstand it, allows for activity besides debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak.\n  I have spoken to the distinguished Republican leader, and we have a \nnumber of amendments that he and I wish to dispose of this evening. So \nwhen this debate is completed, we will move as quickly as we can to \nhave votes on the amendments that are pending. I am somewhat taken \naback by the fact that after all we have been through since the \nCongress started--we have been candid and forthright. Everything has \nbeen aboveboard. I would hope that no matter how disappointed some \npeople may be that we have a way of moving forward on this, that people \nwould allow us to do that in a reasonable period of time. We could do \nit tonight. I understand that is not likely. I don't know what my \nfriend from Louisiana is trying to do. Remember, what we do tonight \nsets us up for the future. There are going to be other pieces of \nlegislation that come to the floor, other opportunities for \ncooperation. I don't know what my friend has in mind, but I would hope \nthat it is nothing that throws a monkey wrench into what we have been \ntrying to accomplish in this Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, how much time remains on the Republican \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republicans have 45 minutes. Senator \nSpecter has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will be the lead-off speaker. Then Senator McCain \nwill follow me. I ask unanimous consent that he control the balance of \nour time after that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McConnell. Mr. President, the question of whether the economy \nneeds help is not in debate. I don't think there is a single Member of \nthe Senate who believes that no action is the appropriate course for us \nto take. But one of the good things about reading history is, you learn \na good deal. We know for sure the big spending programs of the New Deal \ndid not work. In 1940, unemployment was still 15 percent. It is widely \nagreed among economists that what got us out of the doldrums we were in \nduring the Great Depression was the beginning of World War II.\n  We have another example, what is called in Japan ``the lost decade of \nthe 1990s,'' where stimulus packages similar to the ones we are \nconsidering tonight were tried again and again and again. And at the \nend of the 1990s, Japan looked very much like it did at the beginning \nof the 1990s, except it had a much larger debt.\n  We have not seen the compromise proposal which has been discussed \ntonight. I know there has been a good-faith effort on the part of those \ninvolved to pare down the size of the underlying Senate measure. But as \nnearly as we can tell, even after those efforts, it is roughly the same \nsize as the House bill. According to the figures I have been given, the \nHouse bill is about $820 billion. The Senate bill, under the \ncompromise, we believe would be about $827 billion. Bear in mind, the \ninterest costs on either of those proposals would be $348 billion. So \nwe are talking about a $1.1 trillion spending measure.\n  We are already looking at a $1 trillion deficit for this fiscal year. \nWe believe the Secretary of the Treasury and the President are going to \nbe suggesting to us, as early as next week, that we need to do a new, \nwhat has commonly been referred to as, TARP round, some kind of \nadditional assistance for the financial system, as early as next week. \nWe are talking about an extraordinarily large amount of money and a \ncrushing debt for our grandchildren.\n\n  If most Republicans were convinced that this would work, there might \nbe a greater willingness to support it. But all the historical evidence \nsuggests it is highly unlikely to work. So then you have to balance the \nlikelihood of success versus the crushing debt we are levying on the \nbacks of our children, grandchildren and, yes, their children and the \nneed to finance all of this debt, which many suspect will lead to ever \nhigher and higher interest rates, which could create a new round of \nproblems for our economy.\n  Let me sum it up by saying, no action is not what any Republican \ncolleague that I know is advocating. But most of us are deeply \nskeptical this will work. That level of skepticism leads us to believe \nthis course of action should not be chosen.\n  We had an opportunity to do this on a truly bipartisan basis, and the \nPresident said originally he had hoped to get 80 votes. It appears the \nway this has developed, there will be some bipartisan support but not a \nlot. It is not likely, in the judgment of most of us, to produce the \nresult we all desire.\n  I will not be in a position to recommend support for this product, as \nit has developed, in spite of the best efforts of those who worked on \nthe compromise. I commend them for their willingness to try to work \nthis out. It seems to me it falls far short of the kind of measure we \nshould be passing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, after I speak, my side will speak \nrelatively briefly: Senators Kyl, Thune, Coburn, and Senator Graham. I \nhave had some kind of Orwellian experiences in the Senate over the \nyears I have been here, but this one ranks up near the top in the word \n``bipartisanship'' that is being thrown around as far as this package \nis concerned, this $1.1 trillion package. Let's have no doubt about \nthat. There are 178 Members of the House of Representatives who are \nRepublicans. They all voted against the bill, plus 11 Democrats. There \nare 40 Republican Senators here. We now have two--count them, two--who \nhave decided behind closed doors, without consultation with the other \n38, to come to an agreement, which you can call a lot of things but \nbipartisan is not one of them, unless you say that two individuals and \npossibly a third, but no more than that, out of 40 are in agreement.\n  I have been involved in a lot of bipartisan legislation around here, \nbut I guarantee this is not bipartisan. So let's make sure we \nunderstand that to start with.\n\n  Second of all, let's talk about how much it costs. There has been a \nlot said about reduction in the cost. The fact is, they say it is $780 \nbillion. If you include the amendments that were already passed and are \ngoing to be included in this bill, it is now $827 billion. That is $7 \nbillion more than the House of Representatives passed, the debt service \nbeing $348 billion, bringing us to a total of $1.175 trillion. Then you \nadd that to, on Monday, the new Secretary of Treasury is going to \nannounce a new TARP--$500 billion, $1 trillion. Waiting in the House is \nanother Omnibus appropriations bill of $400 billion. We just spent $750 \nbillion--or are in the process of spending another $750 billion--in the \nform of TARP I and II. My goodness, it is a moment in history of \nspending the likes of which this Nation has never seen.\n  By the way, let's suppose it is only $827 billion we are going to \npass here. That only costs around, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office--and I urge every one of my colleagues to read it--on \nFebruary 4 they said the bill, as passed and proposed, would have \ncreated between 1.3 million and 3.9 million jobs. At $827 billion, if \nyou create 1.3 million jobs, that is $636,000 per job. If it creates \n3.9 million jobs, which is the high estimate of the Congressional \nBudget Office, then you now are only paying $212,000 per job.\n  So let's have no doubt. As to the elimination of unnecessary, \nwasteful projects, I have already submitted for the Record page after \npage after page of porkbarrel projects which were put in on a partisan \nbasis, not a bipartisan basis. Let's make sure we understand that.\n  Mr. President, there is $150 million for honey bee insurance. Some \nhave said: $150 million, $200 million, that is not much. Mr. President, \n$300 million to bring USDA facilities into workplace safety \ncompliance--the list goes on and on. This is a Christmas tree done by \nappropriators. And we proved when we tried to eliminate the earmarks \nthat there are three kinds of Senators in the Senate: Republicans, \nDemocrats, and appropriators.\n  The fact is, we turned down--although we got 44 votes--what would \nhave given us at least some shred of confidence that we will be \naddressing\n\n[[Page S1846]]\n\nthis terrible deficit we are laying on future generations of Americans, \nand that would have been a trigger that when we have two quarters of \nGDP growth, we would be on the automatic path to reducing spending and \nbringing us a balanced budget. That was rejected by this body. Why? Why \nin the world, once the economy recovers, wouldn't we want to put this \ncountry on the path to a balanced budget and stop laying--we have \nalready done $10 trillion. Now there are more trillions coming, not to \nmention Social Security and Medicare.\n  So let's have no doubt--let's have no doubt--this is not bipartisan. \nThis is two Republican Senators who decided to join after meetings \nbehind doors, in which almost all of the rest of us were not present. \nIt is as expensive or more expensive than the legislation passed by the \nHouse if you count the amendments that have already been passed, which \nwe are told would be included in this bill. There is no provision--\nthere is no provision--whatsoever, once our economy recovers, to \nsomehow begin to reduce this multitrillion-dollar debt we have laid on \nfuture generations of Americans. If this legislation is passed, it will \nbe a very bad day for America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, first, everyone understands we need to act to help \npeople who are hurting in this country, to try to create jobs and \nstimulate the economy. That is not the issue. The question is whether \nthe deal that has been struck here this afternoon is a solution to the \nproblem or whether it is still a wasteful and ineffective bill.\n  I wish to comment briefly on five quick things. First of all, it is a \nlittle hard to tell because we do not have text yet, but my staff has \njust reconfirmed the numbers, that as compared with the House-passed \nbill--which was described here this evening as a very bad bill--this \nbill would create a deficit of $827 billion; the House bill, $820 \nbillion. So it is $7 billion more in deficit spending than the House \nbill.\n  My colleague from Maine described this as a targeted approach \nbecause, of course, much of the spending they have tried to remove from \nthe bill is ordinarily handled through the regular appropriations \nprocess. They wanted that spending to be handled in the regular order \nthrough the Appropriations Committee, and therefore they are going to \ntarget things that should not be handled through that process. Then I \nheard described items like Pell grants. Now, we have a lot of Pell \ngrants, a lot of students who have benefited from Pell grants. They \nhave all benefited from Pell grants because the Appropriations \nCommittee has appropriated money for Pell grants, and we voted for that \nhere in the Senate. There has never been a stimulus bill to pass Pell \ngrants before. So if this is a targeted approach and we are going to \nhave $6 billion in there for Pell grants, there seems to be a \ncontradiction.\n  It was also indicated that this deal is better than the House bill \nbecause this will really stimulate the economy as opposed to the \napproach in the House bill. Then there was described items such as $6 \nbillion for special education. Well, once again, everybody is in favor \nof special education, but how does special education--$6 billion--\nstimulate the economy? I suppose you could say: Well, it at least \nenables us to hire more special education teachers. How long does it \ntake to educate a special education teacher? About 4 or 5 years in \ncollege? Hopefully, we are out of the recession by then.\n  There was a description of $87 billion in ``targeted increases'' in \nMedicaid. Well, it appears to be the very same amount of money that \ncame out of the Finance Committee--$87 billion for Medicaid. The CBO \nhas said that of this $87 billion, only $10.8 billion is targeted for \nMedicaid. The rest is, in effect, free cash for the States. This is not \na targeted approach at all.\n  Moreover, the committee--and I will see when we understand how this \nbill is actually written--provides a 27-month cliff. In other words, in \norder not to look as if it is spending too much money, it assumes that \nafter 27 months everybody will just be removed from the rolls. Well, I \ndefy my colleagues in this body, after a lot of people have been added \nto the Medicaid rolls, after 27 months to just inform them they are \ngoing to have to be removed because we did not provide the funding for \nit. Obviously, the program is going to be continued and the cost to the \nAmerican taxpayer will be much greater.\n  Finally, just to comment about working together, we all try to work \ntogether, and it is true that the American people want us to work \ntogether. But they do not want us to work together to waste a lot of \ntheir money. So the question still remains: Is the deal that was struck \ntoday a better deal in terms of wasting the public's money and being \neffective at stimulating economic growth? Certainly, the case was not \nmade in 45 minutes on the floor this evening.\n  I will be looking forward to the debate here after we have had a \nchance to read the bill, to understand why the proponents really think \nthis will be better, and we will be willing to debate that. In the \nmeantime, I remain convinced that we do need a targeted--a really \ntargeted--approach and that it needs to be aimed toward stimulating the \neconomy and creating jobs, just not spending more money.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, my colleagues have described it well, but \nwe all should remember what this is. This is still an $827 billion debt \nwe are handing off to future generations. This is the largest \nintergenerational transfer of debt in human history, and we spent 3 \ndays now--4 days, I guess, if you count today--debating it. I think the \nmanagers of the bill have been patient in allowing us to offer some of \nour amendments, but to suggest for a minute that the Republicans are \nslowing this down or that we have had way more than enough time to \ndebate this misses the point.\n  A trillion dollars--a trillion dollars--is something I think most of \nus have a hard time grasping. In fact, the borrowing amount that is \nincluded in this bill does represent the equivalent of what America as \na nation borrowed between the time of the Revolutionary War and the \nPresidency of Jimmy Carter. We borrowed $800 billion between the \nRevolutionary War and the Presidency of Jimmy Carter, and we are going \nto borrow that amount of money in one fell swoop from future \ngenerations with this bill.\n  Much has been said about the discussions in the last few days and how \nthis is going to be a ``bipartisan compromise,'' they are going to \nreduce the size of the bill. The irony in all this is that the bill as \nit came over from the House, as has already been noted by my \ncolleagues, was about $820 billion. The bill that we now have in front \nof us, the so-called compromise, is $827 billion. So it has not gotten \nsmaller coming from the House, it has gotten larger.\n  A lot of people have gotten up in the Chamber and complained about \nthe House bill and its dimensions and its size, and I think the \nAmerican people have picked up on that theme because everywhere you go, \nthey talk about this pork-laden bill that came out of the House, and \nsurely the Senate will do something to improve upon it to shrink it in \nsize and get rid of some of the wasteful spending, and yet here we are. \nWe have a so-called compromise, an agreement that is actually larger in \nsize and scope than the bill that came over from the House.\n  So make no mistake about it, we are borrowing this money from future \ngenerations. It is a larger amount of borrowing than was included in \nthe bill that left the House of Representatives. Frankly, we do not \nknow--because we have not seen it yet--about many of the provisions \nthat were included. Many of us have reacted and I think the American \npublic has reacted negatively to much of the wasteful spending that is \nincluded in the bill. We have all highlighted the things we think are \nextraneous and wasteful and do not stimulate the economy, do not grow \nthe economy, do not create jobs.\n  So we will have an opportunity, hopefully over the weekend, to take a \nlook at it and digest it a little bit. But I think it is fair to say, \nif at least you are talking about the overall macronumber, that this \nthing has not gotten any smaller; it has gotten bigger. I would bet by \nthe time we have analyzed this legislation closely, many of the new \nprograms that were created in the bill that was passed by the House and \nthe bill we were debating earlier in the week are continued, and a lot \nof the new programs that create\n\n[[Page S1847]]\n\nmandatory spending--not one-time spending--that are allegedly designed \nto stimulate the economy on a short-term, temporary basis but will have \nspending that is going to go on and on and on and is going to be a \nliability for generations to come.\n  So as we move toward perhaps a final vote on this at some time this \nweekend--and I suspect the votes are there--the other point I would \nmake--and make no mistake about this either--you cannot call this a \nbipartisan effort without redefining the word ``bipartisan.'' This came \nout of the House of Representatives without a single Republican vote. \nIn fact, 11 Democrats in the House voted against it. And here in the \nSenate, there will be two, perhaps at most three, Republicans who will \nvote for this. So out of 535 Members of Congress and some 220 or \nthereabouts Republicans in the Congress, to have 2 hardly qualifies \nthis particular effort as a bipartisan effort.\n  It went through the House quickly. Republicans were not given an \nopportunity over there to have impact or have amendments considered. We \nhave had some amendments here. Most of the amendments we have offered \nthat have tried to reduce the size of this thing and change some of the \nsubstance of it so it is more targeted, more focused, more focused on \njob creation--most of those amendments have been defeated. We are faced \ntoday with a bill that is actually larger than where we started when \nthis whole initiative got underway in the House of Representatives last \nweek.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope the American people, as they tune in to the \ndebate, will look very closely at this so-called compromise and give \nconsideration to how this is going to impact them and their family \nbudgets. We all know the statistics. We all know there are people who \nare hurting in this country, people who have lost their jobs. The \npeople who are going to be hurting the most, however, are the children \nand grandchildren whom we are going to be handing this debt to--a \ntrillion dollars in debt that we will be handing to our children and \nour grandchildren--and adding to already what has become a historic \nhigh level of debt for this country, so historic that it exceeds by \nalmost two times the average deficit to GDP of many of our allies in \nthe European Union. We are talking about enormous amounts of debt, \nenormous amounts of borrowing.\n  As my colleague from Arizona noted, the CBO estimates on job creation \nas few as 1.3 million jobs for over $800 billion in borrowing. What \ndoes that come down to on a per-job basis? Hundreds of thousands of \ndollars per job.\n  We can do this better. We can do it in a way that is responsible to \nthe next generation of Americans. I hope when this comes up for a final \nvote we will be able to defeat it. The American people will get engaged \nin this effort and let their Senators know how they feel. I believe \nwhen that happens, you will start seeing people change their minds \nabout the effort that is in front of us this evening.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and yield back the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I can't say I didn't expect that we would \nbe where we are tonight. But this country needs to know the way this \nbill we have been talking about, and probably the bill we are going to \nsee, is undoubtedly the largest generational theft bill in the history \nof mankind. When I say generational theft, I am not just talking about \nmoney. I am talking about opportunities and I am talking about futures.\n  There is nobody on this side of the aisle who doesn't want to do \nsomething to fix our economy and stimulate our economy. What this bill \ndoes--and the families who are listening to this right now, you ought \nto think: If you are one of those who are unemployed right now and \nhurting, $12,000 is going to be added to your debt once you get a job \nagain, for your family. If you are struggling out there, but you are \nholding on, we are going to steal $12,000 from you and your kids. Then \nthose of us who might be doing well, we are going to take $12,000 from \nyou, so maybe that is OK in a time such as this. But what is not OK is \nhow this bill is going to spend that money.\n  If you like how efficient the post office is that lost $3 billion \nthis year, and if you like the way the Federal Government works, wait \nuntil this money starts going through the Federal Government. If we \nhave $450 billion that is going to be in programs, 10 percent of it is \ngoing to get chewed up before it ever leaves Washington. Then, when it \ngets to your State to supposedly be a stimulus, another 10 percent of \nit is going to get chewed up. So we are going to lose $90 billion \nbecause we are going to decide to run it through the inefficient \nbureaucracies. I would ask: What does that stimulate? Federal workers \nare great, but they don't produce wealth, and the money ought to go \ninto job-creating exercises that create wealth. What is going to happen \nto your family? The question will be, What is going to happen if we \ndon't do anything? We are not proposing to do nothing.\n  There could be a true bipartisan solution to this, but that hasn't \nbeen offered. We have seen slow walked all day the inability to get \namendments. It is highly unlikely any other amendments will be offered.\n  I want my colleagues to think how can we best stimulate this economy, \nand how can we do no harm as we do that? This bill--this generational \ntheft bill--does tons of harm. Let me tell my colleagues the biggest \nharm it does. There is no guarantee this is going to work, especially \nwhen we haven't fixed the housing and mortgage system and we haven't \nfixed the liquidity issue. Here is the harm it does. Every State, save \nCalifornia and New York, will get more money out of this bill than \ntheir deficits are today--every State. We are going to transfer, by \nwhat we are doing here, a lack of fiscal responsibility to every State. \nWe have had Governors calling up here from all across this country \nsaying, You are going to send us a whole lot more money than we need. I \nhave legislators who are trying to spend money. They are slow walking \nme now, so I can't run this State and keep it fiscally sound. That is \ncoming from Democratic and Republican Governors alike. We are going to \ntransfer the incompetence of the Federal Government in Congress to \nevery State house in this country. Think about what we are doing with \n$12,000 per family.\n  One final point I will make. Barack Obama is my close personal \nfriend. One of the things he said is that we ought to get rid of the \nprograms that don't work. We ought to put metrics on the programs so we \ncan measure them, and then when we look at them we will know whether we \nare truly investing in an adequate way. We are blindly going to invest \nin things and there is not one iota in this bill or the House bill that \neliminates any of the $300 billion that we know is being wasted right \nnow and can be fully documented--not one attempt to do that. So if we \ncared about stimulating the economy and we cared about the future and \nwe cared about those who are having a hard time today, why wouldn't we \ndo the hard work to get rid of what doesn't work before we spend more \nmoney on things that don't work?\n  I would end with this. We got in trouble and we are in this mess \nbecause we spent money that we didn't have on things we didn't need. \nAnd the answer for Congress is to do more of the same. When we do more \nof the same, what we do is we mortgage--the only thing we are doing on \nmortgages is we are mortgaging our children's and grandchildren's \nfuture.\n  This body works on the power of 60, and it will happen, but the \nprecarious nature we find ourselves in today, the responsibility of \npassing this bill when most of it is not going to make a big \ndifference--not truly going to stimulate the economy--and claiming it \nis bipartisan when it is not, is going to leave a legacy that nobody \nwho votes for this bill is going to embrace.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, a couple of observations as we bring this \nnight to a close. I don't know what we are going to do after tonight.\n  I am asked to talk about an amendment that I have never seen. It has \nbeen described to me and things have been said about it that I need to \ntake exception to. Not the people. I know the people. I have been in a \nposition where being the odd guy out is tough. Joe Lieberman, by the \nway, has earned the right to do and say anything he\n\n[[Page S1848]]\n\never wants to do as far as I am concerned. When Joe stood up for what \nhe believed in Iraq, got in a primary, got beat and ran as an \nIndependent, he knew what was coming his way, and I love him to death. \nWhen Joe said there are no winners and losers tonight, I disagree. I \nthink the American people have lost a lot more than $820 billion.\n  What we have done is we have lost a young President's promise to \nchange things. That is not readily obvious. But that speech last \nnight--I am sure you are not, but if you are listening, think twice \nabout doing that again. There is a lot to be done in this country. \nClosing GTMO and moving the prisoners, I would like to help you. What \nare we going to do about Social Security and Medicare? I would like to \nhelp you. I hope you believe it is OK for me to be somewhat concerned \nabout the process here and how we wound up spending $1.1 trillion. \nPlease don't say this is change I can believe in. And please don't \nunderestimate how the public is pulling for you, but they don't like \nthis bill. Please don't overestimate your ability to persuade people \nbecause you are a very gifted orator. People are pulling for you. I am \npulling for you. But they are watching what you are doing and they are \nwatching what I am doing.\n  Here is what happened here. This bill started in the House with the \nattitude: We won, we write it. Not one Republican was able to vote for \nthe bill. Maybe it is us. Maybe we have so lost our way that we can't \nbe reasonable with anybody anymore. You can explain the 11 Democrats \nsomehow, but not only did you not get one Republican in the House, you \nlost 11 Democrats, and the more the American people saw what was in the \nbill, you lost them.\n  I am not your problem. The American people are not your problem. The \nproblem is the system we have been playing around with is broken, and \nour dear friends on the other side, you have reinforced everything bad \nabout it. You haven't fixed it. Who are we to criticize? I am not so \nsure we did a whole lot better, but we got a chance to start over. We \nare in the first month of the administration, and I have never been \nmore concerned about lost opportunity than I am tonight.\n  To my two friends who decided they had to find a compromise: I \nrespect you. I like you. But when you say this was the best we could \ndo, I disagree with you. This is not remotely close to what we could \nhave done if we would have sat down in a true bipartisan fashion and \nfound a better way. We could have come out with a bill that spent less, \nthat created jobs more efficiently, and would have built the confidence \nof the American people, but instead we have come out in our corners \nmore rigid than ever.\n  To say this is bipartisan is not quite fair. When Joe voted with us \nit wasn't bipartisan; it was us and Joe. You have two of my dear \nfriends believing they had to act. But the one thing I will tell them, \nthat is not a very good statement about the confidence you have in me. \nI believe we have to act too. So you must have felt that people like me \nare hopeless; you had to take all this on yourself and none of us would \nhave met you in the middle. There are at least a dozen to fifteen \nRepublicans who would have voted for a bill that did more than cut \ntaxes who would have spent money on infrastructure, who would have \nhelped the States, but most of us--all but two--could not tolerate this \nprocess, and at the end of the day we cannot tolerate the way this ship \nis shaped and how much it spends.\n\n  The second big loss is the future when it comes to acting together \nregarding the banking crisis and the housing crisis. We have in the \nname of a stimulus package spent over $1 trillion and the average cost, \nif there are 1.3 million jobs created, is $636,000 a job, and if we \nsomehow can create 4 million jobs, it is $212,051. People complain \nabout us being overpaid. I will take it: $212,000 a job. We can do \nbetter than that.\n  But here is what we have lost. Because this bill is not better, it is \nworse; because it is not bipartisan, it is the same old way of doing \nbusiness. Because it has been so politicized by a lot of people--and I \ndon't say I am not to blame--we now have lost more confidence. TARP I \nwas tough. TARP II was really tough. TARP III is going to be \nimpossible, and you are going to need TARP III. The administration is \nprobably going to come out Monday with a $500 billion or $600 billion \nrequest to help get this country through a crisis we haven't seen since \nthe Great Depression and they are going to tell us we need more money \nfor housing and we need to get credit flowing and $310 billion left in \nTARP is not enough.\n  The problem they are going to have and the problem I am going to have \nis that people are bailout weary, and they are so tired of us. They are \nso tired of us sitting up here in a matter of a couple of weeks trying \nto jam something through they don't understand and they don't like and \nthen, when it is over, trying to celebrate. There is nothing to \ncelebrate here. There are no bad guys, there are no good guys--men or \nwomen--but what we have lost is a great opportunity to start over. We \nhave sunk back into the swamp. We have spent more money than we should. \nHistory will not judge us well, and the hard part is yet to be done. We \nwill wake up tomorrow and we will try to figure out how to straighten \nout this mess. America somehow survives everything. I hope we can \nsurvive this. I believe we can.\n  I want to end on this note. I am not mad at anybody because I have \nbeen in this spot myself. I am deeply disappointed that we could not do \nbetter, because there is a big loser tonight, and that is the American \npeople.\n  I yield back.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I recognize the Senator from Nebraska for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, if you could give me an alert with about \na half a minute left, I would appreciate it.\n  I rise tonight to speak about the agreement that was announced within \nthe last hour or so. We have taken a lot of votes over the last few \ndays. In fact, I have had colleagues on both sides of the aisle say to \nme we have voted a lot on this bill. As I pointed out, I am new here, \nbut it sure seems as though we have. But the one thing that occurs to \nme is that in all of this debate, we are not going to vote for how to \npay for this bill. I want people to understand this bill is going to be \ntotally, completely financed with borrowed money.\n  The other thing we are not going to vote on any time is a plan for \nour future to pay for this bill and the other spending that seems to be \nheaded our way like a freight train. We are not going to cast that \nvote. We are asking a tremendous amount of our country to try to figure \nout a way to withstand that. The cost of this bill by any definition--I \ndon't care where you land in terms of what the ultimate costs are--is \nmind boggling. And because it is all financed, it will be well over $1 \ntrillion in spending. I listened to the testimony tonight, and so many \npeople I respect on both sides of the aisle got up and said we have to \ndo this now.\n\n  I wasn't in this body when TARP was passed, like so many others. I \nwas out on the campaign trail. But the same argument was made then: We \nhave to act now.\n  Mr. President, I have in front of me the bill that was put on my desk \nthis morning. It just goes on, page after page. It takes a lot of pages \nto spend $1 trillion. We have not seen the compromise yet. I heard \ntonight from the four speakers that we could get an idea what the \ncompromise was all about. We will have it. Somewhere in the next 48 \nhours, we are going to get a whole new plan--this compromise--and we \nare going to be asked to make an assessment on it and to go down there \nand cast our vote yes or no on $1 trillion worth of spending.\n  Let's slow down and take our time. Few things are going to be as \nimportant as this.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I know we all understand the seriousness \nof the moment, the seriousness of the situation our country is in. It \nis for that reason many of us, in goodwill, attempted to work together \nto try to improve upon the product that is this bill on the desk. As \nthe process went on, I felt as if I could no longer support the effort \nbecause it was not going in a direction I thought was prudent or useful \nto our effort. The fact is, in this bill we\n\n[[Page S1849]]\n\nnow have before us, we will have a bill that is larger than the House-\npassed bill. There is a point to be made that the stimulus ought to be \nsufficiently large to stimulate. My concern is it doesn't stimulate, \nand too much of what is contained in this bill--and now the substitute \nwhich will be even more expensive than the original bill or than the \nHouse bill--I am concerned we still do not do the kinds of expenditures \nthat are not part of an appropriations process but part of a stimulus \nprocess.\n  I wonder just how much of this bill will spend out in the next 2 \nyears and how much will spend out after that. The State of Florida is \nin dire need. We are going through the most difficult time I can \nremember in my adult life. Unemployment is almost double digits. Every \ncorner of the State is suffering from the foreclosure crisis. We do \nprecious little in that arena, which I understand to be something that \nis so desperately needed.\n  At the end of the day, we are going to be spending a lot of the \ntaxpayers' money with not too many other opportunities to get it right. \nWe cannot continue to spend at this level. So it is incumbent upon us \nto get it right. That is why I believed it was more important we get it \nright than we get it right now. Let's get it right. We got this today, \nand we will have the weekend or overnight to make our decisions on it.\n  I, frankly, commend those who worked together in a bipartisan \nfashion. I think we should try to do that. I just don't think there was \na good bipartisan construction of this bill that was done by the \nmajority, and it was too difficult for us to try to fix it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Ten minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield to the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator McCain for his leadership. Actually, I \nfelt strongly that his combination of substantial infrastructure and \ntargeted tax relief would have injected more strength into this economy \nthan the present bill, and with a cost of half of that. As we know, \nthis bill cost over $1.1 trillion. The bill itself is $827 billion, but \nwhen you add the $300 billion plus in interest, which the Congressional \nBudget Office adds to it for the 10-year budget window, you end up with \nan unprecedented amount of money--with far too little impact.\n  In fact, if you look at what our own Congressional Budget Office \ntells us--and who else can we rely on--hired by the Democratic \nmajority, they conclude that over a 10-year period--shouldn't we be \nthinking at least 10 years ahead? Senator Coburn says it will be on our \nchildren and grandchildren. But they conclude that the bill will have a \nnegative impact on the economy. Yes, it will help some in the short \nterm. Over the 10-year period, the drain of the interest and capital \ntaken out of the economy to fund this effort will actually weaken the \neconomy, and the total gross domestic product over that period of time \nwill be less than if we had no bill at all. That doesn't mean we should \nnot have a bill. What we should have is a bill from which we can get \nsome results.\n  I hope and I do believe the American people will continue to talk to \ntheir Congressmen and Senators; they will be sharing their thoughts \nwith them. My phones are ringing off the hook. They know you cannot get \nsomething for nothing and that debts have to be repaid. There is \nnothing mysterious about these fundamental principles. We act like they \nare not a reality. The CBO score points out what happens is when you \ntake money out of the future to put into today--or when you borrow it \nand put it into the economy today, it crowds out about a third of a \ndollar's worth of private domestic capital. That is the kind of thing \nthat weakens our potential to bounce back from this problem we are in. \nIt is real and it is serious and I certainly favor taking action.\n  Madam President, I thank the Chair. I am grieving tonight. Hopefully, \nthere will be an opportunity to do better than the bill before us now. \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, as we complete this part of the ongoing \neffort to address a truly terrible time in America's history, full of \neconomic difficulties and woes and sadness, we also face enormous \nchallenges abroad. Every time we see a news report, we see some new \nchallenge around the world.\n  I hope we also have learned from this experience that maybe it is \nbest to begin our discussions in addressing the challenges that face \nAmerica on a truly bipartisan basis, and that everybody be allowed to \nparticipate; that it be the input of both sides and all points of view, \nand that we can then reach consensus and go to the American people in a \nunited fashion.\n  The President of the United States, just a few days ago, said he \nbelieved we would pass this bill through the Senate with 80 votes or \nmore. That, obviously, is not going to happen. I argue it is because of \nthe way it began. People are saying: We won the election, so we will \nwrite the bill. They can do that, but I can assure my friends and \ncolleagues the American people want us to work together. They are tired \nof the bitter partisanship. That is one of the major reasons we have \nsuch low approval ratings from the American people.\n  So I hope we can, the next time--and there will be a next time \nbecause TARP III will be coming up, and we will be addressing national \nsecurity challenges, the Omnibus appropriations bill, and we will be \naddressing other issues. My urgent request to my colleagues is, let's \nnot say: We won so we wrote the bill. I am not saying that wasn't true \non this side of the aisle when we were victorious. Unfortunately, from \ntime to time, we were guilty of the hubris that goes with victory. But \nI hope all of us understand that, in the view of many, including this \nMember, the challenges we face are enormous, and the American people \nand the world deserve an approach where all of us are included in the \ntakeoff so that all of us will be included in the landing.\n  I have been on the Senate floor and I have not been in the \n``negotiations'' that went on. I think it has been a good debate on the \nfloor. There have been contributions from virtually every Member of \nthis body. I think the American people who have observed that probably \nlearned a lot from it. I hope next time we can show the American people \nwe have come together at the beginning and have a truly bipartisan \napproach to the challenges we face.\n  I wish to say also that I believe the majority leader has allowed a \nlarge number of amendments and vigorous debate. Also, I think the \nSenator from Montana has managed the bill in a respectful fashion. I \nhope we do better next time, Madam President.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, Senator Nelson has a few minutes left, but \nhe is not here. Before the Senator leaves the floor, I want to say that \nJohn McCain and I came to Washington together going on 27 years ago. He \nand I have done a number of things together, and we have had a number \nof things that we didn't do together. I know the strength of his \nfeelings. He has expressed them on this floor. I want everyone to \nunderstand how much I appreciate his leadership. The statement he gave \ntoday was a very positive statement. He talked about how we have had \nrobust debate and about how he didn't like the product we are coming up \nwith and that we can do better next time. So I just want my friend from \nArizona to know I appreciate his projection of authority and \nleadership, which I have watched for 27 years. Sometimes when he \nprojects that leadership, you don't want to be on the other end of it.\n  Tonight, I say I appreciate that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank my old friend, the majority \nleader, from our neighboring State. Sometimes, from time to time, all \nof us don't know how difficult his job is, but we appreciate it. I know \nthat comes from all of us.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S1850]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the pending amendments in the order \nspecified in this agreement; that prior to each vote, there be 2 \nminutes of debate prior to each vote; that the previous order regarding \nintervening amendments remain in effect; that the debate time be \nequally divided and controlled in the usual form; that after the first \nvote, the succeeding votes be 10 minutes in duration: Conrad-Graham No. \n501, as modified; Dodd No. 145, with a modification which is at the \ndesk; Grassley, 297; Enzi No. 293, as modified; Cantwell No. 274, as \nfurther modified; Vitter No. 107; Feinfold No. 485; Bunning No. 531; \nWyden No. 468; Thune No. 538; and Murray No. 110; that upon disposition \nof these amendments, the majority leader be recognized.\n  I would tell all members here, we are hopeful and confident that we \nwill not have to have recorded votes on all of those. We hope everybody \nwill be understanding. And if we have to have a vote, we will have one. \nWe would rather that we could work some of these out. The managers are \nwilling to accept a number of them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, there is one amendment on \nthere, and I do see the distinguished Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, \non the floor. I would object to a time agreement such as this, I would \nobject to any time agreement on it as it now stands. With the \nmodification, there is a major change in the privacy aspects of the \nmodification that comes under the jurisdiction of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. It is different than what we have proposed.\n  I would have no objection to the list, with the exception of the Enzi \namendment. I would wonder if it would be possible for the leader to get \nthe whole list and allow the Senator from Wyoming and I some time to \ntalk about his amendment. I say this only because the Senator from \nWyoming is on the floor. I would not have said this if he were not here \nand not able to respond.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, it was my understanding it had been worked \nout between the Senators, through the staffs, and that is the only \nreason we put that modification in. These are technical corrections, \nhoping to be able to have a usable Health IT bill when we finish.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I say to my friend, why do we not take \nthis one out of this tranche and see if this can be worked out while we \nare working through these other amendments.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I waited for 3 days to be able to make a \ntechnical correction amendment. Yes, I will agree to do that. I hope it \ndoes not get left out. I think without that amendment, the Health IT \nportion will not work. It is not anything about money, it is about \nhaving a portion that will or will not work.\n  Mr. REID. During these votes I say to my friend from Wyoming, the two \nmanagers and you and Senator Leahy can meet and get some staff to meet \nand work this out.\n  I would ask that the agreement I have suggested be approved, with the \nexception of 293; we will work on that during the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I hope \nI did not miss something, but I asked earlier several times today about \nan amendment, I believe 239, the E-Verify amendment that I think has \nbroad support.\n  But it keeps not getting on the list. So I am wondering what kind of \nassurance the leader could have, that if we are not on this list, what \nopportunity there will be to get a vote, and if there is a decided \nintention to deny a vote on this, it is something I feel very strongly \nabout and would have to resist, if I could.\n  Mr. REID. I would say to my friend from Alabama, there are a number \nof Senators who have amendments they would like to offer. The \nRepublican leader and I felt it was appropriate to get rid of these \nthat have been brought before the body. I have a number on this side \nthat are in the same standing as you, and we will have to work on \nthose. That is the best I can say.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, I thank the majority leader. I am very uneasy \nabout it. I am afraid this amendment, which I am confident would have \nan overwhelming vote, there may be some objections somewhere from \nhaving a chance to vote on it. So I withdraw my objection at this time \nand hope we can work on it.\n  Mr. REID. We do not know what it is. We have to take a look at it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It has to do with the people who get money, contracts \nunder this agreement who would have to use the E-Verify system to make \nminimal checks that the persons they hire are legally in this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. Reserving the right to object, I have to ask one additional \nquestion. My amendment would still be pending then?\n  Mr. REID. The answer is yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. But, Madam President, not in this batch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment No. 145, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 263, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n\n           general provisions--hope for homeowners amendments\n\n       Sec. 1201.  Section 257 of the National Housing Act (12 \n     U.S.C. 1715z-23), as amended by the Emergency Economic \n     Stabilization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-343), is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (e)(1)(B), by inserting after ``being \n     reset,'' the following: ``or has, due to a decrease in \n     income,'';\n       (2) in subsection (k)(2), by striking ``and the mortgagor'' \n     and all that follows through the end and inserting ``shall, \n     upon any sale or disposition of the property to which the \n     mortgage relates, be entitled to 25 percent of appreciation, \n     up to the appraised value of the home at the time when the \n     mortgage being refinanced under this section was originally \n     made.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary, \n     such sums as may be necessary to carry out this title.\n\n     SEC. 7005. SUNSET OF AUTHORITY.\n\n       The authority of the Secretary to provide assistance under \n     this title shall terminate on December 31, 2011.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 501, as Modified, to Amendment No. 98\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. \n501 offered by the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will take the time, since I do not see the Senator from \nSouth Carolina. I will say very simply, colleagues, this amendment is \ndesigned to help address the housing crisis by reallocating money from \nlesser priority areas to the FDIC mortgage foreclosure mitigation plan.\n  Sheila Bair, the head of the FDIC, has written us and said to us, if \nthis amendment is passed, it will prevent 1.5 million American homes \nfrom being foreclosed on. It is paid for. This is critically important \nto economic recovery. Virtually every economist has told us if this is \nnot dealt with, the housing crisis, and dealt with effectively, we \ncannot expect economic recovery.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n\n[[Page S1852]]\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise in opposition to this amendment \nfor one very simple reason. The Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, the \nSenator from Florida, Mr. Martinez, have the identical amendment coming \nup next, but instead of taking the money out of this proposal, it takes \nthe money out of the TARP where it belongs.\n  This is a proposal related to housing, related to the economic \ncrisis. This week the President will announce a TARP proposal, where he \nwill send to us a letter, where $50 to $100 billion will be used for \nhousing. The amendment of the Senator from Connecticut will do that.\n  I ask my colleagues, if this is a worthy cause, which it is, would we \nrather take the money out of this proposal--where we are fighting for \nevery nickel? We have different views. Some want more tax cuts, some \nwant more spending--when we can take it out of the TARP where the money \notherwise would go to the large banks and others. And we are not happy \nwith where the money went.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would like 30 seconds on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. There are about $20 billion in this amendment of cuts \nwhich complicate the package that has been agreed to. For that reason \nalone, in addition to the reasons already mentioned, I think it is \ngoing to be highly imprudent to adopt this amendment. It would throw a \nmonkey wrench into the agreement that has been reached earlier today.\n  For that reason, I also urge that the amendment not be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire (Mr. Gregg) and the Senator from Texas (Mrs. \nHutchison).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 39, nays 57, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 53 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--39\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dorgan\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Specter\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--57\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Bunning\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Collins\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Gregg\n     Hutchison\n     Kennedy\n  The amendment (No. 501), as modified, was rejected.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. \n145, as modified, offered by the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I will take part of the 1 minute and then \noffer time to my colleague from Florida, who is my cosponsor on this \namendment, Senator Martinez, to quickly address the amendment.\n  This amendment is the response to how we ought to deal with the \nforeclosure mitigation issue. We require in this amendment that $50 \nbillion of the second tranche of the TARP money be dedicated to \nforeclosure mitigation as well as some modifications of the HOPE for \nHomeowners Act.\n  The third part--I want to commend my colleague from Florida--is a \nvery solid and wise suggestion he made dealing with services, and I \nyield to him to explain his part of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, this part of the amendment simply goes \nat the servicers, the private servicers who are now part of the GSEs. \nThey hold about 15 percent of the mortgages, but they are about 50 \npercent of the foreclosures. These folks will now be incentivized to \nmake workouts with the homeowners to keep them in their homes; further, \nthey will also be given a safe harbor so they are not subject to \nlitigation. With that incentive, we believe the private servicers will \nbegin to do the kinds of workouts that are necessary to keep people in \ntheir homes and avoid foreclosures.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I commend my colleague for his very wise \nsuggestion to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I suggest we vote on this amendment by \nvoice.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, did the Chair say ``in opposition''?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, may I ask the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut: It was my understanding that all TARP funding was to be \nused for things the taxpayer would get back. In other words, these were \nsupposed to be investments for which the taxpayers knew they would get \n100 percent of their money back and more. So to use this money, is this \nnot taking away from the very essence of what TARP was to be used for \nand now spending money we know the taxpayers will never get back?\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, if I could have 30 seconds to respond?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Taxpayers not losing their homes is preserving something--\nnot getting something back, No. 1. No. 2, when we wrote the original \nlegislation in September, there were four requirements that we expected \nof the TARP funds, one of which was foreclosure mitigation. \nRegrettably, nothing was done at all about it. Not a nickel was spent \non foreclosure mitigation. We are merely fulfilling the obligation we \nagreed to when the TARP legislation was adopted on October 1.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I will accept a voice vote at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified.\n  The amendment (No. 145), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 297\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on amendment No. 297, offered by the Senator from Iowa, Mr. \nGrassley.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, this amendment is a very simple vote. \nThe complex funding formula for spending the $87 billion in Medicare in \nthis bill is not fair. It should be a flat increase to all States. That \nis the way we have done it in the past, and that is what my amendment \ndoes now. Thirty-four States do better with the formula\n\n[[Page S1853]]\n\nunder my amendment. So this is a vote to give your State its fair share \nor not, as you choose. I believe there are 65 Members in the Senate \nhere today whose States do better under my amendment, and if you do not \nknow how your State does--although I put it in the Record this \nafternoon--come to me before you cast your vote and I will show you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I strongly oppose this amendment \nand hope it will be defeated. Yes, the State of West Virginia would do \n117 percent better because of the across-the-board funding under \nMedicaid, but that means in the future, if we have some kind of a \nfurther recession, we get no special help. We want to have special \nmoney set aside that is used for States that have special needs, \nspecial poverty, special unemployment, and special hurt. That is the \npoint of Medicaid, to be flexible and to react to the needs of the \npeople.\n  I hope this amendment will be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. \n274, as modified, offered by the Senator from Washington, Ms. Cantwell.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I thank my cosponsors of this \namendment, Senator Hatch, Senator Bingaman, Senator Stabenow, Senator \nAlexander, Senator Snowe, Senator Kerry, Senator Carper, and Senator \nSchumer. What this amendment does is make an investment in not only \nstimulative activity for construction, engineering, and manufacturing \njobs now, but it also makes an investment in our future in electric \nplug-in vehicles by making sure we create the right incentives for \ninvestment in that kind of manufacturing.\n  The United States right now leads in R on battery technology and \ncomponents, but we have zero manufacturing--zero. The Chinese have \n250,000 people in manufacturing and battery technology and over 150 \npartners. If we are going to create economic opportunity now, this is \nthe amendment to do that and create jobs for the future in getting us \noff of our foreign dependence on oil.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, the amendment No. 274 would reduce the \nefficiency credit by $1.8 billion--that is almost half the tax benefit \nfor these energy efficient home improvements.\n  The principal defect of this change will be felt in the emerging \nhigh-energy efficiency market. As anyone with conventional windows in \nthis cold winter knows, inefficient windows suck a lot of heat out of a \nhome.\n  Moreover, the tax benefit shifts, in part, to electric plug-in \nmotorcycles, three wheelers, and golf carts.\n  Does this make sense?\n  However, there are a couple provisions I am glad to see are included. \nFor instance, I am glad to see that the depreciation schedule for smart \nmeters was cut from 10 to 5 years. Also, I am glad to see that \nbusinesses that make real plug-in electric cars--I don't support it for \nthose that make golf carts, three wheelers, or motorcycles--can expense \nmanufacturing facilities that make these cars.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Washington \nwho is committed to improving our environment and our energy \nefficiency. I have great hopes for hybrid automobiles. However, I urge \nmy colleagues on this day when we are passing so much on this bill and \ngoing around our committees to not support the amendment.\n  I note that I wrote earlier in the year and hope to receive a \nresponse soon from the Department of Energy to do a study on hybrids, \ndiesel, ethanol, and other methods for both environment and efficiency. \nOur committees have been having hearings. This would choose one \ntechnology. It would have a cost of about $8 billion for the subsidies \nwhich are 10 percent of a vehicle's cost. I would say I favor moving \nforward, but I think it is premature. So I raise a point of order that \nthe pending amendment violates section 201 of S. Con. Res. 21, the \nconcurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2008.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, the amendment is paid for, but \npursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I move \nto waive the applicable sections of that act for purposes of the \npending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this be a \n10-minute vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

For the Senators who did not hear, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Murray amendment No. 110 be withdrawn and the Feingold \namendment No. 485 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I object simply for this reason: Can we go in \nthe order we agreed to? People are confused when we bounce around. If \nwe can go in the order on the list, then I don't think we will be \nconfused.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 107\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, am I correct that the Vitter amendment No. \n107 is the next amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. Under the previous order, \nthere is 2 minutes equally divided on amendment No. 107 offered by the \nSenator from Louisiana, Mr. Vitter.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple and \nstraightforward. It would prohibit ACORN from receiving funds under \nthis bill, including the Neighborhood Stabilization Program. We did \nthat in the housing bill last year. We made that change, as we should \nhave. We should do that in this bill in light of two things: No. 1, a \nlot of ACORN's activities in this area are to encourage things such as \nsubprime mortgages which have led to problems. No. 2, ACORN has been \nguilty of massive voter registration fraud and politicization of their \nactivities.\n  I encourage everyone to support this commonsense amendment which \nmirrors what we did in the housing bill last year.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. \nThis Senator from Louisiana is asking us to prohibit funding for one \norganization in America, ACORN. It exists in 110 different cities.\n  What kind of work does it do? Mortgage counseling, weatherization, \nearned-income tax credit, and volunteer work. In fact, after Hurricane \nKatrina in Louisiana, hundreds of ACORN volunteers went to the home \nState of the Senator offering this amendment and literally helped \nrehabilitate 3,500 homes. This is the show of gratitude they receive \nfor helping him in his home State.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. It is unnecessary. Any \nwork they do they will have to compete for under an amendment \npreviously offered and accepted. Please vote no on the Vitter \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. VITTER. I yield back my time. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wanted to give everyone an idea of the \nschedule. We are having a difficult time finishing this business before \nmidnight. That being the case, we will file cloture likely after \nmidnight. And that being the case, in case anyone has forgotten, \ntomorrow is Saturday, which would mean we would have a cloture vote \nMonday morning sometime.\n  Now, we will be happy to work with the Republicans to determine what \ntime we get to an end game on this legislation, but at this stage it \nappears that we will not have anything here on Sunday. And tomorrow, if \npeople want--and I have spoken to a number of my colleagues on this \nside of the aisle--there will be some time for debate. So tomorrow, \ntentatively what we will do is, we will be in session from 11 a.m. to 3 \np.m.--2 hours for the majority, 2 hours for the minority. The one side \nwill talk about how good the bill is, and the other will be talking \nabout how close to being good the bill is.\n  So we will do that tomorrow, and I will work with Senator McConnell \nto find out how we get toward the end process. I remind everyone that \nwe will want to get this done as early as we can next week so that we \ncan have the Presidents Day recess. Each time we run into a procedural \nroadblock, it makes it very difficult.\n  I think tonight we only have a couple more amendments. We have two or \nthree more votes tonight, but no one needs to take any extra time or \nstop us from doing some of the withdrawals, because I have acknowledged \nit will be past midnight, so there is no need to worry about that.\n  I think I have explained things about as well as I can. As to what we \nare going to do Monday and a time for that, I will work with Senator \nMcConnell during the next couple of votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes equally divided prior to the vote in relation to amendment No. \n531 offered by the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Bunning.\n  The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, over 30 years ago, in 1976, Russell Long \nstood right here where we are today and voted for legislation that set \nthe capital loss limit at $3,000. President Gerald Ford signed the bill \ninto law. That was a long time ago, and Senator Long and President Ford \nare both gone.\n  What is the legacy we will leave for future generations? The bill we \nare considering today will pile a staggering amount of debt on their \nshoulders--more than $1 trillion. But let's at least do some good here. \nAt a time when the stock market is down 40 percent from its highs, when \n$7.5 trillion in paper wealth has been destroyed, there is a crying \nneed to update the 30-year capital loss limit. We have a rare \nopportunity to fix a longstanding problem with the Tax Code at a time \nwhen economists say the change is also good policy.\n  It will stimulate the economy by encouraging private risk taking. \nWhen investors take risks, the economy expands, and the fear we are \nexperiencing will be dispelled.\n  I urge you to vote for the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment increases the amount of \ncapital losses that could be used to offset ordinary income from $3,000 \nto $15,000 at a cost of probably about $11 billion over 10 years. I do \nthink perhaps the capital loss provision applied to income should be \nincreased at some point, but this is too much of an increase. From \n$3,000 to $15,000 is too much of a leap. I think, therefore, we should \nnot support this amendment. I urge we vote against this amendment.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Senators of both parties have worked hard \nto limit the costs of the economic recovery legislation. This \nbipartisan amendment that I offer with Senator Snowe and Senator \nLincoln will, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, reduce the \ncost of this bill by $3.2 billion.\n  This amendment provides a way to quickly return to taxpayers a \nsubstantial portion of the money that was recently paid out in \nexcessive bonuses to companies under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. \nOur people were horrified to learn that Citigroup and others that had \nreceived extensive Federal support had paid out billions of dollars in \nexcessive bonuses. This amendment makes it clear that it is not enough \nto say the excessive bonuses are wrong; it requires that companies pay \nthose bonuses back to our taxpayers. The amendment gives the companies \na choice: Pay back the cash portion of any bonus paid in excess of \n$120,000 or pay an excise tax of 35 percent.\n  This is a bipartisan amendment. I urge my colleagues to accept it on \na voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there debate in opposition? Is all time \nyielded back?\n  Mr. COBURN. I yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. All time \nis yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 468) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 538\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. \n538, offered by the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Thune.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, there are two ways to stimulate the economy \nwith a trillion dollars. One is to have the Government do it. The other \nis to have the American people do it. We are going to spend $1 \ntrillion. Seventy percent of our gross domestic product is in the form \nof consumer spending. What better way than to give consumers' dollars \nback into their hands and allow them to stimulate the economy. If we \nare going to borrow a trillion dollars from our children and \ngrandchildren, let's at least do it in a way that helps American \nfamilies.\n  Under my amendment, if you are someone who makes under $250,000 a \nyear, you are going to be eligible for a check in the amount of $5,143. \nIf you are a married couple filing jointly, you are going to be \neligible for a check for $10,286. Anybody who files a tax return is \ngoing to be eligible for a rebate in that amount. I think this is a way \nto provide real stimulus to the American economy, and I urge my \ncolleagues to adopt this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is now a sufficient second. The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I urge Members not to adopt this \namendment. It strikes the entire underlying bill, and it replaces it \nwith a tax cut for all Americans, except at least 8 million Americans \nwho do not file. This rebate will go to filers. There are about 8 \nmillion Americans, at least, who do not file income tax returns; they \npay payroll taxes, many of them.\n\n[[Page S1856]]\n\n  Under the underlying bill, the rebate goes to people who work and pay \npayroll taxes. Under the Thune amendment, it only goes to people who \npay income taxes, not payroll taxes. At least 8 million people would \nnot get the benefit of this rebate. It strikes the whole underlying \nbill. So I urge it not be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while we have everyone's attention, we all \nrecognize this has been a long, rough week. We have had 46 amendments \nthat have been offered. We have had 19 amendments that have been agreed \nto; 25 or so have been voted on. So we have done a lot of work.\n  We are going to come in tomorrow, from noon until 3 o'clock. The time \nwill be evenly divided for people to talk about the legislation that is \nbefore us. We had more time than that, but some of the people who were \nwanting to speak have fallen off.\n  I am working now with the Republican leader. I think what we are \ngoing to do is come in about 1 o'clock on Monday. We do not have this \nfirmed up. We will do a consent before the evening is over. We will \ncome in Monday at 1 o'clock, have debate until 5:30, have a cloture \nvote at 5:30.\n  At noon on Tuesday, we will have, the way things now are, we will \nhave a budget point of order. If we get 60 votes on that, that will be \nthe end of this matter, and we can start going to conference \nimmediately.\n  The House is coming in Monday to start the conference process. And I \nsay to everyone here, we are going to do our utmost to have a \nconference. It is something we have not done very often here in recent \nyears. But we are going to try to get in the habit of doing \nconferences. I hope I have answered at least the broad outline.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask a question of the majority leader. \nI had an amendment that would simply require those who get contracts to \nbuild infrastructure, that they would use the E-Verify system to \ndetermine whether a person is using a valid Social Security number. It \nis a proven system; 2,000 businesses are voluntarily signing up each \nweek.\n  So I would hope we get a vote on that. Am I now being told we will \nnot be able to vote on that amendment? I hate to object.\n  Mr. REID. I have not asked for any unanimous consent. I would \nsuggest, during this vote, you could talk to the manager of this bill. \nI did not ask for any consent.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the majority leader. I know he has a million \nthings to worry about. But it is an important matter. I would be very \ndisappointed if we did not get a chance to vote on this.\n  Mr. REID. We had, as I indicated, 450 amendments filed. We are trying \nto be as fair to everyone as we can.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I raise a pay-go budget point of order \nagainst the Thune amendment.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I would ask to waive the applicable point \nof order, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire (Mr. Gregg) and the Senator from Texas (Mrs. \nHutchison).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding athlete from my home State of Kentucky, Joe Blanton, who \nwas a pitcher for the Philadelphia Phillies 2008 World Series \nChampionship team.\n  Blanton, who played baseball at Edmonson County High School in \nBrownsville, KY continued his baseball career in the Commonwealth by \nplaying for the University of Kentucky. He was drafted by the Oakland \nAthletics after college and was traded to the Phillies during the All-\nStar break this past summer.\n  Recently, the Daily News in Bowling Green, KY, published an article \ndetailing Mr. Blanton's journey and accomplishments. I will ask to have \nthe full article printed in the Record.\n  I also ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Joe Blanton for his \naccomplishments in the 2008 Major League Baseball postseason. Kentucky \nis proud of his success, and we look forward to seeing more of his \nprodigious athletic talent on the baseball diamond in the years ahead.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the article to which I \nreferred printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Daily News, Jan. 24, 2009]\n\n   Blanton's Day in Brownsville: Edmonson County Honors World Series \n                            Champion Pitcher\n\n                          (By Micheal Compton)\n\n       It's been an offseason to remember for Joe Blanton.\n       Traded from the Oakland A's to the Philadelphia Phillies in \n     July, Blanton became a key member of a Philadelphia team that \n     celebrated its first World Series championship since 1980 by \n     beating the Tampa Bay Rays in five games in October.\n       Blanton was honored Saturday at Edmonson County High \n     School, where he pitched until 1998, getting his jersey \n     retired in front of family, college coach and Edmonson County \n     alum Keith Madison and several hundred fans.\n       Blanton, who signed autographs and took pictures with fans, \n     said his participation in the fundraiser for the ECHS \n     baseball program was his way of giving back to a community \n     that gave him so much as a young man.\n       ``This is kind of a little way that I hope I can help (the \n     Edmonson County baseball program) a little bit, to make it \n     easier on them and give them a few nice things here and \n     there,'' Blanton said.\n       Edmonson County coach Clint Clark said Saturday's event has \n     been in the works since August. But once Blanton won the \n     World Series with the Phillies in October, the process sped \n     up.\n       ``What Joseph means to this community, words can't \n     describe,'' Clark said. ``By bringing him home and honoring \n     Joseph and having (former University of Kentucky) coach \n     Madison back to be a part of it, we wanted to be able to \n     bring back the tradition here at Edmonson County.''\n       2008 was a year of highs and lows for Blanton, culminating \n     in a World Series performance that included one of the most \n     memorable moments in baseball history.\n       ``It's been a ride,'' Blanton said. ``When you get traded, \n     it is definitely weird. It always shocks you a little bit. I \n     didn't know anybody (in Philadelphia), any of the coaches, \n     but it seemed to work out pretty good for me.''\n\n[[Page S1860]]\n\n       Blanton started the season 5-12 with the A's, but during \n     the All-Star break he was traded from the organization that \n     drafted him in the first round in 2002. In joining the \n     Phillies, Blanton was thrust into the National League pennant \n     race.\n       Blanton went 4-0 in 13 starts for Philadelphia, helping the \n     Phillies win the NL's East Division. He pitched the decisive \n     Game 4 in the NL Division Series against Milwaukee, allowing \n     one run and five hits in six innings against a Brewers' \n     lineup that included former Greenwood High School star Corey \n     Hart.\n       ``That was awesome getting to face somebody from the area--\n     somebody I got to play with in summer ball,'' Blanton said. \n     ``We played together with the Kentucky Colonels. That's real \n     nice to see somebody else from here have success like he has \n     had the last couple of years.''\n       Blanton got a no decision in his lone NL Championship \n     Series start against the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n       He saved his best game for last, going six innings and \n     allowing two runs in a 10-2 victory that helped the Phillies \n     take a 3-1 lead in the World Series.\n       But it was Blanton's fifth-inning at-bat that will forever \n     be remembered--a solo home run to left field that Blanton \n     said was his first since 1999, when he played for Franklin-\n     Simpson High School. Blanton's shot was the first World \n     Series home run by a pitcher in 34 years.\n       ``It's what you dream about as a kid when you're in the \n     backyard playing Wiffleball with your buddies or your dad is \n     throwing you batting practice,'' Blanton said. ``You are \n     always taking that last swing like it's Game 7 of the World \n     Series. Mine wasn't Game 7, but it couldn't have been much \n     better if it was. I think other than maybe throwing a no-\n     hitter or something, I wouldn't trade it for anything else.''\n       Three nights later, Blanton charged the mound with his \n     teammates, celebrating a world title.\n       ``It still gives me chills just thinking about it,'' \n     Blanton said. ``There's really not another feeling like it in \n     sports. It's the ultimate team accomplishment. Just having \n     the dogpile on the field, knowing no one in baseball is \n     better than you, it is really hard to put into words. It \n     feels good to be able to accomplish that.''\n       While the World Series title was a life-altering \n     experience, Blanton insists he hasn't changed.\n       ``I'm still the same,'' Blanton said. ``I think if anything \n     changed, it's getting (to the World Series) made me respect \n     it a lot more. I played with a guy, Jamie Moyer, who I think \n     last year was his 22nd year in the majors and that was his \n     first World Series. That shows you how hard it can be to make \n     it and win it.''\n       And Blanton, who recently signed a one-year, $5.475 million \n     deal with Philadelphia, is determined to work just as hard to \n     help the Phillies defend their title.\n       ``I feel like we have a great team coming back,'' Blanton \n     said. ``We have a solid lineup and a great bullpen. I feel \n     like we have a great starting staff and all the components \n     that it takes to win. We're not a one-dimensional team, and \n     we have a great clubhouse and coaching staff on top of it.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/06/senate-section/article/S1860-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1860-S1861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             COMMITTEE ON INDIAN AFFAIRS RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Kennedy once \nagain in the introduction of this important legislation. The bill that \nwe introduce today will correct the Supreme Court's decision in Riegel \nv. Medtronic, which misconstrued the intent of Congress and cut off \naccess to our Nation's courts for citizens injured or killed by \ndefective medical devices.\n  Last year, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a series of hearings \nto examine the way in which the Supreme Court's decisions in the areas \nof retirement benefits, consumer product safety, workplace \ndiscrimination, and personal finance have consistently trended against \nthe rights of consumers and in favor of big business. In many cases \nthat have profound effects on the lives of ordinary Americans, the \nCourt has either ignored the intent of Congress, deferred to corporate \ninterests, or sided with a Federal agency's flawed interpretation of a \ncongressional statute's preemptive force to disadvantage consumers. The \nimpact of the decisions that were the focus of those hearings continue \nto be felt by Americans today, whether they are prohibited from seeking \nredress in the courts for an injury caused by a defective product, \npaying exorbitant credit card interest rates and fees with no relief \nfrom the laws of their own state, or subjected to the unscrupulous \npractices of some in the mortgage lending industry.\n  These hearings raised awareness in Congress, and among Americans, \nabout the impact the Supreme Court has on our everyday lives. I am \nespecially proud that following on these hearings, and through the \nefforts of a determined and principled congressional majority, we \nwitnessed our constitutional democracy at work when President Obama \nsigned the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. And I am heartened that \nCongress reclaimed the intent of its original legislation and overrode \nthe Supreme Court to restore the rights of Americans to be free from \ndiscrimination in the workplace.\n  The bill we introduce today is another important step to correct an \nerroneous reading by the Court of Congress' intent in enacting the \nmedical device amendments of 1976. This legislation will make explicit \nthat the preemption clause in the medical device amendments upon which \nthe Court relied does not, and never was intended to, preempt the \ncommon law claims of consumers injured by a federally approved medical \ndevice.\n  The extraordinary power to preempt State law and regulation lies with \nCongress alone. Where the Court reaches to the extent it did in the \nRiegel decision to find Federal preemption contrary to what Congress \nintended, Congress is compelled to act, just as it was in the case of \nLilly Ledbetter. I hope all Senators will join us in this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/06/senate-section/article/S1861-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1861-S1862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The bicycle is a very big part of the answer to high gas \n     prices and so many more problems that Idahoans face. The use \n     of bicycles reduces demand for fossil fuels. If demand goes \n     down, prices will follow downward. Furthermore, increased use \n     of bicycles puts no pollutants into the air that we and \n     future generations breathe. Use of bicycles promotes better \n     health by adding consistent daily exercise to our daily lives \n     and will lead to a slimmer, healthier and better quality of \n     life for all Americans. Better health leads to lower demand \n     on our health care system also.\n       I urge you to please support increased bicycle friendly \n     infrastructure in our transportation system for all the right \n     reasons, only a few of which I have listed here today.\n     Andrew, Mountain Home.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a pastor in Caldwell and have found that the elevating \n     fuel costs have made it where I have to spend my day deciding \n     whether or not I will visit people in my congregation. The \n     sick, the hospitalized, the elderly, the families that are \n     feeling the impact of all this . . . it all rolls down to \n     making a decision, ``Can I afford to go and see them?'' It is \n     a sad thing. Because when I make the decision to go and see \n     them, I impact my family as well. But they need to be \n     visited. So I go. Please Senator, do what you can to help us \n     Idahoans enjoy the quality of life without having to worry \n     about the cost of life. God bless,\n     Troy, Caldwell.\n                                  ____\n\n       You asked a good question. And I thank you for doing so.\n       How have high energy prices affected our lives?\n       We have been fortunate that the high price of fuel is \n     merely an inconvenience and not a devastating disturbance in \n     our lives. We have also planned wisely for this and are \n     careful with our fuel consumption. We drive small commutes \n     and patronize businesses in our immediate area. We have made \n     good choices and take responsibility for our actions. We do \n     not play victim to political arm-wrestling.\n       I agree with a previous response: ``I think that the high \n     prices for gas/diesel that we're experiencing are a necessary \n     evil. It is time for this entire country, but our politicians \n     in Washington . . . to wake up & realize that the amount of \n     petroleum on this planet based is finite. The current problem \n     with prices should not be dealt with by some . . . Band-\n     Aid.'' In other words, Idahoans need to wake up and realize \n     that high fuel prices are not a sign of the times--they are \n     here to stay and it is time to start thinking like the rest \n     of the world when it comes to fuel consumption. Americans \n     (and Idahoans) need to scale down vehicles, increase mpg, \n     turn necessary travel into opportunities to be active \n     (walking, riding a bicycle, etc.) and look into mass \n     transit. Duh. Why are we so slow to welcome these \n     alternatives?\n       I think Idahoans should be given an annual tax credit for \n     operating vehicles that get more than 20 mpg and/or for \n     limiting miles traveled. It is time Idahoans start thinking \n     globally and not just selfishly when it comes to \n     transportation. Vehicles are for function only; they are not \n     for status. I am shocked by how many Idahoans still think big \n     trucks and big wheels are some kind of status symbol. To \n     educated, environmentally conscious Idahoans it just spells \n     ignorance. And in our beautiful valley, as the smog \n     increases, these people are completely unaware or uncaring of \n     what their egos are doing to our air quality. I have three \n     small children, two with asthma. The depletion of our air \n     quality often leaves us trapped indoors. As their mother this \n     makes me sad and frustrated and as a life-long Boise citizen \n     who never experienced these ``red alerts'' growing up, this \n     makes me furious.\n       Please Senator Crapo, ask your fellow Idahoans to think \n     globally, act locally and give them financial incentive to do \n     so. Right now.\n     Jacqui, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I would like to share my story about the effects of gas \n     prices on my life. I believe that prices are affecting \n     businesses all around so that there is less employment \n     available. I know they have an effect on the economy; so many \n     people are cutting down on their expenses. I had one job \n     where I was required to sell a product to customers. When I \n     was talking to people who were already having financial \n     difficulties I could not feel very good about adding another \n     financial burden on them. Because of a scarcity in decent \n     jobs around here, I have not been able to come up with a \n     decent enough income to be able to buy a car. I have also \n     felt persuaded away from wanting to buy a car because the gas \n     prices are so high.\n       There are several solutions to the problems of the oil \n     crisis and inflation in the economy.\n\n[[Page S1862]]\n\n     I have heard that we have stores of our own oil here in the \n     U.S. which we should take advantage of. The idea of hydrogen \n     powered cars could also be a good solution. Nuclear power is \n     very efficient, and it is as safe and clean as many other \n     energy sources we are using. Whether we used nuclear power \n     for energy in our cities, or if we used it in our \n     transportation such as cars and airplanes, it would be a wise \n     move. I know there are energy sources that we are not taking \n     advantage of, but we should be. Let us fix these problems.\n     Jordi, Shelley.\n                                  ____\n\n       I read where you are asking input from Idahoans on how the \n     high energy costs are affecting us. To put it simply, I am \n     going broke.\n       Everything has gone up. My gas bill has gone up 100 \n     percent. Groceries have gone up 40 percent. I cannot \n     calculate how much other prices have gone up but they have. \n     Every month I have less and less. And unlike some people, I \n     cannot vote myself a pay raise.\n       I do agree with drilling for oil now off the coast and in \n     Alaska. People need to know that China wants to drill for oil \n     some 60 miles off of our coasts. I hear we have enough oil to \n     be rid of the Arabs and other hostile countries for at least \n     30 years. By then we can have alternatives to oil. People say \n     it will take seven years to start drilling for oil if we lift \n     the ban now. Well, if we don't how high will oil be in seven \n     years? What on earth will our economy and national security \n     will be like in seven years?\n       I read where Japan has a car that runs on water. On Fox \n     News they did a story on a fellow by the name of Denny Klein \n     (?) who invented a new process for splitting water into \n     hydrogen and is running his car off of it. He supposedly has \n     a contract with the Department of Defense. I asked Congress \n     if this was so but no one will answer for me.\n       I do not believe that corn for fuel is the right thing to \n     do. It takes one and a half times as much energy to produce \n     it and it gets about one-third less in gas mileage. Now who \n     wants that? It is like when the Mars Company made a candy bar \n     that was smaller and cost more and said it is what the \n     customer wants. What the heck? Also, you know corn for fuel \n     will compete with corn for food, as will growing other \n     crops for fuel instead of food. If the competition for \n     food and land does not drive up the cost, the government's \n     mandate and subsidies will.\n       I believe we need more nuclear power plants. There are a \n     number of designs out there that are proven and are cheap. I \n     believe DuPont has come up with a cheap, reliable design, or \n     perhaps Westinghouse. Even Japan has offered the cheap design \n     they have. However, true to our government's way of doing \n     business, DOE will hear nothing of it. DOE is determined to \n     reinvent the wheel. I do know that DOE has turned down \n     outside jobs at the INL. I say get DOE out of the picture and \n     let the private sector do what it does best. And if it is \n     shown that our own oil companies are doing what the Arabs are \n     doing (artificially manipulating the market) then nail them \n     to the wall. Last year Idaho kept asking why is it that \n     Idahoans have to pay more for gas than other states. At first \n     the oil executives touted ``supply and demand.'' Blah blah. \n     Later they flat out admitted that the cost of gas in Idaho \n     was higher because of lack of competition. They flat out said \n     it on the news.\n       Also, the president has what we call an executive order. He \n     should use it when it comes to energy. If Congress doesn't \n     get its act together and do something (and it has done \n     nothing for over 30 years) about our energy needs, our \n     national security will be at stake. So I feel that the \n     president should just say to heck with the idiot liberals in \n     Congress and the stupid environmentalists and use an \n     executive order to get things going. When it is a real \n     emergency just think what the government will do then. It may \n     be a lot worse. Or is that the intent of some politicians \n     (for power or money)?\n     Dewey, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       Since my kids are out of school I am not having to fill my \n     minivan as frequently. My husband will be riding his scooter \n     to work for as long as weather and temps permit. When we \n     filled our Explorer last week it cost us $85. My husband's \n     job like many others is not completely secure and I am going \n     to school fulltime working on my Masters and not able to work \n     because we cannot afford day care. Things would be less of a \n     concern for us if we were renters and not homeowners with a \n     mortgage. This fuel and economic crisis could result in us \n     losing our home if it continues to spiral downward. My dad's \n     hay operation is also taking a blow due to fuel prices.\n       I consider myself a conservationist and think protecting \n     the environment is important and I believe that new drilling \n     for oil needs to be done and that it can be done in a manner \n     that is more eco-friendly compared to the practices that were \n     occurring when areas were declared off limits to drilling 30 \n     to 40 years ago.\n       The current economic situation is not really going to allow \n     for a lot of new projects within our own state to address \n     concerns. Serious considerations need to be made to make \n     transportation within the state and heavily populated areas \n     easier. I know there are attempts being made to have Amtrak \n     services returned to the southern part of the state. A rail \n     transit system in the Treasure Valley has been considered a \n     number of times but has never gone anywhere. I know if such a \n     system existed our family would use it.\n     Christine, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       I would like to thank you for giving Idahoans this \n     opportunity to e-mail you and let you know how we feel about \n     high gas and energy costs and how it is affecting us. I do \n     not know what you alone can do, but if you could persuade the \n     other politicians to get off their pedestals and do something \n     that really makes a difference, that would be a good thing.\n       The high energy costs are affecting everything. The cost of \n     groceries is up, cost of utilities is up, everything but how \n     much a person takes home in their paycheck is up. It does not \n     take a rocket scientist to figure out that spells doom for \n     the economy and for the average people in this country.\n       Very wealthy people really are not as affected by this as \n     the middle class and poor are affected, Mr. Crapo. It is \n     always at the cost of the middle class and poor that the \n     government operates and gets its taxes. The rich are able to \n     find loop holes and do not feel the effects like the average \n     people do. Once again, with the cost of fuel and expenses \n     going through the roof, it is the middle class and poor who \n     suffer.\n       It is because politicians listen to lobbyists and special \n     interest groups, allow their palms to be greased by those \n     with special interests, such as environmentalists, that we \n     are in the situation we are in now. Something should have \n     been done 10 to 15 years ago to assure our stability with \n     fuel. It was known by anybody with a brain that we were \n     heading down this road, but instead, politicians were swayed \n     by environmentalist money and influence to stay dependant on \n     Middle Eastern oil as well as from other foreign countries. \n     So now, we find ourselves in a crisis. Politicians are \n     elected to represent the majority, or so I thought. It seems \n     though, that concern for those with the most money has become \n     more important. We are now paying the price for bad decisions \n     that have been made over the last 10 to 15 years.\n       It is time for action on the part of the elected officials, \n     Mr. Crapo. We, the people, the majority--would like to see \n     some action instead of words. We are in a crisis, we are \n     absolutely heading for a depression, and if it is to be \n     avoided, something other than empty words must be done.\n       This country has been very blessed, even the poor in our \n     country are better off than many people who live in other \n     countries where they have very little to nothing. \n     Unfortunately, our government is making bad decisions and I \n     fear that there are some really bad times in store for this \n     country. You would think that history would teach people \n     something, but, unfortunately human beings just seem to keep \n     making the same mistakes over and over again, and the results \n     do not ever change. History shows that no government or \n     empire ever goes beyond about 200 years . . . where are we? \n     Has our government really done anything different than any of \n     the other governments in history? nope! Greed, power, \n     corruption . . . all ruined every government or dictatorship \n     that ever existed. Our government, the so called ``For the \n     People, By the People'' government, is no different.\n       I would love to see the people take back this country \n     again, but unfortunately so many of them live off of the \n     government, it will not happen. Why would they bite the hand \n     that feeds them?\n       Take action Mr. Crapo. Get these capped off oil wells re-\n     opened, get ANWAR opened up and going, get offshore oil wells \n     running, and let us start being smart and use the wind, and \n     any other resource we have to get us off of foreign \n     dependency on oil and energy. We are owned by those we depend \n     on sir, I am sure you know that. We are now owned by China, \n     the Middle East, and Venezuela because they control our money \n     and energy. Very frightening.\n       Thanks for taking the time to hear what the people have to \n     say. I hope you were able to have the time to get through \n     this long letter.\n     Denise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/06/senate-section/article/S1862-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1862-S1863]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  DEDICATION OF THE REMEMBRANCE PLAZA\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncommemorating the dedication of the Remembrance Plaza, a memorial to \nthe Pinedale Assembly Center in Fresno, CA, on February 16, 2009. The \nPinedale Assembly Center was a temporary internment site for nearly \n5,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry during World War II. The \ndedication of Remembrance Plaza is a fitting tribute to a generation of \nJapanese Americans who stood tall in the face of adversity and \ninjustice.\n  The Pinedale Assembly Center was located 8 miles north of downtown \nFresno on vacant land near an existing millworkers' housing facility. \nFrom May 7 to July 23, 1942, the Pinedale Assembly Center served as a \ntemporary holding area for nearly 5,000 Japanese Americans, most of \nthem were from\n\n[[Page S1863]]\n\nSacramento and El Dorado, as well as Oregon and Washington, before they \nwere transferred to 1 of 10 internment camps throughout the Western \nStates.\n  Today, the former site of the Pinedale Assembly Center is a \nCalifornia Registered Historical Landmark. The Remembrance Plaza, a \nstriking 7,000 square-foot memorial that features a fountain, a \nconcrete plaza, Japanese landscaping, an interpretive wall, and ten \nprominently displayed story boards, will stand tall to tell the \nJapanese American story of internment and redress. The Remembrance \nPlaza is a testament to the determination of a generation of Japanese \nAmericans and to the value of civil liberties, justice, and equality in \nour democracy.\n  I would like to thank the Pinedale Assembly Memorial Project \nCommittee, the Central California District Council of the Japanese \nAmerican Citizens League, the Central California District Nikkei \nFoundation, the city of Fresno, and the many friends and supporters of \nthis important project for their determined efforts to help make this \nbeautiful and fitting memorial a reality.\n  I am keenly aware of the historical significance of the Japanese \nAmerican experience during World War II and this is why I was proud to \nintroduce legislation with my colleague, Senator Dianne Feinstein, that \nwould authorize a study that could result in the Tule Lake Segregation \nCenter's designation as a national historic site. I am hopeful that \nthis measure which passed the Senate in January will soon become law.\n  The Remembrance Plaza provides a window for future generations to see \nthe experiences of Japanese Americans during World War II. As \nsupporters of this most worthwhile and fitting memorial gather to \ncommemorate its dedication, I thank them for their support and wish \nthem a successful and enjoyable experience.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/06/senate-section/article/S1863-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1863]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    CONGRATULATING THE FIRST GRADUATING CLASS OF THE ERICKSON SCHOOL\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I congratulate the first graduating \nclass of the Erickson School at the University of Maryland, Baltimore \nCounty, UMBC. In December 2008, the Erickson School awarded degrees in \nthe Management of Aging Services to 4 bachelors and 24 masters \ncandidates.\n  In just 4 years, the Erickson School has grown from a vision of its \nfounding benefactor, John Erickson, to a fully operational professional \nschool addressing the leadership needs in the burgeoning arena of aging \nservices. With the graduation of its first class, the school has begun \nto establish a community of change agents dedicated to improving the \nlives of older Americans.\n  Our Nation faces an urgent need for qualified professionals in the \npublic and private sectors of health care and aging services to deal \nwith our growing aging population. Every 8 seconds, a U.S. resident \nturns 60 years of age. By 2030, Americans 65 and over will increase \nfrom 12.5 percent to 20 percent of the population. Of particular \nsignificance is that the fastest growth is among those ages 85 and \nover. Between today and 2040, this group will increase by another 258 \npercent, a tribute to improvements in medicine and public health.\n  The job of caring for an aging population is one that cannot be \noutsourced. The demographic shift we are witnessing will demand the \ndevelopment of innovative and entrepreneurial services and products. \nEvery aspect of our society will likely be transformed, from the \nworkplace, to the way in which we provide health care, to the \nassumptions underlying fundamental Government programs.\n  The Erickson School's first graduates are positioned to respond to \nthe urgent challenges and opportunities presented by the speed and \nscale with which the U.S. population is aging. This class includes the \nCEO of a Maryland retirement community, the executive directors of the \nBaltimore City and County departments of aging, and other experienced \naging services professionals from across the Nation.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in commending the leadership of Dean \nJ. Kevin Eckert and congratulating the graduates. They are: Jessica \nHallis, Tara McDonnell, Jena Rathell, Juliet Strachan, Eleanor Alvarez, \nBrenda Becker, Rebecca Bees, Mimi Burch, Richard Compton, Benjamin \nCornthwaite, Seth Dudley, Christopher Emmett, Arnold Eppel, Diana \nGivens, Christopher Golen, Steve Gurney, William Holman, Jennifer Holz, \nDorothea Johnson, Waclawa Kludziak, Susan Kraus, Jonathan May, \nChristine Mour, Margaret Mulcare, Elizabeth O'Connor, George Pasteur, \nJr., Judith Shapiro, Chris Stewart, John Stewart, Nathaniel Sweeney, \nand Leonard Weiser.\n  The Erickson School will be a world leader in meeting the demands for \nnew human capital, as well as policy analysis, research, and executive \neducation. Erickson School alumni are at the leading edge, a new group \nof professionals that will revolutionize not only the field of aging \nservices but also the way society views aging. They are part of a \ntransformative force that will steer the field of aging services in new \ndirections, and I am pleased to honor them today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/06/senate-section/article/S1863-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1863-S1864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO COLONEL JAMES S. BROWNE\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, on February 11, 2009, Mountain Home \nAir Force Base, AFB, in my home State of Idaho will bid farewell to COL \nJames S. Browne and his wife Alison. Colonel Browne has been the \nMountain Home AFB 366th Fighter Wing Commander, and Commander of the \nbase, since September 15, 2007.\n  Under Colonel Browne's exemplary leadership, the Gunfighters of \nMountain Home AFB have excelled in their respective missions no small \nfeat considering that the 366th Fighter Wing consists of 24 squadrons \nand over 5,000 personnel--and that doesn't include family members. A \nbase commander is a little like a mayor. Along with military mission \nresponsibilities, a base commander is ultimately held accountable for \ncommunity well-being, infrastructure and services, and serves as the \nliaison with local, regional and State civilian government officials. \nMilitary families tend to move more often than the civilian population. \nAs such, base services are critical both when families first arrive, \nand the military member is adjusting to a new job, and throughout their \ntime as they make new friends and carve out a niche in what they know \nwill be a long-term temporary living situation. Furthermore, when \ndeployments occur, it is the responsibility of base leadership to make \nsure that families are taken care of in their loved ones' absence. \nColonel and Mrs. Browne worked in their own capacities to help ensure \nthat facilities, services and community outreach efforts came together \nto make these life transitions easier. In fact, during his time at \nMountain Home AFB, Colonel Browne oversaw the completion of 318 new \nbase housing units.\n  When it came to the mission of the wing, Colonel Browne excelled in \npromoting and achieving excellence, turning challenge into success \nalong the way. As a testament to his remarkable leadership \ncapabilities, in March of 2008, the wing achieved the first passing \ngrade for a combined phase I and II operational readiness inspection in \n3 years in all of Air Combat Command. That success at the base \ntranslated into success in the global war on terror. Colonel Browne \noversaw numerous worldwide Air Expeditionary Force deployments of the \n72 F-15 aircraft operating from the base. During his tenure, over 5,200 \npeople and over 1,500 tons of cargo were deployed to 18 locations \nworldwide. Colonel Browne's gunfighters demonstrated skill and \nprecision in their outstanding contributions to Operation Enduring \nFreedom. In October of 2008, the 391st Fighter Squadron deployed to \nAfghanistan, flying over 1,700 combat sorties for an incredible 98 \npercent hit rate in support of coalition forces. Colonel Browne also \noversaw the successful implementation of a strategic training \npartnership program with the Republic of Singapore Air Force.\n  Colonel Browne's leadership tenure has been characterized by \noptimism, a firm commitment to the gravity of the mission and a \ndedication to the notion of team dynamics. He maintained a \ncomprehensive view of the wing's mission within the context of the \nbroader mission of the Air Force and the U.S. Military. His goal-\noriented, vision-\n\n[[Page S1864]]\n\ndriven approach made him a particularly outstanding Commander. By \nputting people first, Colonel Browne inspired excellence and \nachievement in others.\n  My staff and I have enjoyed an extremely positive working \nrelationship with Colonel Browne and his staff, on issues such as the \ntraining range, Indian affairs, infrastructure and ensuring that \nMountain Home AFB not only retains critical missions, but is considered \nfor others as it possesses one of the top training ranges in the nation \nand has the strong support of the local community and the State. \nColonel and Mrs. Browne have been exemplary representatives of the Air \nForce and good friends to Idaho. On behalf of the State of Idaho, I \nwish Colonel and Alison Browne well as they move back to Washington, \nDC, and thank them for their continued service to our nation and for \ntheir time as gunfighters in the great State of Idaho. They will be \nmissed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/06/senate-section/article/S1864-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING KAREN RAE FORD\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I \nnote the passing of a long-time friend and native Iowan, Karen Rae \nFord. Karen passed away last week after a difficult battle with liver \ndisease. I knew Karen well through her work as the executive director \nof the Food Bank of Iowa, a position she held for over a quarter of a \ncentury. Karen was a founding force for the creation of the food bank, \nwhere she dedicated herself to improving the lives of countless \nthousands of low-income families in Iowa.\n  Let me start by expressing my deepest sympathies to Karen's family \nand friends. It is never easy to lose a loved one, and particularly \nhard when the loss is due to a medical illness that cuts that loved \none's life short. In times of mourning, words fall far short of the \ncomfort we wish we could provide, but hopefully words let those who \nwere close to Karen know that our thoughts and prayers are with them.\n  Karen has played a leading role in the fight against hunger in Iowa \nfor many years. In the last several years the Food Bank of Iowa \ndistributed nearly 5 million pounds of food a year to almost 300 \npartner agencies. Just think of all the hungry, low-income families \nthat have benefited directly from Karen's work during her nearly 30 \nyears of work at the Food Bank of Iowa the parents that were able to \nput food on the table for their children so that they did not have to \ngo hungry.\n  Though I am sure Karen would never say so, these families owe her an \nincalculable debt of gratitude for the hard work and devotion she has \nshown to the cause of improving their lives over her professional \ncareer. And her impact extended far beyond the State of Iowa. On more \nthan one occasion Karen testified before the Congress to advocate for \nimprovements to our food assistance laws and policies so that the \nprograms upon which low-income families depend for a safety net in \ntough times are as effective as possible. That testimony was always \nreceived with the recognition and respect that it came from an advocate \nwho was in the trenches every day fighting to provide food to hungry \npeople.\n  Though the Food Bank of Iowa will continue to operate, and the \nfamilies that depend upon it will continue to be well served, we have \nall suffered a loss with Karen's passing. Her activism and leadership \nover a lifetime of work in the anti-hunger community is a testament to \nher tremendous spirit and dedication to helping those less \nfortunate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/06/senate-section/article/S1864-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. MENENDEZ:\n       S. 392.

Con. Res. 5\n\n       Whereas the Sisters of the Sacred Hearts, also known as the \n     Sisters of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and \n     Mary, in 2009 are celebrating the 150th anniversary of their \n     arrival in Hawai`i on May 4, 1859, to provide Catholic \n     education to the children of Hawai`i;\n       Whereas, during the past 150 years, through the devotion \n     and dedication of the Sisters of the Sacred Hearts, thousands \n     of youth in Hawai`i, California, Massachusetts, and New \n     Jersey have received the benefit of a well-rounded education \n     based on Christian principles and moral living at the \n     following educational institutions: Sacred Hearts Convent at \n     Fort Street, Honolulu; Sacred Hearts Academy, Kaimuki, \n     Honolulu; St. Anthony Home, Kalihi, Honolulu; Sacred Hearts \n     Convent, Nuuanu, Honolulu; St. Theresa School, Honolulu; Our \n     Lady of Peace School, Honolulu; Immaculate Conception School, \n     Lihue, Kauai; St. Patrick School, Kaimuki, Honolulu; Maria \n     Regina School, Gardena, California; Bishop Amat High School, \n     West Covina, California; Sacred Hearts Academy, Fairhaven, \n     Massachusetts; St. Joseph School, Fairhaven, Massachusetts; \n     Sacred Hearts School, Fairhaven, Massachusetts; and St. \n     Andrew School, Avenel, New Jersey;\n       Whereas, during the past 101 years, the Sisters of the \n     Sacred Hearts have served communities in Fairhaven, Fall \n     River, and Mt.

Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce a Concurrent \nResolution commemorating the 150th anniversary of the arrival of the \nSisters of the Sacred Hearts in Hawaii.\n  The first Catholic missionaries to the Hawaiian Islands were members \nof the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary and of \nPerpetual Adoration of the Most Blessed Sacrament of the Altar.\n  The Congregation was founded by Pierre Coudrin and Henriette Aymer de \nla Chevalerie in Poitiers, France on Christmas Eve 1800.\n  In 1825, the Congregation responded to a request of Pope Leo XII for \nmissionaries to the Pacific Rim, then known as Oceania.\n  The Sacred Hearts Priests and Brothers arrived in Hawaii in 1827; the \nSisters, in 1859.\n  Today, through the missionary zeal of its members, of which a \nnoteworthy exemplar in Hawaii is Blessed Damien de Veuster, the \nBrothers and Sisters of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus \nand Mary are present in forty countries and on all continents.\n  The Sisters of the Sacred Hearts Pacific Province is the \nadministrative center of communities of Sisters currently serving in \nHawaii, New Mexico, and Massachusetts. In observance of the 150th \nanniversary of the Sisters arrival to Hawaii, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this Resolution recognizing the Sisters' dedication through \nthese years to the education of the children of Hawaii, Massachusetts, \nCalifornia, and New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/06/senate-section/article/S1866-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1866-S1867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 527.

LONG-TERM CARE WORKER RECRUITMENT AND INVESTMENT \n                   DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Meeting the health needs of baby boomers will create \n     new jobs for individuals trained in geriatric care, in \n     addition to meeting the current high demand for such \n     individuals.\n       (2) Direct care workers, nurse aides, home health aides, \n     and personal and home care aides are the primary providers of \n     paid hands-on care, supervision, and emotional support for \n     older adults in the United States.\n       (3) The Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of \n     Labor predicts that personal or home care aides and home \n     health aides will represent the second and third fastest-\n     growing occupations between 2006 and 2016. In spite of such \n     growth, personal or home care aides are not subject to any \n     Federal requirements related to training or education, and \n     States have very different requirements for personal or home \n     care aides.\n       (4) The Institute of Medicine report, entitled ``Retooling \n     for an Aging America'' described direct care workers, nurse \n     aides, home health aides, and personal and home care aides as \n     the linchpin of the formal health care delivery system for \n     older adults.\n       (5) Research shows that inadequate training is a major \n     contributor to high turnover rates among direct care workers \n     and that more training is correlated with better staff \n     recruitment and retention rates.\n       (6) The Institute of Medicine recommends that State \n     Medicaid programs increase pay and fringe benefits for direct \n     care workers.\n       (7) Investment in these jobs would benefit the economy in \n     multiple ways, such as providing more income and greater \n     economic opportunity to low-income workers and strengthening \n     health services for aging and disabled populations in the \n     United States.\n       (b) Establishment.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall establish a \n     demonstration program (in this section referred to as the \n     ``program'') to make grants to States to evaluate recruitment \n     and retention strategies (including wage enhancements) for \n     personal or home care aides, nurse aides, and home health \n     aides (in this section referred to as ``recruitment and \n     retention activities'') and, separately, to develop core \n     training competencies for eligible personal or home care \n     aides and additional training content for nurse aides and \n     home health aides to supplement training for nurse aides and \n     home health aides that is required under Federal law or \n     regulation, including an evaluation of the effectiveness of\n\n[[Page S1869]]\n\n     such competencies and additional training content (in this \n     section referred to as ``competencies and additional training \n     content activities''. Under such programs, the Secretary, in \n     consultation with the expert panel established under \n     subsection (c)(1), shall--\n       (A) with respect to recruitment and retention activities,

   provide technical assistance to States in implementing the \n     strategies selected, and evaluate the impact of such \n     strategies on the recruitment and retention of personal or \n     home care aides, nurse aides, and home health aides in \n     accordance with subsection (e)(1)(A); and\n       (B) with respect to competencies and additional training \n     content activities, evaluate the efficacy of the core \n     training competencies developed under subsection (c)(2)(B), \n     the additional training content developed under subsection \n     (c)(2)(C), and the method of implementation of such core \n     training competencies and additional training content in \n     accordance with subsection (e)(1)(B).\n       (2) Duration.--The program shall be conducted for not less \n     than 3 years with respect to each of the recruitment and \n     retention activities and the competencies and additional \n     training content activities.\n       (3) Implementation.--\n       (A) Recruitment and retention activities.--The Secretary \n     shall, in consultation with the expert panel, implement the \n     program with respect to recruitment and retention activities \n     not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (B) Core training competencies.--The Secretary shall, in \n     consultation with the expert panel, implement the program \n     with respect to competencies and additional training content \n     activities not later than 18 months after such date of \n     enactment.\n       (c) Establishment of Expert Panel.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall establish a panel \n     of long-term care workforce experts (in this

of proxy decision-makers in the case \n     where a health care consumer has impaired decision-making \n     capacity).\n       (III) Communication, cultural and linguistic competence and \n     sensitivity, problem solving, behavior management, and \n     relationship skills.\n       (IV) Personal care skills.\n       (V) Health care support.\n       (VI) Nutritional support.\n       (VII)

disabilities, individuals with developmental disabilities, \n     individuals with dementia, and individuals with mental and \n     behavioral health needs).\n       (X) Self-Care.\n       (ii) For purposes of the program with respect to \n     competencies and additional training content activities, the \n     core training competencies developed under clause (i) shall \n     only apply with respect to newly hired personal or home care \n     aides.\n       (C)(i) Subject to clause (ii), developing additional \n     training content for home health aides and nurse aides which \n     is

communication skills, \n     working with family caregivers, and ensuring physical health \n     and safety).\n       (IX) Prevention and reporting of abuse and caregiver \n     burnout.\n       (ii)
