Mr. President, I see the majority leader is still on \nthe floor, and I wish to thank him and the Republican leader for \norganizing last night's reception honoring Henry Clay, a great Senator, \nwhose portrait will be hanging in the stairway outside of here. There \nwas a time in history when Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and John Calhoun \nwere better known than the Presidents of the United States. That was in \nthe 1850s, before the Civil War. It was good to take a moment all \ntogether, Democrats and Republicans, and think about that history and \nto honor the man who was known as the great compromiser, who during a \ntime when our Nation was completely split over the Civil War, on three \ndifferent occasions, found a way to try to bring it together. Of \ncourse, he died before the great war.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that during the Republican \nmorning business time I be permitted to enter into a colloquy with my \ncolleagues Senator McCain, Senator Coburn, Senator Brownback, Senator \nThune, and Senator Murkowski, who will be here shortly.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, health care reform is the agenda for \nthe Nation and it ought to be. We, on the Republican side, want health \ncare reform, but we want the right kind of health care reform. Our \nfocus is on costs. Our focus is on the cost to each American as he or \nshe buys their health care policy; our focus is on the cost of the \nGovernment of the United States, for which each American has a \nresponsibility to pay. What we have to do is to reduce costs to make it \neasier for Americans to afford their health care and to afford their \ngovernment.\n  Every single one of us knows that unless we reduce the increasing \ncosts of health care we will not be able to pay our bills in \nWashington, DC. We are in the midst of appropriations bills, and there \nis well-meaning debate here about whether we should spend more money \nfor national parks and for safe drinking water and other urgent needs \nwe have. That is the bill we are talking about today--clean air. Well, \nwe should spend money on those urgent needs. Americans want us to do \nthat. But we can't have those dollars, as the Senator from Alabama \npointed out yesterday, if we continue to increase the debt--trillions \nin debt--and run up the interest rate bill.\n  We are headed toward a situation where, by the end of this decade, we \nwill be spending $800 billion a year on debt--more than we spend on \nnational defense, eight times as much as we spend from Washington on \neducation this year. So those dollars could either be in the pockets of \nthe American people for them to spend for themselves or we could be \nspending those dollars to clean the air, to relieve traffic congestion \nor to provide Pell grants and student loans so Americans can go back to \nschool. Those are the things government ought to be spending money on, \nnot on increasing debt.\n  So health care reform is, first, about cost--the cost to Americans \nfor their own health care policies and the cost of their debt. The \nPresident noted this the other night and said in his remarks to us and \nto the American people that the health care bill couldn't add one dime \nto the deficit. That is reassuring because the President's proposals \nare already adding $9 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years. \nHe is doubling or tripling the national debt, which means he is adding \nmore to the debt by a factor of two and then three than all the other \nPresidents put together. So surely we don't want to add more to it with \na health care reform bill.\n  But when the President said that, he completely wiped out all the \nDemocratic health care bills that have been proposed so far from the \nHouse and from the Senate. The Congressional Budget Office has said the \nSenate HELP Committee and the bills in the House all add to the debt in \nthe first 10 years and in the years after that. So they should be off \nthe table, according to the President's own standards.\n  Now we are looking at the Finance Committee in the Senate to see what \nthey can do. Mr. Baucus, the Senator from Montana, has worked very hard \nin a good-faith, bipartisan way to try to develop a bipartisan bill--a \ncomprehensive bill. But as we read the bill, there are a great many \nthings to be worried about. For example, if you don't buy a health care \nplan, the IRS will tax you.\n\n  The President and George Stephanopoulos, on a Sunday show--and \nSenator Graham said the President seemed to be on every Sunday show \nexcept the Food Channel--were talking about the definition of tax. So \nthat is the first thing. The second is the Medicare cuts.\n  I see the Senator from Arizona has come, and I would say to the \nSenator, through the Chair, we have received permission from the Chair \nto engage in a colloquy between myself and other Republican Senators \nwho might come. I have already pointed out that the President himself \nhas disqualified all the plans our committee worked on, the HELP \nCommittee and from the House, because they all add to the debt. Now we \nsee the Baucus plan coming forward, and I wonder if the Senator from \nArizona has had an opportunity to look at--of course, that is not a \nbill yet. We all understand that. It is just concepts, and we will want \nto make sure we have time to read the bill and to know what it costs. \nBut I wonder if the Senator from Arizona has had an opportunity yet to \nform an opinion about whether the Baucus bill does what we had hoped, \nwhich is reduce the cost to the American people of what their insurance \ncosts and reduce the cost to the American people of their government in \nWashington.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Well, I thank my colleague from Tennessee and the great \nwork he has been doing. First of all, I would ask my friend if he has \nhad the same experience I have had at townhall meetings and that is \nfrom one of the hand-done signs--not printed-out signs but one of the \nhand-done signs--which says: Have you read the bill? One of the first \nquestions at the townhall meeting was: Have you read the bill? Of \ncourse, that is an impossibility for anyone to read the bill because \nthere is no bill before the Finance Committee, it is my understanding. \nI understand it is about 200 pages of a ``framework.'' I think the \nSenator from Tennessee and I are keenly aware that many times there is \na comma, a word inserted here, a word taken out there which changes the \nentire legislative impact.\n  The American people are a lot smarter than we give them credit for. \nThey know that in the middle of the night, many times legislation is \nwritten and turned into the kind of legislation that, frankly, unless \nyou go through it page by page, word by word, you don't know the final \nimpact. So what I, first, wish to say to my friend from Tennessee is \nthat apparently the Finance Committee is working to turn out a \nlegislative package that is not in legislative form, and I am curious \nhow the Members would understand what is in it.\n  I guess the second point is, there is still no serious consideration \nof a couple of the fundamentals--medical malpractice or medical \nliability reform or, obviously, the ability to go across State lines to \npurchase insurance and allowing small businesses to pool their assets \nso they can compete for health insurance policies that large \ncorporations are able to.\n  The other question I would ask, because I know my friend from \nTennessee has had many roles in his long political life, has the \nSenator from Tennessee, as a former Governor, had any contact with the \nGovernors and their organizations as to how much additional costs would \nbe added to those States, which are already in dire shape--certainly \nmine is--in the form of additional Medicaid costs?\n  I notice the majority leader at first complained about the bill and \nthe cost it might accrue to his State of Nevada, but I guess that has \nbeen fixed to his satisfaction. But I don't think the other States--a \nState such as mine, which is still looking at over a $50 billion \ndeficit--probably would be eager to absorb dramatically increased \nMedicaid costs. I wonder if my friend, a former Governor, former \nCabinet member, former candidate for President, former dog catch--\nexcuse me, someone who has had many roles in American life, would \nrespond to that.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. One of my friends said to me after I was Governor: \nRooster today, feather duster tomorrow. And I am afraid I am in the \nfeather duster category.\n  The Senator has made a terrific point. I want to go to the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, who has just arrived, to\n\n[[Page S9763]]\n\ntalk about this, one of the physicians in the Senate. But on the first \npoint, we need to read the bill, and there is no bill. Yesterday, \nRepublicans tried to get the Finance Committee to say once there is a \nbill that at least for 72 hours it would be on the Internet. Then we \nneed to know what it costs because even the President said----\n  Mr. McCAIN. If I might interrupt, if it were on the Internet for 72 \nhours, maybe as many Americans who wanted to would be able to read the \nbill themselves.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. They could let us know what they think of it, and then \nwe need to know what it costs.\n  As to Medicaid, every Governor in America is worried about this. The \nDemocratic Governors and Republican Governors have said to us: If you \nwant to expand the Medicaid Program, which the States pay 40 percent \nof, you pay for it because we can't raise State taxes or raise tuitions \nor cut the highway program to do that.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma heard Senator McCain's question. The \nSenator from Oklahoma and Senator Barrasso the Senator from Oklahoma \nhas delivered thousands of babies, and the Senator from Wyoming is an \northopedic surgeon. They have been touring the country, listening to a \nlot of doctors and physicians and medical personnel. I wonder if you \nhave a reaction, Senator Coburn, to the questions of Senator McCain?\n  Mr. COBURN. First of all, let me say my biggest concern for my \npatients in this whole debate is, will the American consumer still have \nthe power and the ability to select who is going to give them this most \npersonal of all care when this is over? The answer to that is ``no.'' \nIt is not ``no'' for everybody, but it is a ``no'' for half of the \nAmerican public. That is what it means.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Would it be ``no'' for the individual who has employer-\nbased health care and that employer then opts for the so-called public \noption, which would be a government-run health program? Could that \nemployee see the same doctor?\n  Mr. COBURN. We don't know, but most likely half of them will not. The \nwhole debate ought to be how do we get more value out of the health \ncare system we have today rather than how do we add more money to the \ncost of health care to cover more people.\n  The reason my patients have trouble getting care is cost. Right now, \nthey have choice, except if they are in Medicaid, and they have some \nchoice if they are in Medicare because we are seeing a larger and \nlarger percentage of doctors who cannot afford to take the Medicare \nreimbursements. But can they afford the care? This bill does nothing to \nlower health care costs. It does nothing to lower health care costs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Isn't it true, in fact, that the Congressional Budget \nOffice has said that these increased costs, at least half of them, will \nbe passed on to the individual?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I would say to the Senator from Arizona, that is \nexactly right. The Congressional Budget Office did an analysis of the \nimpact of Senator Baucus's plan on insurance premiums. It showed the \npremiums for those in the individual market would go up. So, to the \npoint of the Senator from Oklahoma, one of the effects of the one \nremaining bill that is being considered here, at a time when we are \ntrying to reduce the cost to Americans of their policies and their \ngovernment, is that premiums would go up.\n  Mr. COBURN. Premiums will.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have one very important question. There is no one who \nhas led the fight against waste, fraud, and abuse more than Dr. \nCoburn!.\n  Dr. Coburn, the President keeps saying we will eliminate all this \nfraud and abuse and waste. If we can, why don't we start tomorrow?\n  Mr. COBURN. I agree. We have offered for years a couple of ways to do \nthis. I think it is important for the American people to know how much \nthere is. The Department of Health and Human Services estimated in \n2007--that is the last year for which they have numbers--that $62 \nbillion was improperly paid out of Medicare. The GAO, when they looked \nat that report, said: No, you are way off. It is at least $85 billion, \nand we think it is higher.\n  If you look at that, that is almost 20 percent--20 cents out of every \ndollar--Medicaid pays out is lost to fraud. Why wouldn't we fix that \nfirst rather than say that if we fix it, we are going to take it from \nMedicare and put it somewhere else, when the trust fund, the HI trust \nfund, the hospital insurance fund, is going to be belly-up in 2017?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask Senator Coburn, isn't it true \nthat, under the Baucus plan, about half of it would be paid for by \nMedicare cuts, which would then be spent on a new program?\n  Mr. COBURN. That is right. And Medicare is already unsustainable. So \nwhat is going to happen? There is another factor, which is we have it \nfixed that, with this bill, there will not be a big cut to the payments \nto doctors under Medicare. But in the years that follow that, there \nwill be a 25-percent cut. If access is a problem for Medicare patients \ntoday, it is going to get worse. It is part of the lack of truth in \nthis bill that they do not address what we have set in motion to take \ndollars away from the health care industry.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask Dr. Coburn again, if we start tomorrow, what \ncan we do?\n  Mr. COBURN. The first thing is you put uncovered patients in the \nMedicare system and you put people in jail who are defrauding Medicare. \nIf 30 or 40 doctors went to jail in the next 6 months in this country, \nyou would lower Medicare costs by 10 percent because all of a sudden \nthey would start thinking about: I can't skirt this. I can't play this \ngame. I can't do it. The risk is too high.\n  As a matter of fact, here is one of the things we know. In Florida, \nthe drug dealers have switched from being drug dealers to Medicare \nsuppliers because they can make more money defrauding the Federal \nGovernment. It is harder to get caught and the penalties, when you are \ncaught, are less than when you are dealing drugs. Consequently, we have \nall these people in the business of defrauding Medicare, and there has \nnot been a plan that has been effective in cutting Medicare fraud \nbecause nobody knows--and the government is all about Medicare. So it, \nby its very design, is designed to be defrauded. We should make \nstructural changes so it is not and with that get better care and lower \ncost care, like paying for outcomes rather than paying the American \nMedical Association to use their CPT code.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senators from South Dakota and Kansas have joined \nus.\n  Senator McCain is leading a colloquy on the Baucus bill and health \ncare.\n  I wonder, I ask Senator Thune, if you see the Baucus bill as a bill--\nit is not a bill yet--that is likely to reduce costs?\n  Mr. THUNE. I think that is the big question about all of these \nvarious pieces of legislation we have had in front of us. What do they \ndo to reduce costs? Even the Congressional Budget Office has said \nrepeatedly, in this bill in particular, the Baucus bill, the most \nrecent version of a health care reform proposal here, there is a $1.7 \ntrillion cost over 10 years when fully implemented.\n  If you actually look at what it does for most people in this country, \nthey are going to see their health care costs not go down but go up. \nThe premiums are actually going to increase. The reason for that is \nmany of the taxes imposed in the bill to help pay for the cost of the \n$1.7 trillion expansion are going to get passed on. So the people who \nget hurt by this are hard-working Americans who are expecting, if \nCongress is actually reforming health care, that would mean health care \ncosts, the costs people pay for premiums for their health care \ncoverage, would actually go down. The Congressional Budget Office, \nunder questions that were raised yesterday by some of our colleagues, \nresponded that dollar for dollar, those additional--those taxes that \nwould be imposed to pay for this would actually be passed on and you \nwould see higher health care costs.\n  So there has not been anything in this entire debate yet, or any of \nthe bills that have been put before various committees or that \neventually we assume will be considered on the floor here in the Senate \nand in the House of Representatives, that has actually impacted costs \nin a way that they go down, that reduces the overall cost for the \npeople in this country.\n\n  Furthermore--and I talked about this with the Senator from Tennessee; \nwe had this discussion on the floor yesterday--many Americans, those I \nheard\n\n[[Page S9764]]\n\nfrom in my State of South Dakota during the month of August in the many \nconversations I had out there, are very concerned. They are really \nconcerned about two issues: one is control, one is cost. Who is going \nto control their health care? Is the Federal Government going to do it, \nthe bureaucrat in Washington, DC? In this country, are we ceding one-\nsixth of our economy, more and more control to the people in \nWashington, DC? The Baucus bill, inasmuch as it doesn't at this moment \ncontain the government plan, still assumes a high level of government \ninvolvement, government intervention. The government would determine \nwhich health care plans it would have to approve, which would meet the \nstandards the government set. So you have a high level of government \nintervention with this plan as you have had with all the other plans.\n  But perhaps even more important--and this is the issue I think most \nAmericans are really homing in on--is the cost. What is the cost to me \nas a taxpayer? In this case, $1.7 trillion over a 10-year period when \nfully implemented. And does it reduce my cost of health care? They are \ngoing to look at it two different ways. One is, what am I going to have \nto owe in the form of higher taxes to finance this; and second, how is \nit going to impact the cost of health care for me in terms of the \npremiums I pay? I think it is fair to say--it is not what we are \nsaying, it is what the Congressional Budget Office has determined--that \nactually the cost of health care for a lot of Americans, under this \nproposal, the Baucus proposal, is going to go up.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Senator Thune, I see the Senator from Kansas is here. \nI wonder if Senator Brownback from Kansas or you from South Dakota have \nbeen hearing from your constituents about the possibility of shifting \ncosts from Washington to the States when, because we in Washington say \nit is a great idea to expand Medicaid, then we shift some of the cost \nof that to the State, the State taxes go up or State services go down. \nI wonder if you have heard anything from the people of Kansas about \nthat, Senator Brownback?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I certainly have. I appreciate the Senator from \nTennessee leading this discussion and also asking that question. As a \nformer Governor, he has dealt with these issues. He knows that when \nWashington dictates something--or too often Washington will dangle a \nlittle bit of money out here and say: We would like the State to do \nthis, and here is a little money to get it started. Then 3 years in the \nprogram, 5 years in the program, the money is pulled away at the \nFederal level and the State is left with trying to fund this.\n  It is on two levels that I get it at the State level: No. 1, trying \nto drive so many more people into Medicaid; that is, by raising the \namount of coverage of people in Medicaid, it then gets a big price tag \nwith it--at the Federal level initially and at the State level as \nwell--and State budgets are really strapped right now. I was just \ntalking with some State legislators yesterday, and they are looking at \na multiple hundreds of millions of dollars hole next year--that alone, \nwithout adding additional Medicaid requirements from the Federal \nGovernment on top of that. It is clearly a huge problem for them if you \nare going to add a cost at a time when they don't have the funds.\n  The Federal Government, much of it, is saying: We are going to pay \nfor it initially, and the proposals under Baucus are to pay for most of \nit initially, but I don't think there is any question that then, over \ntime, the State is going to have to assume a bigger role of that, and \nthat is going to be up to State responsibility.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I believe the National Governors Association chairman, \nof Vermont, said that all Democratic Governors as well as all \nRepublican Governors said: Don't shift it to us. If you want to expand \nMedicaid from Washington, pay for it from Washington.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Pay for it and pay for it completely. But this is also \na more pernicious piece of this, and that is we have 40 percent of our \nphysicians in Kansas saying they are not taking more Medicaid patients. \nThat is 40 percent now. Now you are talking about expanding Medicaid, \nthe number of people in Medicaid, when 40 percent of your doctors are \nsaying: We aren't taking them. You are saying: Why won't the doctors \ntake it? It is not that they don't want to have Medicaid patients, but \nit is the reimbursement ratios they get. Listen to these numbers from \nMedPAC saying that Medicare provider reimbursement rates are about 80 \npercent of private insurance. So private insurance, and then 80 percent \nof that is Medicare, and then Medicaid is 72 percent of Medicare. So \nyou are cutting it back even further, to the point that physicians are \nsaying: I just can't afford to take more.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Medicaid is the largest government program we have \ntoday, bigger than Medicare; it has low-income Americans in every \nState. I believe the Baucus proposal plans to add about 11 million more \nlow-income Americans to this plan that 40 percent of doctors will not \nsee patients for?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. They won't see them. Now what you are doing is driving \npeople into a system that is a very low reimbursement system, that \nphysicians are, almost half, saying: We won't take any more.\n  My concern here is that you are going to drive people in this system \nwhere you are not going to be able to get health care; they are not \ngoing to be able to get health care at all because of these \nreimbursement rates, because of the reimbursement rates physicians are \nhaving under Medicaid.\n  So I think that is a deadly piece of this overall proposal. It is the \ncost to the States, and then it is also that you are driving people \ninto an area where providers are fleeing and heading out of.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. We have 5 minutes left. We will go to Senator Thune \nand let Senator Brownback wrap up our time.\n  But ``Medicare cuts,'' those are scary words to most Americans. And \nsome people say: Well, you Republicans are trying to scare the seniors \nof America when you say the words ``Medicare cuts.''\n  But is it not a fact that the Baucus plan would cut Medicare by about \n$500 billion and use it for a different program instead of shoring up \nthe Medicare Program?\n  Mr. THUNE. We know for a fact that the Medicare trustees have said \nthe Medicare Program is destined to be bankrupt in the year 2017. So \nMedicare is already on an unsustainable path. It needs to be shored up. \nAnd what we are talking about doing is getting savings, if you want to \ncall them that, or ``cuts,'' I would say out of Medicare to create a \nwhole new entitlement program here in Washington, instead of fixing and \nmaking more sustainable a Medicare Program that, as I said, is destined \nfor bankruptcy by the year 2017.\n  I think most seniors and most providers around the country are going \nto be very concerned about the idea of having cuts in the Medicare \nProgram, $500 billion, as the Senator from Tennessee has mentioned, go \nto paying for this new entitlement program which, as I said earlier, \nover a 10-year period is going to cost $1.7 trillion.\n  So I think you are not only going to have, as the Senator mentioned, \na lot of providers very concerned about cuts, I think you are going to \nhave an awful lot of seniors who are concerned about how their Medicare \nbenefits are going to be impacted by this proposal. I would add to what \nthe Senator has already talked about, and I know the Senator from \nTennessee's Governor has called some of these Medicaid expansions ``the \nmother of all unfunded mandates.''\n  I have had numerous conservations with my Governor in my State of \nSouth Dakota about this. It would cost our State about $45 million a \nyear, new revenues they would have to raise, to meet the matching \nrequirements under this expansion of Medicaid.\n  In my State of South Dakota, that is real money. I know that does not \nsound like a lot out here in Washington. But that really is. My Govenor \nis very concerned, as are all Governors, about the impacts not just on \nFederal budgets but on State budgets.\n  Of course, as the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from Kansas \nhave pointed out, Medicare--and I might add, I love the quote from the \nCEO of Mayo, which the Senator from Tennessee has mentioned, ``If the \npublic plan looks like Medicare, I think the country would go broke \nalmost\n\n[[Page S9765]]\n\novernight,'' because Medicare is already proposed to go broke by 2015 \nto 2017.\n  I think that is the problem we run into when we try and build upon a \nfoundation that is already crumbling. The Medicare Program is destined \nto go bankrupt. We are talking about adding a whole new entitlement. \nInstead of trying to figure out how to plow some of these savings back \ninto Medicare and make it sustainable, we are actually adding to and \nbuilding upon a foundation that is already crumbling.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. We have about a minute and a half left in our time. I \nwonder if Senator Brownback would conclude.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I think to put it in Kansas-type terms, \nif you are talking about taking savings from Medicare to start a whole \nnew health care entitlement program, that is like writing a big fat \ncheck on a completely overdrawn bank account to buy a new car.\n  You are going: Now, well, who would do something like that? When you \nare saying: Well, that is what the Federal Government is looking at \ndoing in this proposal that Senator Baucus has put forward.\n  Medicare is not sustainable. It is not fiscally sound. You are going \nto write an overdraft check on that to start a whole new program that \nyou do not have the wherewithal to do, that most Americans do not want \nto see you do because they want to see you fix the current program and \nget it on a sustainable basis.\n  It does not make sense. It is out of the stream of thought of the \nAmerican public. We ought to back up, stop, and go at this in \nincremental changes, to get costs down and more people covered, that do \nnot drive costs up, that do not do a big federal takeover of the \nsystem.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank Senators Thune and Brownback.\n  Obviously, we believe that instead of a 1,000-page bill, we should do \nwhat Senator Brownback said. We should go step by step to re-earn the \ntrust of the American people. For example, permitting small business \nplans to pool their resources to offer more insurance to a million \npeople; buying insurance across State lines; stopping runaway junk \nlawsuits against doctors; signing up those people already eligible for \nMedicaid and SCHIP; and encouraging technology.\n  All of those are steps we can agree on and reduce costs, without \nrunning trillions of dollars of new debt, more taxes, and Medicare \ncuts. I thank the Senators from South Dakota and Kansas for \nparticipating in our colloquy.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/24/senate-section/article/S9765-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen).

Madam President, over the past several months, the \nAmerican people have made their voices heard in the debate over health \ncare. Everyone is frustrated at the high cost of even routine services \nand procedures. But the good news is this: everyone agrees that these \nare real and pressing issues and that Congress can and should do \nsomething to help.\n  Unfortunately, the Democrat plan being contemplated here in Congress \nis not content simply to address the problems at hand. Instead, this \nplan uses these problems as an excuse to dismantle the current health \ncare system, slap together a new one as quickly as possible, and force \nit on the American people whether they like it or not.\n  That is what is going on this week in the hearing room of the Finance \nCommittee.\n  The U.S. Congress is hashing out the details of an enormously \ncomplicated bill that calls for a massive expansion of Washington's \nrole in the health decisions of every single American. And when they \nare done, they plan to rush this so-called reform through Congress and \nforce it on a country that is overwhelmingly opposed to it.\n  But there is really only one thing Americans need to know about this \nlegislation: When all the talking is through, what is left is this: a \ntrillion dollar experiment that cuts Medicare, raises taxes, and \nthreatens the health care options that millions of Americans enjoy.\n  The administration has been telling Americans for months and months \nthat if they like the coverage they have, they can keep it. Whoever \nbelieves this apparently is not familiar with the bill that Democrats \nin Congress want the President to sign. If they were, they would \nrealize that it creates a new government standard for coverage, and \nthat anyone who falls below that standard will be forced to buy a \ndifferent health plan.\n  Government would tell you which plans you can have and which ones you \ncan not, and if you do not like the plan they suggest, then you will \nhave to send a check to Washington. You will get taxed. That is \ngovernment expansion. Americans do not want it.\n  Americans are worried about spending. It seems like every time they \nturn around they are hearing about another trillion-dollar spending \nbill coming out of Washington. Well here is another. Once again, it is \nbeing rushed through Congress, and once again, we will not have enough \ntime to read it. They made sure of that yesterday. My Republican \ncolleague from Kentucky, Senator Bunning, offered an amendment to give \nsenators the time they need to study the details. Democrats struck it \ndown.\n  Taxes are already high enough. They are about to get higher. This \nlegislation will lead to significantly higher taxes on just about \neverybody in America. If you have health insurance, you are taxed. If \nyou do not have health insurance, you are taxed. If you need \nprescription medicine, you are taxed. If you need a medical device, you \nare taxed.\n  All these taxes would be bad enough if they were not so hard to \nunderstand.\n  For months we have been hearing that the goal of reform is to lower \ncosts. Yet any school kid in America can tell you that raising taxes on \nsomething raises its cost. And every nonpartisan, independent study we \nhave seen confirms this basic economic principle. Despite all the talk \nof lowering costs, all these higher taxes mean that, as a result of \nthis legislation, health care costs are headed in one direction, and \nthat is up.\n  What is worse, the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional \nBudget Office say that some of the worst taxes would fall squarely on \nthe backs of consumers: not on the rich, but on ordinary Americans who \nare already struggling through a recession.\n  Seniors take a serious hit from this legislation, either through cuts \nin services that millions of them currently enjoy, or by being forced \noff the plans they have. All told, this bill calls for nearly $140 \nbillion in cuts to Medicare Advantage; nearly $120 billion in Medicare \ncuts for hospitals that care for seniors; more than $40 billion in cuts \nto home health agencies; and nearly $8 billion in cuts to hospice care.\n  Everyone agrees Medicare needs reform. This is not reform. This is a \nmassive raid on a program millions of seniors depend on in order to \ncover the cost of another new government program. This bill uses \nMedicare as a piggy bank to pay for this experiment.\n  There is no question that Americans want health care reform. They \nwant lower costs. They want greater access. They want commonsense \nreforms, like a plan to get rid of junk lawsuits on doctors and \nhospitals and to level the playing field when it comes to taxes on \nhealth plans. But what they are getting from Congress instead is a \ntrillion-dollar experiment that cuts Medicare, raises taxes, and \nthreatens the health care options that millions of Americans now enjoy. \nAnd here is the worst part: they are being told that all this has to be \nrushed through Congress on some artificial timeline.\n  Americans have been asking us to slow down. Congress is doing the \nopposite.\n  This is not how Americans expect us to do their business. We need \nnonpartisan groups like the Congressional Budget Office to tell us how \nmuch this legislation will cost and how we would pay for it, and we \nneed to slow down and get it right. We need to give Members of Congress \nthe time they need to understand what they are going to be voting on. \nAnd we need to give the American people the time they need to \nunderstand this legislation too. This bill is too big, too costly, and \ntoo important to allow anything less.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S9766]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to call for the testimony \nbefore Congress of our top military commanders in Afghanistan, GEN \nStanley McChrystal and General Petraeus. Congress and the American \npeople need to hear directly and as soon as possible from the generals \nto ensure that political motivations in Washington do not override the \nvital needs of our commanders and our troops on the ground.\n  Ordinarily, I don't like the idea of calling generals away from their \nduties in theater but, unfortunately, in the often surreal world of \nWashington politics, all the hard work by our military and intelligence \nprofessionals on the battlefield in Afghanistan can be undone very \nquickly. Unfortunately, the latest verbal wavering by the \nadministration and some of my colleagues in Congress can do just that.\n  Last November, when I sent my report, the Roadmap to Success in South \nAsia, to then President-elect Obama and his national security team, I \noutlined the importance of messaging to our overall success in \nAfghanistan and Pakistan. For too long, the United States has flailed \nabout with an uncoordinated communication plan. In other words, we have \nbeen off message.\n  Unfortunately, the enemy has continued to hone its own message. \nRadical Islamic terrorists have staged suicide attacks for maximum \npublicity, propagandizing their message on the Internet, and convinced \ntheir fellow terrorists-at-arms that they will defeat the international \ncommunity.\n  Negative and indecisive comments by the President, broadcast \nworldwide, have now given the enemy a big win in the public information \nbattle.\n  On CNN, the President questioned: ``Are we pursuing the right \nstrategy?''\n  On NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' the President's words were even more \ndisturbing, signaling a lack of confidence in his earlier strategy. The \nPresident said:\n\n       If an expanded counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan \n     contributes to the goal of defeating al-Qaida, then we will \n     move forward. But, if it doesn't, then I'm not interested in \n     just being in Afghanistan for the sake of being in \n     Afghanistan or saving face or . . . sending a message that \n     America is here for the duration.\n\n  Comments such as these call into doubt America's commitment to \nAfghanistan. They give hope to the terrorists--hope that America's \nresolve is not real, and that they only need to wait us out to win the \nwar.\n  The people of Afghanistan get the message that we are leaving soon. \nThe implied message is that you better work with the Taliban and al-\nQaida, because they will be here after America leaves. This is a public \nbonanza in diplomacy for our terrorist enemies.\n  At the same time, these comments have done a great disservice to our \nmen and women serving in harm's way. These heroes need our country's \nunwavering support, not vacillation because of political pressures.\n  President Obama's recent comments present a stark and dangerous \ncontrast to his earlier resolve--resolve that I applauded on this floor \nand publicly and proudly supported. When President Obama commissioned \nGeneral McChrystal's assessment of the situation in Afghanistan, I \nbelieved that he was genuinely interested in receiving the general's \nexpert, on-the-ground perspective and his informed opinion of what \nstrategic and tactical changes would be required for success.\n  Unfortunately, it now appears that the President has developed a \nsudden case of buyer's remorse. It seems increasingly clear to me the \nObama administration is inclined to reject the counterinsurgency \nstrategy recently recommended by General McChrystal and endorsed by the \nhead of the U.S. Central Command, GEN David Petraeus and the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ADM Mike Mullen. In a bewildering twist, \nthis is the same counterinsurgency strategy the President himself \nendorsed this past March.\n  I have been a strong and vocal supporter of the administration's new \nstrategy in Afghanistan, so I was particularly disappointed by the \nPresident's suggestion this past Sunday that he is reconsidering the \nAmerican commitment to the war in Afghanistan.\n  I am also deeply disturbed by press reports that Defense Secretary \nGates will delay sending General McChrystal's troop request to the \nWhite House because the White House is not ready to receive it. Given \nthe President's resolve this spring, I am somewhat puzzled by the \nstrange treatment of General McChrystal's assessment and troop request. \nUnnecessary delay is not our friend in this war.\n  The clearest reason for this delay seems to be that the President is \nconsidering not granting General McChrystal's request. Instead, we are \nnow hearing that he may push for a more aggressive covert war against \nal-Qaida leadership in Pakistan.\n  We all want to eliminate the al-Qaida leadership that plotted and \nplanned the attacks that claimed more than 3,000 American lives on \nSeptember 11. And depending on the details, more aggressive action in \nPakistan may be a good thing. But such action should be in addition to, \nnot a substitute for, giving our troops in Afghanistan all the \nresources and supporting personnel they need to succeed.\n  While denying al-Qaida and Taliban militants sanctuary in the border \nregions of Pakistan is critical, a counterterrorism-only approach, \nfocusing on one part of this regional conflict, will ultimately hand \nvictory to the world's most violent and feared terrorists. This type of \ncounterterrorism-only approach failed us in Iraq and it has failed us \nin Afghanistan for the last 7 years.\n\n[[Page S9767]]\n\n  I have consistently called for--and President Obama had promised--a \ncomprehensive counterinsurgency strategy designed to meet a set of \nclearly defined goals for the Afghanistan-Pakistan region. The Obama \nadministration has rightly characterized the problem as involving both \nof these two countries. But right now, we have a plan only for one \ncountry.\n  I am not suggesting it is General McChrystal's job to set that wider. \nAs directed by the President and by our NATO allies whom he represents \nas commander of ISAF, the general has laid out a good strategy for \nsuccess in Afghanistan and that strategy includes a request for more \nboots on the ground. I understand there is a lot of hand-wringing in \nWashington right now over Afghanistan. We saw the same reaction over \nsending more troops into Iraq 2 years ago. The political courage shown \nby the White House and Congress back then proved to be successful. \nToday, we must marshal the same courage and give General McChrystal \nwhat he needs to get the job done.\n  Amid the reports of wavering and hand-wringing, an important question \ncomes into mind: What has changed? During the campaign and after his \ninauguration, the President spoke repeatedly about the importance of \nwinning the war in Afghanistan.\n  For example, on March 27, 2009, when he rolled out his comprehensive \nnew strategy for Pakistan and Afghanistan, the President declared that:\n\n       To succeed, we and our friends and allies must reverse the \n     Taliban's games and promote a more capable and accountable \n     Afghan government. Our troops have fought bravely against a \n     ruthless enemy. Our civilians have made great sacrifices. Our \n     allies have borne a heavy burden. Afghans have suffered and \n     sacrificed for their future. But for six years, Afghanistan \n     has been denied the resources that it demands because of the \n     war in Iraq. Now, we must make a commitment that can \n     accomplish our goals.\n\n  I was heartened by these words. I agreed with the President on the \nneed for a fully resourced counterinsurgency campaign and a solid \ncommitment to ensure the security of the Afghan people and our own \nvital interests. I applauded his recognition of winning this war when \nhe told our veterans, the VFW, this past August:\n\n       Those who attacked America on 9/11 are plotting to do so \n     again. If left unchecked, the Taliban insurgency will be an \n     even larger safe haven from which al-Qaida would plot to kill \n     more Americans. So this is not only a war worth fighting; \n     this is fundamental to the defense of our people.\n\n  But our troops in the field have now been waiting over 6 months for \nthe President to follow through on his promises. As General \nMcChrystal's recently leaked assessment points out, time is of the \nessence, and we cannot afford more stalling by the administration on \nthis vital national security issue.\n\n  The general said the next 9 to 12 months are critical and that is why \nwe need a decision now. I call on the President to heed his own words \nfrom this past weekend. Let's ignore the politics of the moment and \nfinish the job in Afghanistan.\n  I recognize we have not yet seen any official numbers associated with \nGeneral McChrystal's troop request, but I am very encouraged by the \ngeneral's emphasis on putting more of an Afghan face on operations. I \nbelieve our ultimate success depends on our ability to hand \nresponsibility for security over to Afghans.\n  I was also gratified to see the report's strong emphasis on the \nimportance of ``smart power'' to achieving success. While the \nassessment does not actually use the term, the concept is woven into \nthe core of the report. General McChrystal and others have been clear \nthat traditional kinetic military efforts alone will not achieve the \nsuccess we need. Success will be attainable only if we maximize the \nability of nonmilitary agencies of the United States Government to work \nthrough Afghan institutions to achieve stability, reconstruction, and \nthe rule of law.\n  As I have said repeatedly on the floor, the efforts by the National \nGuard, led by my own Missouri National Guard, to bring agricultural \nexperts, including full-time farmers who also serve as trained military \nsoldiers, who have gone into Nangarhar Province and in 1 year \ntransformed the agriculture of Afghanistan so they could make a greater \nprofit from raising legitimate crops and taking Afghanistan and \nNangarhar Province from the No. 2 poppy-producing province in the \nnation down to almost zero poppy production. Six more National Guards \nfrom different States are there now. More are coming. Two weeks ago, I \nchallenged all of the Nation's National Guard and their commanders at \ntheir meeting in Nashville to commit to send a National Guard unit from \nevery State to an appropriate province where they can help, and they \ncan make a difference. That is part of smart power. They need to bring \nthe economic resources and the structures and the information and \nexperience we have, protected by soldiers and airmen of the National \nGuard who can defend themselves and those they are protecting. That is \nsmart power.\n  In the McChrystal report, the Afghan Defense Minister rejected the \npopular myth that Afghanistan is a graveyard of empires and we are \ndestined to fail there. I couldn't agree more. As General McChrystal \naffirmed in his report: ``While the situation is serious, success is \nstill achievable.''

Madam President, I rise to discuss America's \nrelationship with our Eastern European friends as well as the \nchallenges America faces in our relationship with Russia.\n  Over the last decade in the Senate, I have been a champion of NATO \nand worked diligently to increase membership in the alliance. I have \nalso been active in improving our image in Eastern Europe through the \nexpansion of the Visa Waiver Program at the request of our friends and \nallies in Eastern Europe. My passion for foreign relations stems in \nlarge part as a supporter of Ohio's diverse ethnic communities. As \nmayor of Cleveland and Governor of Ohio, I gained a keen understanding \nof Europe from my close work with constituents who had ties to \ncountries that were once subject to life behind the Iron Curtain. This \ngoes back to my first paper in undergraduate school and how the United \nStates sold out Yugoslavia at Teheran and Yalta.\n  We did see the Berlin Wall fall and the Iron Curtain torn thanks in \npart to the efforts of Pope John Paul II, President Reagan, and \nPresident George H.W. Bush. But even with the end of the Cold War, I \nwas deeply concerned that darker forces in Russia could once again \nreemerge as a threat to democracy, human rights, and religious freedom \nnot just for the Russian people but for the newly freed ``captive \nnations'' of Eastern Europe.\n  I understood getting those nations into NATO could make the alliance \nmore vibrant and healthy and give them safe harbor from the possible \nthreat of Russian expansionism. One of my proudest moments in the \nSenate was being present at Prague in March of 2002 in the room when \nLord Robertson announced that seven countries--Bulgaria, Estonia, \nLatvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia--were invited to \njoin NATO.\n  When I was Governor of Ohio and chairman of the National Governors \nAssociation, I led an effort in 1998 to\n\n[[Page S9768]]\n\nsecure passage of an all-50-State resolution in support of NATO \nexpansion for the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland. These new \nmembers have brought great vigor to the NATO Alliance and are now some \nof our strongest allies working alongside our troops in Iraq and \nAfghanistan--especially Afghanistan.\n  As such, I was astounded last week to see the Obama administration \nappear to turn its back on some of our staunchest NATO allies. Last \nweek's missile defense announcement was made with little advance notice \nor consultation and disregarded the great political capital expended by \nthe leaders of Poland and the Czech Republic. This decision leaves the \nimpression that the United States is dealing unilaterally with Russia \nwithout regard to our NATO allies. Regardless of the merits of the \ndecision itself--and I had a chance to talk to Secretary Gates about \nit, and it makes sense that this was a good decision--the manner in \nwhich it was revealed to Warsaw and Prague was a major public relations \nand public diplomacy blunder.\n  The Polish people are up in arms about the decision--and not so much \nwith the decision, but the way it was handled and the disregard for \nhandling it in a proper fashion. The fact also that the decision was \nannounced on September 17, 2009, the 70th anniversary of the Soviet \ninvasion of Poland, makes it even worse. The way this decision was \ncommunicated shabbily to Poland and the Czech Republic should also send \na shiver down the spines of our brothers and sisters in Eastern Europe \nand their Baltic neighbors, who are concerned with Russia's aggressive \nefforts to reassert its influence in what was once the Soviet Union.\n  In an opinion piece in last Friday's edition of the Washington Post, \nDavid J. Kramer, of the German Marshall Fund, notes that:\n\n       Whatever the official explanation now for not moving \n     forward, many--including the Kremlin--will read this shift as \n     an effort to placate Moscow. Announcing the decision ahead of \n     [President] Obama's meeting with Russian President Dmitry \n     Medvedev this week in Pittsburgh reinforces such thinking.\n\n  I had the opportunity this past July to travel to the Baltic States \nwith my friends Senators Durbin, Cardin, and Wicker as part of the U.S. \ndelegation to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, \nto the parliamentary assembly that was held in Vilnius, Lithuania. As \npart of that trip, I also visited Riga, Latvia--a stop that marked the \nhighest ranking official visit of the United States in Latvia in over 3 \nyears. In all of our bilateral meetings with Presidents, Prime \nMinisters, and Foreign Ministers from former Soviet countries or \ncountries the Soviet Union exercised influence over, we were told it \nwas comforting for them to know their membership in NATO serves as a \nhedge against a potential expansionist Russia.\n  We should be worried about the uncertainty surrounding a Russia that \nis reverting back to a KGB-ruled country seeking to weaponize its oil \nand natural gas resources as a means to expand its influence on Europe \nand the West.\n  I think one of the concerns we all ought to have is that many members \nof the European Union, instead of coming together and negotiating with \nRussia over the issue of natural gas, are cutting their own deals. I \nthink we should be very concerned that in the long run many of those \ncountries are not going to be able to make good decisions because of \nthe influence Russia will have over their natural gas resources.\n  Russia has the world's largest reserves of natural gas and has the \neighth-largest oil reserves. Moscow turned off the tap to Ukraine this \npast winter. They could do it again. We should also be concerned about \nMoscow using its control of oil and natural gas to pit members of NATO \nagainst each other.\n  There is much talk about resetting the U.S. bilateral relationship \nwith Russia. Moscow seeks to regain its global stature and be respected \nas a peer in the international community. There is nothing inherently \nwrong with this.\n  I believe there are key areas where the United States and Russia \nshare common cause and concern: Russia is a permanent member of the \nU.N. Security Council and will be essential to effective multilateral \npressure on Iran to give up its nuclear program; Russia continues to \nhave leverage on the North Korean regime and has stated that a nuclear-\nfree Korean peninsula is in the interest of both our countries; we are \npartners on the International Space Station--in fact, we are going to \nrely on them to send our NASA people to the space station; and, until \nthe Georgia situation flared in August of last year, our government and \nU.S. industry were working hard on a nuclear cooperation agreement with \nRussia, very much like the one we entered into with India.\n  With the world economy as it is today, the worst thing we could do is \nbreak off communication and revert back to our Cold War positions. This \nweek's G-20 conference in Pittsburgh is an opportunity to further \nengage Russia and determine where we have a symbiotic relationship and \nwhat we can accomplish together for the good of the international \ncommunity. Nevertheless, such a reset should not come at the expense of \nour Eastern European friends.\n  Time will tell whether last week's decision will have any influence \non Russian cooperation on the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty--START--\nor our efforts to prevent a nuclear-armed Iranian regime.\n  In the meantime, we have our work cut out as we seek to rebuild \nconfidence and trust with our friends in Eastern Europe. After last \nweek's events, I suspect that their confidence in the reliability of \nthe United States as a partner and ally has been shaken.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, in my home State of Illinois, there are \nroughly 44,000 people living with HIV or AIDS.\n  Every day, these Americans face deadly illnesses that require \ndelicate--and often expensive--treatment.\n  Thankfully, they don't have to fight this fight alone.\n  Across America, about 500,000 HIV patients who don't have adequate \nincome or insurance are currently able to receive assistance under the \nRyan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act.\n  This program supports a wide range of medical and support services \nthat benefit HIV and AIDS patients.\n  Illinois alone receives $75 million in Federal funds that serve more \nthan 10,000 people.\n  These programs make a real difference, not just in my home State, but \nin every State in the Union.\n  They are critically important not only for the people who receive \ntreatment, but for public health in general.\n  That is why we cannot let the Ryan White Act expire on September 30.\n  If we do not take action right now to reauthorize this program, the \ntreatments will stop.\n  If we do not stand up for those who need our help, half a million \nAmericans will suddenly find themselves out in the cold.\n  We cannot let that happen. We must act now keep this safety net in \nplace.\n  That's why I support a 3-year extension of the Ryan White Treatment \nModernization Act.\n  But we shouldn't stop there.\n  As we reauthorize this legislation, it is a great opportunity to make \na few small changes to make it more effective.\n  We should update the Ryan White Act, to make HIV/AIDS information \nmore accurate.\n  We need to maintain transitional grant areas, so that essential \nservices can be better matched with existing needs.\n  We should make sure medical transportation and dietary treatments are \ncovered for all patients.\n  And we should use common sense to ensure that rebates and grants are\n\n[[Page S9769]]\n\nclassified and awarded the right way, with less bureaucratic redtape.\n  This will make the system more efficient, and it will increase the \nimpact this program can have on people's lives.\n  More than 250 AIDS organizations have already expressed support for \nthese changes, and for the reauthorization of this program.\n  It is time to stand with them.\n  It is time to stand with all the people who need treatment.\n  Let us send a strong message to those who are counting on us to keep \nthe money flowing:\n  We will not abandon you in your time of need.\n  If this Senate fails to act by September 30, the aid will stop.\n  These successful programs--which enjoy broad, bipartisan support--\nwill simply cease to exist.\n  We cannot let that happen on our watch.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with me in updating and reauthorizing the \nRyan White Act.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, first of all, we have a unanimous consent \nagreement that has taken a lot of work. I appreciate the work of the \ntwo managers, Senator Feinstein and Senator Alexander. It is not easy, \nbut this is an important piece of legislation. I think it is good for \nthe body.\n  I heard my friend--I will be real quick; I know we are in a hurry--\ncommenting on the dinner we had last night. I think that was such a \ntimely, fortuitous event we had with Senators getting together to, in \neffect, cut the ribbon on this wonderful picture out there, 147 years \nold.\n  I did not know much about Henry Clay other than he is a famous man \nbut a great compromiser. He said everything legislatively you need to \ndevelop a consensus. Legislation is the art of compromise. This is a \nsmaller piece; it is not Henry Clay stuff, but it is good stuff. I \nappreciate the two managers following in the footsteps of Henry Clay \nand we were able to work this out.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following be the only first-degree \namendments and an Ensign motion to recommit, other than the pending \namendments, remaining in order to H.R. 2996, Interior appropriations; \nand that no second-degree amendments be in order to any of the listed \namendments prior to a vote in relation to the amendment, except as \nnoted with respect to Coburn amendment No. 2511; that a managers' \namendment also be in order that has been cleared by the managers and \nthe leaders, and that if that amendment is offered, then the vote on \nadoption of the amendment occur immediately; and that if agreed to, \nthen the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the \ntable:\n  Carper No. 2456, pending, to be withdrawn once a managers' amendment \nhas been agreed to; Collins No. 2498, pending; Isakson No. 2504, as \nmodified, pending; Vitter No. 2549; Ensign motion to recommit; Coburn \namendment Nos. 2482, 2463, 2480, 2523, 2466, 2483, 2468, and 2511, with \na Feinstein second-degree amendment in order to No. 2511; Feingold No. \n2522, to be withdrawn upon the adoption of the managers' amendment; \nReid No. 2531; Bingaman No. 2493, with a modification; further, that \nduring the consideration of the bill, Senators Murkowski and Thune each \nbe provided up to 30 minutes, and Senator Boxer for up to 60 minutes \nfor debate only; that upon disposition of all amendments and the motion \nto recommit, the substitute amendment, as amended, be agreed to, the \nmotion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that \nthe bill, as amended, be read a third time, and the Senate then proceed \nto vote on passage of the bill; that upon passage, the Senate insist on \nits amendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses, and that the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees on the part of the Senate, and that the subcommittee plus \nSenators Inouye and Bond be appointed as conferees; further, that if a \npoint of order is raised against the substitute amendment, then it be \nin order for another substitute amendment to be offered minus the \noffending provisions but including any amendments which had been agreed \nto prior to the point of order; that no further amendments be in order; \nthat the new substitute amendment be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; and that the \nremaining provisions beyond adoption of the substitute amendment remain \nin effect; that if there is a sequence of votes, then after the first \nvote, the succeeding votes be limited to 10 minutes each and that there \nbe 2 minutes of debate prior to each vote, equally divided and \ncontrolled in the usual form; that once this agreement is entered, the \ncloture motions be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as part of the unanimous consent \nagreement entered into this morning by the leader, a managers' package \nof amendments to the Interior bill is in order.\n  I would like to proceed to that business now because of yesterday's \nfiling deadline for all first-degree amendments. Each of these \namendments which constitute the managers' package have been filed at \nthe desk.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside, and that the following amendments be called up and considered en \nbloc, and where modifications are noted, that those modifications be \nagreed to: Bingaman amendment No. 2492; Risch amendment No. 2501; \nCarper amendment No. 2505; Roberts amendment No. 2509; Feinstein \namendment No. 2518; Feinstein amendment No. 2519; Feingold amendment \nNo. 2522; Whitehouse amendment No. 2534, as modified; Bingaman \namendment No. 2491, as modified; Schumer/Durbin amendment No. 2495; \nTester/Crapo amendment No. 2507; and, Bingaman amendment No. 2493, as \nmodified.\n  Let me make one note with respect to Carper amendment No. 2505. The \namendment being included in the managers' package is very similar to \npending Carper amendment No. 2456.

Lamar Alexander,\n     Subcommittee on Interior, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairmen and Ranking Members, I am offering three \n     amendments regarding congressionally directed spending items \n     on the Senate floor to the Fiscal Year 2010 Interior, \n     Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill.\n       Consistent with the requirements of paragraph 9 of Rule \n     XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I certify that \n     neither I nor my immediate family has a pecuniary interest in \n     the congressionally directed spending items that I have \n     requested for Fiscal Year 2010. I further certify that I have \n     posted a description of the items requested on my official \n     website, along with the accompanying justification.\n     Project Title: Lake County, California, for wastewater system \n         improvements\n     Recipient: Lake County, CA\n     Location: 230 A Main Street, Lakeport, CA 95453\n     Amount Requested: $500,000\n       Lake County is upgrading the Kelseyville wastewater system \n     to eliminate effluent and high nutrient pollution from \n     entering Clear Lake. The facility, which is located on the \n     south shore of Clear Lake, is under cease and desist orders \n     to meet clean water standards, and requires expansion \n     overflows into Clear Lake. This important project will \n     improve sanitation and water quality for County residents by \n     limiting sewage overflow.\n     Project Title: Tahoe Basin Vessel Inspection Station\n     Recipient: U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\n     Location: Lake Tahoe, California and Nevada\n     Amount Requested: $800,000\n       The requested funding will be used for study, construction, \n     staffing, and other expenses necessary to conduct water \n     vessel inspection and decontamination at stations located \n     away from boat and vessel ramps at Lake Tahoe and Echo Lake \n     and Fallen Leaf Lake in California. The Tahoe Basin is under \n     threat of Quagga and zebra mussel infestations because of its \n     high-use by recreational boaters. An infestation could have \n     devastating impacts on the regional economy, including \n     recreation, tourism, property values, and other \n     infrastructure equaling approximately $22 million a year. If \n     introduced, Quagga and zebra mussels could destroy the \n     region's fisheries, alter the food web and ecosystem, \n     jeopardize the public drinking supply, and ruin the shoreline \n     and public access points. An infestation would also \n     jeopardize more than $1.43 billion that has already been \n     invested in environmental restoration and water clarity \n     improvements in Lake Tahoe, including $424 million from the \n     Federal government.\n     Project Title: Inland Empire Alternative Water Supply\n     Recipient: City of San Bernardino Municipal Water Department\n     Location: 300 North ``D'' Street, San Bernardino, CA 92418\n     Amount Requested: Technical Correction\n       The Rialto-Colton Basin is seriously contaminated by \n     perchlorate, and the cities and water districts in the area \n     have had to abandon wells or install wellhead treatment\n\n[[Page S9771]]\n\n     equipment to use their groundwater. Local water providers \n     have found a temporary source of 20,000-30,000 acre-feet in \n     the Bunker Hill Basin, within the incorporated limits of the \n     City of San Bernardino, which will use this water source in \n     the long-term. I secured $500,000 in the Fiscal Year 2009 \n     Omnibus Appropriations Act, but the San Bernardino Municipal \n     Water Department has been unable to access these funds and \n     this technical correction will clarify that the city is the \n     recipient of this funding.\n       Thank you for your consideration of my requests.

It was part of the managers' package.\n  The majority leader.\n\n\n                           Health Care Debate\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this past April, as the health care debate \nwas getting underway, I sent my Republican counterpart, Senator \nMcConnell, a letter outlining our priorities for the debate. I wrote, \nof course, that Democrats are committed to lowering health care costs, \nexpanding access, and improving the quality of care. I said that we \nlook forward to a dialog about how to prevent diseases, reduce health \ndisparities, and encourage both early detection and effective \ntreatments that save lives. But in that letter of 5 months ago, I also \nsaid that in order to help struggling Americans, we cannot drown in \ndistractions and distortions. I made clear that bipartisanship depended \non Republicans demonstrating a sincere interest in legislating. It \ndepends on their joining us to offer concrete and constructive \nproposals, even if we disagree on the content of those ideas. It \ndepends on us working together in our common interests rather than \nagainst each other and against the interests of the American people.\n  I stand by that assessment as strongly today as I did this spring. It \nis painfully clear to everyone who has seen this debate's disturbing \nturns and dishonest tactics that more than ever, we now need people \nwilling to work together in good faith. If we have learned anything \nfrom the recent rhetoric, both in our respective States and here in the \nSenate, it is that we need honest debate. It is regrettable that we \nhave seen far too little of that lately.\n  Today, I want to talk about one area of the debate that has seen \nparticularly reckless rumors and scare tactics--what health insurance \nreform will mean to seniors.\n  A Republican Congresswoman recently claimed that our plan to improve \nhealth care would ``put seniors in a position of being put to death by \ntheir government.'' That was wrong when it was said, and it is wrong \nnow. A Republican Senator made a similar statement to mislead his \nconstituents. He actually accused Democrats of proposing a plan that \nwould kill Americans. Others pretend our reforms will cut benefits \nwhen, in fact, the only thing they cut is waste. Is this any way to \nhave an honest debate? I don't think so. Is this what our constituents \nsent us here to do? I don't think so. Some of our friends on the other \nside may not want to let reality get in the way of a good sound bite, \nbut I think it is crucial that we get the facts straight.\n  The fact is, ever since a Democratic Congress and Democratic \nPresident created Medicare, Democrats have spent the past 40 years \nprotecting seniors.\n  I know a little bit about Medicare. My first elective job in Nevada \nwas on a countywide hospital board. It was then called the Southern \nNevada Memorial Hospital. It is now called the University Medical \nCenter. When I started my job, 40 percent of seniors who came into that \nhospital had no insurance. We had an aggressive plan to go after their \nfathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, whoever signed for them. That is \nno longer the case with Medicare. Virtually every senior who comes into \nthat institution and all institutions has insurance to cover their \nhospitalizations. It is called Medicare. By the time I left that job, \nMedicare had come into existence.\n  The fact is, ever since Republicans opposed the creation of Medicare, \nthey have spent the past 40 years on the wrong side of history when it \ncomes to helping seniors. They were wrong then, and they are wrong now.\n  I don't carry much in my wallet. I have three credit cards. I have a \nfew dollars. One thing I always carry with me is something I think is \npretty important. I have carried this for years. You can see how wilted \nit is. I have done it for many years because I want to be able to quote \naccurately what I am talking about here. Republicans have hated \nMedicare from the very beginning, and they still hate it.\n\n       I was there fighting the fight, one of twelve voting \n     against Medicare because we knew it wouldn't work in 1965.\n\n  Robert Dole, former leader of the Republicans in the Senate, \ncandidate for President on the Republican ticket, that is what he said.\n\n       Now, we didn't get rid of it in round one because we don't \n     think it is politically smart, but we believe Medicare is \n     going to wither on the vine.\n\n  Newt Gingrich. I am not making this up. This is what they said.\n  Dick Armey, majority leader a few years ago in the House of \nRepresentatives:\n\n       Medicare has no place in a free world.\n\n  When I say that since Democrats created Medicare, we have spent 40 \nyears protecting America's seniors, the fact is, ever since the \nRepublicans opposed the creation of Medicare, they have spent the past \n40 years on the wrong side of history when it comes to helping seniors. \nThey were wrong then. They are wrong now. They conveniently ignore \nfacts such as that in 1965, only half the Nation's seniors had health \ninsurance. Today, virtually every senior has health insurance. It is \ncalled Medicare. Is it a perfect program? Of course, it is not. But it \nis a pretty good program. Seniors' life expectancy has gone up and the \nnumber of seniors living in poverty has gone down. Those on Medicare \nuniversally like it.\n  People complain about this program. Do you know what the overhead is \non this program? It is less than 3 percent. It is one of the most \neffective programs in the history of the country. But that hasn't \nstopped Republicans from bragging about trying to kill Medicare. It \nhasn't stopped them from looking out for insurance companies instead of \ntheir constituents. And in the past 10 years, it hasn't stopped \nRepublicans from voting against protecting and strengthening Medicare \n59 times. Look at this. These are the votes by year. Just last year, \nthese are the votes. I hope this year's reform will not be No. 60 \nbecause this bill will also protect and strengthen Medicare.\n  There will be an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to offer \namendments to whatever bill comes out of the Finance Committee and out \nof the HELP Committee, and they will be melded together. What our \nlegislation does is lower the cost of medicine. It provides a free \nyearly checkup, makes preventive care for seniors free. It will give \ndoctors who treat seniors a raise, and it will cut waste from Medicare. \nFor seniors, health insurance reform will mean all of that.\n  Rather than having a serious and real debate about a serious and real \ncrisis, some would prefer to deploy tactics to frighten the American \npeople. But what really frightens them is that under the status quo, \nthey live just one\n\n[[Page S9776]]\n\nillness, one accident, one pink slip away from losing everything they \nhave.\n  This is no time to let partisanship get the best of us. This is no \ntime to obsess over rumors or oppose ideas simply because they were \nproposed by people who sit on a different side of this Chamber. This is \nno time to instill unfounded fears or incite hope that our Nation's \nleaders fail.\n  This is the time to get serious about making it easy for American \ncitizens to afford and live healthy lives. When it comes to \nRepublicans' attacks on Medicare, the messenger has no credibility and \nthe message is nothing more than an excuse. At the end of the day, the \nother side's insistence on spreading fear above all else is what will \ntruly hurt seniors and all Americans.\n  Our opponents' claims this time around are as disingenuous as they \nhave been and phony at worst--disingenuous because they have a long \ntrack record of standing in the way of giving America's seniors what \nthey need, phony because they completely and willfully misrepresent \nwhat the bills we are considering will actually do for seniors. Our \nbill will lower the cost of medicine, provide a free yearly checkup, \nmake preventive care free, give doctors who treat seniors a raise, and \ncut waste from Medicare. That is what it is all about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the majority leader, Mr. President, because a lot \nhas been said in this health care debate that needs to be clarified. I \nhave been on the floor--how many times--when the Republican leadership \nhas come to the floor and told us that if we are not careful in health \ncare reform, we will end up with a government-run health insurance \nprogram. They have warned us: Be careful. Government run health \ninsurance, it is socialism, too much government. I am waiting for the \nfirst Republican Senator to come to the floor and say: So we should \nabolish Medicare; we ought to get rid of Medicaid, which is for the \npoorest people, and we ought to get rid of veterans health care, \nanother government program, and the Children's Health Insurance Program \nthat makes health insurance affordable all across the United States. If \none follows the Republican logic, they are all government health \ninsurance programs.\n  Traditionally, the Republican Party has not embraced the concept. \nLet's be honest about it. They have a different view. They would like \ngovernment to step aside and let the market work its will. Have you \nnoticed what the market is working? The market is working its will in \nhealth insurance, and we are seeing private, for-profit health \ninsurance companies making a fortune, denying one out of five people \nthe coverage they thought they had, raising their costs every single \nyear. That is the reality of the private market.\n  When it comes to Medicare, a program created under President Lyndon \nJohnson more than 40 years ago, 45 million Americans have the peace of \nmind to know they have basic health insurance protection. Do you know \nwho these people are? They are folks who worked their whole lives, paid \nmoney out of their paychecks to be part of Medicare so that they would \nhave not only the peace of mind but quality health care in their \nretirement years. It is not just the peace of mind of having access to \ngood health care, it is the peace of mind of knowing that all the money \nyou worked for your entire life to save, the money you wanted to live \non in comfort after retirement would not disappear because of medical \nbills. Medicare gives people peace of mind and protects their assets so \nthey can live independently, comfortably, in the kind of style most of \nus dream of for all Americans who have worked so hard for many years.\n  We hear the other side tell us how bad those government health \ninsurance programs are. The administrative costs of Medicare are \ndramatically lower than the cost of private health insurance. It is \nobvious. Medicare is a not-for-profit entity. It is managed at a cost \nof about 3 percent. Do you know what happens with health insurance \ncompanies? They load up with costs for profit. They load up with costs \nfor advertising and marketing.\n  They load up with people who get on the telephone to say: No--no to \nyour doctor. You know what I am talking about. When the doctor says: I \nthink the best thing for you is this procedure, and you are under \nprivate health insurance, that last stop in that medical decision is \nnot at the hospital or in the doctor's office; the last stop is a long-\ndistance phone call to some clerk sitting out in Omaha, NE, with a \nmanual in front of him or her, and the first words at the top of the \npage say: Say no. Raise questions. Tell them you will get back to them.\n  Am I making this up? I am not. I have example after example from my \nhome State of Illinois, from people I have met during the course of my \nservice in the Senate and the House, and people I met this last summer \nwho will verify that.\n  So when the Republicans come to the floor to criticize us and say \nthey are the guardians of Medicare, it does not square with their \ntraditional position of opposing Medicare, with their efforts to cut \nMedicare over the years and the fact that when we talk about Medicare \nand its future, they are nowhere to be found.\n  This is a critical health care debate we are facing. I admit the \nPresident has stuck his neck out a mile. It takes some courage to do it \nbecause he knows it is a controversial issue. President Obama said to \nus in a joint session of Congress: If this were easy somebody would \nhave done it a long time ago. But he is going to take this on, and he \nsaid to us publicly and privately he will spend every penny of \npolitical capital he has to get it done. It means that much to him and \nto our Nation.\n  So for seniors this is a critical debate. A lot of seniors are being \nmisled by things that are downright awful. I saw the videotape. This \nRepublican Congresswoman went to the floor of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives and said that: Oh, these Democrats want to create death \npanels. Sarah Palin said that those death panels would take the life of \none of her children or something. That is an outrageous statement and \nnot true.\n  Do you know what they are talking about? They are talking about an \namendment offered by a Georgia Senator--a Republican Georgia Senator--\nJohnny Isakson--a reasonable amendment. Do you know what it said? Under \nour health care reform, people should be allowed to go to a doctor and, \nin privacy and in confidence, sit down and say the words that need to \nbe said--words like: Listen, I don't want to be hooked up to some \nmachine. When the time comes, I want to go peacefully. I don't want \nextraordinary things done for me. That is my wish and, doctor, I want \nyou to know that wish. I am going to tell my family, but I want you to \nknow.\n  Is that an important conversation? Any one of us--and so many of us \nfit in this category, who have been through one of those situations \nwith a parent, a member of our family, or someone we love--wants to \nknow what they want.\n  So Senator Isakson proposed that amendment. It was a thoughtful, \nreasonable amendment that we brought into this debate. What happened to \nit? You know what happened: death panels. Oh, they are going in there. \nThey are going to mandate that they pull the plug on Granny. That is \nsad. It is unfortunate. It shows a lack of maturity and judgment by \nthose who are making those charges. And we have heard them from the \nhalls of Congress and outside. What we are talking about here is health \ncare reform this country needs but health care reform that will \nactually benefit Medicare beneficiaries.\n  As shown on this chart, this is basically what we hope to do for \nseniors when it comes to health insurance reform.\n  First, we want to lower the cost of medicine. Ask seniors about \nMedicare's prescription drug plan, and they will tell you: Well, it is \ngood, but if you have a lot of drugs and they are very expensive--\nsomehow or other Congress dreamed up something called the ``doughnut \nhole.'' What it basically means is, for some period of time each year, \nthose seniors who need drug protection the most are on their own. They \nhave to start spending out of their pocket. We close the doughnut hole, \nlowering the cost of medicine for seniors under Medicare.\n  We provide for that free yearly checkup that can make all the \ndifference in the world. A senior who gets to go in and check up with \nthe doctor regularly is one who is likely going to\n\n[[Page S9777]]\n\nspot something before it becomes serious where it can be treated \nsuccessfully. That makes good sense. Seniors across America will \nappreciate that. That is part of our plan.\n  Preventive care is free. We are talking about mammograms, \ncolonoscopies, blood tests for prostate cancer. These things will be \nfree under the health care reform we are talking about for senior \ncitizens and for virtually everyone in America.\n  Giving doctors who treat seniors compensation for the care they are \nproviding. We want doctors who are professional enough to include \nMedicare patients in their practice to be compensated fairly.\n  Finally, cut waste from Medicare. I want to say a word about this. I \ngot on this ``Meet The Press'' program. I get on there once in a while \non Sunday mornings. I think they put me on because I am free. But for \nwhatever reason, I was on there, and I was in debate with Newt \nGingrich. You know Newt Gingrich, former Republican Speaker of the \nHouse of Representatives, the spokesman for many parts of his party \ntoday.\n  I said: It bothers me when people say health care reform is going to \ncut Medicare. Let me tell you what we have in mind. A few years ago, \nthe private insurance companies came to us and said: We can do a better \njob at a lower cost in providing Medicare benefits. Well, some people \nwere skeptical.\n  They said: Let us prove it. The government is doing this all wrong. \nLet the private health insurance companies do it. We will show you, and \nwe will call it Medicare Advantage.\n  Off they went providing these Medicare Advantage programs that were \nto match the benefits under Medicare. The jury came in a few years \nlater, and, do you know what, many of these plans cost up to 14 percent \nmore than Medicare. They did not save us money. It ended up these \nprivate health insurance companies not only did not make their point \nabout being cheaper, they cost the taxpayers more money than we should \nhave paid out. They did not provide additional benefits for Medicare \nrecipients that they needed.\n  They want us to continue to subsidize these private health insurance \ncompanies that have failed in their offer to beat Medicare at its own \ngame. So when we say, and the President says, we want to cut the \nsubsidy to health insurance companies under Medicare, that is what he \nand we are talking about. If they did not keep their end of the bargain \nto provide medical care at the same cost or less cost than Medicare, \nwhy should we continue to subsidize them? I do not think we should.\n  I said that on the show, and the next person to speak was former \nSpeaker Newt Gingrich, who said: Well, that proves our point. Durbin \nwants to cut Medicare.\n  Well, fortunately for me, Dr. Howard Dean, the former Governor of \nVermont, was on the panel, and he corrected him. He said: Mr. Gingrich, \nhe didn't say cut Medicare. He said cut the subsidy to the health \ninsurance companies that are taking advantage of Medicare to profiteer, \ntake that extra money and provide the kind of care we need for seniors, \nand make sure, in the process, we save the Medicare Program.\n  Untouched, our Medicare Program is going to suffer from the same \nthing everybody else suffers from in America: the escalating cost of \nhealth care. We have to do something. We have to keep our promise, not \nonly to the seniors today, but to the many who will come after them, \nthat Medicare will be there when they need it, that when they reach the \nage of 65, they will have the peace of mind of knowing they can still \ngo to their doctor, still go to their hospital, get quality care, and \nnot have a catastrophic illness that wipes out their savings.\n  This is a debate which is worth getting into. I hope those who follow \nit understand this party on this side of the aisle fought to create \nMedicare, fought to protect Medicare, and now is fighting to save \nMedicare. Do not let those who come before us, misleading us about what \nwe are trying to achieve here, mislead the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am not so sure, given what is happening \nin the country these days, it would be very easy to enact the Medicare \nProgram, had we not done so previously. The Medicare Program was \nenacted at a time when one-half of the senior citizens in this country \nhad no health care--none. That is not surprising because the fact is, \ninsurance companies do not go running after elderly people to say: Can \nwe provide health insurance coverage to you? We know you are in your \nseventies or eighties, and we know you are probably going to need \ncoverage for various things in the years ahead. We would like to \nprovide that coverage.\n  In the mid-1960s, this country and the Congress said: People in their \nelderly years should not have to lay their head on their pillow at \nnight and wonder whether tomorrow might be the day when they become \nill, have a disease, have an accident, and go to a hospital with no \nhealth insurance to cover their needs.\n  This Congress did something very important, and, as is usually the \ncase, when it created Medicare, there were plenty of people saying: \nDon't do it. It won't work. It is socialism. It shouldn't happen. But \nit did happen.\n  There is a health care bill being written in the Finance Committee \nnow. I am not part of a gang of two or a gang of six or a gang of \neight. I am part of a gang of 99 Senators, as of today, who will \nconsider the bill they come up with. I do not know what it will look \nlike, and I wish to see all of it before I make a judgment about its \nmerits, but I will say this: Even as it is being written, we hear of \nefforts to cold call into homes of senior citizens to tell them that \nwhat is happening is an attempt to injure and take away services from \nMedicare for senior citizens. It is not true. It is false.\n  It is hard to make the case, it seems to me, but some are trying, \nthat if you try to reduce the cost of Medicare by getting rid of waste \nand fraud and abuse, somehow that results in less health care services \nfor senior citizens, yet that is exactly what is being represented by \nsome.\n  I have watched very carefully and been very concerned about the issue \nof waste and fraud and abuse in Medicare.\n  There should be aggressive oversight, with respect to those who are \nproviding Medicare benefits to senior citizens. There is too much \nfraud. My hope is--and my understanding from what is being written with \nrespect to preventing fraud--it is going to be a new day. If you want \nto sign up as a provider and get reimbursement from Medicare for \nhelping senior citizens, you better be providing the service. All too \noften that has not been the case.\n  So when we decide we are going to try to cut waste and fraud and \nabuse in a very serious and relentless and aggressive way, we have \npeople who say: Aha, what they are going to do will harm senior \ncitizens. It is not going to harm senior citizens in the delivery of \nhealth care to those who are entitled to it if we take on the waste and \nthe fraud and the abuse and start putting the crooks in jail. That is \nnot going to hurt senior citizens. That is going to help America's \nelderly.\n  Let me describe what I am talking about. In 2007, the Department of \nJustice randomly visited 1,600 durable medical equipment suppliers that \nbill Medicare for services. They found that one-third of the businesses \ndid not exist. Think of that. They randomly visited 1,600 durable \nmedical equipment suppliers that provide services to beneficiaries, we \nare told--they are billing the government for it--and they found out \nthat one-third of them did not exist. They were mailboxes to collect \nfraudulent checks. They billed Medicare, combined, $237 million in \n2007.\n  Putting those people in jail and stopping that kind of fraud does not \ninjure Medicare. It strengthens it. It does not hurt senior citizens.\n  A man named Mr. Alcides Garcia was sentenced to 8 years in prison. \nHere is a picture of him, so we can give him a little credit for what \nhe did. He was sentenced to 8 years in prison after his medical \nequipment company made millions in false Medicare claims.\n  Mr. Thomas Fiore, as shown in this picture, was indicted with 10 \nothers on racketeering charges in south Florida for identity theft and \nMedicare fraud and much more.\n  In April of this year, just months ago, officials in Oregon wrapped \nup a lengthy fraud case. Again, to give credit where credit's due, this \nis a man\n\n[[Page S9778]]\n\nnamed Richard Vanderschuere. He faked disability. His wife Karen and \nson Richard, Jr. claimed to be full-time care providers. His mother \nclaimed to be a weekend backup assistant. The so-called caretakers \nreceived payments for providing home health care while he received \nSocial Security disability benefits. His mother was employed. By the \nway, this person's mother was employed as a fraud investigator for a \nState agency in the State of Oregon at the time. Here is his wife, to \nmake sure she gets proper credit. We don't want to leave out the kid \nbecause they were all involved in this--trying to fleece the American \ntaxpayers and defraud the American Government.\n  My point is very simple. My point is that when we take on waste, \nfraud, and abuse--and this is a new day; this is not part of the lost \ndecade when we had a whole lot of people fleecing this program--when we \ndo that, when we cut down on the waste, fraud and abuse and reduce the \ncosts of Medicare, it is not about reducing Medicare for senior \ncitizens.\n  I was in a little ice cream shop about 6 weeks ago in a little town \nin North Dakota. Two elderly women came up to me and said: Byron, \nplease don't let them take my Medicare benefits away. I understand that \nis what they are going to try to do.\n  I said: Well, they are not going to do that, but who told you that?\n  They said: We got telephone calls from some organization that said \nyou have to be aware they are trying to take your Medicare Program \naway.\n  I said: Well, that is not true.\n  They said: Well, we got the telephone calls.\n  I said: You might have gotten the calls, but it is not true. It is \nfalse.\n  But what is happening around here--again, I don't know what the \nhealth care plan will be that comes out of the Finance Committee, but I \nwill guarantee this: Whatever it is, it would not have a ghost of a \nchance of passing this Chamber if it begins to harm Medicare Programs \nfor the elderly in this country. This is a very important program. We \nare the ones who created Medicare. We believe it is important. Those \nnaysayers, those people who have always opposed everything--and there \nare plenty of them, by the way--they are the ones who are saying: If \nyou cut waste, fraud, and abuse, you are going to cut X billions of \ndollars of costs; therefore, you are cutting health care for senior \ncitizens. That is false. I think it ought to stop. We have groups out \nthere that are making cold calls into homes trying to scare senior \ncitizens.\n  The fact is Medicare is a very important program. It has enriched the \nlives of the elderly in this country. Would we want to go back to a \ntime when half the senior citizens reached the point in their lives \nwhere they were finished with their work life, didn't have much in \nassets, and then sat around thinking: Oh, my God, I hope I don't get \nsick because I don't have health care, and I can't find an insurance \ncompany that wants to cover me because they know what I know; that when \nyou get older, sometimes you have those health issues that are most \nacute.\n  In North Dakota, I recently met a 111-year-old woman named Mary--111 \nyears old. She is acutely aware of everything; she can visit with you \nabout everything. She described to me when the barn burned down in 1904 \nwhen she was 6 years old. This is a wonderful, remarkable woman. She is \ncertainly the oldest person in my State and I assume one of the oldest \npeople in our country. But think of what she has experienced in 111 \nyears. Unbelievable things: the automobile, the airplane, walking on \nthe Moon, you name it. But then think of this: In the middle of all \nthis, after she was well into her sixties, Medicare was provided to say \nto America's senior citizens: You don't have to be frightened anymore. \nWe are going to provide health care coverage in your older years.\n  Now 99 percent of the senior citizens in this country have health \ncare. They are our parents, our grandparents, those who raised us, \nthose who loved us, those who cared about us. This country then \nprovided a program called Medicare which said: You don't have to be \nafraid in your older years. You are going to be able to get health \ncare. That is what Medicare is about. Is it perfect? No, it is not \nperfect. Is there waste, fraud, and abuse? Yes, there is, and we are \ndetermined to shut it down. It will be shut down with the right kinds \nof programs to prevent fraud. And if you try to cheat the Medicare \nProgram, we are going to aggressively prosecute.\n  Again, I wish to make sure everybody understands, when we hear people \nsay: If you reduce the cost of Medicare by getting rid of waste, fraud, \nand abuse you are hurting senior citizens and you are trying to cut \nsenior citizens' benefits, that is false and it ought to stop. It is \ngoing on right now and it ought to stop. Organizations doing cold calls \ninto homes of senior citizens ought to stop. And it is parroted by \npoliticians and others who think it is an interesting message to scare \nsenior citizens and it ought to stop.\n  Let me finish as I started. I don't know what kind of health care \nbill is going to come to the Senate, and I want to see it before I \nevaluate it. It is important. It is important to everybody. But I do \nknow this: The Medicare Program is something that has very substantial \nsupport in this Chamber. I don't believe there is anything being \nwritten in any one of the committees in the Senate that would begin to \ndiminish or in any other way weaken Medicare coverage for America's \nsenior citizens. If that was the case, it wouldn't have a ghost of a \nchance of getting through this Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify the \npreviously agreed to list of amendments to be considered in order to \ninclude my amendment No. 2530 and to set aside the pending amendment so \nmine may be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. On behalf of the majority leader, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I believe it is truly unfortunate that \nwe are not allowed to consider this amendment. The amendment I was \nhoping to be able to bring up and consider is one that would prohibit \nthe use of funds that has the effect of making carbon dioxide a \npollutant subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act for any source \nother than a mobile source.\n  It is unfortunate that the majority will not allow us to consider \nthis amendment. The problem it seeks to address is significant. I don't \nbelieve it is going to go away if we choose to ignore it. As \ndisappointed as I am, this amendment has clearly received considerable \nattention, so I wish to take this time this afternoon to fully explain \nits intent, my efforts to ensure its bipartisan nature, as well as the \nreasons I believe it is so incredibly important for the Senate to be \ngiven an opportunity to vote in favor of its adoption, if not now, then \nat some other point.\n  In writing this amendment over this past week, I have listened to the \nconcerns of many of my colleagues and the concerns of the environmental \ncommunity, as well as the concerns expressed by the administration. My \ncolleagues don't have to take my word for this. Look at the text of the \namendment and see how it reflects--I think it so reflects--very \nseriously the comments and the criticisms from those who have weighed \nin. All I ask, at this time, is that for the next few minutes, my \ncolleagues and my critics return the favor and listen to what I have to \nsay.\n  For context, let's start back at the beginning. Back in April of \n2007, the Supreme Court declared, in the case of Massachusetts v. EPA, \nthat carbon dioxide is a pollutant that can be regulated under the \nClean Air Act. The Court held that the EPA must regulate emissions from \nmobile sources--meaning vehicles--if the Agency determined that carbon \ndioxide posed a threat to public health and welfare.\n  In the wake of that decision, EPA began to lay the groundwork for \nFederal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. Through its proposed \n``endangerment finding,'' the Agency has sought to confirm that \ngreenhouse gas emissions are, indeed, a threat to the public health and \nwelfare. That proposal is now under review and most expect that it will \nbe finalized in the very near future.\n  The EPA has also released its draft rule to regulate mobile source \nemissions as required by the Supreme Court, and this will be \naccomplished\n\n[[Page S9779]]\n\nthrough a dual standard that includes increased vehicle fuel economy \nand reduced tailpipe emissions.\n  I am not putting the brakes on that proposal, despite some assertions \nto the contrary, but I am deeply concerned about the reach it may \nultimately have. Under the ``Prevention of Significant Deterioration'' \nprovisions within the Clean Air Act, anything found to be a pollutant \nunder one section will be subject to regulation under all other \nsections of the statute.\n  So what exactly does this mean in plain English? The EPA's decision \nto regulate carbon dioxide legally covers not only mobile sources but \nalso stationary sources. We tend to think of powerplants when we think \nof stationary sources, but also we think of office buildings, \nhospitals, schools, and apartment buildings. If you follow along those \nlines, you get the right idea. Very clearly, stationary sources must \nreduce emissions in order to bring our Nation to its climate goals, but \nforcing them to do so through the Clean Air Act would be one of the \nleast efficient and most damaging ways to pursue that goal. It would be \nrife with unintended consequences and, I believe, potentially \ndevastating for our economy.\n  Under the Clean Air Act, any stationary source that emits more than \n250 tons of pollutants each year is subject to regulation. Unlike other \npollutants, pretty much every form of economic activity generates some \nlevel of carbon dioxide emissions. So these add up relatively quickly. \nIn fact, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has looked at this very closely. \nThey believe that more than 1.2 million buildings that have never \nbefore been regulated under the Clean Air Act would come under this \nregulation if Congress does not intervene and if EPA moves forward.\n  The 250-ton threshold would encompass more than just our major \nemitters. Caught in the same net would be dry cleaners, restaurants, \nthe local Barnes & Noble bookstore. Realistically, we are probably \ntalking about any facility that is heated or cooled by conventional \nmeans that is more than 65,000 square feet in size.\n  I think there are some very grave concerns about the path the EPA \nwould lead us down. I think they are apparent. I think others are \nseeing this as well and are expressing their concerns. Just this week, \nI received letters from over 11 different agricultural groups, \nincluding the American Farm Bureau Federation. I have received letters \nfrom the American Council of Engineering Companies; NFIB, the National \nFederation of Independent Businesses; the National Association of \nManufacturers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters from these organizations be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               National Federation\n\n\n                                     of Independence Business,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 23, 2009.\n     Senator Lisa Murkowski,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski, On behalf of the National \n     Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), the nation's \n     leading small business advocacy organization, I am writing to \n     support your amendment to the Fiscal Year 2010 Interior/\n     Environment Appropriations bill to prohibit the Environmental \n     Protection Agency for one year from using federal funds to \n     regulate stationary sources of carbon dioxide (CO2).\n       As you know, the EPA proposed that six greenhouse gasses \n     (GHGs), including CO2, endanger public health and welfare. \n     These findings would trigger stringent new regulations under \n     the Clean Air Act (CAA) that would disproportionately affect \n     small entities that are not major polluters and least able to \n     handle or even understand new restrictions. Regulation of \n     GHGs under the CAA will create new burdens such as federal \n     permitting requirements, restrictions on fuel choices and \n     energy use, and requirements for installation of new energy \n     efficient equipment.\n       Small business routinely cites unreasonable government \n     regulations as a top problem, ranking number six on the 2008 \n     NFIB Small Business Problems and Priorities publication. \n     Regulatory costs are significant and small businesses pay \n     disproportionately more than larger businesses. According to \n     the 2001 NFIB study on Coping with Regulation, small \n     businesses cite many reasons for being frustrated by \n     government regulations, including dealing with the extra \n     paperwork, understanding what is needed to be in compliance, \n     and the dollars spent to comply with government regulations.\n       The cost of regulation for small business has risen by 10 \n     percent, to $7,647 per employee per year (according to the \n     Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy). This \n     means that for the average member at NFIB with ten employees, \n     the cost of regulation now exceeds $75,000 annually. Adding \n     more regulatory costs would be a serious blow to already \n     overburdened small business owners, who according to the \n     September 2009 NFIB Small Business Economic Trends survey, \n     are still suffering from weak sales and profits numbers.\n       NFIB supports the Murkowski amendment because it would \n     delay for one year the use of federal funds by the EPA to \n     regulate stationary sources of CO2. As the 111th Congress \n     continues, I look forward to working with you to address \n     energy issues in a way that is not disruptive to the small \n     business community.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Susan Eckerly,\n     Senior Vice President, Public Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               September 23, 2009.\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator: The undersigned agricultural organizations \n     urge your support for an amendment to be offered by Senator \n     Murkowski that would prevent unintended and unwanted \n     consequences from regulation by the Environmental Protection \n     Agency (EPA) of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act.\n       The Supreme Court, in Massachusetts v. EPA, held that EPA \n     was not precluded from regulating greenhouse gases under \n     section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, which addresses new \n     motor vehicle emission standards. This amendment would not \n     affect the rulemaking since the rulemaking is still pending.\n       We do not believe it is sound policy for the EPA to extend \n     this pending regulation beyond motor vehicles into activities \n     like the production of crops, livestock and poultry. We urge \n     your support for the Murkowski amendment.\n       Sincerely,\n         American Farm Bureau Federation , American Soybean \n           Association, National Association of Wheat Growers, \n           National Barley Growers Association, National \n           Cattlemen's Beef Association, National Cotton Council, \n           National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, Public Lands \n           Council, United Egg Producers, US Dry Pea and Lentil \n           Council, USA Rice Federation.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                             of Manufacturers,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 23, 2009.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The National Association of Manufacturers \n     (NAM), the nation's largest industrial trade association \n     representing small and large manufacturers in every \n     industrial sector and in all 50 states, urges, you to support \n     the Murkowski Amendment to H.R. 2996, the Department of the \n     Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations \n     Act, 2010.\n       At a time when our economy is attempting to recover from \n     the most severe recession since the 1930s, Environmental \n     Protection Agency (EPA) regulations, with no guidance from \n     Congress, will establish disincentives for the long-term \n     investments that would be necessary to grow jobs and expedite \n     economic recovery. The Murkowski Amendment seeks to ensure a \n     healthy and productive discussion in Congress on harmonizing \n     our nation's energy, environmental and economic needs before \n     the EPA starts regulating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from \n     stationary sources, including manufacturing facilities.\n       Manufacturers support a comprehensive, federal climate \n     policy within a framework that will cause no economic harm \n     while granting sufficient time to deploy low-carbon \n     technologies, such as carbon capture and sequestration, \n     renewable energy and a renewed and large-scale deployment of \n     nuclear power plants.\n       Prior to the onset of the financial crisis in 2008, energy \n     inflation and price volatility were major contributors to a \n     loss of approximately 3.7 million high-wage manufacturing \n     jobs. As you may know, manufacturers use one-third of our \n     nation's energy. Because of the impact a federal climate \n     policy will have on the nation's energy future, this is an \n     issue that must be debated by Congress without preemption \n     from a federal agency.\n       Supporting the Murkowski Amendment does not convey \n     opposition to climate change policy; it merely allows \n     Congress to do its job. We concur with the sentiment in a \n     Washington Post September 21 editorial, ``Regulating \n     Carbon.'' It noted that the EPA ``is preparing to regulate \n     carbon under the Clean Air Act,'' which ``is breathtakingly \n     unsuited to the great task of battling global warming. . . . \n     Yet if Congress does not act, it's likely that the EPA will. \n     It won't be pretty.''\n       The NAM's Key Vote Advisory Committee has indicated that \n     votes on the Murkowski Amendment, including potential \n     procedural motions, may be considered for designation as Key \n     Manufacturing Votes in the 111th Congress. Thank you for your \n     consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jay Timmons.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  American Council\n\n\n                                     of Engineering Companies,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 23, 2009.\n     Hon. Lisa Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: The American Council of Engineering \n     Companies (ACEC) is\n\n[[Page S9780]]\n\n     pleased to support your amendment to the FY 2010 Interior \n     Appropriations bill disallowing for one year the U.S. \n     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from regulating under \n     the Clean Air Act greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from \n     stationary sources. Without taking an overall position on \n     comprehensive climate change legislation, we agree that Clean \n     Air Act regulation of GHGs for stationary sources is not the \n     appropriate way to manage carbon emissions.\n       ACEC is the business association of America's engineering \n     industry, representing more than 5,000 independent \n     engineering companies throughout the United States engaged in \n     the development of America's infrastructure. ACEC member \n     firms represent the broad spectrum of the industry, from very \n     large firms to small, family-owned businesses.\n       We think it is wise public policy to delay for one year \n     potentially premature EPA regulatory actions under the Clean \n     Air Act before the Congress decides on its course of action. \n     The breadth of the issues in a comprehensive climate change-\n     energy bill requires thoughtful debate with ample time to \n     negotiate differences between senators from all regions of \n     the country, which has just begun in the Senate and should \n     not be hindered by concerns that EPA could be developing a \n     regulatory program for stationary sources that may be \n     entirely inappropriate for GHG emissions. Even the EPA \n     Administrator has indicated that she would prefer that the \n     Congress work its will on a climate change bill rather than \n     ceding authority to EPA.\n       It is also important to note that your amendment does not \n     permanently take away any authority from EPA, but simply asks \n     for a one-year delay in stationary source regulations. Given \n     that the House-passed climate change bill makes it clear that \n     stationary sources are subject only to the provisions of the \n     legislation and not to Clean Air Act regulations, your \n     amendment is eminently reasonable as the debate continues.\n       At the same time, we are hopeful that the amendment can be \n     carefully tailored to limit EPA's GHG regulatory authority \n     under the Clean Air Act to only mobile sources. We thank you \n     for the opportunity to express our views. If you have any \n     questions or would like to discuss our comments, please feel \n     free to contact me or our environment and energy director, \n     Diane S. Shea.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 David A. Raymond,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Chamber of Commerce\n\n\n                              of the United States of America,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 23, 2009.\n       To the Members of the United States Senate: The U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business federation \n     representing more than three million businesses and \n     organizations of every size, sector and region, strongly \n     supports an amendment expected to be offered by Sen. \n     Murkowski and strongly opposes an amendment expected to be \n     offered by Sen. Feinstein to the FY2010 Interior, Environment \n     and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, both related to \n     greenhouse gas emissions. The Murkowski amendment would \n     ensure that should the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n     seek to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act \n     absent specific authorization from Congress, that EPA limit \n     such regulation to mobile sources. This was the issue decided \n     by the U.S. Supreme Court in Massachusetts v. EPA. The \n     Feinstein amendment would seek to ``tailor'' a small subset \n     of EPA regulations, but in a manner far less comprehensive \n     than the Murkowski amendment.\n       The House has approved climate change legislation, and the \n     Senate may take up the matter this Congress. It would be \n     inappropriate for EPA to usurp ongoing congressional action \n     on a major policy decision and regulate the very same sources \n     (and the very same emissions) that would be covered by \n     greenhouse gas legislation. Yet that is precisely what would \n     happen if EPA were allowed to proceed.\n       Since the Massachusetts v. EPA decision, EPA has issued \n     regulations implementing a federal greenhouse gas registry, \n     has proposed ``endangerment'' for the motor vehicle sector, \n     and has proposed a rule to regulate motor vehicle greenhouse \n     gas emissions.\n       EPA is also likely to issue and enforce as early as spring \n     2010 a suite of regulations applying to stationary sources, \n     New Source Performance Standards for equipment, Prevention of \n     Significant Deterioration construction permits, and Title V \n     operating permits.\n       EPA asserts it can use the Clean Air Act to ``tailor'' its \n     rules to large industrial sources, despite the Act's clear \n     language. The Chamber disagrees, believing only Congress can \n     determine the scope of the Clean Air Act. As raised \n     repeatedly in correspondence from the Chamber, EPA could \n     cripple the economy if it opens greenhouse gas regulation \n     beyond mobile sources. EPA should remain within the bounds of \n     the Massachusetts v. EPA decision, which dealt with mobile, \n     not stationary, sources.\n       The Murkowski amendment would allow EPA to move forward \n     with its greenhouse gas registry and to take public comment \n     on its motor vehicle rule, but it would hold in abeyance \n     EPA's efforts to regulate stationary sources while Congress \n     considers greenhouse gas legislation and the Obama \n     administration negotiates an international accord. If \n     enacted, the Murkowski amendment would allow Congress to \n     consider meaningful and pragmatic greenhouse gas legislation \n     free from any EPA-imposed threat of a regulatory cascade.\n       The Chamber opposes the Feinstein amendment, which would \n     only exempt farms and other small stationary sources from \n     Clean Air Act Title V regulation. While the Chamber has long \n     argued that the Clean Air Act is a poor tool to address \n     greenhouse gas emissions because it would trigger regulation \n     of smaller sources, like farms, hospitals and small \n     businesses, it would be unwise policy for Congress to react \n     to an attempt by EPA to assert jurisdiction over greenhouse \n     gas emissions from stationary sources with piecemeal, \n     temporary, and wholly incomplete fixes.\n       The Chamber reiterates its call for Congress to approve \n     bipartisan, comprehensive greenhouse gas legislation in a \n     manner that adequately addresses environmental, energy \n     security, economic, and international aspects of the issue. \n     The Murkowski amendment would facilitate a bipartisan, \n     sensible framework for greenhouse gas legislation and ensure \n     that EPA does not exceed the Court's Massachusetts v. EPA \n     decision.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              R. Bruce Josten,\n\n                                         Executive Vice President,\n                                               Government Affairs.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. To its credit, the EPA realized that regulations at \nthe 250-ton level are simply not feasible. So to try and resolve this \nissue, the Agency is apparently considering what they are calling a \ntailoring proposal. This would lift the Clean Air Act's regulatory \nthreshold to 25,000 tons. That is a hundredfold increase.\n  I shared the Agency's concern about a 250-ton carbon dioxide limit, \nbut this 250-ton proposal moving up to a 25,000-ton proposal, this \ntailoring issue, is simply not going to hold. It has no legal basis. I \nthink we expect it would be swiftly rejected by the courts. The EPA \ncannot constitutionally legislate a major change in the Clean Air Act. \nUltimately, once this has all played out, the Agency's carbon dioxide \nregulations would remain in effect, but the threshold would be \ntriggered at a level 100 times lower than the Agency had planned.\n  That brings us to the tremendous consequences we can expect as a \nresult. There is widespread agreement that the regulation of carbon \ndioxide emissions under the Clean Air Act would be absolutely \nunworkable and, at the same time, economically devastating. In the \nwords of a long-term Democrat over in the House, it will create a \n``glorious mess.'' Another observed it could result in ``one of the \nlargest and most bureaucratic nightmares that the U.S. economy and \nAmericans have ever seen.''\n\n  Just this week, the editors of the Washington Post argued that the \nClean Air Act is ``breathtakingly unsuited to the great task of \nbattling global warming.'' The Wall Street Journal's editors cast it as \n``reckless endangerment.'' They went on to assert that the regulation \nwould be like putting ``a gun to the head of Congress'' to ``play cap \nand trade roulette with the U.S. economy.''\n  That may sound over the top, but even some members of the \nenvironmental community have agreed with the metaphor, as one clean air \nadvocate affirmed this by saying this regulation is ``the legal \nequivalent of a .44 magnum.''\n  This regulation is a train that could wreck our fragile economy. It \nis our own creation, and it is barreling toward us at full speed. I \nrecently saw an ironic motivational poster that said: ``Government--if \nyou think the problems we create are bad, wait until you see our \nsolutions.'' It is fair to say that this issue, the regulation of \ncarbon dioxide under the Clean Air Act, is one of the many examples of \nwhy that poster was created and, sadly, it occasionally rings true.\n  Today, however, the Senate can choose another course for the debate \nover energy and climate policy. The Clean Air Act is one of our worst \noptions to regulate carbon dioxide emissions, but it is not our only \noption for that cause.\n  Those of us in Congress can and should step up and pass workable, \nintellectually honest climate legislation--whether it is a system of \ncap and trade, a carbon tax, or something else that removes the Clean \nAir Act from the equation. Nearly every participant in this debate, \nfrom elected officials to businesses and the environmental community, \nhas stated their preference for legislation over regulation.\n  That is where my amendment comes in. For exactly 1 year, it would \nlimit the EPA's ability to regulate carbon dioxide emissions to just \nthe mobile\n\n[[Page S9781]]\n\nsources that were the subject of the 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA lawsuit. \nThis is nothing more than a temporary timeout that will give us the \nbreathing room in an already heated debate. It will give us the time we \nneed to develop a sensible, effective policy that achieves the same \nresult at a much lower cost.\n  Anyone who takes the time to read my amendment will see I have gone \nto great lengths here to ensure it does not lead to any unintended or \nadverse consequences. It has been drafted and redrafted to limit one \naction by the EPA for 1 year, and nothing else. I have been responsive \nto bipartisan requests, even from Members who I knew would not be able \nto support this amendment, because I am committed to avoiding any \noverreach.\n  So the result we have is an amendment that will not interfere or \nconflict with any other regulation or action that EPA is obliged to \ncomplete. That goes for the preparatory work for the regulation of \ncarbon dioxide emissions. It holds true for the rule to expand the \nrenewable fuel standard, for construction permits, and for regulations \nto foster the development of clean coal technologies.\n  My amendment will not in any way impact EPA's authority relating to \nthe reporting of greenhouse gas emissions, its ability to develop a \nvoluntary carbon offset program, to issue permits for energy \ninfrastructure on or near Federal land, permit carbon sequestration \nprojects, or to move forward with very important work of both exploring \nfor and producing the vast reserves of domestic energy on our Outer \nContinental Shelf.\n  All of these concerns have been raised over the past several days, \nbefore this amendment was even introduced. All of these concerns are \nexplicitly addressed within it. Some of our Nation's leading Clean Air \nAct attorneys--among the best and brightest legal minds--have assisted \nus in its preparation. They agree it will do exactly as it says, and \nthat leaves very little ground for the claims that have been made \nagainst it.\n  Given how devastating the EPA's regulation of carbon dioxide \nemissions could be, many casual viewers are probably left wondering \nwhy, exactly, my amendment has drawn such fierce opposition. Well, \nagain, let me be clear. As much as anything else, the regulation of \ncarbon dioxide under the Clean Air Act is being used as a thinly veiled \nthreat to force the Senate to act on climate legislation, regardless of \nwhere we are in what remains an ongoing and incredibly important \ndebate.\n  The possibility that our worst option to reduce emissions will move \nforward, despite its consequences, is supposed to somehow compel us to \nmove faster. We are expected to push through a climate bill, perhaps \nregardless of its content, in order to stave off this regulation. If \nthe House debate is any indication of how our own will proceed, we will \nbe asked to rush to judgment, cut off debate on one of the greatest \nchallenges of our time, and to pass a bill--any bill--that purports to \nreduce emissions.\n  In my mind, this situation has created a false dilemma, a proverbial \nMorton's Fork on Capitol Hill--meaning between a rock and a hard place. \nRight now, those of us in the Senate are clearly left with two bad \nchoices--the EPA's endangerment regulation or the House's energy and \nclimate bill--neither of which will end well for the American people. \nMaking matters worse, we are told there isn't enough time to consider \nour options and develop a more viable path forward.\n  By voting ``yes'' on my amendment, we could easily change this \nunfortunate dynamic. But we will not halt or hinder progress on climate \nlegislation, as some have suggested. Not one of the climate bills that \nhas been introduced so far would take effect until 2012--2 full years \nafter the limitation imposed by my amendment would expire.\n  If my amendment were to be accepted, the EPA will continue its work \nto regulate emissions from mobile sources. The agency and its employees \nwill go about their business exactly as normal. They can even continue \ndeveloping regulations for carbon dioxide emissions from stationary \nsources. For the next year, they simply cannot put those regulations \ninto effect. One year after this bill is signed into law, that \nlimitation would expire, and the EPA would have every authority to \nproceed if Congress has still not acted.\n  For those who have expressed concern that my amendment would become a \nlong-term fixture in appropriations legislation, be assured that I will \nwork with you to ensure that the climate debate not only proceeds but \nreaches a conclusion in the form of a responsible bill that a majority \nof us can support. As an elected representative of the State that has \nbeen hit hardest by climate change, I will work in good faith with all \nwho want to address climate change in an effective way, while \nprotecting our fragile economy from further harm.\n  To those who have claimed I am trying to put the brakes on climate \nlegislation, I simply remind you of my long-standing support for \nrenewable, nuclear, and alternative energies as part of the solution. \nThere is a right way and there is a wrong way to moving forward in \naddressing climate change. EPA regulation of greenhouse gas emissions \nis simply the wrong way. We must reduce emissions, but it is \nunacceptable to do so at any cost and by any means. While Congress has \nnot yet developed a workable bill, I will continue to work as hard as I \ncan to make sure that, in fact, we do.\n  Unlike many Members of the Senate, I have also cosponsored cap-and-\ntrade legislation. I cosponsored the Low Carbon Economy Act that was \noffered last Congress by Senator Bingaman and Senator Specter. This \nyear, recognizing that our work is far from finished, Senator Bingaman \nand I worked together, very cooperatively and collaboratively, on \nanother comprehensive measure--the American Clean Energy Leadership \nAct. We reported that bill from the Energy Committee more than 3 months \nago. It would significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, without \ncausing economic harm, and yet it is still waiting to be heard on the \nSenate floor.\n  The 23 members of the Energy Committee produced a bipartisan energy \nbill in the first 6 months of Congress. I have every reason to believe \nthat the full Senate can, over a time period twice as long, develop an \neffective climate policy that will further reduce greenhouse emissions, \nwithout disrupting our economy. But that will require us to base our \ndecisions more than on vote counts and special requests. It will \nrequire us to set aside politics and focus on substance. It will force \nus to cross the aisle instead of closing ranks, and it will mean acting \non behalf of the American people, in their best interests, rather than \nour own or our party's.\n  With regard to my amendment, the majority has again objected to \ncalling it up. They have done everything they can to prevent a vote \nfrom occurring on the amendment, culminating in the objection that we \nnot even have debate on the matter today. I want my colleagues to know, \nhowever, that this issue will not go away. Neither will my commitment \nto seeing it addressed head-on in a responsible and, if at all \npossible, bipartisan way.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Barrasso, Johanns, and \nChambliss be added as cosponsors to my amendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johanns) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I know Senator Boxer, the chairman of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, has an hour reserved to \ncome and speak.\n  First, I will respond to the comments of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Alaska. I hope she will understand there are many of us who have \nviewed her amendment with substantial alarm, for reasons that I thought \nI might spend a few moments speaking about.\n  Essentially, as I understood the amendment, which was blocked from \ncoming to the floor, it attempted to prohibit the EPA from using any \nfunds to enforce the Clean Air Act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \nfrom stationary sources.\n  The proponents have argued that their only goal was to protect small \nfamily-owned farms and businesses from overly burdensome regulations. \nYet the amendment would have gone much further. In fact, it would \nactually exempt some of the Nation's largest commercial emitters from \nclimate\n\n[[Page S9782]]\n\nchange regulation, including huge industrial facilities, such as \npowerplants and refineries.\n  I am very pleased that this amendment is not before us today. The \nunderlying rationale, as I understand it from the amendment, is \ngroundless. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson has made it clear that the \nagency will not use the Clean Air Act to regulate either small \nbusinesses or family-owned farms. I was prepared, should the amendment \nhave come up, to put down a side-by-side amendment that would have \nclearly exempted any farm, as well as any business, that emits under \n25,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year.\n  Let me point this out. Stationary industrial sources account for over \nhalf of the U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, according to EPA. These are \nthe leading cause of climate change, and they must be reduced if we \nhave any hope of containing the worst impact of climate change. The \namendment would have hampered the administration's effort to tackle one \nof the biggest pieces of the emissions puzzle: large industrial \nfacilities. It would have been a major setback.\n\n  Thirdly, the amendment would effectively overturn the Supreme Court's \nlandmark decision in Massachusetts v. EPA. In that decision, the Court \nfound that the Clean Air Act requires the EPA to determine whether the \nemissions of greenhouse gases may be reasonably anticipated to endanger \npublic health or welfare and then comply with the Clean Air Act \nrequirements designed to protect public health from dangerous \npollution.\n  Upon completion of an endangerment finding, the Clean Air Act \nrequires EPA to control greenhouse gases from both stationary and \nmobile sources.\n  Many argue--and I happen to agree--that regulating the largest \ngreenhouse gas emitters through new legislation, establishing a cap-\nand-trade system, would be more efficient and less expensive than \nregulating these sources under the existing Clean Air Act.\n  But until Congress enacts climate change legislation, EPA has a legal \nobligation to follow the Clean Air Act. So if one does not want EPA to \ntake action under the Clean Air Act, then this body should want to pass \na cap-and-trade bill.\n  The chairman of the EPW Committee, Senator Boxer, has been working \nvery hard to put together a bill which has an opportunity to pass this \nSenate.\n  The point is, if we do not want the Clean Air Act to prevail, then \nthe cap-and-trade bill is the only way to go. That is a clear incentive \nfor the Senate and the House to pass a bill.\n  EPA has released a draft endangerment finding which it is going to \nsoon finalize. Yet the amendment would have blocked EPA from completing \nthe endangerment finding and from complying with its legal obligations \nto protect public health. The repercussions would have been major. It \nmeans EPA would not be able to complete a joint rulemaking with the \nDepartment of Transportation to increase corporate average fuel \neconomy, which we call CAFE, and create a tailpipe emissions standard \nfor automobiles.\n  That would have been a major problem. It would block implementation \nof the 2007 fuel economy law which I authored with Senator Snowe and \nwhich took us a long time to get passed and enacted.\n  By undermining the negotiated agreement between States and the Obama \nadministration, the Murkowski amendment would also have likely resulted \nin States moving forward with their own tailpipe emissions standards \nwhich automakers have fought for years as too onerous. This would have \nstopped California and 14 other States and the District of Columbia \nfrom moving forward with implementing tailpipe emissions standards.\n  This amendment is vigorously opposed by the Alliance of Automobile \nManufacturers, which includes General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler, the \nAssociation of International Automobile Manufacturers, and the United \nAuto Workers. To that end, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks a letter from the Auto \nAlliance and the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, finally, the amendment would send the \nwrong signal to the rest of the world about the Senate's intentions on \nclimate change. It would suggest that we want to ignore the clear \nimperative to act, despite the efforts of the administration to \nmotivate the international community in advance of the Copenhagen \nsummit.\n  There is some concern also about small emitters. EPA is not planning \nto regulate small emitters. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson has clearly \nstated on several occasions that the agency will not regulate small \nemitters. She said it in her confirmation hearings, she said it again \nat Senate budget hearings, and she reiterated that comment when she \nappeared before the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee hearing \non EPA's fiscal year 2010 budget just a few months ago.\n  In fact, Administrator Jackson has sent a draft deregulatory rule to \nthe Office of Management and Budget for review which would establish \nclearly that all but the very largest sources of greenhouse gas will be \npreemptively exempted from the stationary source permitting \nrequirements in the Clean Air Act.\n  She has no intention of regulating small sources that emit under \n25,000 tons of carbon dioxide or any small farm.\n  Mr. President, 25,000 metric tons is a very high threshold. According \nto EPA, it is equivalent to the emissions from burning 131 trainloads \nof coal per year--these would be exempted--or burning 2.8 million \ngallons of gasoline annually.\n  The 25,000-ton threshold would exempt every small source, focusing \nonly on 13,000 of the largest emitters in the United States.\n  Let me say that again. The 25,000-ton threshold which EPA intends to \nproceed with, and which my side-by-side amendment would have had as one \nof the two criteria, would exempt every small source, focusing only on \nthe 13,000 largest emitters in the United States.\n  EPA intends to only regulate the largest facilities, and these \nfacilities are, almost without exception, already regulated under the \nClean Air Act for emissions of other pollutants such as soot, smog-\nforming nitrous oxides, or acid-rain-inducing sulfur dioxide.\n  Let me now explain why the Murkowski Amendment would impact the joint \nEPA-Department of Transportation rulemaking on automobile greenhouse \ngas emissions.\n  This rulemaking is of critical importance, and the regulation \nimplementing this law was negotiated by the White House in cooperation \nwith automakers, the States, and labor.\n  But according to a letter I received from EPA Administrator Lisa \nJackson last night, the impact of the Murkowski amendment ``would be to \nmake it impossible for the EPA to promulgate the light-duty vehicle \ngreenhouse-gas emissions standards that the agency proposed on \nSeptember 15, 2009.''\n  She writes:\n\n       Because of the way the Clean Air Act is written, \n     promulgation of the proposed light-duty vehicle rule will \n     automatically make carbon dioxide a pollutant subject to \n     regulation under the Clean Air Act for stationary sources, as \n     well as for light-duty vehicles. The only way that EPA could \n     comply with the prohibition in Senator Murkowski's amendment \n     would be to not promulgate the light-duty vehicle standards.\n\n  These standards are something Senator Snowe and I have worked on for \nat least 7 years now, beginning with the SUV loophole and ending with \nthe bill that became law, would be totally undermined. By undermining \nthe negotiated agreement between States, the amendment would also \nlikely result in States moving forward with their own tailpipe \nemissions standards.\n  As I indicated before, in 2002 California enacted a landmark law to \nreduce tailpipe emissions standards by 30 percent for all new sedans, \ntrucks, and SUVs by 2016.\n  I also stated that 14 other States--namely, Arizona, Connecticut, \nFlorida, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New \nYork, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the \nDistrict of Columbia--have adopted or announced their intention to \nadopt California's greenhouse gas emissions controls.\n  The amendment would have been a major roadblock in efforts to improve \nfuel economy standards for vehicles.\n\n[[Page S9783]]\n\n  I don't think we can bury our head in the sand when it comes to \nclimate change.\n  I would like to conclude by reminding my colleagues that it makes no \nsense at this particular point in time to put on the floor a major \namendment which well could have devastated both the EPA and any effort \nto get to cap-and-trade legislation when, in fact, the EPW Committee is \nstruggling to write a comprehensive bill which has an opportunity to \npass this body.\n  Again I say, if people do not want the Clean Air Act prevailing, then \nthe only way you can do that is with a cap-and-trade bill. That is the \nway the committee of this body is proceeding. I believe it is the \ncorrect way.\n  I believe our Nation is in serious jeopardy, as is the rest of planet \nEarth, with global warming. I believe it is real. Just this week, the \nJournal Nature published a new paper that found rapid deterioration of \nthe ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica. Yesterday on this floor, I \nshowed the deterioration in the Arctic. I showed the deterioration in \nGreenland. I showed the deterioration in the Chukchi Sea. I showed the \ndeterioration off Barrow, AK. It is happening all over the world.\n  The Flat Earth Society cannot prevail. I think there is a real danger \nsignal out there for planet Earth. We know we cannot reverse it. We \nknow that greenhouse gases do not dissipate and go away after a period \nof time in the atmosphere. We now know these gases that began during \nthe Industrial Revolution are still present in the atmosphere, and we \nknow that the Earth is not immutable, that it can change. We look at \nother planets and we see that they have changed over the millennia. \nWhat we do here to protect our planet Earth for the next generations is \nso key and critical.\n  This discussion has to be joined in an appropriate way, and an \nappropriate way is when a cap-and-trade bill is produced by the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee and the chairman of that \ncommittee is on this floor and the bill is open for amendments and \nthere is a free flow of debate and discussion.\n  I believe the science is real. I pointed out yesterday we have a \nproject in intelligence whereby the satellites are tracking \ndeterioration in the ice shelves of the world. I hope to present more \nof that information when there is a bill on the Senate floor.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Administrator \nLisa Jackson's letter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       United States Environmental\n\n\n                                            Protection Agency,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 23, 2009.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: Thank you for your letter about \n     Senator Lisa Murkowski's Amendment Number 2530 to H.R. 2996, \n     the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Act. As you noted in your letter, \n     Senator Murkowski's amendment would prohibit the \n     Environmental Protection Agency from using any funds made \n     available under the Act to take any action that would have \n     the effect of making carbon dioxide a pollutant subject to \n     regulation under the Clean Air Act for any source other than \n     a mobile source.\n       You asked me what the practical impact would be if Congress \n     enacted Senator Murkowski's amendment. Perhaps the most \n     striking impact would be to make it impossible for the \n     Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate the light-duty \n     vehicle greenhouse-gas emissions standards that the agency \n     proposed on September 15, 2009. Because of the way the Clean \n     Air Act is written, promulgation of the proposed light-duty \n     vehicle rule will automatically make carbon dioxide a \n     pollutant subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act for \n     stationary sources, as well as for light-duty vehicles. The \n     only way that EPA could comply with the prohibition in \n     Senator Murkowski's amendment would be to not promulgate the \n     light-duty vehicle standards.\n       As you know, promulgation of EPA's light-duty vehicle \n     greenhouse-gas emissions standards is an essential part of \n     the historic agreement that President Obama announced earlier \n     this year with the nation's auto-makers, the State of \n     California, the Department of Transportation, and EPA. That \n     agreement attracted broad, bi-partisan support. The joint \n     DOT-EPA standards are projected to save 1.8 billion barrels \n     of oil over the life of the program, which is twice the \n     amount of oil (crude oil and products) imported in 2008 from \n     the Persian Gulf countries, according to the Department of \n     Energy's Energy Information Administration Office. \n     Additionally, the standards are projected to help save \n     consumers more than $3,000 over the lifetime of a model year \n     2016 vehicle and reduce approximately 900 million metric tons \n     of greenhouse gas emissions. Enactment of Senator Murkowski's \n     amendment would pull the plug on those extraordinary \n     accomplishments.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Lisa P. Jackson,\n                                                    Administrator.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                               September 24, 2009.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: We are writing regarding Senator \n     Murkowski's Amendment Number 2530 to H.R. 2996, the \n     Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act. As manufacturers, we are sympathetic to \n     the thrust of Senator Murkowski's amendment that the \n     Congress--and not simply EPA acting under the provisions of \n     the current Clean Air Act--should determine how best to \n     reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions economy-wide.\n       However, the amendment raises additional issues that must \n     be considered where complicated and interconnected \n     environmental and legal issues are at stake. We are concerned \n     that due to the complex interactions among regulations under \n     the various sections of the Clean Air Act, the amendment may \n     impact significantly pending regulations in the mobile source \n     sector--despite language in the amendment that would appear \n     to leave the sector unaffected. In a letter to Senator \n     Feinstein dated September 23, Administrator Jackson stated \n     EPA's interpretation that the Murkowski amendment as filed \n     would ``make it impossible for the Environmental Protection \n     Agency to promulgate the light-duty vehicle greenhouse-gas \n     emissions standards that the agency proposed on September 15, \n     2009.''\n       While the author of the amendment appears not to intend \n     this outcome, we feel compelled to express our concerns. It \n     is critical that the national program for regulating \n     greenhouse gas emissions from autos be finalized early next \n     year. Failure to do so would subject automakers to a \n     patchwork of conflicting state and federal regulations.\n       Therefore, we respectfully oppose the adoption of the \n     Murkowski amendment as written to H.R. 2996.\n           Sincerely,\n     Dave McCurdy,\n       President & CEO, Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.\n     Michael Stanton,\n       President & CEO, Association of International Automobile \n     Manufacturers.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent agreement, \nI apparently had 30 minutes. Can the Chair tell me if I have time \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 11 minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Oklahoma had \nwanted to make a couple comments, but I would like to take a couple \nextra minutes before I turn to him in response to my friend and \ncolleague from California.\n  In many ways, she has made my point or supported the argument. I \nwould agree that, in fact, in order to deal with this very timely \nissue, this very significant issue, we must act. I just do not believe \nthat utilizing the regulation, moving a climate change regulation \nthrough the EPA, is the best instrument, the most effective instrument.\n  The people I represent back home are very concerned about this, as I \nhave indicated, and are expecting their Congress to act. But they do \nnot feel very comfortable with unelected bureaucrats in the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency telling them that, in fact, this is the \nroad we are going to be going down, with no real appreciation or \nsensitivity to the environmental factors that we in this body assess as \nwe are trying to advance policy. We need to be driving forward good, \nthoughtful, considered, reasonable policy on the issue of climate \nchange.\n  I am not disagreeing we stop on this issue. I am simply suggesting we \nneed to make sure it is Congress, it is through the legislative process \nthat we advance these very important policy initiatives.\n  I do want to also make a comment about the concern that somehow or \nanother my legislation would pull back on what the EPA is currently \ndoing with mobile sources, the emissions from tailpipes. I don't think \nwe could have drafted the amendment any more clear to ensure that it is \nspecific as to the stationary sources.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to make sure they are looking at the \ndraft of\n\n[[Page S9784]]\n\nthe amendment we have proposed and not some previous initiatives.\n  One final point before I turn to Senator Inhofe. The point has been \nmade by my colleague from California that the Administrator for EPA has \nsaid it is not her intention to be regulating the small emitters--the \nfarms, the small businesses. She has made those statements, and I \nappreciate that, but the problem we face is the Clean Air Act, which \ndoesn't give her that flexibility to change the Clean Air Act. She is \nobligated to regulate those entities that emit in excess of 250 tons. \nThese are our smaller emitters. So even though she may have suggested \nor stated this is not her intention to go down that road--she can \nperhaps move forward with this tailoring proposal, but as I stand \nbefore you, I can almost bet that will be challenged in court and it \nwill not pass the test and we will be stuck with what we are all \nattempting to avoid, which is capturing the smaller businesses--the \nrestaurants, the drycleaners, et cetera--into this net as we try to \nprovide for the regulation of the major emitters.\n  I am sure we will have plenty of opportunity on this floor to \ncontinue this debate, but at this time, Mr. President, I yield the \nremainder of my time to my colleague from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I only want to be here to thank the \nSenator from Alaska and Senator Thune for trying to bring to our \nattention the issue of the endangerment findings. I have been \ndiscussing the incoming economic train wreck that can result from these \nregulations since the case of Massachusetts v. EPA was decided back in \n2007. The EPA's regulatory reach could go everywhere. It could go into \nschools, hospitals, assisted-living facilities, and just about any \nactivity that meets the minimum thresholds of the Clean Air Act.\n  Despite the attempts to draft an exemption for small businesses by \nthe senior Senator from California, this effort would be hollow at \nbest. Upon issuance of mobile source regulations the EPA has proposed \nin its light-duty vehicle greenhouse gas emission standards, the \nfarmers and small sources still retain the obligation under the Clean \nAir Act, and this obligation is enforceable through citizen suits which \nwe have confirmed through environmental groups will follow. So we know \nthat is going to happen.\n  I would have to say, as the ranking member on the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, the more we get into this, the more \ncomplications we find. In the process of coming up with some type of an \nendangerment finding, we find that the information science has been \nsuppressed. We know of the case of Dr. Alan Carlin, who claims his \nassessment of the latest science on global warming wasn't considered in \nthe endangerment proposal. So we have the endangerment proposal. And \nsome people are not aware of how this process works; that ultimately, \nif the findings are there, that is when they reach into every life in \nAmerica. However, this Dr. Carlin has been with the EPA for a long \nperiod of time, and he was upset that his information was intentionally \nsuppressed.\n  Then we find out that information concerning the economics, such as \nwe found through the U.S. Treasury's assessment when they were trying \nto say, during the consideration of, perhaps this modified bill that it \nwould be the cost of a postage stamp a day, that in fact it would have \nbeen some $1,761 per family every year--we tried to relate that back to \nwhat kind of a tax increase this is. If you remember back in the year \n1993, we had the Clinton-Gore tax increase--the largest tax increase in \ndecades. It was the inheritance tax, marginal rates, capital gains, and \nevery kind of tax imaginable. If you add all that up, that was a $32 \nbillion tax increase. This would be almost 10 times that much.\n  So I think, as we progress along the lines of the endangerment \nfinding, we know how it will be life changing for every element of our \nsociety. So I appreciate the efforts of both Senator Murkowski and \nSenator Thune to bring this issue of endangerment findings to the \nforefront. I am not sure it is the best idea to try to get a 1-year \nmoratorium because in a way that might suppress some of the activity \nthat is going on to expose how bad this is to the public.\n  Having said that, I appreciate being yielded a small amount of time, \nand I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2549\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I stand to briefly discuss my amendment, \nNo. 2549, which is about the so-called czar issue that has a number of \nMembers on both sides of the aisle very concerned.\n  As I introduce this amendment, Mr. President, let me ask unanimous \nconsent to add Senators Grassley, Bunning, Roberts, and Brownback as \ncoauthors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, at this point, I call up amendment No. \n2549.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter], for himself and \n     Mr. Grassley, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Brownback, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2549.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be disposed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To ensure that the Assistant to the President for Energy and \n  Climate Change (commonly known as the ``White House Climate Change \nCzar'') is not directing actions of departments and agencies funded by \n                               this Act)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n\n                           funding limitation\n\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be obligated for the purpose of departments or agencies \n     funded by this Act and lead by Senate-confirmed appointees \n     implementing policies of the Assistant to the President for \n     Energy and Climate Change (commonly known as the ``White \n     House Climate Change Czar'').\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I did just waive reading of the amendment, \nbut I am going to read it. It is very short and very to the point, and \nI think simply reading the language is the best way to introduce the \nconcept.\n  The language is very clear:\n\n       None of the funds made available by this Act may be \n     obligated for the purpose of departments or agencies funded \n     by this Act and led by Senate-confirmed appointees \n     implementing policies of the Assistant to the President for \n     Energy and Climate Change (commonly known as the ``White \n     House Climate Change Czar'').\n\n  That is the entire amendment, and the amendment is, again, very \nsimple and straightforward. The point it is making is that we have \nCabinet-level appointees. They come before the Senate for vetting and \nthey come before the Senate for confirmation. After they are confirmed, \nthey come before the House and Senate on a regular basis as part of our \noversight responsibilities. This constitutional structure should not be \nsuperceded by these so-called czars which have grown enormously under \nthis administration.\n  In making this argument, let me say that this argument has nothing to \ndo with Carol Browner and her qualifications. It is not an attack on \nher. It is an attack, quite frankly, on the concept of these multitude \nof czars and the fact that they are an end run around the \nconstitutional process by which top Cabinet and other officials of any \nadministration are confirmed by the Senate and regularly come before \nthe House and Senate as part of our oversight process.\n  We all know this particular administration has developed an \nunprecedented number of these so-called czars. We have seen a dramatic \nincrease in this phenomenon. Politico wrote that President Obama ``is \ntaking the notion of a powerful White House staff to new heights'' and \nthat he is creating ``perhaps the most powerful staff in modern \nhistory.'' Specifically, the President has created 18 new czar \npositions, and I want to focus on those 18 positions.\n  This czar concept is obviously very general and somewhat undefined. \nWhat I am talking about are those 18 positions because none of those \npositions are established by statute. Congress has not authorized or \nestablished any of those positions, No. 1; No. 2, none of those \nindividuals have come before the\n\n[[Page S9785]]\n\nSenate for confirmation; and No. 3, none of those positions preexisted \nthis administration. As I said a while ago, this has raised concerns \namong a number of Senators and certainly among the American people.\n  As I began my remarks, I added as coauthors of this amendment \nSenators Grassley, Bunning, Roberts, and Brownback. In addition, the \ndistinguished Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, who chairs the relevant \nauthorization committee, has expressed grave concern about this same \nphenomenon and, in fact, has another amendment about this very issue. \nUnfortunately, that amendment is going to be struck down as legislating \non an appropriations bill. But she has expressed concern. She \nspearheaded a letter signed by herself and Senator Alexander and others \nwhich she sent to the President.\n  In addition, and this is very important, this has been a bipartisan \nconcern. Going back to February of this year, the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, wrote the administration expressing \nstrong and grave concern about the constitutional implications of all \nof these czars. Again, the 18 I am talking about are not created by \nstatute, have not been confirmed by the Senate, and never existed prior \nto this administration. Also, within the last 2 weeks, Senator \nFeingold, in addition, has expressed strong and serious concern about \nexactly the same issue and has written to the administration.\n  The purpose of my amendment is to say quite simply that when we have \nan agency, when we have a department that is led by a Senate-confirmed \nappointee, we shouldn't have a so-called White House czar ordering that \nappointee or ordering that agency or that department to do things, \nparticularly when that White House czar is not an office created by law \nthrough Congress, is not a Senate-confirmed position, and did not exist \nin any form or fashion prior to this administration.\n  In terms of my specific amendment, I have chosen to focus on the \nAssistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change, commonly \nknown as the White House climate change czar, for one simple reason: \nFirst, she is among this 18 never created by statute, never confirmed \nby the Senate, never existing prior to this administration, and she is \nclearly in a very powerful position--apparently giving orders to \nSenate-confirmed appointees such as the head of EPA. Of course, the EPA \nis governed by this appropriations bill now on the floor, so that is \nwhy I chose to focus on this particular czar position.\n  Clearly, this particular czar meets all of those criteria which give \nrise to my concerns. The President himself, when he appointed this \nczar, said, ``She will be indispensable in implementing an ambitious \nand complex energy policy.''\n  In addition, there have been several media reports about her dominant \nstature and dominant role in these sorts of considerations. The Wall \nStreet Journal, for instance, on September 11 of this year, reported:\n\n       Ms. Browner helped broker a fuel-standards deal between the \n     administration and automakers earlier this year and has been \n     a conspicuous presence in climate negotiations with Congress. \n     Energy Secretary Steven Chu, meanwhile, has been largely tied \n     up administering billions of dollars in stimulus projects. \n     Ms. Browner, through a spokesman, declined to comment.\n\n  Also, Mary Nichols, the head of the California Air Resources Board, \nand Carol Browner were key in crafting a plan to impose the first-ever \nnational carbon limits on cars and trucks.\n  On May 20, the New York Times reported the following:\n\n       In an interview yesterday, Nichols said Browner quietly \n     orchestrated private discussions from the White House with \n     auto industry officials.\n\n  The obvious question this gives rise to is, What about the head of \nthe Senate-confirmed Energy Department? What about the head of the EPA, \nSenate confirmed? Those folks seem to be shoved to the side, and this \nnew super agency head, a super Cabinet Member seems to be playing a far \nmore dominant role in key issues that are clearly under the purview of \nthe Energy Department and the EPA. Again, this gives rise to serious \nconstitutional concerns. A number of Senators, Republicans and \nDemocrats, have expressed these concerns--Senator Collins, Senator \nByrd, Senator Feinstein, Senator Alexander. So this is a germane \nlimitation amendment that goes absolutely to the heart of the matter: \nShould these czars, positions never created by Congress or by statute, \nnever confirmed by the Senate, never existing prior to this \nadministration--should these czars have a role that is more significant \nthan Senate-confirmed Cabinet Secretaries or agency heads?\n\n  Again, I have very carefully crafted an amendment to go specifically \nto this point. Let me read it word for word. It is not long.\n\n       None of the funds made available by this Act may be \n     obligated for the purpose of departments or agencies funded \n     by this Act and led by Senate-confirmed appointees \n     implementing policies of the Assistant to the President for \n     Energy and Climate Change (commonly known as the ``White \n     House Climate Change Czar'').\n\n  It does not say you cannot implement policies of the President of the \nUnited States. Obviously, the President is elected by the people and \nthe President obviously ranks higher than the head of EPA or anyone \nelse. But it does say the head of EPA, a Senate-confirmed position, \nshould not be ranked below some so-called czar, a position never before \ncreated by Congress, never confirmed by the Senate, never existing \nprior to this administration.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to stand up for the rights and the \nproper constitutional role of the Senate. We play a vital role, \nparticularly with regard to Presidential appointments because only the \nSenate has advice and consent powers. I urge my colleagues to stand up \nfor that constitutional role, to preserve that vital constitutional \nrole, and not to allow so-called White House czars to be an end-run \naround it and to minimize that role in a significant way.\n  This is a significant constitutional issue, it is a significant \nbipartisan issue, and I urge support of my amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Louisiana. Over the past several weeks we have seen \nissues raised with increasing frequency and volume around the use of \nthe word ``czar'' by the Obama administration.\n  I do believe it is unfair to suggest that the White House has a \nclimate czar directing EPA's actions behind the scenes. I do not \nbelieve that is true. Effectively, the title ``czar,'' as we all know, \ndoes not exist. The current Assistant to the President for Energy and \nClimate is there to serve as an adviser to the President and to \nAdministrator Jackson on energy and environmental issues. She also \ncoordinates the work of multiple Cabinet level agencies on one of \nPresident Obama's key policy priorities--clean energy and jobs that are \nessential for long-term economic growth.\n  In a way, this is becoming quite political because it is not unusual \nfor a President to have high-level staff members in the White House who \nhelp to coordinate policy issues that touch a number of Federal \nagencies. We have heard a lot about it. What we do not hear is that \nPresident Bush had 47 such advisers for other issues. We Democrats did \nnot make a huge issue about it. So I have a hard time understanding, \nwith all of the concern over climate change and the rapidity with which \nit is moving, that a Special Assistant to the President who was head of \nthe EPA during the Clinton administration is somebody who is spurious. \nShe is steeped in this. She can give the President good advice. He \nwants her to be an assistant. So I do not understand quite why she is \nbeing picked on.\n  I still believe the day-to-day work of protecting the environment is \nvery much driven by Administrator Jackson and the EPA staff. I have met \nwith the Administrator. I spoke with her on the phone this morning. I \nread into the Record a letter she wrote yesterday. She is very much \nhands-on. So I think all of the energy going into these attacks ought \nto be put into perspective, and that perspective is that the former \nPresident of the United States had 47 special assistants. We didn't \nmake a big deal of it. So I do not understand why this one position is \nnow taken and an amendment is there to eliminate it.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on the Vitter amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S9786]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I want to very briefly rebut some of the \narguments of the distinguished Senator from California. First of all, \nin her last sentence she characterized the amendment as an amendment to \neliminate the position. Of course it does not eliminate the position in \nany way.\n  She said earlier that Carol Browner does not tell EPA what to do. If \nthat is the case, then this amendment will not have to change anything \nshe does or how she operates and we should all come together to support \nthe amendment to help allay concerns of the public. The amendment does \nnot prohibit her from advising the President. The amendment does not \nprohibit her from coordinating multiagency meetings. The amendment is \nvery clear, and it simply prohibits her from ordering around the EPA, \nwhich has its own Senate-confirmed head.\n  Again, I underscore the fact that this amendment is very carefully \nand narrowly written and does not prevent any of the legitimate \nadvisory responsibilities that Senator Feinstein has discussed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Perhaps I can engage the Senator from Louisiana. \nCandidly, I do not understand the wording of the amendment. Let me read \nit. You have read it, and I appreciate that. It does not make sense to \nme. Here is how it reads.\n\n       None of the funds made available by this Act may be \n     obligated for the purpose of departments or agencies funded \n     by this Act--\n\n  So none of the funds may be obligated for the purpose of departments \nor agencies funded by this act--\n\n     and lead--\n\n  It says ``lead'' but led, I think that is a misspelling--\n\n     by Senate-confirmed appointees, implementing policies of the \n     Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change.\n\n  I don't know what that means on its face.\n  Mr. VITTER. I would be happy to explain through the Chair what it \nmeans. The agency I have in mind, which is funded by this act and led \nby a Senate-confirmed position, is EPA. So it simply means that EPA \ncannot use any of its funds to implement orders, policies, from Carol \nBrowner--the White House czar's policies. If the President wants to \ndirect them, obviously the President outranks the head of EPA. But a \nWhite House czar, in a position not created by Congress, not confirmed \nby the Senate, never existing prior to this administration, should not \nbe giving orders to a Senate-confirmed Cabinet Member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, Carol Brown's title is not czar, it is \nAssistant to the President. The President has chosen to appoint an \nassistant to assist him in evaluating, I assume, various issues \npertaining to climate change. It is a complicated subject. She has \nexperience. She has been in government. She has served as head of a \ndepartment. But the actual policies come over the signature of the \nAdministrator of the EPA.\n  What you are saying is, essentially, then, the President cannot have \nany special assistant for the purpose of coordination, asking \nquestions, informing, helping produce--it does not make sense to me. I \nthink on its face it is not clear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, to wrap up, my amendment says none of \nthat. My amendment does not prevent this climate change czar from \ninforming and assisting the President. My amendment does not prevent \nher from convening multiagency and multidepartment meetings. My \namendment doesn't say any of that and doesn't prevent any of that. It \nsimply prevents her from ordering the EPA, headed by a Senate-confirmed \nappointee, to do certain things.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may, I would like to respond to that. Let me \ngive an example. The CIA is headed by a Senate-confirmed Director, Leon \nPanetta. He carries on policies from the National Security Council led \nby General Jones, a nonconfirmed official. Does the Senator from \nLouisiana believe that the National Security Adviser to the President \nshould not have any role in intelligence and national security matters? \nWhat is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.\n  Mr. VITTER. Through the Chair, my answer is no, I don't believe that. \nMy amendment has nothing to do with that, and, by the way, that \nposition is created by statute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If I may, I know the Senator from Missouri is waiting \nto speak because he has an important meeting to go to. But if I could \ntake 2 minutes, I think the Senator from Louisiana is making a point \nthat concerns not just him but a number of us in the Senate on both \nsides of the aisle. Maybe the best way to suggest that is this way.\n  No. 1, the focus should be on the 18 new czars appointed by this \nPresident who were not confirmed, never have existed before, and the \nnumber of them.\n  No. 2, it was not the Republican side of the aisle that raised these \nconcerns first. Perhaps this would best express the concern that many \nof us have. It was offered by Senator Byrd, senior Member of the \nSenate, the constitutional conscience of the Senate, who in a letter on \nFebruary 23 said--this was a letter to President Obama--\n\n       The rapid easy accumulation of power by White House staff \n     can threaten the constitutional system of checks and \n     balances. At the worst, White House staff have taken \n     direction and control of problematic areas that are the \n     statutory responsibility of Senate-confirmed officials.\n\n  That would be exactly the point in terms of an environment or energy \nczar and energy or environment Secretary.\n\n       As Presidential assistants and advisers,\n\n  Senator Byrd goes on to say--\n\n     these White House staffers are not accountable for their \n     actions to Congress, to cabinet officials, and to virtually \n     anyone but the President. They rarely testify before \n     Congressional committees--\n\n  Et cetera.\n  Then, Senator Collins, on behalf of six Senators, wrote the President \na very respectful letter focusing on the 18 new czars who had been \nappointed by the President simply asking what their authorities and \nduties are, how they are appointed, whether they are willing to \ntestify, whether they would consult with us. Senator Feingold, the \nDemocratic chairman on the constitution subcommittee, has expressed his \nconcern and indicated he might hold hearings.\n  I think Senator Vitter is selecting a single example of this unusual \nnumber of new czars and raising the question of the constitutional \nchecks and balances that is the same issue that Senator Byrd and \nSenator Feingold and many of the rest of us raised.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, through the Chair, I thank my colleague from \nSouth Dakota, Senator Thune, for allowing me to speak for a minute. We \nagreed to do that rather than to offer amendments that I intended to \npropose to this bill. I want to make sure everybody understands a \nconcern that Senator Thune, many others, and I have; that is, the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's potential efforts to push through \nback-door carbon regulations which they cannot achieve legislatively on \nthe Senate floor.\n  EPA, over the next several years, may attempt to impose trillions of \ndollars in new energy taxes that will kill millions of jobs. Of course \nthey will say that is not their intent. They want to control climate. \nBut that will be the impact of regulations they could issue over the \nnext few years to control carbon emissions.\n  Experts have told us the House-passed Waxman-Markey legislation would \nkill 2.4 million American jobs and impose new energy taxes on the \nAmerican people. Even President Obama has previously confirmed that \nunder his plan for carbon emission mandates, electricity prices will \n``necessarily skyrocket.''\n  ``Necessarily skyrocket''. Those are the President's words. In the \nEPW Committee, I presented information from the Missouri University \nFood and Agricultural Policy Research Institute which determined that \nthe Waxman-Markey legislation would raise farm production for an \naverage family-run\n\n[[Page S9787]]\n\ncommercial production farmer who grows corn and soybeans by about \n$11,000 in 2020 and rising to over $30,000 by 2050.\n  In this time of suffering, when so many people are out of work and so \nmany family budgets are stretched thin, I cannot, in good conscience, \nstand by and remain quiet when there is a potential that such new \nenergy taxes would be imposed on American families, farmers, and \nworkers. It is no wonder the Senate is pausing before we jump off the \ncliff.\n  Senators, especially from manufacturing and the coal-dependent \nheartland where I am from, know how much this bill will punish the \nMidwest, South, and Great Plains. This spring, EPA began the process to \nstart limiting carbon emissions through regulations, and they will do \nit through expensive plant-by-plant command-and-control regulations, \nnot a cap-and-trade system.\n  Some say we could limit this problem by not regulating small \nemitters. But that is no different than Waxman-Markey, which already \nexempts small emitters. Thus, similar to Waxman-Markey's national \nenergy tax, regulations that exempt small emitters would still impose a \nnational energy tax and kill millions of jobs. Every family will be hit \nby higher electricity prices when they go after the large electricity-\nproducing companies.\n  They will face more money for heating, more money for gasoline, more \nmoney for diesel fuel--if you are on the farm--more money for almost \neverything they buy that is produced with energy, which is just about \neverything that is not in the IT world, although there will be costs \nthere too.\n  Businesses will face large increases in backdoor costs put on them by \nhigher prices they must pay, even if they fall below the threshold. \nThese costs, the backdoor impact of these costs, will be felt on \nfamilies, on workers who can lose their jobs.\n  That is why I proposed two amendments to prevent EPA from imposing \nbackdoor carbon regulations when they result in lost American jobs or \nraise costs unacceptably for farmers. I was gratified when the Senate \nearlier passed a version of my jobs amendment during the budget debate. \nBut the leaders on the majority side stripped the job protection out of \nthe bill, leaving workers vulnerable again.\n  They again, during this debate, will not allow us to protect workers \nfrom job-killing carbon proposals, but we will continue to educate the \nAmerican people on how much they will suffer under proposed carbon \nlegislation and regulation.\n  I have to add one last word about my friends and majority colleagues, \nSenators Kerry and Boxer. There continue to be reports that their bill \nwill not include, in writing, before anybody votes on it, crucial \nsections on how they would distribute their program carbon allowances.\n  This, regrettably, would hide, not only from us but from the American \npeople, the true costs of the energy tax they propose to impose.\n  If my Senator friends from Massachusetts and California believe truly \nin what they are doing, they should not hide the provisions from us. \nThey should give us the time and the American people the time they need \nto determine the bill's impact.\n  With millions of jobs on the line and trillions of dollars in tax \nincreases at stake, the American people deserve no less. I call on my \ncolleagues to stand for the suffering people of America who are \nburdened already by energy costs and could pay much more. I call on \npeople who may be affected to let their Members of Congress know how \nthey feel.\n  Nobody is going to put out a mandate saying we cannot encourage them \nto speak. Nobody, no czar is going to come down and say: You cannot \nexpress your opinion. I have expressed mine. I have found a lot of \npeople--almost everybody I talk to who raised the subject in my State \nof Missouri agrees.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I move to table the Vitter amendment No. 2549. I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. President, I withdraw that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish to speak in support of an amendment \nthat was offered earlier today, actually it was filed, I think it was \nattempted to be called up by Senator Murkowski. The Democratic majority \nobjected to getting a vote on that amendment, which, I think, suggests \nthey do not want to have a vote on that amendment. Frankly, I can see \nwhy.\n  From what I hear about the whole debate on climate change and cap-\nand-trade legislation that has passed in the House, it will not be \nvoted on in the Senate this year. The reason it will not be voted on is \nbecause there are a lot of people in this Chamber who, I think, do not \nwant to have that vote because they know it is a bad vote for them to \nmake.\n  Fear not, EPA has come to the rescue of people who want to see a lot \nof this stuff accomplished but do not want to have to make a tough \npolitical vote on it. So what we are now faced with is the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency deciding they are going to regulate \ncarbon emissions under the Clean Air Act and moving forward with the \nregulations to do that.\n  The Murkowski amendment would essentially prevent funds from being \nused to do that. It weighs in favor of having Congress deal with this \nvery complex, very weighty, very consequential, and very costly issue \nto the American people.\n  This legislation, as we all know, would increase energy prices, cost \nus jobs, be unfair to entire regions of the country, mine included, \nenlarge an already bloated bureaucracy in Washington, DC, and put our \nNation at a certain economic disadvantage.\n  I have been skeptical of that controversial legislation that has \npassed the House, the cap-and-trade bill over there, for some time, for \nthe reasons I have mentioned.\n  Additionally, I think it is fair to say there would be very little \nenvironmental benefit derived from that legislation, were it enacted, \nwithout binding, enforceable commitments by China, by India, and other \ndeveloping countries that are now significant sources of carbon \nemissions.\n  I find it disappointing that in the middle of this important debate \nthe administration wants to use the back door--issuing regulations to \ncap carbon dioxide under the Clean Air Act because they cannot get a \nWaxman-Markey type climate bill through the front door.\n  Instead, the relevant committees of this body and the Senate as a \nwhole should be able to consider whether now is the right time for a \nnew massive energy tax disguised as an EPA regulation.\n  During the previous administration, the EPA had published an Advanced \nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking that showed just how impractical it would \nbe to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases under the \nClean Air Act.\n  These onerous regulations covered homes, schools, churches, \nhospitals, small businesses and potentially even small farms with \nlivestock.\n  Under the Clean Air Act, the primary mechanism for regulating carbon \nemissions would be a fee placed on each ton of covered pollutant \nemitted above a certain threshold.\n  This fee, if applied to carbon emissions, is nothing more than a tax \non energy that would have severe consequences as our economy struggles \nto recover from a long recession.\n  While the Bush administration regulations never made it past an \ninitial draft, the Obama EPA is moving quickly to finalize an \nendangerment finding and regulate carbon dioxide emissions.\n  In April 2009, the EPA issued a draft endangerment finding that \nlinked emissions from motor vehicles to an endangerment of human \nhealth.\n  The comment period has closed on this draft endangerment finding, and \nwhen the EPA issues a final ruling it will trigger an array of \nregulations under the Clean Air Act.\n  These command and control regulations will have far reaching \nconsequences for our economy at a time when we can least afford it.\n  According to media reports, EPA will eventually propose regulations \nfor not just mobile sources, but stationary sources that emit over \n25,000 tons of carbon dioxide.\n  The first round of regulations on stationary sources would cover \napproximately 13,000 facilities in the United States.\n\n[[Page S9788]]\n\n  These include powerplants, large manufacturing facilities, \nrefineries, fertilizer manufacturers, and a long list of other \nfacilities that are critical to the health of our economy.\n  In South Dakota, these regulations would place a tax on powerplants, \nethanol refineries, and even our largest public university.\n  And we need to remember that these companies will pass these new \ncosts on to you and me. Now is an especially bad time to saddle the \nAmerican people with what is in effect a gigantic new energy tax that \nwould cause electricity, gasoline, and home heating costs to skyrocket.\n  Additionally, pending the outcome of the final endangerment finding, \nthe EPA might be legally bound to regulate all sources that emit over \n250 tons of carbon dioxide.\n  If this statutory threshold of the Clean Air Act is enforced, over 1 \nmillion carbon-emitting entities would be faced with a new tax, \nincluding commercial buildings, churches, homes, schools, restaurants, \nand manufacturing facilities both big and small.\n  Regulation of carbon dioxide is far too important for EPA and the \nadministration to craft expensive, cumbersome, top-down regulations \nunder the Clean Air Act.\n  Republicans in the Senate know this, Democrats in the Senate know \nthis, the EPA knows this and the White House knows this.\n  Last year, Congressman John Dingell said that EPA greenhouse gas \nregulations would lead to ``a glorious mess.'' He continued by stating \nthat ``As a matter of national policy, it seems . . . insane that we \nwould be talking about leaving this kind of judgment, which everybody \ntells us has to be addressed with great immediacy, to a long and \ncomplex process of regulatory action.''\n\n  Congressman Dingell said it best when he concluded that carbon \nregulation under EPA had ``the potential for shutting down or slowing \ndown virtually all industry and all economic activity and growth.''\n  According to an OMB memo associated with EPA's endangerment finding, \n``Making the decision to regulate CO2 under the [Clean Air \nAct] for the first time is likely to have serious economic consequences \nfor regulated entities throughout the U.S. economy, including small \nbusinesses and small communities.''\n  Representative Collin Peterson, chairman of the House Agriculture \nCommittee, noted in a recent op-ed that EPA regulations of greenhouse \ngas emissions would result ``in one of the largest and most \nbureaucratic nightmares that the U.S. economy and Americans have ever \nseen.''\n  Senator Murkowski and I have filed an amendment to the fiscal year \n2010 Interior and Environment appropriations bill that would prohibit \nthe EPA from moving forward with regulations on carbon dioxide emitted \nfrom stationary sources for 1 year.\n  This amendment is not intended to impact the recent announcement from \nEPA and the Department of Transportation regarding new tailpipe \nemission requirements for new cars and light trucks.\n  Additionally, this amendment is not intended to impact the regulation \nof other greenhouse gasses, such as hydrofloural carbons, which are \nalso included in the proposed endangerment finding.\n  This amendment would simply delay the expensive, top-down regulation \nof carbon emissions from thousands if not 1 million stationary sources \nin the United States.\n  For those Senators who wish to regulate carbon emissions through a \ncap-and-trade system, I encourage you to support this amendment as well \n. You should be supporting this amendment.\n  This amendment is not about whether carbon dioxide emissions should \nbe regulated or whether the Federal Government should take any action \nto reduce carbon emissions. Rather, this amendment is about the process \nof regulating carbon dioxide emissions.\n  Should regulations as far reaching and expensive as taxing carbon \ndioxide be determined by EPA bureaucrats behind closed doors? Or should \ncarbon regulations be openly debated on the floor of the U.S. Senate?\n  The Murkowski amendment gives the Senate a clear choice.\n  Constituents, through their elected representatives, should have a \nvoice in that debate. If carbon dioxide regulations moved through the \nEPA unchanged, the American people would be deprived of their \nopportunity to be heard on this very important subject. Meanwhile the \ncost of gasoline, food, and manufactured goods will skyrocket. I urge \ncolleagues on both sides to acknowledge the extremely dangerous \nconsequences of allowing the administration to unilaterally regulate \ncarbon dioxide under the Clean Air Act. I understand the Murkowski \namendment will not be allowed to be voted on. I believe the regulations \nthat amendment addresses should be delayed until Congress has the \nopportunity to debate the consequences. I will continue to work with \nSenator Murkowski and other colleagues, families, and small business, \nto make them aware of what the EPA intends to do by regulation.\n  In addition to speaking on the Murkowski amendment, as I have filed \nan amendment which is similar, I ask unanimous consent to call up my \namendment and ask that it be made pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. THUNE. Let me briefly speak to the amendment because it simply \naddresses this subject in a slightly different way. It is clear the \nmajority does not want to have a vote on either the Murkowski amendment \nor my amendment because they get at the fundamental issue which is \nwhether we are going to have a debate in Congress about regulating \nCO2 emissions or whether we will allow an administrative \nagency, the EPA, to do that for us. I understand my amendment, which \nhas now been objected to, will not have a vote. We know where the votes \nare on this. But like the Murkowski amendment, what my amendment is \ndesigned to do is to shed daylight on harmful regulations that are \ntaking shape behind the closed doors of the EPA. My amendment is \ndesigned to give our constituents a greater say in climate change \nregulations.\n  The amendment is also designed to force the EPA to consider the \ndramatic impact these new Clean Air Act regulations on carbon dioxide \nwill have on electricity and gasoline prices. If these regulations move \nforward, I am concerned that many families, especially those who rely \non coal-generated electricity, will see skyrocketing electricity bills. \nI am also concerned for families and truckdrivers who could see \ngasoline and diesel prices go up. EPA regulation of CO2 \nwould amount to a tax on millions of working-class families.\n  During debate on the climate change bill, proponents of cap and trade \nclaimed that lower income families will be made whole by giving local \ndistribution companies free allowances to meet the new carbon \nregulations. Aside from whether this mechanism would actually limit the \nimpact on working families, it is clear such a safeguard is simply not \npossible under the Clean Air Act. Carbon regulations under the Clean \nAir Act would effectively be a huge new tax on electricity and gasoline \nprices paid by families and small businesses.\n  Additionally, new taxes under the Clean Air Act would apply to oil \nand ethanol refineries. In South Dakota, we produce approximately a \nbillion gallons annually of ethanol. If the EPA moves forward with \ncarbon caps under the Clean Air Act, 12 ethanol plants in South Dakota \nwill be subject to this new tax. Additionally, we have a large soybean \nprocessing facility hoping to soon produce biodiesel that would also be \ncovered. Not only will these costs be passed on to consumers in the \nform of higher prices at the pump, but the new regulations will be a \nmajor setback to renewable fuel production. In the end, the energy \nsecurity benefits of domestic renewable fuel production will be \nnegatively impacted by these new regulations.\n  My amendment 2540 asks EPA to consider the costs and the adverse \nimpacts these regulations will have on the economy before moving \nforward with an endangerment finding.\n  It is clear that neither the Murkowski amendment nor mine will be \nvoted on. This issue is not going away. The EPA is moving forward. The \nHouse has acted on this issue. The Senate\n\n[[Page S9789]]\n\ndoesn't want to take the hard votes on this so they have punted it to \nthe EPA. The EPA is now moving forward by regulation to do what \nCongress doesn't have the courage or the will to do, and that is to \nhave a debate about the relative costs and, perhaps, benefits of \nclimate change legislation. It is wrong for us to allow the bureaucracy \nat the EPA to move forward with these regulations that could be so \nharmful to our economy, so harmful to jobs, so disastrous when it comes \nto the energy prices paid by families and small businesses.\n  This issue will be back. Senator Murkowski will bring it back. I will \nbring it back. Others of my colleagues who care about the impact of \nthis particular regulation on small businesses and families will be \nback to debate the issue even though the Democratic majority will not \nallow us to get a vote today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Louisiana \nwishes to speak in morning business, which is fine. I wonder if I could \nmake one brief announcement. Members are interested in bringing this \nbill to a conclusion. There are a number of amendments that were listed \nin the consent order. I ask that Members come to the floor to call up \ntheir amendments shortly. Senator Coburn has a number, Senator Reid, \nSenator Collins. Senator Ensign has a motion to recommit. If these \nMembers could come to the floor and call up their amendments, it would \nbe appreciated. We would be able to, hopefully, conclude the bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I certainly will.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am here to make a few comments addressing the points \nraised by Senator Thune and Senator Murkowski. They were going to offer \nan amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The Senator has an hour.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I won't be taking that. At what point would the Senator \nlike me to use the time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I think directly following Senator Landrieu.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is fine. And how long is Senator Landrieu speaking?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Ten minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized following \nSenator Landrieu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I appreciate the leadership of the Senators from \nCalifornia and Tennessee, trying to move this important appropriations \nbill through the process. As we heard this morning, there are lots of \nimportant issues pending. I came to speak for a few minutes not about a \npending amendment but about an issue bubbling up and brewing in a \nfairly significant way that we will have to address sometime soon, not \nnecessarily on this bill today, not necessarily through an amendment \nprocess to the Interior appropriations, but a program that is in the \nInterior appropriations bill that is screaming for attention. That is \nthe program having to do with the management of wild horses. It is not \na major issue in all 50 States, but it is a big issue to a handful of \nwestern States and of interest to several of us in this body.\n  Let me thank Senator Feinstein and her staff for the leadership they \nare providing in helping us shape policy. She has been extremely \nattentive over the last several months. I thank her. I acknowledge the \ninterest of former Senator Salazar, now Secretary of Interior, and his \ntop leadership. They have a tremendous amount of issues before them, \nissues that will take a lot of their time. For them to make this a \npriority because some of us have asked them to, I acknowledge that and \nthank them, all the assistant secretaries and staff from the Interior \nDepartment who are working on this.\n  There are two aspects to this important issue. One involves the \nfiscal element which taxpayers are alarmed about. The wild horse \nprogram, because of its mismanagement and poor, old-fashioned way of \noperating, is chewing up or taking up about three-quarters of the \nbudget of the Bureau of Land Management. From a fiscal perspective and \na financial management perspective, it is crying out for reform.\n  On the other hand, there is the view of the inhumaneness of some of \nthe practices going on that also cries out for attention. I come to \nspeak briefly about both.\n  As to the big picture, at the turn of the century, we had about a \nmillion wild horses in the territory of the United States. It is sad, \nfrom the perspective of most people, that we are now down to 66,000 \nwild horses and burros basically forced, through policies developed in \nthe 1970s, to stay in relatively small places, grouped in a few States, \nmost notably the States of Nevada, Wyoming, and California, and a few \nother western States. We also are down to a few herds of horses. The \nreason I believe this is important not only to western States or \nranchers or landowners or humane societies and others is because for \nthe American people generally, the idea of wild spaces with wild horses \nis something that is part of our heritage. We want to make sure that \nheritage is not lost, that we are being responsible in terms of the way \nthe land is being used for multiple purposes and, from the perspective \nof horse advocates, that the horses themselves are being treated well.\n  None of that is now being done in the way that most people would \nappreciate or would be satisfied with. There have been any number of \nstudies I will submit for the record. Most recently, the Congressional \nResearch Service, as well as the Government Accounting Office, \nsuggested major changes to the program. I am going to go through a few \npossible options. One is the creation of several public/private \nsanctuaries. This has been suggested by a few fairly high-profile \nindividuals. The idea has merit. We are working with a variety of \ngroups, along with the Department, to think about the possibility of \ncreating public/private partnerships, large sanctuaries, maybe 500,000 \nor a million acres, where thousands of wild horses could not only roam \nfreely in a healthy way but could potentially become ecotourist \nopportunities for some of the States and communities, as it would be an \nattraction that could potentially make money and attract people to some \nof the western areas or, for that matter, rural areas in other parts of \nthe country.\n  There is the possibility of making some smart investments to step up \nsome of the adoption programs that might work. There are any number of \nscientific and new technologies that can be brought to bear in terms of \nbreed management, reproductive issues that could help us to get a much \nmore cost-effective, sane, and humane approach to this problem.\n  I wanted to let the managers of this legislation know that while we \nwill not have an amendment at this time on the Interior bill, I am \nlooking forward to working with members of the Energy Committee who \nhave jurisdiction over this matter to review in detail a bill that has \ncome over from the House, the ROAM Act, by the chairman of that \nsubcommittee, whom I commend for taking the committee's time, \nCongressman Rahall, who sent the bill over here to the Senate. As we \nbegin to discuss the ways that bill could potentially be modified, \nworking with the Department of Interior to find a long-term solution, \none that is cost effective, one that is humane, and one that honors the \ngreat history of wild horses, not just pleasant to look at but helped \nus to settle the West, helped us to open transport and commerce for the \nNation, have carried us into war, into battle, helped to feed and \nclothe this Nation in our history, needs a bit more attention than what \nthey are getting right now.\n  In conclusion, there was a disturbing roundup conducted not too long \nago--just a few weeks ago--and I thank the advocates who brought this \nto my attention and commit to them to continue to work until we find a \nbetter way forward; again, a way that is good for the wild horses, that \nhonors our heritage but is also very respectful of these Western lands \nand the ranchers who have multiple uses of this property.\n  I am certain in the Nation God has bequeathed to us we can find \nenough space for everyone if we keep an open mind. I know the Senator \nfrom Tennessee would agree with that; that if we work hard enough, we \ncan find some common ground solutions to this issue.\n\n[[Page S9790]]\n\n  I thank the Chair and yield the time. I understand my colleague from \nCalifornia is here to speak on a different issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  I am on the floor, along with Senator Whitehouse--there may be some \nothers--to respond to the remarks made by Senators Murkowski and Thune \nregarding an amendment they very much wanted to put before this body. \nThat amendment, simply stated, would stop the Environmental Protection \nAgency from enforcing the Clean Air Act as it relates to the pollutant \ncarbon.\n  Some of the things they said are so reminiscent of what was said \nbefore the Clean Air Act passed, that: Oh, this is going to be a \nterrible thing for our people; and the same thing that was said when \nthe Clean Water Act was passed: Oh, this is going to be a burden on \nbusiness. I have to say to this body, the day we turn our back on these \nlandmark environmental laws is the day the health of our people will \nsuffer. We do not want that to happen.\n  I wish to be clear, I know this amendment will come back again and \nagain. I know there will be attacks on the Clean Air Act and the Clean \nWater Act. That is an attack on our families. It is particularly an \nattack on our children and on our vulnerable senior citizens and our \ncitizens who may have disabilities and who are ill. I will fight it \nwith every ounce of my strength every time it rears its ugly head in \nthis Chamber.\n  The interesting thing is, most of these environmental laws started \nwith a Republican President named Richard Nixon. What happened to the \ndays when environmental laws were supported on both sides? Those days \nappear to be gone.\n  What I would like to do is--I am going to yield up to 20 minutes to \nthe Senator from Rhode Island. He is so eloquent on this point. Before \nI do, I wish to place some letters in the Record.\n  One letter is from the Environmental Protection Agency, saying they \nwould have a very difficult time making sure the air was clean if that \nMurkowski amendment had been offered and passed and become law.\n  Interestingly, we have a letter from the Alliance of Automobile \nManufacturers, also opposing that Murkowski amendment.\n  We have two more letters to put in the Record--and this just happened \nin 24 hours--one from a coalition made up of the Alliance for Climate \nProtection, Center for American Progress Action Fund, Center for Auto \nSafety, Center for Biological Diversity, the Clean Air Task Force, \nClean Water Action, the Defenders of Wildlife, Environment America, the \nEnvironmental Defense Fund, League of Women Voters of the United \nStates, National Audubon Society, the Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil, Oceana, the Sierra Club, Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, \nSouthern Environmental Law Center, and Union of Concerned Scientists--\nall saying they oppose this amendment, which concerns not enforcing the \nClean Air Act as it relates to carbon dioxide.\n  Lastly, we have a very well put together letter by the National \nWildlife Federation, in which they quote a poll that says 75 percent of \nAmericans believe our government should, in fact, regulate global \nwarming pollution, which, of course, is mostly carbon.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent those letters be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       United States Environmental\n\n\n                                            Protection Agency,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 23, 2009.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: Thank you for your letter about \n     Senator Lisa Murkowski's Amendment Number 2530 to H.R. 2996, \n     the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Act. As you noted in your letter, \n     Senator Murkowski's amendment would prohibit the \n     Environmental Protection Agency from using any funds made \n     available under the Act to take any action that would have \n     the effect of making carbon dioxide a pollutant subject to \n     regulation under the Clean Air Act for any source other than \n     a mobile source.\n       You asked me what the practical impact would be if Congress \n     enacted Senator Murkowski's amendment. Perhaps the most \n     striking impact would be to make it impossible for the \n     Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate the light-duty \n     vehicle greenhouse-gas emissions standards that the agency \n     proposed on September 15, 2009. Because of the way the Clean \n     Air Act is written, promulgation of the proposed light-duty \n     vehicle rule will automatically make carbon dioxide a \n     pollutant subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act for \n     stationary sources, as well as for light-duty vehicles. The \n     only way that EPA could comply with the prohibition in \n     Senator Murkowski's amendment would be to not promulgate the \n     light-duty vehicle standards.\n       As you know, promulgation of EPA's light-duty vehicle \n     greenhouse-gas emissions standards is an essential part of \n     the historic agreement that President Obama announced earlier \n     this year with the nation's auto-makers, the State of \n     California, the Department of Transportation, and EPA. That \n     agreement attracted broad, bi-partisan support. The joint \n     DOT-EPA standards are projected to save 1.8 billion barrels \n     of oil over the life of the program, which is twice the \n     amount of oil (crude oil and products) imported in 2008 from \n     the Persian Gulf countries, according to the Department of \n     Energy's Energy Information Administration Office. \n     Additionally, the standards are projected to help save \n     consumers more than $3,000 over the lifetime of a model year \n     2016 vehicle and reduce approximately 900 million metric tons \n     of greenhouse gas emissions. Enactment of Senator Murkowski's \n     amendment would pull the plug on those extraordinary \n     accomplishments.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lisa P. Jackson.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               September 24, 2009.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: We are writing regarding Senator \n     Murkowski's Amendment Number 2530 to H.R. 2996, the \n     Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act. As manufacturers, we are sympathetic to \n     the thrust of Senator Murkowski's amendment that the \n     Congress--and not simply EPA acting under the provisions of \n     the current Clean Air Act--should determine how best to \n     reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions economy-wide.\n       However, the amendment raises additional issues that must \n     be considered where complicated and interconnected \n     environmental and legal issues are at stake. We are concerned \n     that due to the complex interactions among regulations under \n     the various sections of the Clean Air Act, the amendment may \n     impact significantly pending regulations in the mobile source \n     sector--despite language in the amendment that would appear \n     to leave the sector unaffected. In a letter to Senator \n     Feinstein dated September 23, Administrator Jackson stated \n     EPA's interpretation that the Murkowski amendment as filed \n     would ``make it impossible for the Environmental Protection \n     Agency to promulgate the light-duty vehicle greenhouse-gas \n     emissions standards that the agency proposed on September 15, \n     2009.''\n       While the author of the amendment appears not to intend \n     this outcome, we feel compelled to express our concerns. It \n     is critical that the national program for regulating \n     greenhouse gas emissions from autos be finalized early next \n     year. Failure to do so would subject automakers to a \n     patchwork of conflicting state and federal regulations.\n       Therefore, we respectfully oppose the adoption of the \n     Murkowski amendment as written to H.R. 2996.\n           Sincerely,\n     Dave McCurdy,\n       President & CEO, Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.\n     Michael Stanton,\n       President & CEO, Association of International Automobile \n     Manufacturers.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               September 24, 2009.\n       Dear Senator: We are writing in opposition to Senator \n     Murkowski's revised appropriations amendment (No. 2350) to \n     the FY 2010 Interior Appropriations bill, H.R. 2996, which \n     concerns carbon dioxide pollution and the Clean Air Act.\n       The filed amendment's spending limitation would go well \n     beyond blocking the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \n     from curbing carbon dioxide pollution from power plants, \n     refineries, and other big ``stationary sources.'' It also \n     would block EPA from implementing the Supreme Court's \n     landmark decision in Massachusetts v. EPA by curbing carbon \n     pollution from cars and trucks. If this amendment passes, EPA \n     could not issue the historic consensus standards that the \n     President announced in May with the support of the auto \n     makers, the UAW, states, and the environmental community. \n     Here is why:\n       The first sentence of the amendment says: ``No action taken \n     by the Environmental Protection Agency using funds made \n     available under this Act shall have the effect of making \n     carbon dioxide a pollutant subject to regulation under the \n     Clean Air Act . . . for any source other than a mobile \n     source. . . .'' This is a reference to Section 169 of the \n     Act, which says that every new or modified major stationary \n     source needs to install best available control technology \n     (BACT), considering costs, for each pollutant ``subject to \n     regulation under this chapter,'' i.e., under the Clean Air \n     Act.\n       When EPA issues final vehicle carbon dioxide standards \n     under Section 202 of the Act as\n\n[[Page S9791]]\n\n     planned next March, carbon dioxide will automatically become \n     a pollutant ``subject to regulation'' under Section 169. From \n     that point on, new or modified major stationary sources will \n     need to install BACT for carbon dioxide, just as they \n     currently do for other dangerous pollutants. This is \n     automatic; there is no way around it without blocking the \n     vehicle rules. Since the Murkowski amendment would bar any \n     action that has the effect of making carbon dioxide ``subject \n     to regulation'' under Section 169, EPA would be barred from \n     issuing the vehicle standards.\n       This is why EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said yesterday \n     that the amendment would be ``a death knell to the historic \n     agreement between the President and auto-makers to increase \n     gas mileage and reduce emissions from cars and trucks.''\n       Congress should not take any action that would undo the \n     progress already made on carbon pollution from motor \n     vehicles.\n       Later paragraphs of the revised amendment attempt to limit \n     other collateral damage done by the amendment. But those \n     provisions cannot overcome the effect of the amendment's \n     first sentence.\n       We believe common ground can be found to ensure that the \n     Clean Air Act's stationary source requirements apply only to \n     power plants and other big sources, not smaller sources, and \n     to incorporate this approach in comprehensive energy and \n     climate legislation. But it cannot be accomplished through \n     this rider.\n       The Murkowski amendment would only move us farther from, \n     not closer to, a bipartisan consensus on comprehensive clean \n     energy and climate legislation that the Senator says she \n     seeks. We strongly urge you to oppose Senator Murkowski's \n     amendment as well as any other amendments to the Interior \n     Appropriations bill that would delay America's progress \n     toward a clean energy economy that would create jobs, \n     increase America's energy security, and cut pollution.\n         Alliance for Climate Protection, Center for American \n           Progress Action Fund, Center for Auto Safety, Center \n           for Biological Diversity, Clean Air Task Force, Clean \n           Water Action, Defenders of Wildlife, Environment \n           America, Environmental Defense Fund, League of Women \n           Voters of the United States, National Audubon Society, \n           Natural Resources Defense Council, Oceana, Sierra Club, \n           Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, Southern \n           Environmental Law Center, Union of Concerned \n           Scientists.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     National Wildlife Federation,\n\n\n                                     National Advocacy Center,\n\n                                Washington DC, September 24, 2009.\n       Dear Senator: National Wildlife Federation asks you to \n     oppose Amendment 2530, sponsored by Sen. Murkowski, on HR \n     2996 (the Fiscal Year 2010 Interior and Environment \n     appropriations bill).\n       America and the world are poised to take long overdue \n     action to reduce global warming pollution. As President Obama \n     said this week in a climate address to the United Nations, \n     there are ``no excuses for inaction. . . . we don't have much \n     time left.'' At this historic juncture, Senators should not \n     hit the ``snooze button'' to delay enforcement of the Clean \n     Air Act and extend the government's long nap on global \n     warming. Year after year, Congress has debated whether or not \n     to act on global warming, but little has been done. Over the \n     past two decades, as the impacts of warming became \n     increasingly severe and the scientific warnings increasingly \n     urgent, U.S. emissions of global warming pollution increased \n     17%.\n       National Wildlife Federation, which represents over four \n     million members and supporters, and Americans across the \n     nation strongly and overwhelmingly support action by the \n     Environmental Protection Agency. A recent Washington Post \n     poll found that 75% of Americans believe the government \n     should regulate global warming pollution from power plants \n     and factories.\n       Amendment 2530 has been revised from earlier drafts and now \n     has a fatal flaw that would extend the amendment's damage \n     beyond what is intended, undoing the recent progress made by \n     automakers, environmental groups and the Obama administration \n     to reach agreement on reducing vehicle emissions. The \n     regulation of a pollutant under the Clean Air Act for \n     vehicles automatically triggers regulation of stationary \n     sources. By blocking action on stationary sources, the \n     amendment would block the Environmental Protection Agency \n     from implementing the new vehicle tailpipe standards as well.\n       The Clean Air Act has a strong and proven track record of \n     cleaning the air we breathe while allowing our economy to \n     prosper. The Supreme Court has spoken clearly on the \n     government's neglected responsibility to address global \n     warming under the Clean Air Act. And the Environmental \n     Protection Agency is already taking commonsense steps to meet \n     the requirements of the Clean Air Act, focusing on the \n     biggest corporate polluters and limiting the reach of any new \n     regulations.\n       We appreciate Sen. Murkowski's commitment to advance global \n     warming legislation in Congress, and look forward to pursuing \n     that common effort with her and other Senators this year. But \n     we strongly oppose this amendment.\n       Please support action on global warming and vote ``no'' on \n     Murkowski Amendment 2530.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Larry J. Schweiger,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. So here we had a situation where I am very pleased the \nrules of this Senate did not allow this very dangerous amendment to be \nbrought before the body. We would have talked about it for days \nbecause, before I would allow a vote on that, I would want to make sure \nevery single Senator understood it is a repeal of the Clean Air Act \nthrough the backdoor, even after the Bush Supreme Court said the Clean \nAir Act covers carbon and greenhouse gases.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, first, let me thank my distinguished \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee chairman, Senator Boxer, for her \npassionate defense of this statute, which has improved the quality of \nlife and the quality of our air for a generation now of Americans \nagainst this assault. I appreciate that she has given me a few moments \nto discuss the amendment the Senator from Alaska wanted to offer. I \nknow it was not offered, but, nevertheless, I feel we need to respond, \ngiven the message that amendment sends to this body, to the Nation, and \nto the world regarding America's position on the need to curb global \nwarming and our move toward a clean energy economy.\n  This amendment would have tied the hands of the Environmental \nProtection Agency at the very time we need its help to protect the \nAmerican public from the dangers of climate change--dangers to \nAmerica's public health, to our national security, and to our economy.\n  A little history is in order here.\n  In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court overrode the Bush administration and \nruled, in a case called Massachusetts v. EPA, that the Clean Air Act \nrequires the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gas \nemissions as pollutants, if the Agency determined that greenhouse gases \nposed a danger to public health, and the Court further obliged the EPA \nto go ahead and make that determination, yes or no.\n  The Bush administration, of course, did everything in its power to \navoid the duty ordered by the Supreme Court, and it was only this April \nthat the EPA, under Administrator Jackson, finally issued its proposed \nendangerment finding. The finding, unsurprisingly, acknowledged what \nevery reasonable scientist--in fact, every reasonable person--has known \nfor years: That carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gas \nemissions cause our planet's atmosphere to warm and pose a threat to \nthe public health.\n  The conclusion that these gases should be regulated under the Clean \nAir Act logically and inevitably followed, as required by law, from the \ndetermination that these pollutants threaten public health. Thankfully, \nthis administration has already begun this important work. Senator \nMurkowski's amendment would have required EPA to take what is called a \ntimeout while Congress crafted a legislative solution to global \nwarming. Unfortunately, time is not on our side as we race to protect \nour planet from the effects of carbon pollution.\n  Just yesterday, our President spoke before the United Nations about \nthe challenges to all nations from unchecked global climate change and \nthe opportunities we have to revive the world economy through the \nadvancement of clean energy and clean energy jobs. The world community \nneeds the United States to be a leader in this effort, and the world is \nwatching our actions closely.\n  President Obama pledged that our steps so far--investments in \nalternative energy, efficiency measures, tougher fuel standards--and \nour steps to come ``represent an historic recognition on behalf of the \nAmerican people and their government.'' He said:\n\n       We understand the gravity of the climate threat. We are \n     determined to act. And we will meet our responsibility to \n     future generations.\n\n  Forcing the EPA to take a timeout now would have sent exactly the \nopposite message; would tell the world we do not truly care about \nclimate change; that we are not ready to step up, let alone lead; would \nsay we would prefer to leave a polluted world to our\n\n[[Page S9792]]\n\nchildren and grandchildren, a world far worse off than the world our \nparents and grandparents left to us. Any timeout now would have damaged \nour international progress and our leadership.\n  Moreover, a timeout of the sort proposed in the Murkowski amendment \nwould have hurt our legislative efforts. Supporters of the timeout idea \nprofess to want a legislative solution to address climate change. Well, \nmaybe. But doing so would have set back that very goal.\n  To the extent some of the big polluters are working with us in this \nlegislative process, it is because they feel the hot breath of the \nfuture on their necks, and they know they had better participate or be \nleft to their fate. Give them an artificial reprieve from those \nconsequences--real consequences of science, of fact, of law, and of \nnature--and their motivations would change. Delay would become their \nfriend, indeed their purpose, because of the artificial, false status \nquo that a timeout would create for them.\n  Let me tell you how these polluters affect Rhode Island, my home.\n  Let's start back in 1972, when EPA authorized the use of tall \nsmokestacks instead of emissions limits. By the mid-1970s, four \ndifferent circuit courts of appeal had ruled that the Clean Air Act \nrequired real emissions controls and not just increased stack heights. \nA tall smokestack only curbs local emissions, but it spreads the \npoisons widely.\n  In 1977, Congress enacted section 123 of the Clean Air Act, which \nbarred the construction of smokestacks taller than called for by good \nengineering practice. Notwithstanding, Midwestern powerplants continued \nto increase the height of their stacks. The average smokestack height \nincreased from 200 feet tall in 1956 to over 500 feet tall in 1978. In \n1970, there were two smokestacks in the United States taller than 500 \nfeet. By 1985, 180 smokestacks stood taller than 500 feet. Twenty-three \nof these were over 1,000 feet. Once you get over 1,000 feet tall, you \nactually have to put that smokestack on the aviation safety maps \nbecause it becomes a hazard to aviation. Local interests, of course, \nwere happy because less of the smokestack-emitted poisons fell locally \nand more were spread abroad.\n  What did this mean for downwind States, such as my State of Rhode \nIsland? Well, all other things being equal, the taller the stack, the \nfarther the poisons travel. According to a 2001 report by the Clean Air \nAct Task Force entitled ``Power to Kill: Death and Disease from Power \nPlants Charged with Violating the Clean Air Act,'' pollution spewed \nfrom just 51 plants has shortened the lives of as many as 9,000 people \nnationwide annually, including about 1,500 to 2,100 people in our \ndownwind States such as Rhode Island.\n  These plants have also caused tens of thousands of asthma attacks \neach year and hundreds just in Rhode Island. This is just from 51 \nplants. Physicians for Social Responsibility has estimated that all \ncoal plants in the United States together cause about 23,600 premature \ndeaths and 554,000 asthma attacks each year.\n  The Centers for Disease Control tells us that between 1980 and 1995 \nthe incidence of childhood asthma increased over 100 percent--the \nincrease of childhood asthma more than doubled--from 3.6 percent to 7.5 \npercent of all children.\n  By 2005, nearly 9 percent of all children were reported to have \nasthma. In African-American children, the rate soared to 19.2 percent--\nnearly one in five African-American children.\n  Massachusetts, Maryland, and my State of Rhode Island--all downwind \nStates--were among the five States with the highest incidence of \nasthma. The Rhode Island Lung Association estimates that 15,000 \nchildren--15,000 children in my State of less than 1 million \npopulation--have asthma. Nationally, every year more than 40 kids 4 \nyears old and under will die from asthma. Another 115 kids 5 to 15 \nyears old will die, and nearly 400 more age 15 to 34 will die every \nyear. This is what upwind polluters have helped cause.\n\n  When I was attorney general for the State of Rhode Island, I joined \nEPA's lawsuit against American Electric Power for its illegal \nmodification of 16 plants. In 2008, the utility company settled the \nlawsuit by installing billions of dollars of pollution-control \nequipment which slashed NOX and SO2 emissions by \n813,000 tons each year--813,000 tons of pollution each year. American \nElectric Power also paid a $15 million penalty, nearly five times what \nExxonMobil has paid so far for the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1990, and \nit invested another $60 million in environmental mitigation projects. \nSo don't tell me things can't be done.\n  But in Rhode Island, the danger continues, and still every summer in \nRhode Island the morning radio announces several days that are unsafe \nair days, when infants and seniors and people with breathing \ndifficulties are told they should stay home, that they should stay \nindoors because the summer air in Rhode Island is not safe, and one of \nthe prime reasons it isn't safe is because we are downwind. So don't \nexpect a lot of sympathy from me for these polluters, with their \nbelching smokestacks, that want a free pass to endanger the public, \ntimeout or not.\n  Here is a little description of how tall some of these stacks go. The \ntallest building is Willis Tower in Chicago. A lot of its radio towers \nare on the top, but it is still a heck of a big building. The Empire \nState Building is 1,250 feet. The Washington Monument is 555 feet. The \nStatue of Liberty is 305 feet. In Marshall, WV, there is a smokestack \n1,204 feet tall. In Rockport, IN, there is a smokestack 1,038 feet \ntall. In Jefferson, OH, there is a smokestack exactly 1,000 feet tall. \nI don't know whether that has to go on the aviation safety maps. That \nis just at the boundary. What these things do is they solve the local \nproblem of pollution by pushing the poisons so far up into the \natmosphere that they don't fall in West Virginia, in Indiana, and in \nOhio, but they move elsewhere and they land often in Rhode Island, and \nwe face the health consequences every day. So if anybody is looking for \na sympathetic ear for these powerplants, they have come to the wrong \nplace if they have come to Rhode Island.\n  Today, we are facing perhaps the greatest environmental threat of our \ntime: Global climate change triggered by increased concentrations of \ncarbon dioxide in our atmosphere. We have supersaturated the atmosphere \nwith carbon dioxide, and it is having an effect. Coal-fired powerplants \nshare much of the blame. Forty percent of all carbon dioxide emissions \ncome from coal powerplants. And the polluters will fight--they are \nfighting--any effort to control their carbon dioxide emissions. The \npolluter opponents of climate change who are resisting our change to a \nclean energy economy are strong and wealthy, and they will stop at \nnothing. We have even recently seen forged letters to Congress opposing \nclimate change legislation in the names of groups that never authorized \nthe letters.\n  Just like the polluters fought the Clean Air Act in the past, just \nlike the polluters built taller stacks rather than making what comes \nout of the stacks cleaner, just like the polluters manipulated their \nflunkies in the Bush administration, today the polluters wanted a \ntimeout. They may say they support a legislative solution to climate \nchange, but if they could fool us so that we defunded and stopped and \nweakened all of the other available tools for pollution control, that \nwould not help in passing a climate bill. That would give those \npolluters every incentive in the world to defect, to delay, and \nultimately to defeat our efforts to move this country toward a clean \nenergy economy, to stop subsidizing their pollution of our air, and our \nefforts to start solving this great problem of our day. To protect \nourselves, we have to keep all of our tools available, all options for \ncurbing greenhouse gas emissions working to protect us.\n  I thank the chairman very much for yielding me this time, and I look \nforward to working with her as we continue to find ways to support this \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Rhode \nIsland. He gets us to where we need to be, which is focusing on what \nhappens to our people when we walk away from protecting them from \npollution.\n  I know Senator Brown is in the chair. I wanted to share with him the \nfact that he knows well that after the Cuyahoga River caught fire in \nOhio in 1969 and many of our lakes and rivers\n\n[[Page S9793]]\n\nappeared to be more like sewers, the committee, which I now chair so \nproudly and on which Senator Whitehouse sits, responded by enacting the \nClean Water Act. That was 1972. I don't know if Senator Brown was born \nyet. The fact is, that incident of a river catching fire really caught \nthe attention of the people of this Nation. Whether it was our water or \nour air or endangered species, we decided to take control of our \ncommunities, of our health, of our environment.\n  There is a lot about America that makes us proud. There is a lot \nabout America that makes us great. I believe one of our values is \ncaring about the health of our families. I thought Senator Whitehouse \nwas very clear that we are not just debating a regulation on page 4 or \n5 or 20 or 50. We are talking about the ability of our kids to breathe \nthe air. We are talking about the ability of this planet to survive \nwithout the ravages of global warming, which the Bush administration's \nCDC told us would have unbelievable effects on the health and safety of \nour people.\n  The laws we passed are the landmark laws. So therefore I just want to \nbe put on record, along with Senator Whitehouse, that if this amendment \nthat wasn't offered today comes back in any other form, we are going to \nhave to open up the debate pretty wide--pretty wide--because a repeal \nof an environmental law can't be done on an appropriations bill. In \nessence, when you don't enforce a law--that is what the Murkowski \namendment would have done--when you don't enforce it, it is the same as \nnot really having it. But you don't have to look in the eyes of your \nconstituents and say: Oh, by the way, today I repealed the Clean Air \nAct. What you say instead is: Today I fought to have a pause--no \nenforcement. Well, let me tell my colleagues, when that child gets \nasthma, she is not going to ask her mom: Did I get asthma because there \nwas a pause in the Clean Air Act or because they repealed the Clean Air \nAct? That child will get asthma. I swear to my colleagues that I am not \ngoing to let more kids get asthma, not on my watch. It is wrong. It is \nwrong.\n  Here is the great news. The great news is, if we decide to be the \nleader in this clean energy revolution, we will see our people get \nhealthy. We will see millions of jobs created. We will move off of \nthese dirty energy sources. We will create American jobs, 21st-century \njobs, building wind turbines, installing solar panels, producing a new \nfleet of electric cars, hybrid vehicles. We see it in Ohio already \nwhere they are building solar panels. This is the one area of growth.\n  We are having a tough time in our State--people laid off, terribly \nhigh unemployment rate. The stimulus is helping us. We are getting some \njobs back, but we are suffering. The one area of growth, I say to the \nChair, 125,000 new green jobs that can't be taken away. You can't take \na job of putting a solar rooftop on a home in Los Angeles or Riverside \nor San Bernardino or San Diego or Akron, OH--you can't have that person \nin China putting on a solar rooftop. They have to be here. These are \ngood jobs. That is what we ought to be doing, not repealing the laws \nthat protect the health of our citizens but trying to figure out a way \nto work together to have a bill that will create these new clean energy \njobs, that will protect our kids from carbon pollution, and that will \nmake sure the ravages of global warming won't occur.\n  At the end of the day, our competitiveness depends on how we face \nthis challenge. I believe Thomas Friedman got it right. If you haven't \nread his book ``Hot, Flat, and Crowded,'' I think you should read it \nbecause he is so eloquent on the point. He is not on the defense on \nthis, he is on the offense. He says that if we don't grab this mantle \nof leadership on clean energy, then other countries will grab it and \nthey will create the technologies, they will create the jobs, and we \nwill fall behind.\n  America is a leader. We are not a follower. We will have many more \nopportunities to debate this in the future, but, my goodness, if we are \nfacing legislation that does not move us forward but takes us back to \nbefore Richard Nixon was President by not enforcing the Clean Air Act--\nI have heard of the party of no, but this is the party of yesterday if \nthose are the kinds of amendments we are going to face, dangerous \namendments that will hurt the health of our children.\n  So I wanted to make sure that America takes control of its energy \nfuture and that it doesn't cower in the corner and repeal laws that \nprotect our citizens, landmark laws such as the Clean Air Act. I am so \nglad that today we avoided having to have this long debate. I am glad \nthis amendment was disallowed because it doesn't belong on an \nappropriations bill. It is a repeal of the Clean Air Act. Let's face \nit, you don't do that in 15 minutes on the floor of the Senate and call \nit a timeout. Call it whatever you want, but when you tell an agency: \nDon't enforce the law that protects the health of our children and our \nfamilies, that is a repeal through the back door.\n  So I thank you very much for the time. I know I have additional time. \nI will not be using it. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, in just a few minutes, the Senator from \nMaine will have the floor. Senator Feinstein has asked those Senators \nwho have amendments which are part of the unanimous consent agreement \nto come on over and call them up. I think Senator Coburn is probably \ncoming following Senator Collins from Maine.\n  I listened carefully to Senator Whitehouse and to the distinguished \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. I wish to make \nan observation, if I may, which will take only 3 or 4 minutes, not to \nprolong the debate.\n  First, what Senator Thune and Senator Murkowski were saying is that \nthe question of climate change is so important that we in the Congress \nought to deal with it, not the Environmental Protection Agency. That is \nthe point of the amendment.\n  Second, I am one Senator who believes we need to deal with climate \nchange and who believes humans are contributing to it, and we need to \nstop stuffing so much carbon into the atmosphere. But while my friends \non the other side often speak in great rhetorical flourishes about the \ninconvenient problem of climate change that my friend and fellow \nTennessean Al Gore talks about, they are conspicuously silent about the \ninconvenient solution, which is nuclear power.\n  Even the President of the United States went to New York this week \nand made an entire speech talking about our commitment to climate \nchange and lecturing the developing countries of the world about \nclimate change when they are ahead of us on nuclear power and the \nPresident, in his entire remarks, didn't mention it once. I simply \nthink that ought to be noted in the midst of this debate.\n  The largest contributors to carbon in the air are China, the United \nStates, Russia, India, and Japan. There are 44 nuclear reactors under \nconstruction this minute, almost all of them in Asia. China has 4 \nreactors under construction and has announced plans for 130 more \nreactors. Why? Because nuclear power is carbon free. The United States \nhasn't built a new nuclear plant in 30 years. Russia intends to build 2 \nreactors a year in order to replace the 30 percent of electricity they \nget from natural gas so they can sell that gas to Europe at a big \nprofit.\n  Japan is building two nuclear reactors a year. They derive 36 percent \nof their electricity from nuclear. South Korea gets nearly 40 percent \nof its electricity from nuclear, and they are planning 8 more reactors \nby 2015. India is developing thorium reactors instead of uranium. \nFrance is 80 percent nuclear and is selling electricity to Germany, \nwhich is the only major European country still renouncing nuclear \npower. And here we sit worried about climate change, having 104 \nreactors that we built before 30 years ago, which produce 20 percent of \nour electricity, but 70 percent of our carbon-free electricity, and the \nPresident goes to New York and doesn't say one word about nuclear \npower. He wants to build 186 50-story wind turbines, which will operate \nabout a third at a time, and not at all in our part of the country, \ninstead of taking the greatest technological advance of the last \ncentury, which we already use to produce 70 percent of our carbon-free \nelectricity, and say let's do more of that.\n  I am hopeful that as this debate proceeds, the President will say \nlet's double our nuclear production and build\n\n[[Page S9794]]\n\n100 new nuclear plants in the next 20 years. We should be able to agree \non 100 new nuclear plants and electrifying our cars and trucks. If we \ndo those two things alone, we would meet the Kyoto Protocol by 2030. \nBut we don't hear a word about it.\n  Let's bring up the inconvenient problem of climate change and let's \ndeal with it here. But let's bring up the inconvenient solution of \nnuclear power. As far as science goes, the chief scientist in the Obama \nadministration, a Nobel Prize winner, Dr. Chu, says nuclear power is \nsafe and nuclear waste--used nuclear fuel--can be safely dealt with for \nthe next 40 to 60 years by having it stored onsite, while we have a \nmini Manhattan Project over the next 20 years to find the best way to \nrecycle used nuclear fuel that doesn't produce plutonium.\n  This is a good debate. I am glad Senators have come to the floor to \ntalk about this, and this is an appropriate amendment on which to have \nthe discussion. The point of the Republican amendments were, let's do \nit in Congress, not the agency. If we are going to talk about the \ninconvenient problem, climate change--and I agree it is a problem and \nwe need to deal with it--let's talk about the inconvenient solution, \nnuclear power, which today provides 70 percent of our carbon-free \nelectricity, which is what we are debating.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2531\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have an amendment No. 2531, and I ask that \nit be brought before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2531.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To make funds available for preliminary planning and design \n   of a high-performance green building to consolidate the multiple \noffices and research facilities of the Environmental Protection Agency \n                         in Las Vegas, Nevada)\n\n       On page 183, line 14, before the period, insert the \n     following: ``: Provided, That, at the discretion of the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, from \n     the funds included under this heading, $500,000 may be made \n     available for preliminary planning and design of a high-\n     performance green building to consolidate the multiple \n     offices and research facilities of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency in Las Vegas, Nevada''.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate my friend from Maine allowing \nme to speak for a couple minutes prior to her being recognized.\n  The amendment I have called up allows, not directs, the EPA \nAdministrator to use $500,000 of the funds provided in the bill for \npreliminary planning and design to work to consolidate the many agency \noffices and labs in Las Vegas into one high-performance green building.\n  It doesn't make a lot of sense to continue spending money on aging \nfacilities spread across several buildings in need of repair and \nrehabilitation, particularly with the leases that are not far from \nending. Current costs associated with these facilities' leases and \ntheir operation cost over $5.5 million annually.\n  Consolidation would improve administrative efficiencies and reduce \nagency energy, water, and other costs over time. Developing a more \nprecise estimate of total savings would be part of the preliminary \nplanning effort my amendment authorizes.\n  The people in the offices and labs I think could be consolidated \nwould also greatly benefit from their being able to work more closely \ntogether, given their mission and activities. These include the \nagency's National Exposure Research Laboratory, the Emergency Response \nTeam--when something bad happens with a nuclear device, they are able \nto move on that--the Radiation and Indoor Environments National \nLaboratory, the Financial Management Center, the Human Resources \nOffice, the National Environmental Research Center, and the \nEnvironmental Services Division's various laboratories and Technical \nReference Center.\n  As we know, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 and the \nRecovery Act strongly direct the Federal Government to be a leader, not \na follower, in adopting green building technologies. EPA should be at \nthe top of the list, given its important role, and I think its labs and \nfacilities in Las Vegas should serve as a shining example of \nenvironmental leadership that saves the Federal Government and \ntaxpayers money.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record following my \nstatement a letter to the Appropriations Committee regarding this \nrequest, in compliance with paragraph 9 of rule XLIV of the Standing \nRules of the Senate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 22, 2009.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Inouye,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Chairwoman, Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and \n         Related Agencies, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Vice Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Lamar Alexander,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and \n         Related Agencies, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Inouye, Vice Chairman Cochran, Chairwoman \n     Feinstein, and Ranking Member Alexander: I am writing to \n     request that the Interior Appropriations bill for fiscal year \n     2010 include the discretion for the Administrator of the U.S. \n     Environmental Protection Agency to use up to $500,000 from \n     the amounts identified for buildings and facilities for the \n     purpose of preliminary planning and design work to \n     consolidate the Agency's Las Vegas offices into one high-\n     performance green building.\n       Such a consolidation would save taxpayers money, reduce \n     energy and water use, and improve administrative efficiency. \n     The current facilities used by the EPA offices and \n     laboratories are in need of rehabilitation and repair and \n     their leases expire in the near future, so it is essential \n     that the Agency begin making plans for their future use.\n       Consistent with paragraph 9 of Rule XLIV of the \n     requirements of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I certify \n     that neither I nor my immediate family has a pecuniary \n     interest in the congressionally directed spending items I \n     have requested. I further certify that I have posted a \n     description of the items requested on my official website, \n     along with the accompanying justification.\n       Thank you for your attention to this request\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Harry Reid,\n                                            United States Senator.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on the University of Nevada-Las Vegas campus \nwe have EPA buildings. They are so old. We have been talking about \ndoing something about them for decades. They have been so terribly \nimportant over the years with what has been going on at the Nevada Test \nSite and Yucca Mountain. The leases are about to run out. It is not \nfair to the Federal Government or the university. It would save the \ngovernment huge amounts of money and it would be the right thing to do. \nThis would be the beginning of accomplishing what EPA wanted to do for \ndecades. I hope that Senators will look favorably on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, what is the pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Reid amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2498\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, prior to Senator Reid offering his \nproposal, the pending business before the Senate was an amendment I \noffered earlier this week, which was designed to promote better \ntransparency, accountability, and oversight within our government.\n  I am deeply disappointed that a procedural tactic will be invoked to \nprevent an up-or-down vote on my amendment, which is designed to bring \nthe proliferation of czars under the normal process.\n  The amendment I proposed would have ensured that the 18 new czar \npositions appointed by this administration could be held accountable to \nCongress and to the American people. The proliferation of czars under \nthe current administration to manage some of the most complex and \nimportant issues facing our country has created serious problems in \noversight, accountability, and transparency. It is of great concern to \nme that these positions circumvent the congressional requirements for\n\n[[Page S9795]]\n\noversight. They circumvent the constitutional process by which the \nSenate is supposed to give advice and consent to major policy positions \nwithin our government.\n  I have a list of the 18 new czar positions that have been created by \nthis administration. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 Czars\n\n\n        Positions in the Executive Office of the President (10)\n\n       Central Region Czar: Dennis Ross.

Many of the czars on the list seem to either duplicate \nor dilute the statutory authority and responsibilities that Congress \nhas already conferred upon Cabinet level officials and other senior \nexecutive branch officials who go through the normal constitutional \nprocess whereby the Senate gives its consent to these nominees.\n  As I said when I first introduced this amendment, I do not consider \nevery position that has been identified as a czar in various media \nreports to be problematic. Some of those positions are established by \nlaw. Some of them are subject to Senate confirmation. Rather, my \namendment is carefully tailored so it would not cover and would not \napply to positions recognized in law or subject to Senate confirmation.\n  For example, the proposal I have would not apply to the Director of \nNational Intelligence, to the National Security Advisor, to the \nHomeland Security Advisor, to the Chairman of the Recovery \nAccountability and Transparency Board, or to the so-called information \nor regulatory czar within OMB. These positions, because they are \nrecognized in law, or they are subject to Senate confirmation, simply \ndo not raise the same kinds of concerns about accountability, \ntransparency, oversight, and vetting.\n  Instead, my amendment has been carefully tailored to cover officials \nthat the President has unilaterally designated as responsible for \nsignificant policy matters. It would not have covered the President's \nChief of Staff, for example, and it would not cover less senior White \nHouse officials, despite some misinformation to the contrary.\n  Because the White House has raised so many objections to my \namendment, I have offered to sit down with the White House counsel and \nnarrow the scope of the amendment further, to address any concerns the \nWhite House might have. Unfortunately, the White House has failed to \nprovide any modification to the text of my amendment. Instead, they \nsaid they did not want any of these officials to be called to testify \nbefore Congress.\n  Let me explain exactly what my amendment would have done, so you can \nsee how modest indeed the amendment was.\n  The amendment simply would have required that the President certify \nto Congress that officials in these important positions would respond \nto all reasonable requests to testify before or provide information to \ncongressional committees with jurisdiction over the issues involved.\n  Second, it simply would have required these officials to submit a \nbiannual report to the congressional committee with jurisdiction, \ndescribing the activities of the official and his or her office, and \nany rule, regulation, or policy that the official participated in or \nassisted in the development of.\n  That is it. How can we possibly be against that kind of \naccountability, transparency, and oversight? It is our job as Members \nof Congress to conduct such oversight.\n  We cannot do so when the administration sets up a structure where \nthere is an energy czar, an urban affairs czar, an environmental czar, \na cyber-security czar--the list goes on and on. It creates confusion \nover who is in charge, who is making policy.\n  Let's take the area of health care. Is the top policy position in \nthis administration Nancy-Ann DeParle, who is the\n\n[[Page S9796]]\n\nhealth care czar within the Executive Office of the President--a \nperson, by the way, for whom I have the greatest respect--or is it \nSenate-confirmed Kathleen Sebelius, the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices? Who is in charge? Whom do we hold accountable?\n  What the President has done by creating so many czar positions within \nthe White House that appear to duplicate the executive branch officials \nwho are subject to Senate confirmation is to blur the lines of \nauthority. That is not good for our system of government, and it is not \nin keeping with this administration's pledge to be the most transparent \nadministration ever--a pledge for which I salute the President.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator about her \namendment. The first thing I would like to ask is, her amendment does \nnot specify how many czars--I think that is the term she used on the \nfloor--how many czars she thinks there are in the administration or \nwhat their titles are. Could the Senator from Maine tell me how many \nczars we are going to try to impact with her amendment?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I will be happy to. Mr. President, I say to my friend \nthat I have a list of 18 positions which I have talked repeatedly about \nand which I have inserted into the Record. As I have said, I am not one \nwho has used this term in the way some have to include individuals with \nbroad authority across various agencies, such as the Director of \nNational Intelligence. But that is the position that is established or \nrecognized in law and is subject to Senate confirmation. I did not \ninclude those. In fact, in the language of my amendment, I specifically \nsay it does not apply to positions established in law.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield and share a copy \nof that list with me, I would appreciate it. But in the meantime, I ask \nthe Senator, it seems that the czar watchers on her side of the aisle, \nSenator Hutchison, for example, found 32 czars when she went looking. \nOne of the advisers to some politicians--and I will not include the \nSenator from Maine; she can speak for herself--the noted guru Glenn \nBeck has identified 32 czars as well.\n  I ask the Senator from Maine before we get into the propriety of her \namendment under Senate rules, who is going to define who is covered by \nher amendment, if her colleague from Texas found 32, Glenn Beck found \n32, and she found 18?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I will be glad to respond to the question \nof my colleague. My colleague did not have the benefit of being on the \nSenate floor when I first presented my amendment, and I addressed this \nvery issue.\n  I was very careful in drafting this amendment to make clear that I \nwas not talking about positions that are recognized in law. Some of my \ncolleagues legitimately have taken a different approach. But that is \nnot the approach that is before the Senate now. Rather, I have taken \ninto account the issues that have been raised by my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle, such as Senator Byrd--who certainly knows more \nabout the Constitution than I think any of us who are serving at the \npresent time--who has expressed concerns about the proliferation of \nczars. I have taken into account concerns expressed by Senator \nFeingold, by Senator Feinstein. I have done a careful, narrowly \ntailored amendment that does not attempt to sweep in positions that are \nrecognized in law, nor does it sweep in positions that are subject to \nSenate confirmation.\n  That is why it is so disappointing to me that my colleagues are not \nunanimously adopting my amendment, which it looked like they were going \nto do earlier this week before the White House weighed in, because I \ndid not take a broad sweeping approach. I took a very narrow, careful \napproach that aimed at the promise the President talked about, the lack \nof oversight, transparency, and accountability.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield further for a question, I would \nlike to ask the Senator--I have been told that using the definition of \n``czar'' that Mr. Beck, political adviser to some, and Senator \nHutchison, and even you use, that under President George W. Bush, the \nprevious Republican administration, one could characterize his \nofficials and advisers in the Executive Office of the President and \nother agencies as an Afghanistan czar, an AIDS czar, a drug czar, a \nfaith-based czar, an intelligence czar, a Mideast peace czar, a \nregulatory czar, a science czar, a Sudan czar, a TARP bailout czar, a \nterrorism czar, and a weapons czar, under the previous administration. \nI ask the Senator from Maine if she proposed this amendment under a \nRepublican President who clearly had his own stable of Muscovite czars \nof a lot of different versions?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I, again, will be happy to attempt to \nclarify this issue for my colleague and friend--and he is my friend--\nfrom Illinois. I realize he has his role to play in this debate. But \nthe fact is, he has just listed several positions that are established \nby law. The intelligence czar is the Director of National Intelligence, \nDennis Blair. Joe Lieberman and I wrote the law that established that \nposition in 2004, and he is confirmed by the Senate.\n  The regulatory czar--he is referring to Cass Sunstein in this \nadministration and John Graham in the previous one--it is established \nby law. It is part of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs \nwithin OMB. I am not talking about those positions no matter in whose \nadministration it is. I am talking about perhaps other positions on his \nlist. Regardless of whose administration they are in, I would apply the \nsame standards.\n  The Senator may say why didn't I offer this amendment in the previous \nadministration. The answer is, we did not have this proliferation of \nczar positions in the previous administration. But I would say to my \ncolleagues, regardless of whether it is a Democratic President or a \nRepublican President, a Democratic Congress or a Republican Congress, I \nthink this is an institutional issue, and I think all of us as Members \nof Congress should be very concerned about organizational structures \nthat make it impossible for us to conduct effective congressional \noversight; that insulate these officials who have significant policy \nresponsibilities from ever coming to testify, from going through the \nvetting and the confirmation process.\n\n  I think that is a problem regardless of who the President is, and I \nam not the only one who thinks it. That is why Senator Robert C. Byrd \nwrote to the White House, wrote to the President, as this press release \nsays, questioning the Obama administration on the role of White House \nczar positions because, as he says:\n\n       Too often, I have seen these lines of authority and \n     responsibility become tangled and blurred, sometimes \n     purposely, to shield information and to obscure the decision-\n     making process.\n\n  I am not saying this is part of a plot to obscure information, but \nwhat I am saying is we have an obligation to exercise our \nconstitutional duties, and the proliferation of these unaccountable \npositions in any administration makes that impossible for us to do so.\n  Mr. President, if I may complete the end of my statement--before we \ngot into this good little colloquy. And I do appreciate the opportunity \nto clarify whom my amendment would cover, who would be covered by it \nand who would not. As I said, I was willing to work with the White \nHouse to make this even clearer. My staff was here many hours last \nnight. I had conversations with White House officials and, \nunfortunately, at the last moment, they decided not to try to propose \nrevisions to the text.\n  I am not going to seek to overturn the Chair's ruling on this \namendment which will be forthcoming, and I know how it will go. But I \ndo think it is unfortunate that a procedural tactic is being used to \nblock a vote on this amendment. I do want to tell my colleagues that I \nthink this is a real issue. I am very pleased the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, under Chairman Lieberman, is going to \nhold a hearing to explore this issue because it does have \nconstitutional ramifications and it does involve the balance of power \nbetween the executive and legislative branches. The ruling the Chair is \ngoing to make is not going to be the last word on this subject.\n  The administration needs--any administration--to fully explain the \nresponsibilities and authorities of these\n\n[[Page S9797]]\n\nczars. Until all of these czars are made available to testify before \nand provide information to Congress, until Congress is fully consulted \non the decisions to create these positions in the first place, I will \ncontinue to press forward on this issue.\n  I believe the amendment I drafted is a very reasonable, balanced one, \nand it would have been a significant step toward establishing an \noversight structure for these positions that would provide the \ntransparency, accountability, and oversight our Nation expects from its \nleaders. I am dismayed the Senate is about to choose a point of order \nover these principles.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me point out at the outset my \nfriendship and respect for Senator Collins. These are terms tossed \naround on the Senate floor sometimes in meaningless context, but this \nis meaningful. We have worked together on many issues. I respect her \nvery much and believe when she was chairman of the then Governmental \nAffairs Committee, later to be the Homeland Security Committee, that \nshe did extraordinary work with Senator Lieberman, particularly when it \ncame to the creation of a new intelligence agency. After 9/11, it was \none of the toughest political assignments ever given, and Senator \nCollins handled it with professionalism, in a bipartisan way. I commend \nher for it. I think she is exceptionally talented, and I am happy to \nhave her as my ranking member on the Financial Services and General \nGovernment Appropriations Subcommittee where we continue to work \nclosely together.\n  She raises a legitimate inquiry. The legislative branch should ask \nwhether the executive branch has gone beyond its constitutional \nauthority. I think it is a legitimate question. Unfortunately, before \nshe came to the Senate floor, the waters had been muddied by statements \nmade by our colleague, Senator Hutchison, in the Washington Post on \nSeptember 13 as to when she went searching for czars in the Obama \nadministration, she found 32 of them. The political wise man, Glenn \nBeck, found 32 as well but went on to say on his Web site--he is a \nmajor champion on this issue, incidentally--``since czar isn't an \nofficial job title, the number [of czars in the Obama administration] \nis somewhat in the eye of the beholder.''\n  That is why this becomes a pretty difficult amendment to consider at \nthis moment in time. The Senator from Maine has been kind enough to add \na page in the Record that lists her findings of 18 of these so-called \nczars. I don't know if others would find the same number, more or less. \nWhether there are 57 known czars or whether there are 18, I just don't \nknow.\n  This amendment would prohibit funds for the administrative expenses \nof White House advisers--and that is a term usually used by those not \npartial to Russian history--unless those positions were created through \nexpress statutory authorization.\n  Further, the amendment requires the President to certify to Congress \nthat the adviser will respond to all reasonable requests to testify \nbefore or provide information to any congressional committee with \njurisdiction over such matter.\n  The adviser must give a report every 6 months, kind of a work-in-\nprogress report, a diary of what they are doing. So in addition to \nworking on issues such as health care reform, they need to prepare a \nreport sent to Congress every 6 months to let us know they are showing \nup on time at their desks and actually doing what they are supposed to \ndo. The President doesn't need statutory authority to appoint advisers, \nand it doesn't make sense to require an assistant to the President, who \nhas an otherwise pretty serious workload, to fill out these reports to \nCongress every 6 months to make sure they are showing up as promised.\n\n  But the amendment does touch on accountability in a way that I agree \nwith. Public officials, including those who serve at the pleasure of \nthe President, should be responsive to congressional inquiries. That is \nwhy Senator Collins and I, through our appropriations subcommittee, \nbring in leaders from the administration. And I can't say for certain, \nbut I am virtually certain we have not been turned down by any at this \npoint. The committee expects officials employed in whole or in part by \nthe Executive Office of the President and designated by the President \nto coordinate policy agendas across executive departments and agencies \nto keep Congress fully and currently informed. We ask that of them, and \nso far we have received their cooperation.\n  Over the past several weeks, there has been this new interest in the \nczars and czarinas in the Obama administration, according to Mr. Beck \nand others. Some Members have asked serious questions about the makeup \nof the White House staff. The bulk of the noise being heard right now \nbegan with partisan commentators like Mr. Beck, suggesting this is \nsomehow a new and sinister development that threatens our democracy.\n  Unfortunately, this czar issue didn't start with the Obama \nadministration. It goes back much further in history, and it certainly \nincludes the previous Bush administration, which was not subjected to \nan amendment such as is being offered at this moment. Many of the \nofficials cited by conservative commentators--and I don't include \nSenator Collins because I haven't seen her list of 18--are Senate-\nconfirmed appointees or advisory roles carried over from the Bush White \nHouse. Many are advisers to the President's Cabinet Secretaries. Many \nhold policy jobs that existed in the Bush administration. Some hold \njobs that involve coordinating the work of agencies on President \nObama's key policy priorities: health insurance reform, energy and \ngreen jobs, and building a new foundation for a longlasting economic \ngrowth.\n  I might say that in the past the same concern and furor hasn't \narisen. Darrell Issa, a Congressman from California, was recently on \nFOX News and was asked what kind of investigation he had made into the \nBush administration about czars, and he said he hadn't done so. He \nhadn't raised any objection, although he now thought it was a pretty \nimportant issue under President Obama. In fact, if you adhere to the \ndefinition of czar held by many Members--and I won't include Senator \nCollins in this group but other Members in the Senate--the Bush \nadministration had 47 czars--budget czars, faith czars, manufacturing \nczars, to name a few.\n  Many of the Members who now decry the practice have called on \nPresidents in the past to appoint czars. Senator Robert Bennett of \nUtah, a friend and recognized colleague who worked hard on the Y2K \nconcern, asked for a czar to be appointed, and he said he had worked \nwith that person to maintain ``bipartisan and across-the-government \ncommunication.'' Even the ranking member of the Appropriations Interior \nSubcommittee, Senator Alexander of Tennessee, has had words said about \nczars in this administration. But during remarks delivered on the \nSenate floor in 2003, captured in the Congressional Record, Senator \nAlexander said, ``I would welcome [President Bush's] manufacturing job \nczar.'' That same day in the Senate, he also expressed support for \nPresident Bush's AIDS czar, Randall Tobias.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would ask the distinguished assistant \nDemocratic leader if he is aware that the manufacturing czar in \nPresident Bush's time was appointed by the President and confirmed by \nthe Senate and testified before the Senate? And I wonder if he is also \naware that the AIDS czar was appointed by the President and confirmed \nby the Senate and testified before the Senate?\n  Senator Collins has been careful--I believe he is aware; I wonder if \nhe is aware--that she is not talking about any czars whom we confirm \nand the President appoints and who testify, and she is only talking \nabout the 18 new czars under the Obama administration, just as Senator \nByrd did in February.\n  I wonder if the Senator is aware of those things?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Tennessee for the question, and \nI am aware of that fact, and I would respond to him, that is why I was \ntrying to clarify how many czars are in this Muscovite conspiracy \nbecause one of his colleagues from Texas, Senator Hutchison, identified \n32, as did Mr.\n\n[[Page S9798]]\n\nGlenn Beck, and they included 16--pardon me, 7 of these so-called czars \nare people who have--pardon me, 9 have been confirmed by the Senate. So \nit appears that some of your colleagues do not share your definition \nthat Senator Collins referred to on the floor.\n  The point I am trying to make is that this is a legitimate inquiry, \nit is an important inquiry, but it has been muddled by statements made \nby some Members of Congress and certainly by those in the political \ncommentary realm.\n  The good news for Senator Alexander and Senator Collins and everyone \nelse concerned about this issue is that a trusted friend and colleague, \nSenator Joe Lieberman, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, has \npromised a hearing on this issue. I know he will engage Senator \nCollins, as ranking Republican member, on it, and serious questions \nwhich have been presented will be considered by Senator Lieberman. We \nrespect him in that capacity.\n  So the reason I am objecting to this amendment isn't because I don't \nthink Senator Collins has at least a legitimate inquiry, but I think it \nshould be taken in the greater order of things rather than considered \nin this fashion on an appropriations bill.\n  So, Mr. President, I make a point of order that the Collins \namendment, No. 2498, violates rule XVI, paragraph 4, legislating on an \nappropriations bill.\n  Excuse me, Mr. President, I missed one procedural step.\n  I call for regular order on the pending Collins amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I now make a point of order that the \nCollins amendment, No. 2498, violates rule XVI, paragraph 4, in that it \nlegislates on an appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained. The amendment \nfalls.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the assistant Democratic leader \nfor his comments, and I want to especially thank the Senator from \nMaine.\n  The Senator from Illinois suggested that the waters had gotten \nmuddied because some of us didn't count very well in terms of the \nnumber of czars who might exist in the Obama administration. That is \nwhy we are so fortunate to have the Senator from Maine, who is always \ncareful, always thoughtful, and always experienced. What she has done \nis gone back to Senator Byrd's first letter in February, in which he \nexpressed his concern about the constitutional issues here, and then \nshe has counted 18 new czars in the Obama administration. Her letter of \nSeptember 14 to the President is limited, thoughtful and respectful, \nand she simply asks that the President identify the specific \nauthorities and responsibilities of those positions, the process by \nwhich the administration examines these people, and whether they are \nwilling to testify before us. She is the ranking member of the \ncommittee Senator Lieberman chairs and will have an opportunity during \nthe hearings to explore this.\n  Some of us are concerned that the administration is too dedicated to \ntoo many Washington takeovers, and the unusual number of new czars is \nthe most visible symbol of the large number of Washington takeovers. I \nthink we are fortunate that we have as thoughtful a Senator as the \nSenator from Maine and an independent Senator from Connecticut, Joe \nLieberman, who will look into it. I am sure Senator Byrd will want to \nweigh in. Senator Feingold may want to have a hearing. So we will have \nan opportunity to have a thoughtful resolution.\n  I thank the Senator from Maine for her amendment and her leadership \non this issue, and I look forward to hearing more from her on it.\n  Madam Chairman, if I could say to the Senator from California, the \nSenator from New Mexico has been waiting and the Senator from Louisiana \nhas been waiting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes of \nrecognition before we move away from this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I will be brief. I wish to compliment my \ndistinguished colleague from Maine on her amendment. It was very well \ntailored and very carefully put together. I do think it is a shame that \nit won't be able to come to any vote because of this procedural move by \nthe assistant majority leader.\n  I want to underscore three points:\n  No. 1, maybe we can talk about some other universe when we debate the \nBeck amendment, but we are not debating the Glenn Beck amendment, we \nare talking about the Collins amendment, and we will get to vote on the \nVitter amendment. What all of us have been talking about are appointees \nof the President whose offices were not created by statute in any way \nand who were never Senate confirmed.\n  No. 2, I also want to underscore the point that this is clearly a \nbipartisan concern, as evidenced by Senator Byrd's letter of February \nand the recent comments of Senator Russ Feingold. It is a very serious \nand very bipartisan concern.\n  No. 3, we will have an opportunity to vote on this issue today under \nmy amendment. The climate change czar is one of those 18, and she \nclearly threatens to supercede and overshadow Senate-confirmed Cabinet \nmembers such as the head of EPA. My amendment is very simple. It says \nEPA shouldn't have to carry out orders of the climate change czar when \nit is supposed to be headed by a Cabinet member, a Senate-confirmed \nappointee, directly at EPA.\n  So again I compliment the Senator from Maine on her efforts. I will \ncertainly pledge ongoing support on the issue, including through my \namendment.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the \nMurkowski amendment. The Murkowski amendment would prohibit the EPA \nfrom using funds under the Clean Air Act to deal with climate change.\n  I listened earlier today, and I heard the Senator from California, \nthe chairman of the Appropriations Interior, Environment Subcommittee, \nspeaking about the issue, and she spoke eloquently. I heard Senator \nBoxer, the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nspeaking about this issue. She also made the very strong point that \nthis amendment would be ill-advised and irresponsible. And I rise today \nto speak to this amendment and to oppose it.\n  America and the world are face-to-face with a perfect storm--an \nenergy crisis and a climate crisis that require a do-it-all energy \npolicy. These two crises are closely linked, and today I would like to \nraise one facet of the solution: clean energy incentives.\n  I strongly believe we should resist efforts to block the Obama \nadministration actions on clean energy on the fiscal year 2010 Interior \nand Environment Appropriations Act or other legislation, for that \nmatter. If that were to happen, American families and the men and women \nin our Armed Forces would be stuck with the bill.\n  Concerns about the cost of the administration's actions to address \nour energy and climate crisis have it exactly backward. The biggest \ncost is the cost of inaction--costs families pay at the pump in energy \nbills every day; money from their hard-earned paychecks that end up in \nthe treasuries of foreign countries or foreign oil companies, some of \nwhich are hostile to the United States. In the end, the only people who \nwill benefit from efforts to block clean energy solutions are members \nof OPEC and other special interests in the fossil fuel industry.\n  To put it simply, our dependence on fossil fuels is a huge drag on \nfamilies' pocketbooks and a clear and present danger to our national \nsecurity. In 2008, American families and businesses sent $475 billion \noverseas to pay for foreign oil. That works out to over $4,000 per \nhousehold in America--a massive transfer of wealth from hard-working \nfamilies in New Mexico and the other 49 States to the treasuries of \nforeign nations. The largest consumer of foreign oil is the U.S. \nmilitary, which is engaged in two major conflicts in the Middle East--\nan area of strategic importance largely due to its massive oil \nreserves.\n\n[[Page S9799]]\n\n  Making matters worse, this same reliance on fossil fuels pollutes our \natmosphere with toxic compounds such as sulfur dioxide, soot, and \nmercury, alongside greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. The global \nclimate crisis is real. Strong scientific evidence shows unless we \ntransition to clean energy sources, our home States will pay a heavy \nprice.\n  In New Mexico, scientific evidence indicates more devastating forest \nfires, droughts, and invasive species caused by climate change.\n  Luckily, we have numerous cost-effective solutions at hand to address \nthe energy and climate crisis. My home State of New Mexico and many \nother States across the Nation are rich in much cleaner domestic \nsources of energy, sources such as wind and solar, geothermal and \nnatural gas. Several years ago, wind energy was unusual but today these \nprojects are quite common. Wind projects create thousands of U.S. jobs \nin the steel, manufacturing, and construction sectors.\n  The United States is now installing over a gigawatt of solar power \neach year and there are six other gigawatts of concentrated solar power \nprojects planned nationally, particularly in the Southwest.\n  U.S. natural gas reserves have also increased by 35 percent in 1 \nyear, an increase that gives our Nation a century's worth of supply. \nWhile natural gas is a fossil fuel, it is significantly cleaner than \neither coal or oil, and much more abundant.\n  Despite these improvements, we continue to waste tremendous amounts \nof energy. Government and industry studies have found that the right \ninvestments could save energy and more than $1 trillion at the same \ntime. Energy efficiency does not mean turning down the heater in the \nwinter. Rather, efficiency means investments in building technologies \nsuch as advanced windows, insulation, and smart electric grids that do \nnot waste energy or money. Improving our efficiency on a major scale \nwould also save more than 1 billion tons of greenhouse gases, proving \nwe can address the global climate crisis without increasing costs on \nfamilies.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Bush administration was \nrequired by the Clean Air Act to reduce air pollution that is causing \nour climate crisis, but the Bush administration failed to act. Congress \nshould not put the Obama administration in handcuffs when the President \nis trying to change course and follow the law. To those who worry that \nthe administration action could short circuit debate on these issues in \nCongress, nothing could be further from the truth. I agree that \nCongress should act and set a comprehensive clean energy incentive \npolicy. Numerous Cabinet Secretaries from the administration have \ntestified that they welcome congressional action to create a path \nforward on clean energy. For Congress to block the administration and \nto fail to act itself would be the height of irresponsibility.\n  Our energy and climate crisis have the same root cause. The Senate \nshould address both challenges with the same cost-effective solutions--\nincentives for renewable energy and energy efficiency. That is why \nefforts to block the Obama administration from acting on climate change \nare so dangerous. Such efforts continue our reliance on fossil fuels \nthat hurt family budgets, threaten our national security, and pollute \nour atmosphere.\n  The bottom line is America needs a ``do it all'' energy policy, one \nthat includes all the tools in our energy toolbox--more alternative \nenergies and a commitment to conservation; increased domestic oil \nproduction, including offshore; investments in clean coal research and \ntechnology; and nuclear power has to be part of the mix. Energy and \nclimate change are one of the defining challenges of our time--our \nperfect storm. We have the tools to fix the problem. Now we need the \nwill to act, not to obstruct.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wanted to make some comments based on \nthe comments the Senator from New Mexico raised.\n  He talked about $4,000 a year in terms of imported oil into this \ncountry and then he talked about we needed to do offshore exploration, \nbut I note for the Record he voted against an opportunity to expand \noffshore exploration yesterday. You can't have it both ways. If we are \ngoing to get off oil and hydrocarbons, it is going to take us 25 years. \nBut when we have an opportunity to decrease that cost of $4,000 per \nfamily and use American oil, we do not have the same consistency as the \nrhetoric when it comes to the votes. I think the Record needs to show \nthat although the Senator claims that, when he had the opportunity \nyesterday to vote in a way to expand domestic offshore exploration, he \nvoted against that opportunity.\n  I wish to take this time to bring up several amendments and make them \npending. I thank the chairman of the committee and staff for working \nwith us. We will try to make this as painless as possible and do it in \nas short a period of time as possible, but I have been down here for \nthe last 4 days, every day, trying to get things done and unable to get \nthem done. So I am going to take adequate time to explain these \namendments and also explain a couple of amendments I agreed not to \noffer but I think it pertinent the American people hear about.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2463\n\n  First, I ask the pending amendment be set aside and amendment No. \n2463 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will try to do this, to save some time, \nin the shortest amount of time I can. I also thank the chairman of this \ncommittee for working with me.\n  There are several amendments I did not offer. I want to spend a \ncouple of minutes talking about those because I think the American \npeople need to hear about them.\n  Less than a block from this building is the Belmont House. It is a \nfoundation. It is a beautiful building. It has $4 million in the bank, \nthe foundation does. There is an earmark in this bill at this time of a \n$1.8 trillion deficit, of a 16-percent increase in this bill. The \nSenator, Senator Landrieu from Louisiana, is sending $1 million to that \nbuilding. They have the money in the bank but we are still going to \ntake $1 million from our grandkids and send it there. I am not offering \nthat amendment in conjunction with having the pleasure of the chairman \nconsider my other amendments. But the American people need to know that \nkind of thing is going on. It is absolutely not indicated. Who uses \nthat building? We do,\n\n[[Page S9801]]\n\nfor fundraisers. We do for events. We do for social events. In fact, \nthere is a high price paid when you rent it. But what we are going to \ndo, without regard to what our fiscal situation is, is we are going to \nsend another $1 million as though it is a peanut and send it to that \nbuilding. That is all I will say on it, but to me it is one of the \nreasons why this Congress, and we in particular as Members of the \nSenate, lack the respect of the American people.\n  The other amendment I am not going to offer that was objected to by \nthe chairman of the Resources Committee is for us to know what kind of \nland we own. We don't know, since 2005, how much land we have or where \nwe own it.\n  Supposedly the BLM puts out something. Supposedly the Geological \nSurvey puts something out. But there is not a concise list of the land \nthat the Federal Government owns--and it is somewhere in excess of a \nthird of all the land of this country--and it is 650 million acres. In \nthis bill is another $300 million--almost $400 million--to buy more \nland. At the same time, the National Park Service has a backlog of $11 \nbillion. We do not have one national park that does not have \nsignificant factors of erosion and dilapidation that is now putting \nboth the employees and park visitors at risk. Yet we are going to spend \n$400 million to buy more land, to require more of their services to \ntake care of, rather than to take care of what we have. It does not fit \nwith common sense.\n  There is no way the American people as a whole would embrace that \nkind of stupidity. Yet that is in this bill. We are going to buy more \nland, we are going to take more land off the tax rolls, we are going to \nhurt the States, we are going to limit the ability of property owners, \nand we are going to continue--the Park Service, this year, their \nbacklog grew by over $400 million.\n  We have the Carlsbad Caverns where we had sewage leaking into the \ncavern. I won't spend the time to go through the hundreds of examples \nthe Park Service has given us, that they cannot maintain the parks \nbecause we will not send them the money to do it. We would rather spend \nit on an earmark or buy more land. The priorities here are amazing.\n  Let me talk about amendment No. 2511. I will spend a short period on \nit. That is the competitive bidding amendment. We have carefully \ncrafted that with the concerns of both staff and the chairman and \nranking member of this committee. What it says is we are going to use \ncompetitive bidding, much like the President campaigned, when we go to \nbuy things that are approved in this bill. We very carefully exempted \nthe sections of the Native Americans where their sovereignty reigns, \nwhere we would not step on their sovereignty--although I am not sure we \nshould not require them to competitively bid, but we agreed not to do \nthat.\n  Here is what we do know. If you take different branches of the \nFederal Government, about 5 percent of the costs are excessive because \nwe do not have competitive bidding. If you take the Pentagon, it is \nabout $20 billion a year because we do not have competitive bidding. In \nthe Interior it is much smaller. But any penny we can save, in terms of \nenhancing the value of the American taxpayers' dollars by saying what \nwe buy is going to be competitively bid, we ought to do that. We ought \nto get the best value we can. We may not always get great value but at \nleast we are going to have a competitive bid and we are at least going \nto have everybody in that who is qualified to have a shot at some of \nthat business. So it is a ``two-fer.'' It is, No. 1, better value for \nthe American people but also opening up all this to everybody who has a \nopportunity to offer a service when the Federal Government buys it.\n  With that, we have an agreement and I appreciate the chairman \naccepting that amendment.\n  Amendment No. 2463 is an amendment for the public to see all the \nreports required by this bill if, in fact, that will not in any way \ncompromise national security. I think we have worked out an agreement \non that amendment to where that is going to be accepted. It is about \ntransparency.\n  We ought to make sure the American people see what we are doing, and \nif we ask for a report that will not in any way endanger the security \nof this country that comes back to us, there is no reason the American \npeople should not be able to see that and we make it available to them \nso they can make a judgment to judge us on what we are doing and \nwhether we are responding properly to problems identified in such \nreports.\n  So I am very thankful for the chairman in terms of accepting this \namendment. I look forward to her comments on it. We should do the same \nthing with this amendment as we did with the last one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would be happy to do the same thing. \nIf I may, Senator Coburn's amendment No. 2463, he and I have come to an \nagreement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Coburn amendment be agreed to and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2463) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill.) The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2523\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I switch now to amendment No. 2523, \nwhich is a prohibition on funds being spent in this act that would \nactually limit the effectiveness of the Homeland Security Department in \nterms of securing our borders and protecting us.\n  This amendment basically ensures that the wilderness areas and other \npublic lands are protected from crime and pollution. I know it is not \nseen that way, but what is happening is a very big and sad story about \nwhat is happening in our wilderness areas.\n  Border violence and trafficking is at an all-time high. Our public \nlands along the border are being exploited by drug and human smugglers. \nWilderness concerns hinder law enforcement efforts. How do we balance \nproperly our concerns for the environment and still secure our borders \nand still protect our population from both drug smuggling and human \ntrafficking?\n  Wilderness areas also are being destroyed by these very smugglers \nbecause we do not allow the enforcement agencies access to be able to \nmake a difference. We have not acted on it; we have not acted on it in \nthis bill. We have to make sure there is the proper balance between \nprotecting our wilderness areas and protecting our country and our \ncitizens.\n  We have sought to address in the last couple of years our border \nsecurity concerns by appropriating a large increase in Federal funds \nfor law enforcement and for significant legislation to construct \ninfrastructure along the southern border.\n  In the Secure Fence Act of 2006, Congress sought to ensure that the \nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security was able to take the \nactions necessary and appropriate to achieve and maintain the \noperational control over the entire international land and maritime \nborders of the United States.\n  The goal of the act was to prevent all unlawful entries into the \nUnited States, including entries by terrorists, narcotics, and other \ncontraband, except it has not had the desired impact, and in large \npart, to the unwelcome increase of illegal human and drug trafficking \nthrough public lands, along our southern border. So we have a conflict \nof desires by agencies to do their jobs.\n  Amendment No. 2523 would prohibit any funds from within the Interior \nappropriations bill to be used to prohibit or restrict the activities \nof Homeland Security on public lands to secure our borders. The effect \nof this amendment would be to ensure that DHS is able to further secure \nour borders from terrorists and other national security threats and \nprotect the environment of these lands.\n  I know there is some concern on the other side with the language, the \nway we have written it. I am more than willing to work with the \nchairman of both the Resources Committee, Interior Committee, and the \nAppropriations Committee to try to put that in a way that properly \nbalances it. I know this is a tough amendment. I do not deny that.\n  But when you hear the testimony--and I am going to ask that this be \nprinted in the Record. This is former\n\n[[Page S9802]]\n\nBorder Patrol officers and field supervisory Border Patrol agents who \ntestified in Congress last April about what is going on in our \nwilderness areas.\n  Do you realize that these people, because we do not have law \nenforcement in there, they are setting fires in our wilderness areas to \ndistract us to the fire so they can smuggle contraband and humans while \nwe are addressing the fire?\n  Our wilderness areas are being defiled near McAllen, TX. It relates: \nWhen a wilderness area or refuge is established near the border, the \ncriminal element moves in and trashes it because the restrictive \nwilderness or refuge status accorded to these lands effectively \nprevents all law enforcement from effectively working the area.\n  This is Border Patrol:\n\n       In other words, refuge or wilderness designation actually \n     serves to put the environment at a greater risk of being \n     seriously damaged and defaced. Law enforcement must have \n     common, unrestricted, free access to all lands near the U.S. \n     border.\n\n  He goes on to clarify that it needs to be at least 50 miles. The \nother thing that was especially telling and which is horrific is the \ncomments about what is going on along Interstate 8 and Interstate 10 in \nArizona: numerous reported ``rape trees'' have been identified in and \nnear the current Pajarita Wilderness near the U.S.-Mexican border.\n\n       Rape trees mark the location where drug and alien smugglers \n     habitually sexually assault and rape illegal alien females \n     that are being brought into the United States across the \n     Mexican border. These locations are marked by the \n     perpetrators who prominently display and hang--\n\n  I will not use the words that he does.\n\n       the underwear of their victims on a particular tree. I \n     visited one such reported tree on March 27, 2008, and noticed \n     30 sets of underwear. These rape-tree trails begin at the \n     Mexican border and travel all of the way through the Pajarita \n     Wilderness.\n\n  In southern Arizona we are experiencing increased incidents of \nwildfires from two primary sources. The first source is illegal aliens \nwho cross into the United States illegally and start fires through \ncarelessness. The second is from illegal aliens engaged in other \ncriminal enterprises who start wildfires intentionally to create a \ndiversion so they can smuggle things into or out of the United States.\n  You cannot deny the fact that we are having a conflict between the \nDepartment of Interior and the Department of Homeland Security in terms \nof law enforcement along our border. The tragedy is that the very \nintent of the Department of Interior to protect the environment is \nactually being made worse by their policy of not allowing law \nenforcement efforts, i.e., the Border Patrol, into those areas.\n  So this amendment is intended to do a couple of things. Let me talk \nabout what the claims against this amendment are first, and that I am \nmore than willing to try to work out a sensible agreement. What is \ndriving me nuts is those two Departments have not worked out a sensible \nagreement themselves, which we ought to have significant oversight \nhearings on the fact that we are having to do something that they \nshould be taking care of.\n  The claim is that if this amendment passes it will devastate the \nenvironment and give the Department of Homeland Security the mandate to \nshow no regard for the environment. Nothing can be further from the \ntruth. The interpretation of congressional intent that we currently \nhave has led to the destruction of much of our wilderness area because \nhuman and drug smugglers have been able to use these lands as major \nthoroughfares without fear of law enforcement.\n  Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security will still be \nobligated to conduct its law enforcement activities in a manner that \nseeks to minimize or mitigate any negative environmental impact. Do you \nrealize in Arizona they are cutting down 150-year-old cactuses to block \nthe road to inhibit anybody following them? And the fact that we do not \nhave significant law enforcement, i.e., Border Patrol there, these \nmajestic, 100-year-old cactuses, which are protected, are intentionally \nbeing destroyed to protect the smugglers.\n  In the past, when the Secretary of Homeland Security waived 30 \nenvironmental and other laws and regulations associated with the \nconstruction of tactical infrastructure along the southwest border in \ncompliance with the Federal law, he still required the Department to \npractice responsible stewardship of natural and cultural resources.\n  The U.S. Customs and Border Patrol is also committed to do that. I \nwill stop with this: I do want to have printed in the Record a letter \nfrom the National Border Patrol Council, which is the AFL-CIO \nrepresentative of our Border Patrol agents who fully endorse this \namendment because they are the people actually on the ground seeing the \nproblem, and we are not allowing them to do their job.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  Eagle Forum,\n\n                                               September 23, 2009.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the many thousands of American \n     families we represent, I urge you to support Senator Tom \n     Coburn's (R-OK) Secure Our Borders and Protect the \n     Environment amendment (#2523) to the Interior Appropriations \n     bill, H.R. 2996, currently being debated on the Senate floor.\n       The Coburn amendment would simply prevent any funds in this \n     bill from going to any Department of the Interior efforts or \n     activities to impede or stall the Department of Homeland \n     Security's progress of the border fence or to prevent the \n     enforcement of U.S. law on public lands near the border. \n     Yesterday, the House passed a motion to recommit to the Santa \n     Cruz Valley National Heritage Area Act (H.R. 324) by a vote \n     of 259 to 167 that included this same amendment language.\n       In 2006, the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly passed the Secure \n     Fence Act of 2006 by a vote of 80 to 19 to construct 700 \n     miles of border fence between the U.S. and Mexico--even then-\n     Senator, President Barack Obama, voted in favor of the fence. \n     Despite the enactment of this law and billions of taxpayer \n     dollars for law enforcement efforts, our border remains \n     vulnerable and the increase in violence in Mexico has begun \n     to spill over into the United States. Even worse, our \n     national parks and other federal public lands are being \n     easily targeted by and used as sanctuaries for illegal drug \n     smugglers because environmental concerns limit the range of \n     U.S. Border Patrol agents and also complicate efforts to \n     build the barrier ordered by Congress.\n       Not only do these restrictions on enforcement endanger our \n     border guards, but the increased illegal activity as a result \n     of reduced law enforcement has led to adverse environmental \n     impacts on these lands, including contamination of pristine \n     areas with bio-hazardous waste and communicable diseases, \n     contamination of water supplies for animals and local \n     ranchers, and an increase in wildfires.\n       We need the Coburn amendment because it is a common-sense \n     step in our fight against the illegal drug and human trade, \n     to secure our border, and to restore our wilderness areas \n     that border Mexico. I urge you to vote in favor of the Coburn \n     amendment when it comes up for a floor vote today. Eagle \n     Forum will score this vote, which will appear in our \n     scoreboard, published annually, for the 1st session of the \n     111th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Suzanne Bibby,\n     Legislative Director, Eagle Forum.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Border Patrol Council of the American Federation \n           of Government Employees, Affiliated With AFL-CIO,\n                                               September 24, 2009.\n     Hon. Tom Coburn,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Coburn: The United States Border Patrol is \n     charged with the formidable task of securing our Nation's \n     borders, and confronts numerous obstacles that hinder the \n     accomplishment of that goal, including rugged terrain, \n     extreme climatic conditions, an overwhelming number of people \n     crossing the border illegally, and violence perpetrated by \n     smugglers and other criminals. Bureaucratic regulations that \n     prevent Border Patrol agents from utilizing vehicles and \n     technology on public lands should be the least of their \n     concerns, but unfortunately are not.\n       Your amendment to the Fiscal Year 2010 appropriations bill \n     for Interior, Environment and Related Agencies that would \n     preclude the use any of those funds to impede, prohibit, or \n     restrict any activities of the Department of Homeland \n     Security on public lands that are undertaken to achieve \n     operational control of our borders is therefore greatly \n     appreciated by the dedicated men and women of the U.S. Border \n     Patrol.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      T.J. Bonner,\n                                                        President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, if I may say through the Chair to \nthe distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, the manager of the amendment \nand I are prepared to take the amendment. Moreover, we are prepared to \nconvene a meeting between the two Department heads, have you present, \nand sit down and see what we can work out.\n\n[[Page S9803]]\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Well, that is perfectly acceptable to me. I want the \nproblem solved. I think security is just as important as protecting our \nenvironment. We are not going to allow one to trump the other.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. We will accept the amendment on both sides with the \nstricture I just added to it on the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2523) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you, Madam President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2483\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I would next like to talk about amendment No. 2483. This \nis the amendment that moves the Federal Land Acquisition Fund to \nbacklog.\n  There is no question my colleagues in this body know of my concern \nabout an ever-expanding, ever-enlarging Federal role in terms of land \nownership. In fact, I have had a lot of conflicts with the chairmen, \nwhether it was a Republican chairman or a Democratic chairman, in terms \nof expanding the amount of property the Federal Government owns.\n  It is not just about expanding. When we expand it costs more money. \nIt costs our kids more money. But in this bill, we have almost $400 \nmillion that is going to be put in to buy more land where we cannot \ntake care of the land that we have today.\n  What we know is the following: Federal land management agencies \nacross all these different branches of government, as well as within \nthis bill, are responsible for a large and aging number of structures. \nAs we have continued, through the Federal Government, to consume more \nprivate land nationwide, Federal agencies have increasingly been unable \nto maintain the existing land holdings.\n  All one has to do is talk to any park ranger. Go up to the Statue of \nLiberty, they have an $800 million backlog. Go to the Washington Mall, \nwell over $1 billion in maintaining some of our most significant \nstructures. If you go to the Grand Canyon National Park, people are \ncontinually being limited because we can't maintain the trails and \nbecause we don't put the money in to do it. The National Park Service, \nwhich receives most of the money to buy more land in this bill, faces \nan $11 billion backlog.\n  When I first started talking about the issue, the backlog was $6 \nbillion. In 4 years, we have seen the backlog with the National Park \nService almost double. Although I am thankful for the increase in \nmaintenance funds this bill does add to the national parks, it does not \ncome sufficiently close.\n  What is the priority? Is the priority for the Federal Government to \nconsume more land, restrict more access, limit the freedom of people \naround that land and on that land, or is it to let Americans own the \nland and take care of the land the Federal Government already has? It \nowns a third of the land. How much land is enough for the Federal \nGovernment to own? How much is enough, especially when most of the land \nwe own we are not taking care of. We are letting it fall down. The \nquestion has to be: What are the priorities?\n  The committee says the priority is to buy more land. This amendment \nsays the priority is to repair and take care of the land we have. It \nspecifically directs this money to the National Park Service to help \nwith a backlog of falling down structures and the increased risk of \nsafety for both park employees and visitors.\n  I obviously don't have all the information the committee has, but as \nthe Senator from New Mexico knows, I have been looking at land \nacquisition and land bills for the last few years. I have not been \nsuccessful in slowing them down, but I think the American people need \nto know about this. They need to recognize that our priorities are \nscrewed up and that, in fact, we ought to be about taking care of what \nwe have before we add to it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, regretfully, I have to oppose this \namendment. The fact is, we would lose opportunities to conserve \nvaluable lands because within national parks there are inholdings, and \ninholdings, when they become available--these are private properties \nthat people own--the Federal Government buys them and adds to the \npublic land. Let me name a few: In Georgia, I am told the Chattahoochee \nNational Recreation Area would be involved; in many States, Civil War \nbattlefield sites; in Ohio, the Cuyahoga Valley National Park; in the \nState of Washington, Mount Rainier, Olympic, and San Juan National \nParks; in Texas, Big Thicket National Preserve; in Indiana, the Hoosier \nNational Forest; in Utah, Dixie National Forest; in South Dakota, the \nBlack Hills National Forest.\n  The point I wish to make is, on occasion, there are families who have \nlarge land holdings, and these are valuable, pristine land holdings. \nTheir first preference might be to have the Federal Government buy \nthese lands to hold them for the future and to conserve the lands. If \nthe Federal Government can't do that, the lands go on the market, \ngenerally, for the highest and best use. With some of our prized and \ntreasured possessions, that is not the way to go.\n  I will oppose this amendment. I am sure it will be in line for a \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. The chairman makes my point for me. Yes, we might miss an \nopportunity. But we don't have the courage to put the priorities right. \nWe are going to miss an opportunity while structures fall down at \nYellowstone. That is what the choice is. We are going to take large, \nvaluable land segments that are now paying property taxes and, because \nthey are up for sale, we are going to spend that money rather than \nrepair Carlsbad Caverns. That is the choice. The chairman made my \nargument for me. We are not going to do the sensible thing.\n  Many of these things will come back. They are not gone forever. What \nwe are saying is, because we don't have any limitation on what we spend \nor how we spend it, we therefore have no limitation in worrying about \nwhether things fall down. The fact is, now an $11 billion backlog, \nwhich grew $400 million last year alone in the Forest Service, \ndocumented by the Forest Service--those are not my numbers--we are \ngoing to say these are more important now than putting back in proper \norder things that relate to safety or security in the national parks. I \nwill end with the fact that if we don't do this, what we have done is \nearned the reputation we are garnering, that we refuse to make tough \nchoices. Life is about tough choices. Maybe we don't get to add to one \nof these parks right now. But how about taking care of what we have? \nWhy not make that a priority?\n  It is kind of like when your front porch is falling down and that is \nthe only entrance to your house, you start building a garage rather \nthan fix your front porch or you buy an extra five acres so you can \nhave a big garden. We wouldn't do that. The American people wouldn't do \nthat. We need to respond with some commonsense solutions. Instead, we \nare adding to the cost as the backlog grows.\n  I am uncomfortable with the fact that that is how we think here. I \nknow the American people are uncomfortable with that fact. I am \ndisappointed we will not have the support of the committee. I look \nforward to the vote.\n  The next amendment I will call up is pending, but I will discuss \namendment No. 2482.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will the Senator yield? I know he is a gentleman.\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, when we did the stimulus, we put in \nthe maximum amount that the departments could use for maintenance and \nrehabilitation. I have the breakdown. It is hard to add it all up \nquickly, but I can give some idea. Bureau of Land Management deferred \nmaintenance, $35 million; recreation maintenance, 25; trail \nmaintenance, 20; abandoned mine site remediation, $30 million; habitat \nrestoration, 25. It goes on. I recall as we did this, what we were told \nby our staffs is that was the maximum amount these departments could \nabsorb in the length of time covered by the stimulus. I will leave my \ncolleagues with that.\n  Mr. COBURN. I would be happy to have a UC on this amendment that \nwould exclude the inholdings, if that would satisfy the chairman.\n  In fact, the inholdings are a very small amount of the $400 million. \nA very small amount of the money for land acquisitions is inholdings. I \nwould be happy to accept a second degree that would exclude the \ninholdings from this.\n\n[[Page S9804]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I appreciate that, but I cannot accept that. We \nbelieve the Land and Water Conservation Fund is working as it is \nsupposed to. If anything, it has been underfunded. This bill proposes \nto appropriate $420 million of the $900 million that is authorized. \nThat is less than 50 percent. The Land and Water Conservation Fund, we \nbelieve, is extraordinarily important. We would try to get it higher if \nwe could, but we cannot.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the chairman for her comments on that. I am sure \nit is important. It is important to preserve what we have. You can't go \nto one national park and talk to the park rangers and talk to the \nperson in charge without hearing them talk about the declining status \nof their individual parks. We have to start making some choices. We are \ngoing to refuse to do that. So next year, instead of it being $11 \nbillion, it is going to be $11.6 billion, and then it is going to grow. \nWhat is happening right now is, we are shutting off parts of our parks. \nWe are saying, since it is dangerous or it is in disrepair, we cannot \nlet people experience it.\n  I will put in the Record hundreds of examples where that is happening \nright now. We have researched and the parks have told us where they are \nlimiting access because of the lack of maintenance funds and funds for \nrepair of required things in the parks.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2504, as Modified\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside and amendment No. 2504, as modified, be \ncalled up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment, as modified, is pending.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2504, as Further Modified\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, there is a further modification at \nthe desk, and I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be further \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is further \nmodified.\n  The amendment, as further modified, is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To encourage the participation of the National Park Service \nin activities preserving the papers and teachings of Dr. Martin Luther \n     King, Jr., under the Civil Rights History Project Act of 2009)\n\n       On page 135, line 2, before the period, insert the \n     following: ``of which $200,000 may be made available by the \n     Secretary of the Interior to develop, in conjunction with \n     Morehouse College, a program to catalogue, preserve, provide \n     public access to and research on, develop curriculum and \n     courses based on, provide public access to, and conduct \n     scholarly forums on the important works and papers of Dr. \n     Martin Luther King, Jr. to provide a better understanding of \n     the message and teachings of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.;''.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, this modification, which has been \nagreed to on both sides, allows the Secretary of the Interior to make \n$200,000 available for preservation of the Martin Luther King papers. \nIt is an amendment offered by Senator Isakson. I fully support the \namendment.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment as \nfurther modified, be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2504), as further modified, was agreed to.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 2527.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for Mr. \n     Bennett, proposes an amendment numbered 2527.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To modify the definition of the term ``Beaver Dam Wash \n                   National Conservation Area Map'')\n\n       On page 240, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n       Sec. 4__.  Section 1971(1) of the Omnibus Public Land \n     Management Act of 2009 (16 U.S.C. 460www note; Public Law \n     111-11) is amended by striking ``December 18, 2008'' and \n     inserting ``September 20, 2009''.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2527) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I come to the floor because we were \nlooking at an amendment earlier today that would have stopped the EPA \nfrom exercising its obligation to combat global warming pollution. \nThere are those here who would choose to defer taking action to deal \nwith this enormous threat where future generations' lives and well-\nbeing would be at risk. But the time for delay is a luxury we don't \nhave. We can't afford to wait any longer and we cannot afford to limit \nour options.\n\n  Every day the science makes it more clear we are on a dangerous \ncourse. In fact, the scientific community has recently had to revise \nits own estimates because rising temperatures are destabilizing our \nplanet far faster than originally expected. For instance, 2 years ago, \nscientists warned us that summers in the Arctic would be completely ice \nfree by 2050. Now they are saying summers in the Arctic will be \ncompletely ice free in 3 years. Two years ago they said sea levels \nwould rise less than 2 feet by the end of this century and now it is \nbeing said sea levels will rise by 6 feet. The risks of inaction are \ntoo great.\n  We have to look also at the national security risks we face by \ncontinuing to do nothing about climate change. According to the CIA's \nNational Intelligence Council, if we fail to act, nearly 1 billion \npeople may face water and food shortages in the next 15 years. These \nshortages will set the stage for conflict and breed conditions for \nterrorism. At the same time, with 20 percent of the world's population \nliving in\n\n[[Page S9805]]\n\ncoastal zones, rising sea levels and stronger hurricanes could displace \nmore than 150 million people by 2050. When it is expressed in \npercentages such as that and talking about numbers that are almost \nbeyond the imagination, it sometimes loses its impact. But what we are \ntalking about are people seeking higher-level places to take themselves \nand their families so they are not overwhelmed by floods.\n  Border pressures created by these mass migrations will increase \ntensions and lay the groundwork for armed conflict. The U.S. Navy has \nlooked at this problem in the past and issued a report that in the last \nhalf of the 21st century we could be looking at a different structure \nfor naval engagements with smaller boats, higher speeds, and so forth \nto keep people from flooding our shores because they are trying to get \naway from higher water. Nations will look to us, to the United States, \nas a first responder in the aftermath of these major natural \nemergencies and humanitarian disasters.\n  Retired GEN Anthony Zinni put it this way, that if we don't begin \nreducing carbon emissions now, we will ``pay the price later in \nmilitary terms and that will involve human lives.''\n  Delay is not a substitute for confronting this growing problem. It is \nno surprise that many of those who want to shelve the Clean Air Act and \nstop EPA from doing its duty are the same ones who close their eyes to \nthe overwhelming scientific evidence that says, Wake up, hear the \nalarm. They have dismissed the ominous forecasts of life changes for \nplants, animals, and humans. They called global warming ``the greatest \nhoax ever perpetrated on the American people.'' A hoax is a joke. That \nis a bad joke.\n  Let's not forget, the EPA's power to curb greenhouse gas emissions \nunder the Clean Air Act was recently affirmed by the Supreme Court. The \nClean Air Act has been one of the great success stories of our lifetime \nand it is one of the few tools we have to overcome climate change. For \nthe last 40 years, this law has led to cleaner skies and healthier \nchildren. If it weren't for the Clean Air Act, 225,000 Americans would \nhave died prematurely, according to an EPA study. Imagine, we would \nhave lost 225,000 people if it weren't for the Clean Air Act.\n  While the gains have been enormous, the cost to polluters has been \nminimal. In fact, the total benefits to our economy have been \nidentified as high as $49 trillion, putting the benefit at 100 times \ngreater than the cost for action. Even so, history shows that opponents \noften dramatically overstate the costs of environmental improvement. \nThe last time we strengthened the Clean Air Act, our adversaries rang \nthe alarm that these changes would cost too much and damage the \neconomy. But as it turned out, the actual costs were less than one-\nfifth of what these opponents estimated. Today, even though EPA has a \nproven track record of producing trillions in benefits for our economy \nand our country under the Clean Air Act, we are hearing the same kinds \nof warnings. It makes no sense.\n  There is no doubt our opponents prefer to endorse inaction and will \nreward failure. That is why I urge my colleagues to stand up to the \nspecial interests and stand for the public interest. It is time to say \nfrom our hearts that we are willing to stand firm against those who \nclaim the overstated cost of change outweighs the risk of disappearing \nspecies, poor health, and international unrest.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I wish to put my colleagues on notice \nthat we are trying to work out an amendment so it can be acceptable to \nall parties concerned. It has to do with the heritage areas. If, in \nfact, you are a landowner in this country or you are a farmer or you \nare a rancher or you happen to have 20 acres in the country, you ought \nto be very worried about the implications and the consequences of those \nwho come in and change the zoning laws on heritage areas.\n  Most people in this country have no idea they are in a heritage area. \nThey have no knowledge that they are in a heritage area. As a matter of \nfact, the whole State of Tennessee is a heritage area. So what we are \nattempting to do is to create a mechanism where anybody in the country \nwho is in a heritage area who doesn't want to be in it can be out of it \nwith their property.\n  We also want to respectfully protect some efforts in North Dakota on \none specifically where they would have to opt in. So we are working on \nan agreement. We will come back and talk about this when this is \nfinished. Hopefully, this is the start of restoring property rights to \nAmericans that have been trampled, in my opinion, by those who are \nempowered through the heritage area name.\n\n  My hope is we are going to make good progress on this with this bill. \nIt is important. If you are a farmer or a rancher, if you are a farm \nbureau member, if you are a cattleman or if you are a dairy farmer, it \nis time to make sure this stays--whatever agreement we come to--in this \nbill as it goes to conference. Because real property rights are at \nrisk. They have been at risk. They have been trampled on. This is a \ngreat solution in terms of solving it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from \nOklahoma, the Senator from California, the Senator from North Dakota, \nand the Senator from New Mexico for their work on this amendment. The \nSenator from Oklahoma stated it exactly right, and that is our \nintention. I wish to thank the Senators involved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I am in support of the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Oklahoma. I also offered an amendment which I \nunderstand will be accepted. It allows for something called an ``opt \nin'' for private property. It means that for the Northern Plains \nHeritage Area, private property would be involved only if someone \nwishes to be included. My understanding is, after having worked with \nthe Senators from Tennessee and Oklahoma, and the Senator from \nCalifornia, who is managing this bill, my amendment will also be \naccepted by unanimous consent.\n  My amendment is amendment No. 2441 which has previously been filed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, in the interest of moving things \nalong--Members are impatient. We have been on this bill for a long \ntime. We wish to conclude. It is my understanding both sides are \nagreeable to take the Dorgan amendment No. 2441, so I ask for unanimous \nconsent.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, the Senator from Oklahoma has asked \nto be present when we do that, so I wonder if it might not be possible \nto take up other amendments at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I withdraw my prior request and I ask \nunanimous consent that at 5 o'clock tonight, the Senate proceed to vote \nin relation to the following amendments and motion to recommit \nremaining in order to H.R. 2996, the Interior Appropriations Act, and \nin the following order:\n  The Vitter amendment, No. 2549; the Ensign motion to recommit; the \nCoburn amendment No. 2482; the Coburn amendment No. 2483; and the Reid \namendment No. 2531; that the remaining provisions of the previous order \nare still in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the exercise of governmental authority \nby White House advisers, sometimes called ``czars,'' is a serious issue \nthat deserves serious consideration by the Senate. Our ability to \nconduct meaningful oversight of those who hold the levers of power and \nto evaluate whether they have the qualifications and character to carry \nout their duties may be undermined by the centralization of power in \nthe White House. That is why I wrote to the President recently and plan \nto chair a hearing in the Constitution Subcommittee on this topic in \nthe very near future. We need to know\n\n[[Page S9806]]\n\nmore about the role of these advisers and what powers they have. There \nis a core issue here that concerns me. At this point, however, it is \npremature to pass legislation on this topic before fully understanding \nthe constitutional and policy ramifications. I am also uncomfortable \nwith singling out a single policy adviser, the Assistant to the \nPresident for Energy and Climate Change, particularly since I am not \naware of any evidence that she is acting inappropriately. Therefore, I \nwill vote against the Vitter amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield back the time remaining on the \nVitter amendment No. 2549, and I move to table it. I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll. `\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I have a motion at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] moves to recommit H.R. \n     2996 to the Committee on Appropriations with instructions to \n     report the same back to the Senate with changes that reduce \n     the aggregate level of discretionary appropriations in the \n     Act for fiscal year 2010 by $4,270,000,000 from the level \n     currently in the Act.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, this is a very simple motion. It just says \nthat at this time of runaway deficits, of out-of-control Federal \nspending, we are going to try to do a little something. We are just \ngoing to take this appropriations bill and say with regard to last \nyear's level, which was increased fairly substantially, we are going to \nfreeze it to last year's level.\n  As State budgets, local budgets, and family budgets are all being \ncut, trimmed, and tightened around the country, Washington says: You \nknow what, we are going to print money. We are just going to borrow \nfrom our children and grandchildren and continue to print money and \nprint money and push it off onto the next generation.\n  It is time for this body to show some fiscal restraint. So let's cut \n$4 billion out of this spending bill and bring it back to last year's \nlevel. Let the Appropriations Committee determine where that spending \nis, but let's actually show some fiscal responsibility.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I urge a ``no'' vote. I am going to \nmove to table at the appropriate time. If we adopt the Ensign motion, \nwe cut Park Service dollars, Indian health dollars, particularly water \ninfrastructure. Mr. President, $2.5 billion in this bill is for sewer \ngrants; $1.8 billion is for fire suppression. It is the first time we \nhave met the fire suppression need fully so that they do not have to \ntake from other accounts to fight fires.\n  I move to table the motion to recommit.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2482, As Modified\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I think we can dispense with two fairly \nquickly, one with a vote and one without. We have worked out an \nagreement on amendment No. 2482. I believe the modification is at the \ndesk. We have an agreement between the chairman and ranking member of \nthe committee and the Senator from New Mexico, who is chair of the \nappropriate authorizing committee, which allows private property owners \nto opt out of heritage areas. I ask for its consideration now, rather \nthan spending more time on it, and ask unanimous consent it be \naccepted.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The Senator is correct. We are prepared to accept the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the amendment will \nbe modified and agreed to as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2482), as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       Any owner of private property within an existing or new \n     National Heritage Area may opt out of participating in any \n     plan, project, program, or activity conducted within the \n     National Heritage Area if the property owner provides written \n     notice to the local coordinating entity.\n\n[[Page S9807]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 2441\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. A corollary part of this is Dorgan amendment No. \n2441, which also moves along with this. So we are prepared to accept \nDorgan No. 2441 as well.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me say I think this has been cleared \nby both sides. It does have a connection to the previous amendment. I \nappreciate the cooperation of the Senator from California, the Senator \nfrom Tennessee, and the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  I ask for its immediate consideration and approval.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     and Mr. Conrad, proposes an amendment No. 2441.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the inclusion of property in, or removal of \n           property from, the Northern Plains Heritage Area)\n\n       Beginning on page 173, strike line 12 and all that follows \n     through page 174, line 5, and insert the following:\n       ``(g) Requirements for Inclusion and Removal of Property in \n     Heritage Area.--\n       ``(1) Private property inclusion.--No privately owned \n     property shall be included in the Heritage Area unless the \n     owner of the private property provides to the management \n     entity a written request for the inclusion.\n       ``(2) Property removal.--\n       ``(A) Private property.--At the request of an owner of \n     private property included in the Heritage Area pursuant to \n     paragraph (1), the private property shall be immediately \n     withdrawn from the Heritage Area if the owner of the property \n     provides to the management entity a written notice requesting \n     removal.\n       ``(B) Public property.--On written notice from the \n     appropriate State or local government entity, public property \n     included in the Heritage Area shall be immediately withdrawn \n     from the Heritage Area.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment will be \naccepted.\n  The amendment (No. 2441) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2483\n\n  Mr. COBURN. We are on amendment No. 2483, which was not agreed to. We \ncould not work out an agreement. I want to take a minute or two--we \ndon't have a time agreement on this--to talk about this amendment, what \namendment No. 2483 will do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes equally divided on this \namendment.\n  Mr. COBURN. I am not sure I was present. Do we have a unanimous \nconsent in that regard?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. COBURN. I should have been here to object.\n  We have an $11 billion backlog in the national parks. It grew by $400 \nmillion this year. The Land and Water Conservation Act of 1965 was not \nmeant just to buy land. It was meant to take care of the backlogs and \nthe problems associated with outdoor recreation enjoyment by the \nAmerican people. There is almost $400 million in this bill to buy more \nland rather than take care of the things we have today. This amendment \nsimply moves that to take care of the backlog at every national park we \nhave. If we do not do that, we are soon going to be at $12 billion, \nsoon at $13 billion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. COBURN. The fact is, it is common sense. Every American knows you \ndo not build a garage when your front porch is falling down and that is \nthe only way to get into your house. That is what is happening to our \nparks. I know there is some increased funding for the parks but the \nfact is they are falling down, whether it is Yellowstone--I don't care \nwhere it is, there are significant maintenance problems in the parks. \nThat ought to be a priority before we add 1 more acre to 650 million \nacres we already own.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, we oppose this amendment. We oppose it \nbecause it takes $420 million out of the Land and Water Conservation \nFund. We oppose it because the committee in the stimulus bill put in as \nmany dollars as these departments could absorb in the period of time \nfor maintenance.\n  I move to table. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich).

The question is on agreeing to the Reid \namendment No. 2531.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield back all time on the Reid amendment. It has \nbeen cleared on both sides. I ask for its adoption by unanimous \nconsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2531) was agreed to.\n\n\n                            tahoe rim trail\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to provide additional \nclarification regarding a congressionally directed spending items \nincluded in the fiscal year 2010 Senate Interior Appropriations \nSubcommittee. At Senator Reid's request, the committee included \n$100,000 for the U.S. Forest Service to fund trail improvements in \nNevada. It is my understanding that Senator Reid intended those funds \nto be used for improvements for the Tahoe Rim Trail, to be conducted \nthrough a partnership with the Tahoe Rim Trail Association. Due to a \nclerical error, the project is not listed correctly in the committee \nreport, and I would like to ensure that the Record clearly reflects \nSenator Reid's intended use for these funds. Through the chair, I would \nlike to ask my colleague from Nevada, the distinguished majority \nleader, if my understanding of his intent is correct?\n  Mr. REID. I would like to thank the chairman for her efforts to \nclarify this matter Chairman Feinstein is correct, I do intend that the \nfunds recommended by the committee be used by the U.S. Forest Service \nfor improvements to the Tahoe Rim Trail through their partnership with \nthe Tahoe Rim Trail Association. I would also note for the record that \nmy request complies fully with all disclosure requirements relating to \ncongressionally directed spending.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his \nclarification and I look forward to working with him to support his \nproject as we move through the annual appropriations process.\n\n[[Page S9808]]\n\n                             FUNDING RCAPs\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as the Chair knows, I have long been a \nsupporter of improving the quality of drinking water in rural America. \nThere is a lot of work to be done. While small rural communities are \nhome to fewer than 20 percent of America's population, they account for \nmore than 85 percent of the Nation's community water systems, and are \nmore likely than larger systems to report major drinking water \nviolations. According to EPA data, 93 percent of the maximum \ncontaminant level, MCL, and treatment technique, TT, violations \nreported in 2002 affected community water systems serving fewer than \n10,000 people. MCL and TT violations include higher than allowable \nlevels of organic and inorganic contaminants such as arsenic, benzene, \natrazine, lead, copper and nitrate.\n  One significant reason for these high numbers is the lack of capacity \namong local elected officials to deal with the complexities of \nmaintaining a safe and clean supply of drinking water. For this reason \nI have supported funding for RCAPs--six regional nonprofit \norganizations that help rural communities with facilities needs.\n  The technical assistance and training activities the RCAPs provide \nfocus on helping communities comply with the Clean Water Act and the \nSafe Drinking Water Act. Last year alone, the RCAPs assisted more than \n2,000 communities, leveraged over $200,000,000 in funding, conducted 78 \ntraining sessions for almost 2,000 community water officials, and \nassisted nearly 3 million people to access safe and clean water. Most \nof the communities the RCAPs work with have populations of less than \n1,500.\n  Funding for the RCAPs has been included in this bill for more than 20 \nyears. I understand that the committee was limited by rules regarding \nearmarks, and I note that funding for the RCAPs is not included in the \nfiscal year 2010 Senate bill. However, I understand that the House bill \nincludes funding for the RCAPs at the current rate and it my hope that \nin conference the Senate will move toward the House position on this.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator for his comments on this. I \nappreciate the difficulties faced by rural communities in gaining and \nmaintaining access to adequate drinking water. I also know well the \ngood work of the RCAPs in assisting those communities. As we move into \nconference on this legislation I look forward to working with my \ncolleague to see if we can maintain funding for this important program.\n\n\n                          White Nose Syndrome\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would like to discuss with the Senator a serious \nissue that deserves our attention. White nose syndrome, WNS, is a \nfungus that is causing an extraordinary number of bat deaths, \nparticularly in the Northeast. This disease has the potential to \ninflict widespread ecological, agricultural, and economic damage \nthroughout our country. More than 1 million bats have died from New \nHampshire to Virginia over the last two winters, and scientists report \nmortality rates as high as 100 percent in some affected caves. Experts \nfear that WNS could lead to the extinction of many bat species as the \ndisease spreads across the country.\n  WNS not only has ecological effects, but it also has severe economic \nand environmental implications. Bats consume vast quantities of \ninsects, protecting crops and reducing pesticide use. A single bat can \neasily eat more than 3,000 insects a night and an entire colony will \nconsume hundreds of millions of insects per year. Bats prey on \nmosquitoes, which spread disease, and moths and beetles, which damage \nagriculture.\n  With the Senator's leadership, the fiscal year 2010 Interior \nappropriations bill has included $500,000 for research to prevent the \nspread of WNS, and I thank the Senator for that.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank Senator Lautenberg. Our offices have worked \ntogether on efforts to provide funding to fight WNS, and I share his \nconcerns about this issue.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. As the Senator knows, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService, FWS, is spearheading efforts to better understand this deadly \ndisease and learn how to control its spread. FWS is working in \nconjunction with the U.S. Geological Survey, National Park Service, and \nU.S. Forest Service and with State and local partners, scientists, and \nconservation organizations. Due to the high mortality rate and the \nrapid spread of the disease, time is of the essence.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I agree with the Senator. We must tackle this issue \nhead-on and make sure all stakeholders are working together to combat \nthis challenge.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Experts estimate that much more funding is needed for \nresearch on WNS. Accordingly, I filed an important amendment to this \nbill, amendment No. 2476, to shift $1.4 million in additional funding \nto WNS research. My amendment would not put any other projects or \nprograms at risk, and it would provide critical resources to fight this \ndisease. I ask for the chairman's assurance that she will work in \nconference to implement my amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. As I mentioned earlier, I share the Senator's \nconcerns and agree that we need to focus more attention and resources \non WNS. I commit to work in conference to increase funding for this \ndisease as called for in his amendment.\n\n\n                      Clean Automotive Technology\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of the \ndistinguished chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, \nEnvironment and Related Agencies a very important program in my State. \nThe Environmental Protection Agency's National Vehicle and Fuel \nEmissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, MI, leads EPA's Clean Automotive \nTechnology Program by facilitating collaboration with the automotive \nindustry through innovative research to achieve ultra low-pollution \nemissions, increase fuel efficiency and reduce greenhouse gases.\n  One of the programs that has been developed collaboratively through \nthe Ann Arbor laboratory and its industry partners is the hydraulic \nhybrid technology which has come out of the laboratory's focus areas in \nhydraulic hybrid research, engine research, alternative fuels research \nand technical and analytical support. This technology offers potential \nto reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent.\n  The President's fiscal year 2010 budget increases the Climate \nProtection Program line in EPA's budget, which includes this facility, \nand I appreciate the subcommittee's concurrence with the request in the \nbill before the Senate.\n  It is my understanding that the version of the bill adopted by the \nHouse of Representatives provides an additional $1.6 million over the \nfiscal year 2010 budget request. Is that also the understanding of the \nSenator from California?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The Senator is correct. The President's budget \nproposed $18.975 million for the Climate Protection Program, and that \nis the same amount proposed in this bill. The House of Representatives \napproved $20.575 million.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I hope to provide additional funding for this program in \norder to fund a demonstration program to deploy hybrid hydraulic \ntechnology in larger fleet vehicles, such as school buses. \nDemonstration of this hybrid hydraulic technology, through its \nincorporation into a fleet of school buses, would not only bring these \nfuel-efficient and environmentally friendly technologies closer to \nwide-scale viability and acceptance but also provide EPA with important \ndata to support its work in developing achievable standards for fuel \neconomy and greenhouse gas emissions.\n  As the conference committee considers the differences between the \nHouse and Senate bills, I am hopeful that the additional $1.6 million \nincluded in the House bill will be maintained and that serious \nconsideration will be given to directing this funding to demonstration \nof the hybrid hydraulic technology I have described.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I appreciate the Senator from Michigan bringing this \nto my attention and I assure him that I will keep his suggestions in \nmind as this bill progresses.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n\n\n      New York's Northeastern States Research Cooperative Funding\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would like to enter into a colloquy with my \ncolleague from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I thank the chairman for entering into a colloquy\n\n[[Page S9809]]\n\nwith me and for her hard work on this bill. I want to discuss the need \nto add New York to the list of States included for Northeastern States \nResearch Cooperative Funding.\n  The Northeastern States Research Cooperative, NSRC, was originally \nauthorized by Congress in the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources \nResearch Act of 1978 and is managed by the U.S. Forest Service. The \nclear intent of Congress in creating the NSRC was to fund a competitive \ngrants research program shared by the four states of the cooperative, \nNew Hampshire, Vermont, Maine and New York.\n  The original intent of Congress was to have all four States jointly \nfunded by the enacted authorization of this act. Unfortunately, New \nYork has been left out of the Forest Service budget requests this year.\n  Funding through this cooperative will maintain critical forestry \nresearch programs in New York State. For instance, the State University \nof New York, College of Environmental Science and Forestry has received \nfunding through this program in the past that has provided research, \ntechnology transfer and outreach to coordinate and improve ecological \nand economic vitality of the northeastern forests of New York, Vermont, \nNew Hampshire and Maine.\n  The NSRC's research is critical to the economic vitality of and \nquality-of-life in the 18.5 million acres of the New York's forested \nland.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would like to thank my colleague for bringing this \nto my attention and I will certainly look into this matter during \nconference negotiations.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I thank the chairman for her help and for her \nleadership.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I would like to correct the \nrecord regarding some recent remarks of Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma \nregarding offshore drilling. Senator Coburn stated in today's debate \nthat I ``voted against an opportunity to expand offshore exploration \nyesterday.''\n  First, the Senator's comments are somewhat confusing because there \nwere no votes yesterday that would have opened up even one acre of our \noffshore public lands to oil exploration. Instead, I believe that \nSenator Coburn may have been referring to yesterday's motion to \nrecommit by Senator Vitter of Louisiana.\n  I opposed the Vitter motion yesterday because it was counter-\nproductive. By using political interference in offshore permitting, it \nwould have actually created serious delays. Supporters of the Vitter \nmotion talked about their desire to expand offshore oil drilling, but \nthe motion set up major legal obstacles to developing our natural \nresources.\n  The motion was vaguely drafted, but it could have blocked funding \nfrom being used to review the over 300,000 public comments received. \nThe motion also could have blocked the Secretary from considering facts \nand scientific evidence regarding the decision he needs to make.\n  I opposed the Vitter motion because the only way that we can legally \naccess our public lands for natural resources is by due process. If we \nblock the Department of Interior from following due process, that only \nserves to delay the process with litigation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an amendment I \nfiled to the Interior appropriations bill, and in doing so, I hope to \nremind my colleagues about their responsibility as federally elected \nrepresentatives of the citizens of the United States. The U.S. \nConstitution, the document written by the people to empower and limit \ngovernment, specifically gives the Congress the power to make the laws \nthat direct this government. The first section of the first article of \nthe Constitution states ``All legislative Powers herein granted shall \nbe vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a \nSenate and House of Representatives.'' The people also established an \nexecutive power and a judicial power, but put the lawmaking power \nspecifically into the hands of Congress\n  I would invite my colleagues to consider for a moment, and to remind \nthemselves, why the people put the control of the Nation's laws into \nthe hands of Congress, and not to the other branches of government. It \nis because Congress is directly answerable to the people. For members \nof Congress, there is no escape from the people. Our founding document \nensures that we routinely have elections whereby lawmakers face the \ncitizens who sent them here. By limiting legislative powers to \nCongress, the people have secured this power to themselves. So we see \nthat the people are willing to live under laws, but only to the extent \nthat those laws are their own.\n  This is a principle upon which our Nation was founded. This is a \nprinciple upon which we have achieved our status as a great nation. It \nis a principle that has made our government an inspiration to \ngenerations of free minds throughout the world. And I believe it is a \nprinciple that is being weakened on our watch during the 111th \nCongress.\n  In April of 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA, by \na 5 to 4 margin, that the Environmental Protection Agency could act to \nregulate carbon dioxide emissions as a pollutant from vehicles under \nthe Clean Air Act without further authorization from Congress. And it \nis widely believed that this decision allows the EPA to also regulate \ncarbon dioxide emissions from all other sources, as well, without \nfurther action from Congress.\n  I disagree with the Supreme Court's decision in Massachusetts v. EPA \nand even consider it ill-informed in some respects. However, I don't \nquestion the role of the Court to make such a decision. After all, the \npeople did, in fact, give the Supreme Court the jurisdiction to \ninterpret the laws of Congress.\n  Furthermore, I disagree with the EPA's finding that carbon dioxide \nposes an endangerment to humans and that it is a pollutant. Unlike \nconventional pollutants, CO2 does not normally cause direct \nharm to our environment or to our bodies. It is considered an \nendangerment only because it has the potential as a greenhouse gas to \nwarm the planet. What seems to be completely lost by the EPA, is that \nmost scientists will tell you that a warming climate is a net benefit, \nwhile a cooling climate is a net detriment to life on Earth.\n  If greenhouse gases and warming are detrimental to life, then why \ndoesn't the EPA propose to regulate water vapor? Water vapor makes up \n95 percent of all greenhouse gases, and a cubic foot of water vapor has \na much stronger warming factor than a cubit foot of carbon dioxide?\n  Those are just a couple questions that haven't been answered \nsufficiently, in my view. And so I disagree with the EPA's finding that \ncarbon dioxide is an endangerment. In spite of that, I do recognize \nthat the Supreme Court has the ability to interpret the Clean Air Act \nin a way that allows the EPA to make this finding.\n  However, I doubt that any of my colleagues can honestly say that when \nCongress voted for the Clean Air Act in 1970, that we intended that \ncarbon dioxide should be regulated as a pollutant. But now we are \nwitnessing the EPA initiating a process to that end which will lead to \nthe most sweeping, and probably most expensive set of regulations in \nour nation's history, with no specific authorization from Congress to \ndo so.\n  Is it the proper role of Congress to sit by and allow an independent \nagency, with nary an elected official within its walls to take over \nevery single energy producing activity in the Nation? Could there be a \nmore dramatic and sweeping centralization of government power than the \nmove to control all carbon dioxide emissions? And are we, as the \nelected body representing the people going to hide behind a decision by \na Supreme Court and just watch it happen? While technically, the \nSupreme Court and the EPA are acting within their jurisdictions and \nauthority. Certainly, though, with such far reaching regulations, \nCongress has a responsibility to put these actions back under the \ndirect authority of Congress, and thus back into the hands of the \npeople.\n  My amendment would do just that. It would bar the EPA from moving \nforward with these far reaching regulations until Congress has \nexpressly authorized such an action. I urge my colleagues to restore \nCongress and the people to their proper role over laws that relate to \nthe regulation of carbon dioxide, and support my amendment.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nfiscal\n\n[[Page S9810]]\n\nyear 2010 Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act. I wish to thank subcommittee Chairman Feinstein and \nRanking Member Alexander, as well as committee Chairman Inouye and Vice \nChairman Cochran, for their work on this bill.\n  This bill will fund important programs at the Environmental \nProtection Agency, Department of the Interior, Indian Health Service, \nForest Service, Smithsonian Institution, National Endowment for the \nArts, and National Endowment for the Humanities. Consequently, it \naddresses critical needs related to public lands management, \nenvironmental protection, Indian Country, and cultural education. I am \npleased with the inclusion of a number of initiatives for which I \nrequested funding and that I believe will be of great benefit to Hawaii \nand our Nation. Therefore, I am very thankful that my colleagues on the \nAppropriations Committee recognized the need of these programs and \nbacked them with unanimous committee approval. I would like to take \nthis opportunity to discuss these important initiatives.\n  The Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009, which was signed \ninto law earlier this year, includes a bill I introduced in the 110th \nCongress to authorize appropriations for the National Tropical \nBotanical Garden, NTBG. Chartered by Congress in 1964, the NTBG \ncollects, cultivates, and preserves tropical flora and conducts \nresearch in tropical botany. The NTBG's work has advanced disease \ntreatment, world hunger prevention, and medical education. Funding in \nthis appropriations bill will allow the NTBG to continue to help \nprotect, propagate, and study tropical species that could permit \nadditional scientific advances but are threatened with extinction.\n  The bill will also fund the establishment and construction of a \nresearch and education center for the Hawaii Experimental Tropical \nForest, HETF. The Hawaii Tropical Forest Recovery Act, which I \nsponsored and became law in 1992, authorized the establishment of the \nHETF to be managed as a site for research and education on tropical \nforestry, conservation biology, and natural resource management. HETF \nhas been home to dozens of research projects since its establishment, \nand it has been selected as one of the National Science Foundation's 20 \ncore wildland sites of the National Ecological Observatory Network and \na site of the Forest Service's Experimental Forest and Range Synthesis \nNetwork. Construction of the center will further HETF's mission to \nimprove the conservation and scientific understanding of tropical \nforests, a natural resource of global significance.\n  The James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge will receive funding in \nthis bill to help provide for the acquisition of the remaining parcels \non Oahu's northern shore to complete the expansion of the Refuge. The \nexpansion would add approximately 1,100 acres and ensure protection of \nthe largest natural coastal wetland and last remaining natural coastal \ndune ecosystem on Oahu. It is a premier endangered Hawaiian waterbird \nrecovery area and supports four endangered Hawaiian waterbirds and a \nvariety of migratory shorebirds and waterfowl. I was pleased to be an \noriginal cosponsor of the 2005 legislation that authorized such \nexpansion and believe that securing the remaining parcels will aid in \npreserving the wetland's natural floodwater retention function.\n  In addition, the invasive species management project in Hawaii \nincluded in this bill will help to reduce the impact of established \ninvasive species in the State and support ongoing efforts to prevent \nthe introduction of new ones. Hawaii's delicate insular ecosystems are \nhome to over 300 endangered species, which is more than any other \nState, and the primary factor limiting their recovery and contributing \nto their decline in Hawaii is the continued presence of ecologically \nharmful invasive species. Thus, continued vigilance and action is \nneeded to safeguard these species and their habitats, which are so \nimportant both nationally, in terms of biodiversity, and locally, in \nterms of agriculture, tourism, and culture.\n  I am also pleased the funding in this appropriations bill that will \nsupport the Native Hawaiian Culture and Arts Program, NHCAP, which \npreserves, supports, revitalizes, and develops Native Hawaiian arts and \nculture. NHCAP's efforts are focused on assisting Native Hawaiians to \nbe practitioners of their culture and to share knowledge of and \ncelebrate Hawaiian art and culture. NHCAP projects include educational \nprograms, exhibits, publications, and increased access to the Bishop \nMuseum's vast cultural collections of artifacts, documents, and images. \nThese projects foster Native Hawaiian cultural preservation, create \nimportant educational opportunities for youth, and promote the sort of \nunderstanding necessary in a multicultural nation and increasingly \ninterconnected world.\n  As population grows on islands with limited freshwater resources, \ninformation to evaluate the sustainability of water resources is needed \nto make informed decisions that balance environmental protection with \neconomic opportunity. The resources that this bill supports for well \nmonitoring and water assessment in my State will enable continued work \nwith stakeholders to provide information on water resources so that \nthey can be managed in a sustainable and legally compliant basis. It \nwill also provide for the operation of stream gauges, which supply data \nimportant to signaling flood conditions, improving long-term planning, \nexamining climate change, and measuring water availability and quality.\n  In all, funding for our national priorities in such areas as \nenvironmental protection, Federal lands, and cultural education is \ncomplemented in this bill by these six Hawaii programs that drive \nprogress on research, education, planning, and preservation related to \nnatural and cultural resources across my home state for the benefit of \nmy constituents and the country as a whole. Again, I thank my \ncolleagues for their support of these initiatives and urge continued \nsupport in conference.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote for this bill to provide $32 \nbillion in funding for a variety of important environmental and \ninfrastructure purposes. This bill would provide clean drinking water, \nprevent pollution from contaminating our precious natural resources, \nclean up hazardous waste sites, protect lands for habitat preservation \nand recreation, improve vehicle efficiency, and help restore the Great \nLakes.\n  I am pleased this bill includes $400 million for Great Lakes \nrestoration and protection efforts through a new effort called the \nGreat Lakes Restoration Initiative, GLRI. The GLRI is a multiagency \neffort to address the array of current and historic threats facing the \nGreat Lakes including invasive aquatic species, nonpoint source \npollution, and contaminated sediment.\n  While I appreciate the significant investment in the Great Lakes, I \nhave encouraged the bill managers to provide the full funding requested \nfor the GLRI. The President requested $475 million for the GLRI, and \nthe Environmental Protection Agency has prepared a spending plan for \nthe full funding. Full funding is needed now and would be well spent.\n  A 2003 GAO report on Great Lakes federal restoration programs stated: \n``Despite early success in improving conditions in the Great Lakes \nBasin, significant environmental challenges remain, including increased \nthreats from invasive species and cleanup of areas contaminated with \ntoxic substances that pose human health threats.'' More recently, \nscientists report that the Great Lakes are exhibiting signs of stress \ndue to a combination of sources, including toxic contaminants, invasive \nspecies, nutrient loading, shoreline and upland land use changes, and \nchanges to how water flows. A 2005 report from a group of Great Lakes \nscientific experts states that ``historical sources of stress have \ncombined with new ones to reach a tipping point, the point at which \necosystem-level changes occur rapidly and unexpectedly, confounding the \ntraditional relationships between sources of stress and the expected \necosystem response.''\n  The Great Lakes are a unique American treasure. We must recognize \nthat we are only their temporary stewards. If Congress does not act to \nkeep pace with the needs of the lakes, and the tens of millions of \nAmericans dependent upon them and affected by their condition, the \nproblems will continue\n\n[[Page S9811]]\n\nto build and we may start to undo some of the important work that has \nalready been done and is underway. We must be good stewards by \nproviding the resources that the Federal Government needs to meet its \nongoing obligation to protect and restore the Great Lakes. This bill \nwill help us meet that great responsibility to future generations.\n  Importantly, the bill would provide $1.4 billion to capitalize the \nDrinking Water State Revolving Fund and $2.1 billion for the Clean \nWater State Revolving Fund for wastewater projects. The funding in the \nSenate bill more than doubles the amount provided in the fiscal year \n2009 bill. I had urged appropriators to provide this increase because \nMichigan's water infrastructure needs are sizable. Michigan would \nreceive about $41 million for drinking water and $88 million for \nwastewater projects, protecting public health, improving the \nenvironment, and creating a stronger economic climate.\n  I am also pleased this bill provides $2.7 billion for our National \nPark Service, an increase of $200 million from last year's level, which \nI supported. Michigan has six national park units, and this funding \nwould help ensure these resources are adequately maintained and \nprotected. The national parks have been struggling for years with \ninadequate funding and large maintenance and construction backlogs. \nThis funding would help meet these needs so that our Nation's natural \nand cultural heritage is preserved. Over a million people visited \nMichigan's national parks last year, and it is important that visitors \nfind our parks in good condition and that we do the same for future \ngenerations.\n  I am pleased to see this bill includes the President's fiscal year \n2010 budget request for the Environmental Protection Agency's Climate \nProtection Program, which includes the Clean Automotive Technology \nProgram. EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Ann \nArbor, MI, leads the Clean Automotive Technology Program by \nfacilitating collaboration with the automotive industry through \ninnovative research to achieve ultra low-pollution emissions, increase \nfuel efficiency and reduce greenhouse gases. An example of the work \ndone collaboratively through this program at the Ann Arbor laboratory \nwith its industry partners is development of hydraulic hybrid \ntechnology that offers potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by \n50 percent. The House bill includes an additional $1.6 million for the \nClimate Protection Program, and I am hopeful this additional funding \nwill be maintained in conference and that serious consideration will be \ngiven to directing this funding to deployment of hybrid hydraulic \ntechnology in larger fleet vehicles, such as schoolbuses.\n  Mr. President, this appropriations bill would protect our natural \nresources and the Great Lakes in particular, provide communities with \nsafe drinking water and wastewater infrastructure, improve fuel \nefficiency and reduce greenhouse gases, and protect and improve public \nlands and parks, and I support its passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my understanding is that the next vote will \nbe final passage on the Interior appropriations bill. I want to alert \nall Members and give them kind of a suggestion of what the schedule is \ngoing to be.\n  First of all, people are asking about the Finance Committee. I have \nspoken to Chairman Baucus. The Finance Committee is going to work late \ntonight. They are going to come in in the morning and work, and then \nthey will make a decision how long they are going to work tomorrow and \nwhether they go into the weekend.\n  The next item of business will be the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill. Tonight will be debate only. There will be no \nvotes on Friday. The Defense appropriations managers will be here for \namendments and debate.\n  This is one of the most important bills we deal with every year. \nThere will be no votes on Monday. It is one of the high holidays, Yom \nKippur. The Defense managers will be here to continue consideration of \nthe bill. We are not going to be in session on Monday, not on the \nholiday. I do not think that would be appropriate. People are traveling \nthat day. I do not think it is fair.\n  There will be votes on Tuesday. It will be like a regular Monday. \nThere will be no votes before 5:30. I would hope if people have \namendments on this Defense bill they will lay them down. We want to \nmove on this as quickly as possible. We know there are lots of \nimportant subjects people want to talk about.\n  Wednesday, September 30, is the end of the fiscal year. We have a \nnumber of things we must do before the end of the fiscal year. We are \ngoing to have a CR. We have to extend FAA authority and other issues. \nAll of the chairmen and ranking members know what they are and we have \ndiscussed them on the Senate floor.\n  Next week will be an extremely busy week. I am hopeful in the next \nfew days the Finance Committee will complete their work on the Finance \nhealth care bill, and I hope we do not have to do anything dealing with \nreconciliation on that. We have made progress this week.\n  Members this week working on this bill have been very cooperative. We \nhave two wonderful managers on this Interior appropriations bill. They \nhave worked well together and done a good job.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Before you call the roll, I just want to thank the \ndistinguished ranking member. A lot of cooperation went into this bill \nor it would have taken a lot longer.\n  I thank particularly the staff: Peter Kiefhaber, Virginia James, \nScott Dalzell, Rachael Taylor, Chris Watkins; on the Republican side, \nLee Fonnesbeck, Rachelle Schroeder, and Rebecca Benn. We thank you very \nmuch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. In 60 seconds I would like to thank Chairman Feinstein \nfor being so accommodating working with Republican Members. I would \nlike to thank my colleagues for moving this bill along. Senators \nCochran, Inouye, Reid, and McConnell have been terrific. The staff \nmembers, Peter and Rachael and Scott; on our side, Leif and Rachelle \nand Rebecca. We thank you for your hard work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the committee \nsubstitute, as amended, is agreed to.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2445\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Inhofe \namendment No. 2445 be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Notwithstanding the adoption of the \nsubstitute, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2445.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The people of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the \n     United States share a long history of friendship and comity, \n     and the interests of both nations are well-served by \n     strengthening and deepening this friendship.\n       (2) Since 2001, the United States has contributed more than \n     $15,000,000,000 to Pakistan, of which more than \n     $10,000,000,000 has been security-related assistance and \n     direct payments.\n       (3) With the free and fair election of February 18, 2008, \n     Pakistan returned to civilian rule, reversing years of \n     political tension and mounting popular concern over military \n     rule and Pakistan's own democratic reform and political \n     development.\n       (4) Pakistan is a major non-NATO ally of the United States \n     and has been a valuable partner in the battle against al \n     Qaeda and the Taliban, but much more remains to be \n     accomplished by both nations.\n       (5) The struggle against al Qaeda, the Taliban, and \n     affiliated terrorist groups has\n\n[[Page S9813]]\n\n     led to the deaths of several thousand Pakistani civilians and \n     members of the security forces of Pakistan over the past \n     seven years.\n       (6) Despite killing or capturing hundreds of al Qaeda \n     operatives and other terrorists--including major al Qaeda \n     leaders, such as Khalid Sheikh Muhammad, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, \n     and Abu Faraj al-Libi--the FATA, parts of the NWFP, Quetta in \n     Balochistan, and Muridke in Punjab remain a sanctuary for al \n     Qaeda, the Afghan Taliban, the Terikh-e Taliban and \n     affiliated groups from which these groups organize terrorist \n     actions against Pakistan and other countries.\n       (7) The security forces of Pakistan have struggled to \n     contain a Taliban-backed insurgency, recently taking direct \n     action against those who threaten Pakistan's security and \n     stability, including military operations in the FATA and the \n     NWFP.\n       (8) On March 27, 2009, President Obama noted, ``Multiple \n     intelligence estimates have warned that al Qaeda is actively \n     planning attacks on the United States homeland from its safe-\n     haven in Pakistan.''.\n       (9) According to a Government Accountability Office report \n     (GAO-08-622), ``since 2003, the [A]dministration's national \n     security strategies and Congress have recognized that a \n     comprehensive plan that includes all elements of national \n     power--diplomatic, military, intelligence, development \n     assistance, economic, and law enforcement support--was needed \n     to address the terrorist threat emanating from the FATA'' and \n     that such a strategy was also mandated by section 7102(b)(3) \n     of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of \n     2004 (Public Law 108-458; 22 U.S.C. 2656f note) and section \n     2042(b)(2) of the Implementing the Recommendations of the 9/\n     11 Commission Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-53; 22 U.S.C. 2375 \n     note).\n       (10) During 2008 and 2009, the people of Pakistan have been \n     especially hard hit by rising food and commodity prices and \n     severe energy shortages, with \\2/3\\ of the population living \n     on less than $2 a day and \\1/5\\ of the population living \n     below the poverty line according to the United Nations \n     Development Program.\n       (11) Economic growth is a fundamental foundation for human \n     security and national stability in Pakistan, a country with \n     more than 175,000,000 people, an annual population growth \n     rate of two percent, and a ranking of 136 out of 177 \n     countries in the United Nations Human Development Index.\n       (12) The 2009 Pakistani military offensive in the NWFP and \n     the FATA displaced millions of residents in one of the \n     gravest humanitarian crises Pakistan has faced, and despite \n     the heroic efforts of Pakistanis to respond to the needs of \n     the displaced millions and facilitate the return of many, it \n     has highlighted the need for Pakistan to develop an effective \n     national counterinsurgency strategy.\n\n     SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES.\n\n       Congress declares that the relationship between the United \n     States and Pakistan should be based on the following \n     principles:\n       (1) Pakistan is a critical friend and ally to the United \n     States, both in times of strife and in times of peace, and \n     the two countries share many common goals, including \n     combating terrorism and violent radicalism, solidifying \n     democracy and rule of law in Pakistan, and promoting the \n     social and economic development of Pakistan.\n       (2) United States assistance to Pakistan is intended to \n     supplement, not supplant, Pakistan's own efforts in building \n     a stable, secure, and prosperous Pakistan.\n       (3) The United States requires a balanced, integrated, \n     countrywide strategy for Pakistan that provides assistance \n     throughout the country and does not disproportionately focus \n     on security-related assistance or one particular area or \n     province.\n       (4) The United States supports Pakistan's struggle against \n     extremist elements and recognizes the profound sacrifice made \n     by Pakistan in the fight against terrorism, including the \n     loss of more than 1,900 soldiers and police since 2001 in \n     combat with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and other extremist and \n     terrorist groups.\n       (5) The United States intends to work with the Government \n     of Pakistan--\n       (A) to build mutual trust and confidence by actively and \n     consistently pursuing a sustained, long-term, multifaceted \n     relationship between the two countries, devoted to \n     strengthening the mutual security, stability, and prosperity \n     of both countries;\n       (B) to support the people of Pakistan and their democratic \n     government in their efforts to consolidate democracy, \n     including strengthening Pakistan's parliament, helping \n     Pakistan reestablish an independent and transparent judicial \n     system, and working to extend the rule of law in all areas in \n     Pakistan;\n       (C) to promote sustainable long-term development and \n     infrastructure projects, including in healthcare, education, \n     water management, and energy programs, in all areas of \n     Pakistan, that are sustained and supported by each successive \n     democratic government in Pakistan;\n       (D) to ensure that all the people of Pakistan, including \n     those living in areas governed by the Frontier Crimes \n     Regulation, have access to public, modernized education and \n     vocational training to enable them to provide for themselves, \n     for their families, and for a more prosperous future for \n     their children;\n       (E) to support the strengthening of core curricula and the \n     quality of schools across Pakistan, including madrassas, in \n     order to improve the prospects for Pakistani children's \n     futures and eliminate incitements to violence and \n     intolerance;\n       (F) to encourage and promote public-private partnerships in \n     Pakistan in order to bolster ongoing development efforts and \n     strengthen economic prospects, especially with respect to \n     opportunities to build civic responsibility and professional \n     skills of the people of Pakistan, including support for \n     institutions of higher learning

Mr. President, today the Senate will begin consideration \nof the bill making appropriations for the Department of Defense for \nfiscal year 2010. On behalf of the committee, Vice Chairman Cochran and \nI are recommending funding which totals $636.3 billion for the \ndiscretionary programs under the Defense Subcommittee's jurisdiction.\n  This amount is $3.9 billion below the amount requested but is the \nsame as the subcommittee's allocation.\n  Of this amount $128.2 billion is funding to sustain our overseas \ncontingency operations, primarily in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I applaud Secretary Gates and the administration for putting forward \na budget request which covers the operations both for the normal cost \nof running our national security programs and for the ongoing wartime \nneeds.\n  The proposed funding in this measure protects the priorities of our \nmilitary and civilian leaders; it supports our men and women in \nuniform, and provides the funding needed for critical acquisition \nprograms.\n  There has been much discussion this year about proposals by the \nadministration to cut funding for ``unneeded'' weapons programs. Vice \nChairman Cochran and I have reviewed each of the proposals by the \nadministration.\n\n[[Page S9831]]\n\nWhile we are not in complete agreement with the judgment of \nadministration officials, we have generally concurred with the \nrecommendations of our current leaders.\n  I would like to remind the Members of the Senate that the Defense \nDepartment has been wrong on several occasions in recommending program \nterminations. Luckily the Congress has not always agreed with such \nproposals.\n  Let me give three examples, although we could spend all day relaying \nexamples of mistakes by previous administrations.\n  First, the F-117 Stealth fighter. After producing only one squadron \nof F-117s the Air Force wanted to terminate the program which some in \nthe Defense Department saw as a threat to the F-15E.\n  Congress continued to add funding for the program until two squadrons \nhad been completely filled out.\n  Without the additional aircraft provided by the Congress, the Defense \nDepartment would have been woefully short of Stealth aircraft in \nconducting operations in Desert Storm and Bosnia.\n  Second, the first Bush administration fought very hard to kill the V-\n22 which today the Marine Corps considers one of its greatest assets.\n  Finally, I would remind my colleagues that shortly before Desert \nShield-Desert Storm some in the Pentagon wanted to eliminate the \nCentral Command. The view at the time was that we probably wouldn't \nneed to focus much attention on South West Asia. This clearly \ndemonstrates that our ability to predict hot spots and future threats \nis not perfect.\n  As we go forward today--killing the F-22, the VH-71 Presidential \nhelicopter, the Combat Search and Rescue helicopter, the Kinetic Energy \nInterceptor, we do so with the hope that today's military and civilian \nleaders are better able to predict the future than some of their \npredecessors were.\n  The recommendations before the Senate provide our best judgment on \nthe needs of our Nation for national security.\n  We have not provided funding for the closure of Guantanamo because \nthe administration has yet to produce a credible plan. Instead we have \nincluded language which for all practical purposes is the same as was \nadopted by the Senate earlier this year.\n  We have adjusted funding for the littoral combat ship because the \nadministration did not request sufficient funding to produce the \nquantity it requested.\n  On that subject, I must report that the administration has recently \nannounced that it will only procure two LCS ships this year, which is \nthe number that our committee has funded.\n  We have reapplied savings cut from unjustified amounts requested in \nthe budget to programs that are better suited for funding.\n  For example, we have reduced amounts requested for Afghanistan \nsecurity forces which the administration has informed the committee \ncannot be spent in the coming year and transferred that amount to cover \na shortfall in the critically needed MRAP program.\n  While we strongly concur with the administration that increased \nfunding is required to train and equip our Afghan army and police \nforces, the amount that we recommend is nearly $1 billion more than was \nprovided for fiscal year 2009.\n  Moreover, my colleagues should be advised that the Defense Department \nhas not yet spent nearly $2 billion of the funds that are currently \navailable for this program as we near the end of this fiscal year.\n  Notwithstanding the critical importance of funding for the Afghan \nsecurity forces, it simply makes no sense to provide more funding than \ncan be spent for this program when other shortfalls exist.\n  Along with our staffs we spend countless hours reviewing the programs \nand funding requests proposed by the administration. As you all know \nthe defense budget is huge and it is extremely complex. There are \nthousands of acquisition and operations programs. In most cases the \nspecific amounts requested for each of these programs was proposed by \nthe military services more than a year ago.\n  During the intervening period many changes occur. It is not unusual \nfor a program to be delayed or even terminated while a request is \npending before the Congress.\n  As such, it is up to the subcommittee to make the necessary \nadjustments based on the latest information to ensure that the Nation \nis afforded the best use of the funds provided in this measure.\n  In so doing, we are recommending several program increases in this \nbill.\n  For example, we are recommending adding $1.5 billion to provide for \nessential equipment for our National Guard and Reserve Forces.\n  We have also added funding to sustain our near term missile defense \nprograms--like the AEGIS standard missile, THAAD radars, and ground \nbased interceptors for testing.\n  We are recommending $1.7 billion to purchase an additional DDG-51 \nDestroyer to put that restarted program on a more efficient and \neconomical production schedule.\n  And we have added $2.5 billion to sustain production of the C-17 \nprogram for one additional year. The administration has recently been \nprovided with authority to retire the aging, hard to maintain, and \noften broken C-5A force.\n  We expect that in re-examining its airlift fleet the Defense \nDepartment will eventually conclude that purchasing additional C-17s \nand maintaining the strategic asset of a hot airlift production line is \nthe right solution.\n  On the question of earmarks, as we described earlier this year, the \ncommittee has reduced the amount recommended for earmarks by $300 \nmillion or 10 percent from last year's recommendation.\n  In numbers, the committee has reduced the number of earmarks by \nnearly 200 fewer projects. We recognize that most members of the Senate \nwill receive less than last year. we hope that our colleagues can \nsupport this package with its streamlined approach to earmarking.\n  Collectively, we believe the recommendations in this bill will \nprovide for our Nation's defense and is far superior to the budget \nrequest submitted by the administration. Having had the time to review \nthe suggestions of the administration carefully has afforded the \nsubcommittee the opportunity to produce a better bill. I hope that all \nmy colleagues can support the bill which was approved unanimously by \nthe committee.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Inouye for his \nleadership and bipartisanship in putting together this legislation and \nmoving it to the floor for consideration.\n  Two weeks ago, the Appropriations Committee unanimously approved this \nbill which provides over $636 billion for Department of Defense \noperations for fiscal year 2010, including $128 billion for overseas \ncontingency operations. In compliance with committee allocation, this \nbill is $3.9 billion below the President's budget request.\n  Given the allocation, the committee was forced to make tough \ndecisions. This bill reflects a balanced recommendation which fully \nfunds key readiness programs as well as providing for pay, housing \nallowance, medical care and family support for our men and women in \nuniform and their families.\n  Included in this bill is funding for requirements identified by the \nadministration after the budget request was submitted. Funding is \nincluded to address the administration's budget amendment to grow the \nArmy by an additional 22,200 personnel. Also included is an additional \n$1.2 billion for 1400 mine resistant ambush protected vehicles that \nwere recently identified as new requirements for our men and women \nserving in Afghanistan.\n  This bill also includes $1.5 billion in the National Guard and \nReserve Equipment account to help the Guard and Reserve components \nprocure needed equipment. The Guard and Reserve continue to answer the \ncall to duty. With over 140,000 Guard and Reserve personnel activated, \nwe need to ensure they have the resources necessary to be ready to \nperform their Federal and State missions. This additional funding will \nhelp ensure the Guard and Reserve have the equipment they need.\n  I urge Senators to support the passage of this bill so we can make \nsure service members and their civilian colleagues in the Department of \nDefense have the funding they need to carry out their responsibilities. \nThe men and women who wear our Nation's uniform make great sacrifices \nand one way to\n\n[[Page S9832]]\n\nshow our support is to provide funding in a timely manner. My hope is \nthat we finish floor consideration of this bill this week. It would be \ngood for all concerned if we could in a timely fashion before the end \nof this fiscal year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/24/senate-section/article/S9832-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to \nAttorney General Holder's decision to reexamine the judgment by career \nprosecutors at the Department of Justice and initiate a preliminary \nreview to determine whether criminal charges should be filed against \nCIA officers who conducted interrogations against hardened al-Qaida \nterrorists.\n  At the outset, let me remind everyone that President Obama promised \nthe American people he would look forward rather than backward and \nwould not seek a criminal investigation for individuals involved in the \nCIA's interrogation and detention program. Notwithstanding this \npromise, he has allowed the Attorney General, a member of his Cabinet \nwho answers to him, to rehash old ground despite the fact that career \nprosecutors already have examined the same information and declined to \nprosecute the same individuals for the same actions.\n  By allowing this decision to stand, President Obama is failing to \nexercise his duty as Chief Executive and enforcer of the law. Given \nthat there are no new facts to justify this action by the Attorney \nGeneral, the President should demand that the legal conclusions \npreviously reached by career prosecutors be upheld.\n  Just last week, seven former CIA Directors--encompassing all living \nformer CIA Directors from both political parties except the two \npresently serving in the Obama administration, current Director Panetta \nand Secretary of Defense Gates--wrote in a letter to President Obama \nthat the decision to reexamine these cases ``creates an atmosphere of \ncontinuous jeopardy for those whose cases the Department of Justice had \npreviously declined to prosecute.''\n  No facts have changed since then, no new facts have arisen, and in \nlight of the previous refusal of the Department of Justice to prosecute \nall but one CIA employee, the CIA has already taken administrative \naction against some of these individuals. Where is the justice for \nthese government employees who have been on the front lines in the war \non terror since the 9/11 attacks and who acted under the legal guidance \ngiven to them if they are to face potential punishment more than once \nfor their actions?\n  What is the message we are sending to our intelligence community? \nReopening these cases is exactly the type of action which creates risk-\naverse intelligence agencies and officers. If an intelligence officer \ninvolved in a clandestine operation today worries that he may be \nprosecuted for it tomorrow, he is not going to think twice about \nconducting the operation. He simply will not do it. Worse yet, if an \nintelligence officer involved in a clandestine operation today worries \nthat he may be prosecuted for it tomorrow because of random policy \nchanges, it will evoke an even greater subjective risk-adverse \nenvironment. Creating such an environment where intelligence activities \ntoday are held hostage to the political decisions of tomorrow is a \nrecipe for failure for our intelligence collection efforts.\n  As a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I \nunderstand the important role that intelligence plays in our military, \nlaw enforcement, and intelligence operations. I see firsthand the \nbravery and professionalism exhibited by our intelligence community \ncadre. Partisanship plays no role in their daily operations. They are \nguided not by which political party may obtain their vote on a \nparticular day in November but by an overwhelming sense of duty to \ntheir country. They understand they do not make policy. Yet they are \nout there risking their lives to gather the intelligence necessary for \npolicymakers to make an informed decision.\n  Similarly, partisanship should play no role in the decisions of the \nadministration or Congress when it comes to intelligence gathering. I \ndo not want our intelligence community professionals to have to think \ntwice about whether to gather certain information that will inform me \nof foreign policy developments because they fear potential prosecution \nat a later date for doing so. These men and women need to know they \nhave the freedom to do their jobs within the guidance that is given to \nthem at the time, even though that guidance or policy may change down \nthe road. They need to know the country they are serving has their \nback. Sadly, that is not the message we are sending. Never before has a \nchange in policy brought the threat of potential prosecution for past \nsanctioned actions.\n  Some may ask why the Attorney General's decision is so harmful to our \nnational security. The answer is simple. Without calculated risk taking \non the part of our intelligence community, we will lose the fight \nagainst not only our state adversaries but against terrorists as well. \nThis is not a tradeoff I am willing to take. It is not a tradeoff the \nPresident should be willing to make either, particularly as we continue \nthe fight in Afghanistan.\n  We need to look no further than the events of the past week, the \narrests on American soil of three individuals with admitted ties to al-\nQaida who may have been planning attacks against the U.S. homeland, to \nunderstand that the threats to our country are real and that this \ntradeoff which the administration has sanctioned is a lot closer to \nhitting home.\n  Finally, I would point out that the same report--the CIA inspector \ngeneral's report entitled ``Counterterrorism Detention and \nInterrogation Activities (September 2001-October 2003)''--that Attorney \nGeneral Holder claims was his reason for reopening this investigation \nwas the same report that prompted the CIA to self-report to the \nDepartment of Justice in the first place.\n  Long before the IG even started his review, the CIA informed the \nDepartment of Justice that they had recommended an IG investigation \nrelated to the interrogation program. Once the report was completed, \nthe Department of Justice received it and carefully reviewed the facts \nand circumstances described within it. Only after doing so did the \ncareer attorneys decline to prosecute. Unfortunately, press reports \nfrom this past weekend indicate that the Attorney General never even \nbothered to read the declination memos prepared by these career public \nservants.\n  In recent months, the administration has declassified and released to \nthe public this IG report, as well as the legal guidance from the \nDepartment of Justice. The record is there for the American people to \nreview for themselves. I have reviewed all of this information, and I \nam confident that anyone else who does so will reach the same \nconclusion I have; namely, that reopening an investigation is not \nmerited.\n  Further, it is worth noting that the IG report found that:\n\n       The Agency's detention and interrogation of terrorists has \n     provided intelligence that has enabled identification and \n     apprehension of other terrorists and warned of terrorist \n     plots planned for the United States and around the world.\n\n  Where deviations from the approved procedures and guidance occurred, \nit was an anomaly and was either prosecuted or administratively \npunished by the CIA leadership.\n  The issues at the heart of the Attorney General's decision have been \nexamined thoroughly, and it is time for them to be laid to rest. \nPresident Obama and the Attorney General should put an end to their \nunjustified second-guessing of career prosecutors. I cannot imagine \nthey would be willing to expose their own policy decisions and legal \ndeterminations to future politically motivated prosecutions. Yet by \ndoing so with their actions against the CIA employees, they are setting \na dangerous precedent which I believe will have a lasting, chilling \neffect on our intelligence community and our national security.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S9833]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise once again to honor America's \ngreat Federal employees.\n  When I began my great Federal employees initiative in May, I did so \nby sharing the stories of some outstanding public servants who in past \nyears had won Service to America Medals.\n  Last night, at its eighth annual awards gala, the Partnership for \nPublic Service announced its 2009 Service to America Medal winners. \nThese nine exemplary Federal employees represent a number of agencies \nand hail from diverse backgrounds. Together, they form a snapshot of \nthe finest civil service in history.\n  When I spoke in May about what makes our Federal workforce so \nexcellent, I said there are several qualities our civil servants \nembody. First and foremost, they demonstrate great citizenship by \nchoosing careers in the public sector. Second, they are industrious and \nhardworking in the face of often difficult and challenging tasks.\n  Our Federal employees take risks both to their safety and to their \ncareers. They persevere even when faced with setbacks or with the \nknowledge that the effects of their work may not be felt for years to \ncome. Our public servants exhibit great intellect and bring to their \njobs many advanced skills and specialized knowledge. I am glad--very \nglad--there are awards such as the Service to America Medals to \nrecognize the unsung heroes who keep America moving ever forward. This \nis what I have tried to do each week by speaking about our great public \nservants.\n  This year's Service to America medalists can well be described by the \nfive attributes I just listed.\n  Dr. Janet Kemp, who won this year's Federal Employee of the Year \nMedal, exemplified the value of outstanding citizenship when she \norganized a national suicide prevention hotline for veterans. As \nnational director for the VA's Suicide Prevention Program, Janet \noversaw the creation of the hotline to help combat veteran suicide, \nwhich has increased significantly in recent years. Since 2005, when she \nwas asked to spearhead this program, Janet's initiative has rescued \nover 3,000 veterans and has assisted them in finding help.\n  An important aspect of citizenship is a commitment to protecting \none's community from harm. Ben Fisherow was awarded the 2009 Justice \nand Law Enforcement Medal for his work to prevent air pollution. As an \nexperienced litigator with the Department of Justice's Environment and \nNatural Resources Division, Ben has spent over 20 years enforcing key \nprovisions of the Clean Air Act and taking legal action against \nutilities that violate anti-pollution mandates. In one case alone, Ben \nsecured a settlement that prevented the release of over 800,000 tons of \nair pollutants annually.\n  Our federal employees are hard working, and this year's Citizens \nServices Medal winner proves it. Michael German, of the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development, has been working tirelessly to combat \nhomelessness in America. The Interagency Council on Homelessness, which \nhe leads, coordinates with over 850 State and local officials \nnationwide on efforts to help the homeless obtain medical care and \npermanent housing. Their work has led to a 30-percent reduction in the \nchronically homeless between 2005 and 2007.\n  Another example of our civil servants' industriousness can be found \nin Allan Comp. Allan won the 2009 Environment Medal for his work at the \nDepartment of the Interior's Office of Surface Mining. He created the \nAppalachian Coal Country Watershed Team, a partnership between his \noffice and VISTA volunteers who help local citizens and community \ngroups organize clean-up projects and monitor water quality. His \nprogram was so successful that it was recently expanded to the American \nWest. Today, joint Office of Surface-Mining and VISTA teams are at work \nprotecting and empowering local communities in Colorado, New Mexico, \nand Montana.\n  Clare Rowley is an economic analyst for the FDIC. She won the Call to \nService Medal for helping to implement the FDIC's mortgage modification \nprogram, which helped thousands of families stay in their homes after \nthe collapse of subprime mortgages. In February, Clare, who is only 25 \nyears old, found herself sitting in a high-level meeting with \nregulators, bankers, and Obama administration officials on the \nforeclosure crisis. Despite feeling somewhat intimidated because of her \nage and junior position, Clare spoke up and offered important ideas \nthat eventually made their way into the Treasury Department's mortgage \ncrisis recovery plan. Now, Clare is one of those instrumental in \ncarrying out the plan.\n  A risk-taker, who won this year's National Security and International \nAffairs Medal, serves as the director of the USAID's Office of Economic \nGrowth in Pakistan. In July, I spoke about a USAID employee who was \ngunned down by extremists while posted in the Sudan. For Amy Meyer, who \nperforms similar work in Pakistan, the danger is very real. \nNonetheless, she arrived in the country in 2006 and began working with \nlocal women to create dairy cooperatives. Starting with just a staff of \ntwo and little funding, Amy now oversees a $200 million budget and \nseveral successful economic empowerment programs. She even teaches yoga \non Pakistani television and has spent much of her personal time \ndispensing advice to local women in their homes.\n  The winner of the 2009 Career Achievement Medal knows the meaning of \nperseverance. Dr. Thomas Waldmann has been a medical researcher at the \nNational Institutes of Health for over 50 years. Currently, Tom is \nchief of the NIH National Cancer Institute's Metabolism Branch, and the \nfocus of his career has been researching disorders in which the body \nattacks its own cells. His work has led to treatments to once-fatal \nvarieties of lymphoma, leukemia, and multiple sclerosis. Tom also co-\ndiscovered a type of molecule that may lead to advances in the fight \nagainst AIDS and cancer. But his successes did not happen overnight. \nHis achievements were the work of a lifetime, and the full impact of \nTom's discoveries will not be known for years.\n  Similarly, Dr. Patricia Guerry has demonstrated great resolve while \nresearching an elusive vaccine. Now serving as chief of the Naval \nMedical Research Center's Molecular Biology and Biochemistry Branch, \nshe has spent nearly 30 years studying a microbe that causes food \npoisoning. Researchers discovered that the most common microbe involved \nin food-borne illnesses is Campylobacter. In the mid-1980s, after \nseveral years of unsuccessfully attempting to find a vaccine, many \nmicrobiologists turned their attention elsewhere. Patricia, however, \nnever gave up. Today, she and her team of researchers are nearing their \ngoal, and their vaccine is now in the testing phase. She persevered, \nand our troops stationed abroad as well as tens of millions in the \ndeveloping world will likely soon benefit from a vaccine.\n  This year's Homeland Security Medal was shared by a pair of CIA \nemployees who showed great intellect in solving a critical problem. In \n2005, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence gave Sean \nDennehy and Don Burke the task of improving information-sharing across \nthe intelligence community. Lack of communication between the \nintelligence agencies had been a serious impediment to preventing the \nSeptember 11 attacks. To fix this, Sean and Don created an online \nsystem called ``Intellipedia,'' modeled after the popular Wikipedia Web \nsite. Intellipedia enables analysts from different agencies to \ncontribute information to subject pages and open cases. Today, \nIntellipedia has grown to nearly a million pages, and it has helped \nprevent threats to the Beijing Olympics, analyze IED patterns in Iraq, \nand study the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks.\n  All of these outstanding public servants display great humility. Even \nwith such accomplishments, modesty is their common response.\n  I want to congratulate the Partnership for Public Service on their \nwork to award the Service to America Medals. The winners were selected \nby a blue ribbon panel of leaders from both\n\n[[Page S9834]]\n\nthe public and private sectors, of which our colleague from \nMississippi, Senator Thad Cochran, is a member.\n  I hope the rest of my colleagues will join me in congratulating all \nof this year's Service to America winners on receiving their medals. We \nthank them, and all Federal employees, for their service to our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/24/senate-section/article/S9834-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FURTHER CHANGES TO S. CON. RES. 13\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wish to make a series of adjustments to \nthe allocation of budget authority and outlays to the Senate \nAppropriations Committee and the section 401(b) Senate discretionary \nspending limits. I am making these adjustments for the Departments of \nLabor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2010, and for the Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act, 2010.\n  First, section 401(c)(2)(A) of the 2010 Budget Resolution permits the \nchairman to adjust the section 401(b) discretionary spending limits, \nallocations pursuant to section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974, and aggregates for legislation making appropriations for \nfiscal year 2010 that both appropriates $273 million and provides an \nadditional appropriation of up to $485 million to the Social Security \nAdministration for continuing disability reviews and Supplemental \nSecurity Income redeterminations.\n  Second, section 401(c)(2)(C) of the 2010 Budget Resolution permits \nthe chairman to adjust the section 401(b) discretionary spending \nlimits, allocations pursuant to section 302(a) of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, and aggregates for legislation making \nappropriations for fiscal year 2010 that appropriates up to $311 \nmillion to the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services.\n  Third, section 401(c)(2)(D) of the 2010 Budget Resolution permits the \nchairman to adjust the section 401(b) discretionary spending limits, \nallocations pursuant to section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974, and aggregates for legislation making appropriations for \nfiscal year 2010 that both appropriates $10 million and provides an \nadditional appropriation of up to $50 million for in-person \nreemployment and eligibility assessments and unemployment insurance \nimproper payment reviews.\n  Fourth, section 401(c)(3) of S. Con. Res. 13, the 2010 Budget \nResolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to \nadjust the section 401(b) discretionary spending limits, allocations \npursuant to section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and \naggregates for legislation making appropriations for fiscal year 2010 \nthat appropriates $3.2 billion in funding for the Low-Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program and provides an additional appropriation of \nup to $1.9 billion for that program.\n  On August 4, 2009, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported H.R. \n3293, the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010, with an \namendment in the nature of a substitute. The reported bill contains \n$2.746 billion in funding that satisfies the conditions of sections \n401(c)(2)(A), 401(c)(2(C), 401(c)(2)(D), and 401(c)(3). The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that the $2.746 billion in budget \nauthority will result in $2.197 billion in new outlays in 2010. As a \nresult, I am revising both the discretionary spending limits and the \nallocation to the Senate Committee on Appropriations for discretionary \nbudget authority and outlays by those amounts in 2010.\n  Finally, section 401(c)(4) of S. Con. Res. 13, the 2010 Budget \nResolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to \nadjust the section 401(b) discretionary spending limits, allocations \npursuant to section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and \naggregates for legislation making appropriations for fiscal years 2009 \nand 2010 for overseas deployments and other activities by the amounts \nprovided in such legislation for those purposes and so designated \npursuant to section 401(c)(4). The adjustment is limited to the total \namount of budget authority specified in section 104(21) of S. Con. Res. \n13. For 2009, that limitation is $90.745 billion, and for 2010, it is \n$130 billion.\n  On September 10, 2009, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported \nH.R. 3326, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2010, with an \namendment in the nature of a substitute. The reported bill contains \n$128.221 billion in funding that has been designated for overseas \ndeployments and other activities pursuant to section 401(c)(4). The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that the $128.221 billion in \nbudget authority will result in $66.653 billion in new outlays in 2010. \nAs a result, I am revising both the discretionary spending limits and \nthe allocation to the Senate Committee on Appropriations for \ndiscretionary budget authority and outlays by those amounts in 2010. \nWhen combined with previous adjustments made pursuant to section \n401(c)(4), $128.6 billion has been designated so far for overseas \ndeployments and other activities for 2010.\n  When combining the effects of the adjustments made for both bills, I \nam revising today both the discretionary spending limits and the \nallocation to the Senate Committee on Appropriations by a total of \n$130,967 million for budget authority and $68,850 million for outlays.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following revisions to S. Con. Res. \n13 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2010--S.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize September as \nNational Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. Prostate cancer is the most \ndiagnosed nonskin cancer in the United States and the most commonly \ndiagnosed cancer in men. It is estimated that 200,000 men will be \ndiagnosed with prostate cancer and 30,000 men will die from the disease \nthis year. Our commitment to making awareness and early detection of \nthis disease a national priority must continue.\n  A simple blood test, the prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, can \ndetect the risk of prostate cancer. Health experts recommend that \ndoctors offer men yearly screening beginning at age 50. However, men \nwith high-risk factors should consider starting yearly testing earlier. \nWe must remember that through screening and early detection, we truly \ncan save lives.\n  I am proud to add my voice to those who are working to fight prostate \ncancer, and I take this opportunity to recognize the families, \nprofessionals, and advocates who work day after day to be a powerful \nvoice for prostate cancer patients. I commend them on their tireless \nefforts to raise awareness of the risks, to promote early detection and \ntreatment, and to further our efforts to understand and eliminate this \ndisease. We must all join these efforts to pursue increased funding for \nbiomedical research and public health awareness\n\n[[Page S9835]]\n\ncampaigns, as well as expanded diagnosis and treatment options.\n  I urge all citizens to support the search for the early detection and \ncure of prostate cancer and support those individuals and families who \nface this devastating disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/24/senate-section/article/S9835-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING CHARACTER COUNTS! WEEK\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the \nnational week of CHARACTER COUNTS!, the most widely used character \nbuilding framework in the United States.\n  In 1993, after a conference in Aspen, Colorado, CHARACTER COUNTS! was \nformed to educate students about universal ethical standards. With six \nvital pillars--trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, \ncaring, and citizenship--CHARACTER COUNTS! teaches students essential \nvalues for developing into productive citizens. This important program \nsupplements a regular school's curriculum to educate our future \ngenerations about important decisionmaking skills. The program has been \ncredited for increased school attendance, as well as a reduction in \nmisbehavior.\n  Character education is vital to our youth, and it teaches important \nlessons we would all do well to embrace. I commend the CHARACTER \nCOUNTS! organization, its instructors, and its participants for being a \npart of this admirable initiative.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/24/senate-section/article/S9835-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                       SPECIALIST JUSTIN PELLERIN\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a special \nperson, U.S. Army SPC Justin Pellerin of Concord, NH, for his service \nand supreme sacrifice for our Nation.\n  Tragically, on August 20, 2009, this courageous young soldier, only \n21 years of age, gave his last full measure of devotion when an \nexplosive device detonated near his vehicle in Wardak Province, \nAfghanistan. At the time of the incident, Specialist Pellerin was \nserving as an infantryman assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 87th Infantry \nRegiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division based at Fort \nDrum, NY.\n  Justin joined the U.S. Army in June 2007 after graduating from \nConcord High School and deployed in January in support of Operation \nEnduring Freedom. This decorated patriot is the recipient of the \nNational Defense Service Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Global War \non Terrorism Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, NATO Service Medal, \nand most recently, the Purple Heart and Bronze Star.\n  Heroes from the State of New Hampshire have served our Nation with \nhonor and distinction from Bunker Hill to Afghanistan. Undoubtedly, \nJustin has advanced that fine tradition. Daniel Webster said: ``God \ngrants liberty only to those who love it, and are always ready to guard \nand defend it.'' Justin chose to serve our Nation, guard our precious \nliberties, and answer the call of freedom. Our debt of gratitude will \nnever be fully repaid to Justin or his loved ones.\n  The sudden death of a young person is especially difficult for family \nand friends. In November 1864, President Abraham Lincoln was informed \nby the War Department of a mother who had lost five sons in the Civil \nWar. He wrote the mother: ``I feel how weak and fruitless must be any \nword of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a \nloss so overwhelming. But I cannot refrain from tendering you the \nconsolation that may be found in the thanks of the Republic they died \nto save.''\n  My heartfelt sympathy, condolences, and prayers go out to Justin's \nwife Chelsey; his parents Dale and Melissa, and family and friends. The \ndeath of Justin, on a battlefield far from New Hampshire, is a true \nloss for our State and Nation, and a grievous pain for those who knew \nhim best and loved him most. Although he will be sorely missed by all, \nit is my hope that his family and friends may find some comfort in \nknowing that Justin's devotion, sense of duty, and selfless dedication \nhave made the safety and liberty of each and every American more \nsecure. May God bless SPC Justin Pellerin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/24/senate-section/article/S9835-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                TRIBUTE TO OUTSTANDING HAWAII EDUCATORS\n\n Mr. AKAKA.

Through their efforts, they established one of our \nNation's premier cancer centers. The Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum \nCancer Center is known for translating its innovative research into \nbetter treatments. Stewart is a past chairman of the board of the \nUniversity of Maryland Medical System, home to the Marlene and Stewart \nGreenebaum Cancer Center.

Mr. President, I wish today to recognize the noble \nefforts of\n\n[[Page S9836]]\n\nboth the Sones family and the Dover Air Force Base community for their \nsupport of Karina Sones in her battle against cancer. Karina was \ndiagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia when she was 4 years old. \nAlthough the doctors thought they had beaten the cancer after a round \nof chemotherapy in 2004, she unfortunately relapsed in 2006. I wish to \ncommemorate the sterling efforts of her two younger brothers, her \nparents, and the men and women of Dover Air Force Base for encouraging \nand supporting Karina through this difficult time. Thankfully, she is \nnow on the path to recovery.\n  When Karina relapsed, her parents were informed that a bone marrow \ntransplant was her only option. Despite there being approximately 20 \nmillion bone marrow donations on record, there were no matches on the \nNational Marrow Donor database for Karina. Her parents, however, \nremained optimistic that a solution would be found. In what can only be \ndescribed as good fortune, Karina was lucky enough to be the recipient \nof an anonymous donation of umbilical cord stem cells that allowed her \nto have a second chance at life. Karina bravely endured radiation and \n50 days of isolation before she could receive the transplant. \nAfterwards, the whole family had to work together to prevent her from \ngetting sick. Although, Karina still suffers from graft-vs-host disease \nwhich has caused her skin to be inflamed, she remains brave and upbeat. \nShe insists that she would like to go to Disneyland with her mother and \nbe Cinderella.\n  Her two younger brothers, Braydin, age 10, and Torin, age 7, \nadmirably refuse to be helpless as their sister battles leukemia. \nKarina's struggle inspired them to want to help other kids with cancer \nand to further support research, so they began collecting golf balls \nthat had landed in their backyard and selling them on to golfers. Their \ngoal was to collect $500, and they have already exceeded that amount. \nThey will donate all the money to the Alfred I. duPont Hospital for \nChildren where Karina still receives treatment.\n  This story is a true example of the Air Force, the Dover community, \nand the Sones family all coming together to unite against a common \nadversary. The city of Dover and the Dover Air Force Base are known for \ntheir tight-knit relationship which is certainly demonstrated by the \nDover community having won the Abeliene trophy twice--the trophy \ndesignated for the base with the most supportive community--and this \nstory only provides further evidence for that statement.\n  I believe that it is a mark of Karina's character and impressive \nbravery that she has persevered through all of her medical setbacks. To \nthis day, Karina refuses to rest and is working on spreading awareness \nabout becoming a bone marrow donor because she wants other children to \nhave the same chance at life that she had. Most children, after \nspending so much time in hospitals, would wish to stay away from them, \nbut Karina is not most children. She wants to become a cardiologist \nwhen she grows up.\n  Karina's brave story is one that we do not hear often. I wish to \nhonor not just her courage but also the bravery and perseverance of her \nbrothers and her parents and to wish them continued blessings in the \nfuture. I also want to emphasize the good work and support that Dover \nAir Force Base has offered the Sones family during such a trying and \ndifficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/24/senate-section/article/S9836-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO THE WHIFFENPOOFS\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, 100 years ago this winter, history \nwas made at the old Mory's Bar on Temple Street in New Haven, CT, as \nDenton Fowler, James Merriam Howard, Carl Lohmann, Meade Minnigerode, \nand George Pomeroy formed an a cappella singing group known as the \nWhiffenpoofs of Yale University.\n  The Whiffenpoofs, as every Yalie knows, are unsurpassed in talent and \ntradition. They are now the oldest continuously functioning collegiate \na cappella singing group in the United States.\n  Their history is rich and vibrant. During World War II, the brave men \nof the U.S. Army Air Force's Black Sheep Squadron adopted ``The \nWhiffenpoof Song'' as their theme song. And over the course of the 20th \ncentury, that famous tune has been recorded by such legendary artists \nas Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, and Elvis Presley.\n  The Whiffenpoofs have inspired a cappella singing groups at colleges \nand secondary schools across America--in fact, there are now more than \n1,200 such groups entertaining audiences.\n  But their influence is not limited by our borders. Each year, the \nWhiffenpoofs embark on an international tour, visiting foreign capitals \nand tiny villages, great palaces and humble churches, and U.S. \nEmbassies around the world, spreading song and good will on behalf of \nYale University and America's college students.\n  Next month, Whiffenpoofs alumni from around the world will descend \nupon Yale to convene with the current group in celebration of the \nWhiffenpoofs' centennial. It is sure to be an occasion filled with good \ncheer, great music, and tremendous fellowship--the trademarks of this \nbeloved Connecticut institution.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate the Whiffenpoofs of Yale University on \ntheir centennial, I thank them for their many contributions to our \nNation, and I look forward to another century of song and \nfriendship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/24/senate-section/article/S9836-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO STEVE AND SHELLEY BRUNE\n\n Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, Steve and Shelley Brune are \nextraordinary Nebraskans who made a commitment to open their hearts and \nhome to a foster child, which led to a remarkable story of love and \ncompassion.\n  In September 1999, they welcomed Jonathon into their home as a foster \nchild. In February 2001, Jonathon's biological brother, James, was also \nremoved from the home. The Brune family recognized the importance of \nkeeping siblings together and agreed to unite the brothers by welcoming \nJames into their home as a second foster child.\n  The Brunes worked closely with the Nebraska Department of Health and \nHuman Services, HHS, in efforts to reunite Jonathon and James with \ntheir biological parents. When HHS determined that reunification was \nnot in the boys' best interest, Steve and Shelley made a permanent \ncommitment to the boys by adopting them; Jonathon on July 19, 2001 and \nJames on January 17, 2002.\n  In October 2007, the biological sister of James and Jonathon, Mary \nAnn, was removed from the home. HHS contacted the Brune family to \ndiscuss the possibility of once again becoming foster parents. The \nBrunes recognized that this child needed a loving home and would \nbenefit from being with her brothers. For a third time, they admirably \nopened their hearts and home, welcoming Mary Ann on July 15, 2008.\n  In April 2009, another sibling, Madeline Grace, was born and was also \nremoved from the home. The Brune family showed tremendous compassion \nand devotion to the children of this family by agreeing to welcome \nMadeline Grace into their family. Steve and Shelley are currently in \nthe process of adopting both Mary Ann and Madeline Grace.\n  It is with heartfelt admiration that I nominate Steve and Shelley \nBrune as Adoption Angels. Their capacity to love and care for these \nfour children is an inspiration and worthy example for others to \nfollow. My hope is that their story inspires others to consider opening \ntheir hearts and homes to the many children awaiting adoption, in need \nof loving families.\n  May God bless Shelley, Steve, Jonathan, James, Mary Ann, Madeline \nGrace, and all adoptive parents who give children the gift of a loving \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/24/senate-section/article/S9836-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9836-S9837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BRICKLAYERS AND ALLIED CRAFT \n                                WORKERS\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

Working with their signatory contractors, Local \n03 negotiated fair wages, safe working conditions, a respectable \nretirement, and solidarity among the membership. Although Local 03 has \nnever had a large membership, they have always believed that working \ntogether will accomplish more than working alone. Today, 16 members \nkeep the hopes and dreams of their founding members alive and well. \nSpecial recognition is given to Howard Jones as he receives his 50-year \ngold card and Don Feiock as he receives his 25-year membership pin.\n  I commend Local 03 Bricklayers and Allied Craft members for \ncontinuing the proud tradition of craft excellence and union solidarity \nstarted by their founders a century ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/24/senate-section/article/S9837-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING HARBOR TECHNOLOGIES\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as we emerge from this lengthy \nrecession, companies small and large are seeking to grow their \nbusinesses and become increasingly more innovative. Many are seeking to \nbe leaders in some of the world's foremost emerging technologies. I \nwish to recognize a small firm in my home State of Maine that has been \nat the cutting edge of the composites industry since its founding 6 \nyears ago, positioning itself well for continued future success.\n  Harbor Technologies, located in Brunswick, was founded during the \nsummer of 2003 to fill the demand for environmentally friendly \ncomposite building products used for marine infrastructure. In \nparticular, Harbor Technologies' composites are utilized in the \nmanufacturing of docks, piers, marinas, sea walls, pilings, and other \nsimilar structures. Additionally, Harbor Technologies is using its \ncomposites to build bridge beams as an alternative to heavy steel. As \nwe seek to improve and upgrade our Nation's roads and bridges, Harbor \nTechnologies' distinctive fiberglass bridge beams should be at the \nforefront.\n  What makes composites so unique is its durability. While steel rusts \nand wood is subject to rotting, composites last longer and are easily \nmaintained, leading to huge cost savings for both the supplier and the \npurchaser. Composites are also lightweight and compact; a large \ncomposite beam weighs 4,000 pounds, while similar concrete beams weigh \n63,000 pounds. This allows Harbor Technologies to save on shipping \ncosts, and reduce its carbon footprint in the process.\n  Just last year, Harbor Technologies tripled the size of its \nmanufacturing space to 30,000 square feet, and added state-of-the-art \npultrusion machinery to produce pilings of any length. This has allowed \nthe company to take on considerable new work and hire additional \nemployees, even during these difficult economic times.\n  Significantly, Harbor Technologies has played a critical role in \ndeveloping an advanced composites cluster in the Maine midcoast region. \nAdditionally, Harbor Technologies' president Martin Grimnes, is the \nfounder of the Maine Composites Alliance, an organization that seeks to \npromote the State's leadership in several composites industries, \nincluding marine, aerospace, and automotive. Clusters, which are \ngeographic concentrations of companies and organizations that \ncollaborate to create specific products, represent proven tools in our \nNation's innovation agenda, and Mr. Grimnes is to be commended for his \nsteadfast determination to advance their effectiveness and utilization \nthroughout Maine.\n  As a national leader in the composites industry, Harbor Technologies \nhas made a name for itself as a reliable and trustworthy company that \nproduces innovative, cost-effective, and environmentally sound \nproducts. And it is small businesses like Harbor Technologies that \nrepresent the brightest lights for our economy's future. I congratulate \npresident Martin Grimnes and everyone at Harbor Technologies on their \noutstanding work and wish them continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/24/senate-section/article/S9837-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/24/senate-section/article/S9837-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/24/senate-section/article/S9837-4", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 9:33 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 1677.

A bill to amend the Act of June 18, 1934, to reaffirm the \nauthority of the Secretary of the Interior to take land into trust for \nIndian tribes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a technical \namendment to the Act of June 18, 1934.\n  On February 24, 2009, the Supreme Court issued its decision in the \nCarcieri v. Salazar case. In that decision the Supreme Court held that \nthe Secretary of the Interior exceeded his authority in taking land \ninto trust for a tribe that was not under Federal jurisdiction, or \nrecognized, at the time the Indian Reorganization Act was enacted in \n1934.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is necessary to reaffirm the \nSecretary's authority to take lands into trust for Indian tribes, \nregardless of when they were recognized by the Federal government. The \namendment ratifies the prior trust acquisitions of the Secretary, who \nfor the past 75 years has been exercising his authority to take lands \ninto trust, as intended by the Indian Reorganization Act.\n  On May 21, 2009, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs held a \nhearing to examine the executive branch's authority to take land into \ntrust for Indian tribes. At that hearing, it became clear that Congress \nneeds to act to resolve the uncertainty created by the Supreme Court's \ndecision. Therefore, this legislation was developed in consultation \nwith interested parties to clarify the Secretary's authority.\n  Inaction by Congress could significantly impact planned development \nprojects on Indian trust lands, including the building of homes and \ncommunity centers; result in a loss of jobs in an already challenging \neconomic environment; and create costly and unnecessary litigation.\n  Further, if the decision stands, it would have the effect of creating \ntwo classes of Indian tribes--those who were recognized as of 1934, for \nwhom land may be taken into trust, and those recognized after 1934 that \nwould be unable to have land taken into trust status. Creating two \nclasses of tribes is unacceptable and is contrary to prior Acts of this \nCongress. In 1994, Congress passed the Federally Recognized Indian \nTribe List Act to ensure that all tribes are treated equally, \nregardless of their date of recognition.\n  I want to thank Senators Tester, Inouye, Akaka, Baucus, Udall, \nBingaman, and Franken for their support on this legislation. My \ncosponsors are well aware of the resulting impact this decision could \nhave on our Native American communities. Affected tribes deserve our \ntimely consideration of this bill. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting the passage of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1703\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to hold the surviving Nazi war criminals accountable \nfor the war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity they \ncommitted during World War II, by encouraging foreign governments to \nmore efficiently prosecute and extradite wanted criminals; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nWorld War II War Crimes Accountability Act of 2009. The bill seeks to \nhold the surviving Nazi war criminals accountable for their crimes by \nencouraging foreign governments to prosecute and extradite wanted \ncriminals. I would like to thank my colleagues, Senators Snowe and \nCardin, for supporting this important legislation.\n  The atrocities committed by the Nazis and their allies during the \nSecond World War were vast and have helped shape the modern concept of \ncrimes against humanity. After the war, some of the perpetrators of \nthese heinous crimes escaped justice and have been living out their \ndays as free men.\n  In an effort to bring these fugitives to justice, the Simon \nWiesenthal Center and the Targum Shlishi Foundation of Miami, Florida \nlaunched ``Operation: Last Chance'' to help identify and facilitate the \nprosecution of the remaining unprosecuted Nazi war criminals and to \nassist governments in bringing Nazi war criminals to justice.\n  Among the Center's many open cases there is Alois Brunner, a key \noperative of Adolf Eichmann, who was responsible for the deportation of \n47,000 Jews from Austria, 44,000 Jews from Greece, 23,500 Jews from \nFrance, and 14,000 Jews from Slovakia to Nazi death camps. He lived in \nSyria for decades and the Syrian government refused to\n\n[[Page S9843]]\n\ncooperate with international prosecution efforts. He was convicted in \nabsentia for his crimes by France. He was born in 1912 and last seen in \n2001. While is it doubtful that he is still alive, there is no \nconclusive evidence of his death.\n  Another case is that of Milivoj Asner, who served as the police chief \nof the city of Slavonska Pozega. During 1941 and 1942, Mr. Asner \norchestrated the robbery, persecution and destruction of the local \nSerb, Jewish, and Gypsy communities, which culminated in the \ndeportation of hundreds of civilians to Ustasha concentration camps, \nwhere most of the deportees were murdered. After his exposure in \nOperation: Last Chance, the former police chief later escaped once \nagain to Klagenfurt, Austria where he currently resides.\n  Within our own government, the Office of Special Investigations at \nthe Justice Department is tasked with identifying, investigating and \ndenying refuge in the United States to the Nazi persecutors. As a \nresult, the U.S. is the only country in the world to have won an ``A'' \nrating from the Simon Wiesenthal Center for effectiveness in pursuing \njustice for Holocaust crimes.\n  Yet despite the best efforts of the U.S. Government and tireless work \nof organizations like the Wiesenthal Center, some countries continue to \nharbor wanted Nazis and refuse to accept the extradition of Nazi \ncriminals from other countries, including the U.S. This inaction is \nshameful.\n  It is incumbent upon us as Americans to honor the memory of those \nkilled in the Holocaust and to pay tribute to the sacrifices of the men \nand women who fought and died in World War II. The last surviving Nazi \nwar criminals are dying off. We must do everything in our power, \nincluding equipping our own government with important tools, to bring \nthese war criminals to justice before it is too late.\n  The World War II War Crimes Accountability Act seeks to strengthen \nU.S. efforts by directing the Attorney General to assess a country's \ncooperation in prosecuting and extraditing war criminals when \nconsidering prospective countries for admission into the Visa Waiver \nProgram. It also requires the President to issue an annual report \ndescribing such cooperation for countries seeking entry into or renewal \nof the Visa Waiver Program.\n  I believe that giving the administration this added review process \nwill help encourage foreign governments to prosecute and extradite \nwanted criminals. I hope that others will join me in cosponsoring this \nlegislation and voting it into law.\n  Time is of the essence. Surviving Nazi war criminals are becoming \nincreasingly rare. We must do all that we can before it is too late.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 1711. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax incentives for making homes more water-efficient, for building new \nwater-efficient homes, for public water conservation, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce three pieces of \nlegislation: the Water Efficiency and Conservation Investment Act, S. \n1711, the Water Efficiency, Conservation and Adaptation Act, S. 1712, \nand the Water Efficiency via Carbon Harvesting and Restoration Act, S. \n1713.\n  Water is our world's most precious and important limited natural \nresource--access to water is vital for every person and life form on \nthis planet. Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, a Hungarian Nobel Prize winning \ndoctor, once said that ``water is life's mater and matrix, mother and \nmedium. There is no life without water.''\n  While Nevada is blessed with beautiful desert landscapes and \ntremendous clean energy resources, we are not blessed with abundant \nwater supplies. That is why I am introducing legislation together with \nmy friend Senator Ensign and others that will: encourage Americans to \nuse water more efficiently; ensure that future generations have access \nto adequate supplies of clean water; and convert water stealing \ninvasive weeds to sequestered carbon and clean-burning fuels.\n  A lengthy drought is taking its toll on the Colorado River Basin \nstates, especially Nevada, Arizona, and California. More than 30 \nmillion people rely on water from the Colorado River, which supplies \nSouthern Nevada with 90 percent of its water. Water levels at Lake \nMead, where water used by 1.9 million Nevadans is stored, have dropped \nby roughly 100 feet. If the drought in the Southwest continues the lake \ncould dry up in the next 12 years, according to a study by the Scripps \nInstitution of Oceanography.\n  Growing population, rising water demand, climate change induced \ndisruptions to the water cycle, aging infrastructure, and water \ndisputes all necessitate early action so the water resources we rely on \ntoday can be enjoyed by the next generation.\n  Even without considering the effects of climate change, the U.S. \nGlobal Change Research Program has identified many serious water supply \nconflicts in the Colorado River Basin states by 2025. Factoring in the \nUSGCRP's projection that precipitation runoff will decrease in the \nSouthwest by up to 40 percent in some areas over the next half century \nas a result of a changing climate, it is clear that immediate and \nconstant attention is and will be necessary to address these water \nsupply problems.\n  Legislation is urgently needed to promote greater water efficiency \nand create better financing options for improving our infrastructure to \nsave, recycle and reuse water. Strong tax incentives to make our homes \nand yards more water efficient and to increase investments in extending \nthe life of our existing water supplies will help secure water scarce \nregions against the economic and health catastrophes that would occur \nif their water supplies were to run dry.\n  We need to invest meaningfully in planning for, adapting to and \nmitigating the effects of climate change on water supplies and water \ninfrastructure with which Nevadans are becoming all too familiar. It is \nimportant that we start planning right away for a more secure water \nsupply future.\n  Investing in water efficiency and adapting our water systems to a \nchanging climate not only prepares us for the future, it also can save \nconsumers hundreds of dollars on their water bills. Additionally, \nadequate funding for the legislation I am introducing today could \ncreate tens of thousands of jobs. A $1 million direct investment in \nwater efficiency is estimated to create between 15 and 22 jobs--more \nthan double the jobs created by coal or oil investments.\n  Together, the Water Efficiency and Conservation Investment Act and \nthe Water Efficiency, Conservation and Adaptation Act provide the right \nbalance of tax incentives, financing and grant programs to begin \nformulating a national strategy to address these pressing needs and \nensure that current and future Nevadans will have greater and more \nsustainable economic growth opportunities.\n  The Water Efficiency via Carbon Harvesting and Restoration Act also \nhelps protect our water resources, and does much more. Invasive weeds \nand dangerous fuels buildup in Western landscapes have become recipes \nfor disaster on a seemingly annual basis. The Bureau of Land Management \nhas estimated that a single acre of salt cedar robs our watersheds of \nnearly a million gallons of water each year. The National Park Service \nhas found that the infestation at Lake Mead National Recreation Area \nalone covers almost 7,000 acres. Removing the salt cedar from this one \narea would restore enough water to satisfy the needs of 72,000 Las \nVegas residents.\n  At the same time, expansion of pinyon and juniper now covers up to 9 \nmillion acres of the public lands in the Great Basin, forming dense \nthickets impenetrable to most wildlife, and creating enormous wildland \nfire hazards.\n  Using biochar production technology, we can restore these impacted \nlandscapes, while producing valuable products that can help address \nclimate change through long term carbon sequestration, benefit \nagriculture and the environment by reducing the need for chemical \nfertilizers, and produce cleaner-burning fuels to help meet our \nNation's energy needs. All of this can be achieved while saving \nbillions of gallons of water, reducing the risks of hotter and more \ndifficult to extinguish wildfires, and creating rural economic \ndevelopment opportunities.\n  Let me offer a brief description of how biochar technology works: the\n\n[[Page S9844]]\n\nwoody material in invasive plants is heated in the absence of oxygen to \nproduce biochar, as well as bio-oil and syngas which can then be used \nto power the production process. Biochar is nearly pure carbon, and \nwhen applied to landscapes and agricultural fields it has long-lasting \nbenefits. It significantly improves soil quality, decreases fertilizer \nrunoff, and increases plant health and crop yields. Studies have found \nthat biochar is stable for hundreds if not thousands of years, keeping \nthis carbon from being released into the atmosphere where it would \ncontribute to climate change.\n  These bills will do much to extend the life of our water resources in \nthe face of growing water demand and climate disruptions, while \nimproving the health of ecosystems. Under these bills, Nevadans would \nhave new options to save money on their water bills and new ways to \nmake money by eliminating water-hungry invasive species. And, the low-\ncost financing options that will help communities adapt to drought and \nwater scarcity due to global climate change will ensure sustainable \neconomic growth and stimulate more green job creation.\n  As these bills move through the legislative process, I look forward \nto working with my colleagues to ensure that adequate attention is paid \nto the tremendous work our Nation must do so that future generations \nmay enjoy a more secure and predictable clean water future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1711\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1712\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Water Efficiency, \n     Conservation, and Adaptation Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1)(A) human-induced climate change is affecting the \n     natural water cycle, decreasing precipitation levels in the \n     West, especially the Southwest, and making droughts and \n     floods more frequent and more intense;\n       (B) declining precipitation levels will severely impact \n     water supplies in Southwestern States; and\n       (C) a sharp increase in the number of days with very heavy \n     precipitation throughout the Northeast and the Midwest will \n     stress aging water infrastructure;\n       (2) changes in the water cycle caused by climate \n     disruptions will adversely affect water infrastructure, \n     energy production and use, human health, transportation, \n     agriculture, and ecosystems, while also aggravating water \n     disputes across the United States;\n       (3)(A) the Colorado River, which supplies water for over \n     30,000,000 people, is experiencing the worst drought in over \n     100 years of recordkeeping; and\n       (B) the primary reservoirs of the Colorado River Basin and \n     Lakes Mead and Powell have lost nearly half of the storage \n     waters of the reservoirs and Lakes, and clean hydropower \n     generated from Hoover Dam risks reduction if the extended \n     drought persists;\n       (4) States and local governments and water utilities can \n     begin to address the challenges described in this section by \n     providing incentives for water efficiency and conservation, \n     while also planning and investing in infrastructure to adapt \n     to the impacts of climate change, particularly those impacts \n     already affecting the United States;\n       (5) residential water demand can be reduced by 25 to 40 \n     percent using existing, cost-effective technologies that also \n     can reduce the water bills of consumers by hundreds of \n     dollars per year; and\n       (6) water and energy use are inseparable activities, and \n     supplying and treating water consumes around 4 percent of the \n     electricity of the United States, and electricity makes up 75 \n     percent of the cost of processing and delivering municipal \n     water.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF ADMINISTRATOR.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``Administrator'' means the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to authorize grants for the creation, update, or \nadaption of open textbooks, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, technology has transformed the way we \nwork, the way we entertain ourselves, and the way we understand the \nworld around us. But one area of our lives that has been more resistant \nto technological change has been the way we educate our children. And \nyet I see tremendous potential in technology to improve access to \neducation and decrease its often high costs. One example of this is \nopen educational resources. Today, I am introducing a bill that will \nprovide a short-term federal investment in the development of one type \nof open educational resource--college textbooks. I believe this \ninvestment will improve learning in our college classrooms and help \nbring down the cost of college for students.\n  The growth of the Internet has enabled the creation and sharing of \nopen content. A teacher or professor in Illinois can create a lecture, \na lesson, a book, or an entire curriculum and share it online. A \nteacher across the country or even across the world can access that \neducational material, adapt it, and use it in his or her classroom. \nMore and more often educators are utilizing technology in this way to \nimprove student learning.\n  The President recognizes the potential of this new technology. He has \nproposed a significant new Federal investment in the creation of online \nopen-source courses for community colleges. These courses will be made \nfreely available online and widely distributed so that all colleges can \nmake use of them. I believe this initiative will help make higher \neducation more accessible for students, especially non-traditional \nstudents or students living in rural areas far away from brick-and-\nmortar institutions. Because the courses will be available for free, \nthe initiative will also help bring down the high cost of a college \neducation for students struggling to pay.\n  I think we can go even further. The high cost of textbooks continues \nto be a barrier for many students struggling to pay for college. The \nCollege Board reported that for the 2007 to 2008 school year, students \nspent an estimated $805 to $1,229 on books and supplies. A little over \na year ago, the Higher Education Opportunity Act was signed into law. \nThat law includes provisions that I authored to increase transparency \nin college textbook pricing for professors and students. I hope that \nnew law will help decrease the high cost of textbooks when these \nprovisions are enacted next year, but there is more that the Federal \nGovernment can do to provide cheap alternatives to professors and \nstudents.\n  The bill I am introducing today, the Open College Textbook Act, will \ncreate a grant program for the creation of freely-available, online \nopen college textbooks. Making high-quality open textbooks freely \navailable to the general public would significantly lower college \ntextbook costs. Under my bill, the Secretary of Education would award \ngrants to colleges, professors, nonprofit organizations or for-profit \ncompanies to create introductory-level college textbooks. Once \nproduced, these books would be posted on an easily-accessible website \nand made available to students, professors, and the public for free. \nThe result would be a set of high-quality college textbooks that could \nbe adopted in any introductory course at any college in the country. \nThis would be a limited investment of Federal grant funding over just a \nfew years, not a permanent federal funding stream. The choice would \nultimately still be the professor's. Each professor could choose \nwhether to assign the open textbook to his class, but I hope that he \nwould seriously consider this high-quality, free online option that \nwould save his students $150 or $200 each at the college bookstore.\n  Along with the clear cost benefits, open textbooks can also improve \nteaching and learning. The content of an open textbook can be adapted, \nsupplemented, and personalized by professors for their course. Instead \nof framing a course around a textbook, a professor can modify an open \ntextbook to fit the needs of a particular course or group of students. \nWhen professors take advantage of the flexibility and adaptability of \nopen textbooks, student learning improves.\n  The use of Federal funding for textbooks and curricula is not new. \nFor years, the National Science Foundation has been awarding grants to \nprofessors for research into the improvement of learning in the \nclassroom. Sometimes these grants have resulted in the creation of \ntextbooks, which the author can then license for profit to a commercial \npublisher. I believe textbooks created with Federal funding should be \nmade available for free so that all students and professors can benefit \nfrom our investment. This bill would also require that all future \nFederal grants that lead to the creation of a textbook or curriculum \nfor use in the classroom be licensed openly and made freely available \nto all educators for their use.\n  Over the past decade, I have watched textbook publishers use \ntechnology to drive up the cost of textbooks through unnecessary online \nsupplements and CD-ROMs. It is time that we use the potential of \ntechnology to improve college access, learning, and affordability for \nall students. I believe the Open College Textbook Act that I am \nintroducing today will accomplish that goal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1714\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Open College Textbook Act of \n     2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The growth of the Internet has enabled the creation and \n     sharing of open content, including open educational \n     resources.\n       (2) The President has proposed a new, significant Federal \n     investment in the creation of online open-source courses for \n     community colleges that will make learning more accessible, \n     adaptable, and affordable for students.\n       (3) The President has challenged the United States with a \n     goal of having the highest college graduation rate in the \n     world by 2020.\n       (4) More than 80 percent of the 23,000,000 jobs that will \n     be created in the next 10 years will require postsecondary \n     education, but only 36 percent of all 18- to 24-year olds are \n     currently enrolled in postsecondary education.\n       (5) The high cost of college textbooks continues to be a \n     barrier for many students in achieving higher education, and \n     according to the Advisory Committee on Student Financial \n     Assistance, 200,000 qualified students fail to enroll in \n     college each year due to cost.\n       (6) The College Board reported that for the 2007-2008 \n     academic year an average student spent an estimated $805 to \n     $1,229 on college books and supplies.\n       (7) Making high quality open textbooks freely available to \n     the general public could significantly lower college textbook \n     costs and increase accessibility to such education materials.\n       (8) Open textbooks can improve learning and teaching by \n     creating course materials that are more flexible, adaptable, \n     and accessible through the use of technology.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 285\n\n       Whereas the use of the Internet in the United States, to \n     communicate, conduct business, or generate commerce that \n     benefits the overall United States economy, is ubiquitous;\n       Whereas many people use the Internet in the United States \n     to communicate with family and friends, manage finances and \n     pay bills, access educational opportunities, shop at home, \n     participate in online entertainment and games, and stay \n     informed of news and current events;\n       Whereas United States small businesses, which employ a \n     significant fraction of the private workforce, increasingly \n     rely on the Internet to manage their businesses, expand their \n     customer reach, and enhance the management of their supply \n     chain;\n       Whereas nearly all public schools in the United States have \n     Internet access to enhance children's education, with a \n     significant percentage of instructional rooms connected to \n     the Internet to enhance children's education by providing \n     access to educational online content and encouraging self-\n     initiative to discover research resources;\n       Whereas the number of children who connect to the Internet \n     continues to rise, and teaching children of all ages to \n     become good cyber-citizens through safe, secure, and ethical \n     online behaviors and practices is essential to protect their \n     computer systems and potentially their physical safety;\n       Whereas the growth and popularity of social networking \n     websites has attracted millions of teenagers, providing \n     access to a range of valuable services, making it all the \n     more important to teach young users how to avoid potential \n     threats like cyber bullies, predators, and identity thieves \n     they may come across while using such services;\n       Whereas cybersecurity is a critical part of the United \n     States national security and economic security;\n       Whereas the United States critical infrastructures and \n     economy rely on the secure and reliable operation of \n     information networks to support the United States military, \n     civilian government, energy, telecommunications, financial \n     services, transportation, health care, and emergency response \n     systems;\n       Whereas Internet users and information infrastructure \n     owners and operators face an increasing threat of malicious \n     crime and fraud attacks through viruses, worms, Trojans, and \n     unwanted programs such as spyware, adware, hacking tools, and \n     password stealers, that are frequent and fast in propagation, \n     are costly to repair, and may disable entire systems;\n       Whereas millions of records containing personally \n     identifiable information have\n\n[[Page S9852]]\n\n     been lost, stolen, or breached, threatening the security and \n     financial well-being of United States citizens;\n       Whereas consumers face significant financial and personal \n     privacy losses due to personally identifiable information \n     being more exposed to theft and fraud than ever before;\n       Whereas national organizations, policymakers, government \n     agencies, private sector companies, nonprofit institutions, \n     schools, academic organizations, consumers, and the media \n     recognize the need to increase awareness of cybersecurity and \n     the need for enhanced cybersecurity in the United States;\n       Whereas coordination between the numerous Federal agencies \n     involved in cybersecurity efforts is essential to securing \n     the cyber infrastructure of the United States;\n       Whereas the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace, \n     published in February 2003, recommends a comprehensive \n     national awareness program to empower all people in the \n     United States, including businesses, the general workforce, \n     and the general population, to secure their own parts of \n     cyberspace;\n       Whereas the White House's Cyberspace Policy Review, \n     published in May 2009, recommends that the government \n     initiate a national public awareness and education campaign \n     to promote cybersecurity; and\n       Whereas the National Cyber Security Alliance, the Multi-\n     State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, the Department \n     of Homeland Security, and other organizations working to \n     improve cybersecurity in the United States have designated \n     October 2009 as the sixth annual National Cybersecurity \n     Awareness Month which serves to educate the people of the \n     United States about the importance of cybersecurity: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Cybersecurity \n     Awareness Month, as designated by the National Cyber Security \n     Alliance, the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis \n     Center, the Department of Homeland Security, and other \n     organizations working to improve cybersecurity in the United \n     States;\n       (2) continues to work with Federal agencies, businesses, \n     educational institutions, and other organizations to enhance \n     the state of cybersecurity in the United States; and\n       (3) congratulates the National Cyber Security Alliance, the \n     Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, the \n     Department of Homeland Security, and other organizations \n     working to improve cybersecurity in the United States on the \n     sixth anniversary of the National Cybersecurity Month during \n     October 2009.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I rise to submit, along with \nSenators Rockefeller, Gillibrand, Carper, Mikulski, Lieberman, Collins, \nReid, Levin, Bennett, Snowe, Landrieu, Hatch, Bayh, and Voinovich, a \nresolution supporting National Cyber Security Awareness Month, which \nwill be held next month.\n  We in the Congress are trying to make cybersecurity a priority issue, \nbut much work remains to be done. A critical first step is to raise \nawareness and public understanding of the cyber threat and steps that \ncan be taken to improve cybersecurity. This is true across Government \nand private industry, but the Government should play a leadership role.\n  Each year for the last 5 years, the National Cyber Security Alliance, \nthe Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, the Department \nof Homeland Security, and other organizations working to improve \ncybersecurity in the U.S. have designated October as National Cyber \nSecurity Awareness Month.\n  Today, I am submitting a resolution to officially designate National \nCyber Security Awareness Month again this October.\n  The goal is to educate and empower Internet users to take simple \nsteps to safeguard themselves from the latest online threats and \nrespond to cyber crime and to bring Federal agencies, businesses, \neducational institutions, and other organizations together to encourage \ndevelopment and implementation of cybersecurity best practices.\n  Cybersecurity is a serious national security and economic security \nchallenge of great complexity, deserving of increased attention from \nthe Congress. As the Senate prepares to consider important \ncybersecurity legislation to provide new authorities and clarify \nprivacy and legal issues, a few cyber-related observations and concerns \ncan be mentioned now.\n  First, I am troubled by the lack of situational awareness on the \nopportunities, activities, and identities of cyber thieves or potential \nattackers on U.S. information networks. This is a serious weakness and \na source of frustration for those responsible for oversight and \nstrategic decision-making. Unfortunately, it will not be easy to remedy \nthis because there are disincentives to report cyber intrusions and \nvulnerabilities in the U.S. Government and private sector. This must \nchange. It must change quickly so that cybersecurity leaders can make \nwell-informed decisions and respond to problems in real time.\n  Next, it is clear that cybersecurity activities must be conducted \nwith strong congressional oversight that will demand thorough Executive \nbranch planning before billions of dollars are authorized and \nappropriated. In addition, there must be a rigorous analysis of the \ngovernment's use of legal authorities for national cybersecurity \nmissions that preserve the reasonable privacy expectations of \nAmericans. The government's role must be well-defined as its activities \ninvolving the Internet evolve. I appreciate the White House's effort to \nbe transparent and open with Congress on this issue this year, and have \nhigh expectations for continued healthy cooperation.\n  We need to have those entities with cybersecurity responsibilities \ncollaborating across the Government. That means homeland security, \nintelligence, military, foreign policy, law enforcement, and other \ncomponents involved in cybersecurity must be working together. The \nPresident has begun, through his cybersecurity review earlier this \nyear, to provide a clear vision, strategic direction, and effective \nintegration of the wide range of cybersecurity activities. However, \nmore progress in this area is needed.\n  I was pleased when President Obama made a major address on \ncybersecurity at the end of May, but that strong first step has been \nfollowed by a four-month delay in appointing a White House \ncybersecurity coordinator. Until this position is filled, it will be \ndifficult to have effective leadership and coordination on governmental \ncybersecurity efforts.\n  The Federal Government's communication strategy concerning \ncybersecurity must be improved as well. There should be a new plan on \nthe best way to communicate the national cybersecurity policy to the \npublic. Though some elements must be classified, it is important that \nthe American people understand the Government's basic role in helping \nto secure information networks. The general rules and expectations for \nGovernment involvement, and how these may affect privacy, must be \nclearly explained.\n  In addition, the Government must consider that effective \ncybersecurity inside the U.S. will require stronger diplomatic efforts \nand an international agreement on what will and will not be tolerated \nin cyberspace. An international framework on cyber warfare, much like \ninternational conventions on traditional warfare, is needed to govern \nthis rapidly growing field.\n  I also believe there should be a significant emphasis on long-term \nissues such as cyber research and development, recruiting cyber experts \ninto government, and cyber education and training. In particular, \nrecent studies sponsored by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \nhave concluded that the Intelligence Community must dramatically \nincrease funding for research and development in order for our cyber \ndefenses to be effective in the future.\n  The online world is moving quickly, with cutting-edge technology \nexpertise spread across the globe, and the U.S. cannot presume a clear-\ncut technology advantage as it has in other areas of national security. \nI recommend a balanced portfolio approach that includes a nationally \ncoordinated program of long-term, high-risk research aimed at \nrevolutionary breakthroughs, sustained even when faced with near-term \nbudget pressures. I strongly support a rebalancing of the Federal \nGovernment's Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative budget to \naddress these concerns.\n  Finally, as a step beyond the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity \nInitiative's focus on securing Federal Government information networks, \nI am highly concerned about protecting the U.S. critical \ninfrastructure. For example, the country's electric power grid, \ncommunications systems, and financial infrastructure are all critical \nto our way of life yet unacceptably vulnerable to cyber attack. The \nGovernment and the private sector must work together to share more \neffectively cyber threat and vulnerability information, and the \nadministration and\n\n[[Page S9853]]\n\nthe Congress must work together to determine the best mix of mandates, \nincentives, and other tools to improve critical infrastructure \nsecurity.\n  Fortunately, there is an increasing level of interest and debate on \ncybersecurity issues in Congress and around the country. The Senate \nIntelligence Committee, which I have the privilege of chairing, has \ninvested significant time assessing the cyber threat to our country and \npotential Government responses through the following initiatives: \nscores of personal meetings and staff briefings with government, \nprivate sector, academic, and nonprofit thought-leaders; six cyber \nhearings in the last 2 years; four 6-month studies by the Committee's \nTechnical Advisory Group; a new, balanced oversight system for federal \ngovernment cybersecurity programs, as proposed in the fiscal year 2010 \nintelligence authorization bill; and regular outreach to other \ncongressional committees.\n  I want to thank my distinguished colleagues, Senators Rockefeller, \nGillibrand, Carper, Mikulski, Lieberman, Collins, Reid, Levin, Bennett, \nSnowe, Landrieu, Hatch, Voinovich, and Bayh, for cosponsoring this \nresolution and for their leadership on this issue. I look forward to \nworking with them and other members of Congress to improve our \ncybersecurity in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/24/senate-section/article/S9853-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 286--EXPRESSING CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILIES OF THE \n  INDIVIDUALS KILLED DURING UNUSUAL STORMS AND FLOODS IN THE STATE OF \n  GEORGIA BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 18 AND SEPTEMBER 21, 2009, AND EXPRESSING \n GRATITUDE TO ALL OF THE EMERGENCY PERSONNEL WHO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH \n   UNYIELDING DETERMINATION TO MEET THE NEEDS OF GEORGIA'S RESIDENTS\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON (for himself and Mr. Chambliss) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 286\n\n       Whereas beginning on September 18, 2009, the State of \n     Georgia was hit by days of unusually strong storms that \n     resulted in downpours and flooding;\n       Whereas numerous Georgia rivers and creeks, including the \n     Chattooga and Chattahoochee Rivers and the Chickamauga Creek, \n     swollen by days of rain, overtopped their banks, creating a \n     dangerous and deadly situation for nearby residents;\n       Whereas the storms and floods took human lives;\n       Whereas the floodwater destroyed homes, flooded roadways, \n     including major highways, compromised drinking water, \n     severely damaged plumbing systems, and caused significant \n     damage to homes and businesses;\n       Whereas on September 21, 2009, Georgia Governor Sonny \n     Perdue declared a state of emergency in 17 counties, \n     including Carroll, Catoosa, Chattooga, Cherokee, Clayton, \n     Cobb, Crawford, DeKalb, Douglas, Forsyth, Fulton, Gwinnett, \n     Newton, Paulding, Rockdale, Stephens, and Walker Counties;\n       Whereas the National Weather Service estimated that between \n     15 and 22 inches of rain fell in the metropolitan Atlanta \n     counties of Gwinnett, Douglas, and Paulding between September \n     18 and September 21, 2009;\n       Whereas the rains broke a 130-year-old record at \n     Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport;\n       Whereas hundreds of Georgians were evacuated from their \n     homes, and more than 300 people sought refuge in shelters;\n       Whereas Governor Perdue estimated that more than 1,000 \n     residences were seriously flooded;\n       Whereas the weather closed schools in several counties;\n       Whereas as many as tens of thousands of people were without \n     power in metropolitan Atlanta;\n       Whereas search and rescue operations functioned in several \n     counties where the water continued to rise;\n       Whereas the Georgia Emergency Management Agency coordinated \n     with local emergency personnel and worked tirelessly to \n     protect human lives and rescue those threatened by the \n     floods;\n       Whereas the Georgia Emergency Management Agency facilitated \n     requests for assistance from people and first responders all \n     across the State of Georgia;\n       Whereas the Georgia Emergency Management Agency and other \n     first responders acted valiantly in life-safety response \n     operations, including delivering sandbags and rescuing people \n     trapped in their cars and homes from the floodwater;\n       Whereas the Federal Emergency Management Agency activated \n     its national and regional response coordination centers and \n     worked closely with the State of Georgia to monitor the \n     response efforts and identify and respond to any immediate \n     emergency needs for the people and communities of the State \n     that were impacted by the devastating floods; and\n       Whereas volunteers gave their time to help ensure that \n     evacuees were sheltered, clothed, fed, and comforted through \n     this traumatic event: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) offers its deepest sympathy and condolences to the \n     families of those who lost their lives in the flooding in the \n     State of Georgia;\n       (2) expresses its condolences to the families who lost \n     their homes and other property in the floods;\n       (3) expresses gratitude and appreciation to the people of \n     the State of Georgia and the surrounding States, who worked \n     to protect people from the rising floodwaters;\n       (4) expresses its support as the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency responds to the needs of the people and \n     communities affected by the flooding; and\n       (5) honors the emergency responders, within and beyond \n     metropolitan Atlanta and the State of Georgia, for their \n     bravery and sacrifice during this tragedy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/24/senate-section/article/S9853-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9853-S9854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 287--HONORING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ENACTMENT \n OF THE DRUG PRICE COMPETITION AND PATENT TERM RESTORATION ACT OF 1984 \n                         (THE HATCH-WAXMAN ACT)\n\n  Mr. BROWN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 287\n\n       Whereas on September 24, 1984, the Drug Price Competition \n     and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-417; \n     98 Stat. 1585), commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, was \n     signed into law by President Ronald Reagan, at which time \n     President Reagan indicated that generic drugs might save \n     American consumers $1,000,000,000 over the next 10 years;\n       Whereas this landmark law created the regulatory mechanism \n     under which the Food and Drug Administration approves safe \n     and affordable generic drugs;\n       Whereas each year for the past quarter century, the generic \n     pharmaceutical industry has delivered billions of dollars in \n     savings on the purchase of prescription drugs, far exceeding \n     the original estimate;\n       Whereas a May 2009 report showed that during the preceding \n     10-year period, the use of generic drugs has saved the \n     American health care system more than $734,000,000,000, with \n     the most-recent annual average exceeding $121,000,000,000;\n       Whereas generic drugs accounted for more than 72 percent of \n     all prescription drugs dispensed, yet accounted for only 17 \n     percent of the spending on all prescription drugs, a \n     differential that reflects the dramatically lower prices paid \n     for generic drugs, which not only reduces consumer and \n     taxpayer spending but also increases patient access to needed \n     medicines; and\n       Whereas while the Hatch-Waxman Act does not have an \n     explicit pathway for approval by the Food and Drug \n     Administration of lower-priced versions of cutting-edge \n     biologic medicines, which account for a rapidly growing \n     portion of prescription medicine spending, the Act does \n     provide a solid framework for such a pathway: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of Senate that--\n       (1) enactment of the Hatch-Waxman Act (Public Law 98-417; \n     98 Stat. 1585) in 1984 served to create the modern generic \n     pharmaceutical industry, which has provided consumers with \n     access to affordable drugs, yielding significant health and \n     economic benefits for the Nation's health care system;\n       (2) Senator Orrin Hatch and Representative Henry Waxman \n     deserve the Nation's gratitude for authoring and championing \n     this landmark bipartisan legislation; and\n       (3) Congress should build on the work of these dedicated \n     policymakers and enact legislation to create a pathway for \n     approval by the Food and Drug Administration of safe and \n     affordable generic versions of biologic medicines.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \ncommemorating the 25th Anniversary of the Drug Price Competition and \nPatent Term Restoration Act, more commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman \nAct.\n  This historic legislation--which was signed into law exactly 25 years \nago today, on September 24, 1984--marked the culmination of months of \nlengthy and often contentious debate over how to foster pharmaceutical \ninnovation while at the same time encouraging competition from \naffordable generic prescription drugs.\n  Guided by my good friends and colleagues Representative Henry Waxman \nof California and Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, Congress delivered a \nbill that struck the right balance between innovation and access, and \nput in place a new regulatory pathway to bring safe and effective \ngeneric medicines to market.\n  I doubt that anyone involved in the passage of Hatch-Waxman could \nhave envisioned a quarter century ago the\n\n[[Page S9854]]\n\nmagnitude of savings and the significant boost to new drug innovation \nthat this bill has delivered.\n  According to a May 2009 report of IMS data, the use of FDA-approved \ngeneric medicines has saved the U.S. healthcare system approximately \n$734 billion over the past 10 years.\n  Moreover, patients around the world can get needed medication that \nthey would not be able to afford except for access to lower-cost \ngenerics.\n  At the same time, price competition from generics has acted to spur a \ndramatic increase in new drug research and development.\n  In short, the Hatch-Waxman Act has delivered above and beyond the \nintended result.\n  I urge my colleagues to view the success of this landmark legislation \nas an indicator of what we can accomplish in the field of biologic \nmedicines.\n  Biologics are the most promising treatments available for diseases \nsuch as cancer, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's, but they are \nexpensive, often costing between $20,000 and $100,000 a year.\n  There is no explicit pathway for Food and Drug Administration \napproval of generic versions of these medicines under the Hatch-Waxman \nlaw; however, there is bipartisan agreement that we need to create one. \nTo do that, we need to focus on our goals and bridge our differences.\n  The time to do that is now.\n  Biologic drugs are the fast growing component of prescription drug \nspending.\n  These drugs are expected to make up 50 percent of the pharmaceutical \nmarketplace by 2020, but their high prices keep them out of reach for \nfar too many patients and place an increasingly heavy financial burden \non consumers, on businesses, and on taxpayers.\n  In 2007, the top six biologics accounted for more than $7 billion of \nthe nearly $17 billion in direct prescription drug spending by \nMedicare.\n  That figure will continue to grow, and the amount taxpayers pay \ndepends on whether Medicare can access lower-priced biogenerics or is \nforced to pay brand-name prices year after year after year.\n  Biogenerics hold the promise of making life-saving medicines \navailable to all patients at an affordable cost.\n  With the explosion in biologics, we have a new generation of \nlifesaving medicines--and a new opportunity to reprise the historic \nvictory Senator Orrin Hatch and Representative Henry Waxman achieved 25 \nyears ago today.\n  With biologic use and prices spiraling upward, we have no: time to \nlose.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/24/senate-section/article/S9854-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2548.

The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1599) to amend title 36, United States Code, to \n     include in the federal charter of the Reserve Officers \n     Association leadership positions newly added in its \n     constitution and bylaws.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate will \npass the Reserve Officers Association Modernization Act of 2009. I \nthank Senator Chambliss and Senator Pryor, cosponsors of this \nlegislation and chairs of the U.S. Reserve Caucus, for their hard work \nand support of this legislation.\n  This legislation makes several updates to the charter of the Reserve \nOfficers Association, ROA, to more accurately reflect the \norganization's current operation. First, it adds the position of \n``president elect'' to its constitution and bylaws. Additionally, under \nthe legislation, the national executive committee is expanded to \ninclude three representatives from each of the seven branches of the \nuniformed services. This bill makes the first changes to the ROA \ncharter since 1998 and will enable ROA to continue its good work.\n  Since its founding in 1922, the ROA has worked on behalf of the \nNational Guard and Reserves and their families. For over 85 years, ROA \nhas remained committed to its original mission, to ``support and \npromote the development and execution of a military policy for the \nUnited States that will provide adequate National security.'' The \nReserve Officers Association represents the Reserve components officers \nfor the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, the Air and \nArmy National Guard, Public Health Service, and the officers of the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n  As chair of the Senate National Guard Caucus, I have worked closely \nwith groups like the Reserve Officers Association, ROA, to ensure that \nthe National Guard and Reserves have access to more affordable health \ncare, a greater influence in the military, adequate training facilities \nand supplies, and shorter troop deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nThe National Guard and Reserves provide an invaluable contribution to \nour Nation's military, our national security, and disaster relief \nefforts, and it is vital that we continue to support their needs.\n  The Reserve Officers Association has provided a voice to the men and \nwomen that serve our country in the National Guard and Reserves. I am \nproud that today the Senate has demonstrated its support for the brave \nmembers of the National Guard and Reserves by passing this legislation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread the third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and that any statements \nrelating to the matter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1599) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1599\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, tonight the Senate has approved a 3-month \nextension of the FAA Reauthorization Act.\n  While I understand the importance of passing a short-term extension \nof this law, I am disappointed that the full Senate has yet to act on \nthe FAA reauthorization bill that was ordered reported by the Senate \nCommerce Committee in July. That bill, the FAA Air Transportation \nModernization and Safety Improvement Act, includes long overdue \nlegislation known as the Airline Passenger Bill of Rights.\n  Too often, airline passengers are trapped on airplanes without basic \nneeds such as food, water, medicine, working restrooms or proper cabin \nventilation.\n  Just last month, passengers on a flight from Houston to Minneapolis-\nSt. Paul were diverted to Rochester, MN, and forced to spend the night \ntrapped in a small commuter airplane.\n  Two weeks later, a flight carrying more than 100 passengers bound for \nMinneapolis was forced to sit on the tarmac at JFK airport in New York \nfor 6 hours before finally departing. The passengers, including parents \ntraveling with infants, were forced to endure overflowing bathrooms and \nhad no real food or water to speak of.\n  These are not isolated examples of a few airlines with ineffective \npolicies. USA Today recently reported that since January 2007, 200,000 \ndomestic passengers on 3,000 flights have been stranded in airplanes on \nthe tarmac for 3 hours or more.\n  This is unacceptable. We must pass the Airline Passenger Bill of \nRights this year--before the 3-month extension of the FAA \nreauthorization bill expires. The Passenger Bill of Rights, which I \nhave introduced with Senator Olympia Snowe, would require airlines to \noffer passengers the option of safely leaving a plane they have boarded \nonce that plane has sat on the ground for 3 hours.\n  Americans deserve a safe and efficient aviation system. We cannot \nafford to wait another year to pass long overdue legislation that will \nmake our skies safer and protect passengers from excessive tarmac \ndelays. No American should ever be forced to spend the night in a plane \non an airport tarmac. We can prevent this and we must.\n  I know the Senate is working to address many important challenges at \nthis time. But, we cannot lose sight of the aviation challenges facing \nour country.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to S. Res. 286.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 286) expressing condolences to the \n     families of the individuals killed during unusual storms and \n     floods in the State of Georgia between September 18 and \n     September 21, 2009, and expressing gratitude to all of the \n     emergency personnel who continue to work with unyielding \n     determination to meet the needs of Georgia's residents.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I come to the floor with a heavy heart \nto express condolences to those in my home State of Georgia as well as \nothers across the southern part of our country who have been affected \nby the recent devastating floods.\n  It is hard to imagine that 1 year ago we in Georgia were in the \nfourth year of extensive drought. Yet today across the metro Atlanta \narea and throughout north Georgia, we have gone from a water crisis in \nthe last couple of years to rising waters that have transformed \nneighborhoods into rivers, ballfields into lakes, and basements into \ndank pools. Rafts and kayaks have taken the place of cars in streets. \nIn many areas, the only dry places are rooftops and treetops.\n\n  For 4 days and 4 nights, beginning September 18, water poured from \nthe sky in torrents, and rose from rivers, creeks, and the saturated \nground to claim lives and livelihoods, worldly possessions, and \ntreasured memories in flooded basements, attics, driveways, and fields.\n  The Chattooga and Chattahoochee Rivers and Chickamauga Creek, swollen \nby days of rain, topped their banks, with deadly results. The \nChattahoochee crested at 30 feet, some 15 feet above flood stage.\n  Nearly 1,000 families have lost their homes to flooding they never \nexpected to see in their lifetimes. Others found their businesses \nsubmerged. Because most are not in floodplains, they do not have flood \ninsurance. Many have lost everything they own during already tough \neconomic times.\n  In addition to homes and businesses, the rising waters destroyed \nroadways, swept away bridges, tainted drinking water, and damaged sewer \nsystems. It will take months, if not years, to repair the damage.\n  Even more heart-wrenching is the fact that nine Georgians and one \nresident of Alabama, just across the State line, have perished in the \nrushing waters.\n  When all was said and done, more than 20 inches of rain fell on \nGeorgia, breaking a 130-year-old record at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson \nInternational Airport. More than 30,000 people were without power in \nthe metro Atlanta area. The Red Cross sheltered hundreds rendered \nhomeless by the floods.\n  However, the worst situations often bring out the best in people. \nLocal first responders and emergency personnel worked tirelessly to \nprotect lives and property and to rescue those trapped by the waters. \nTheir bravery and sacrifice is exemplary.\n  Also, the Georgia Emergency Management Agency worked around the clock \nto facilitate requests for assistance. The Federal Emergency Management \nAgency worked closely with the State to anticipate and respond to \nemergency needs, and countless volunteers gave time and energy to \nensure that evacuees were sheltered, clothed, fed, and comforted. They \nall have Georgians' and my personal deepest, most heartfelt gratitude.\n  I would like to express my sympathy to the families of those who have \nlost loved ones, homes, and livelihoods. To that end, Senator Isakson \nand I have submitted this resolution, S. Res. 286, expressing \ncondolences to those affected and appreciation to emergency responders \nand others who helped them. I urge my colleagues to support the \nresolution tonight.\n  On September 21, Gov. Sonny Perdue declared a state of emergency in \n17 counties. I understand President Obama called Governor Perdue \nTuesday night to discuss the needs of Georgians and assured the \nGovernor that his request for Federal aid would receive prompt \nattention. To that end, today we received notification that 4 of the 17 \naffected counties have been declared disaster areas by President Obama, \nand I am certain the others, when the processing is completed, will \nlikewise be declared disaster areas.\n  Tomorrow, Vice President Biden will accompany Senator Isakson and \nmyself to Georgia to take a firsthand look at what is going on.\n  Mr. President, we are literally underwater. Georgia and other parts \nof the Southeast need the assistance of the Federal Government in this \ncase, as well as the State government. To that end, we are seeing the \nresponse in a very appropriate way.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 286) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 286\n\n       Whereas beginning on September 18, 2009, the State of \n     Georgia was hit by days of unusually strong storms that \n     resulted in downpours and flooding;\n       Whereas numerous Georgia rivers and creeks, including the \n     Chattooga and Chattahoochee Rivers and the Chickamauga Creek, \n     swollen by days of rain, overtopped their banks, creating a \n     dangerous and deadly situation for nearby residents;\n       Whereas the storms and floods took human lives;\n       Whereas the floodwater destroyed homes, flooded roadways, \n     including major highways, compromised drinking water, \n     severely damaged plumbing systems, and caused significant \n     damage to homes and businesses;\n       Whereas on September 21, 2009, Georgia Governor Sonny \n     Perdue declared a state of emergency in 17 counties, \n     including Carroll, Catoosa, Chattooga, Cherokee, Clayton, \n     Cobb, Crawford, DeKalb, Douglas, Forsyth, Fulton, Gwinnett, \n     Newton, Paulding, Rockdale, Stephens, and Walker Counties;\n       Whereas the National Weather Service estimated that between \n     15 and 22 inches of rain fell in the metropolitan Atlanta \n     counties of Gwinnett, Douglas, and Paulding between September \n     18 and September 21, 2009;\n       Whereas the rains broke a 130-year-old record at \n     Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport;\n       Whereas hundreds of Georgians were evacuated from their \n     homes, and more than 300 people sought refuge in shelters;\n       Whereas Governor Perdue estimated that more than 1,000 \n     residences were seriously flooded;\n       Whereas the weather closed schools in several counties;\n       Whereas as many as tens of thousands of people were without \n     power in metropolitan Atlanta;\n       Whereas search and rescue operations functioned in several \n     counties where the water continued to rise;\n       Whereas the Georgia Emergency Management Agency coordinated \n     with local emergency personnel and worked tirelessly to \n     protect human lives and rescue those threatened by the \n     floods;\n       Whereas the Georgia Emergency Management Agency facilitated \n     requests for assistance from people and first responders all \n     across the State of Georgia;\n       Whereas the Georgia Emergency Management Agency and other \n     first responders acted valiantly in life-safety response \n     operations, including delivering sandbags and rescuing people \n     trapped in their cars and homes from the floodwater;\n       Whereas the Federal Emergency Management Agency activated \n     its national and regional response coordination centers and \n     worked closely with the State of Georgia to monitor the \n     response efforts and identify and respond to any immediate \n     emergency needs for the people and communities of the State \n     that were impacted by the devastating floods; and\n       Whereas volunteers gave their time to help ensure that \n     evacuees were sheltered, clothed, fed, and comforted through \n     this traumatic event: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) offers its deepest sympathy and condolences to the \n     families of those who lost their lives in the flooding in the \n     State of Georgia;\n       (2) expresses its condolences to the families who lost \n     their homes and other property in the floods;\n       (3) expresses gratitude and appreciation to the people of \n     the State of Georgia and the surrounding States, who worked \n     to protect people from the rising floodwaters;\n       (4) expresses its support as the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency responds to the needs of the people and \n     communities affected by the flooding; and\n       (5) honors the emergency responders, within and beyond \n     metropolitan Atlanta and the State of Georgia, for their \n     bravery and sacrifice during this tragedy.\n\n[[Page S9859]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/24/senate-section/article/S9859-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    NOMINATION OF JONATHAN B.

Mr. President, earlier today--actually, at 1:43 p.m. \ntoday--Senator Tom Udall, the Senator from New Mexico, joined the 100-\nhour presiding club of the 111th Congress. He is the third member of \nthe freshman class to achieve this goal. These are individuals who \npreside over the Senate for 100 hours.\n  We have a tradition that those Senators who devote so much time to \npresiding in the Senate are given what we call a golden gavel. It is a \nvery nice presentation, very nice keepsake, and we will make that \npresentation at our next caucus. I appreciate very much the work of Tom \nUdall, devoting his time to making sure the proceedings on the floor \nare in keeping with the rules of the Senate, and we welcome him to this \nmost prestigious club--a member of the golden gavel society.\n  I believe the Presiding Officer is a member of the golden gavel \nsociety.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Presiding Officer, were you the first to get it? \nIn your capacity as a Senator from the State of Alaska, what is the \nanswer?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from the State of \nAlaska, the answer is yes.\n  Mr. REID. It was a close battle, but you won.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/24/senate-section/article/S9859-5", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2009\n\n  Mr. REID.
