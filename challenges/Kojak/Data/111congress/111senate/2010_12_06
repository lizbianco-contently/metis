Mr. President, as far as lameduck sessions of the Senate \ngo, our agenda is rather ambitious, and the session itself is \nrelatively long. It did not have to be this way. We have tried many \ntimes this Congress to tackle each of the priorities on our agenda. \nEach time we have tried, the minority has tried to shut down the \nSenate. Republicans ground the Senate to a halt and forced endless \nhours of inactivity. That is why we were here voting on Sunday--on \nSaturday; I am sorry. Thank goodness it was not on Sunday. That is why \nwe will still be here another few weeks.\n  We have a long to-do list. But these priorities are not mere \nleftovers. They are critical to our economy and our national security, \nto our families and our country's future, and we will resolve them \nbefore we adjourn.\n  We have to give first responders--our communities' firefighters, \npolice officers, and emergency medical personnel--the same job \nprotections that other workers enjoy.\n  We need to give seniors and disabled veterans some relief, which will \nalso benefit our economy as a whole. The cost-of-living adjustment for \nSocial Security recipients is a question of both fairness and \neconomics.\n  We will again fight for the DREAM Act. When it passes, millions of \nchildren who grew up as Americans will be able to get the education \nthey need to contribute to our economy. Many who have volunteered to \ndefend our country will no longer have to fear being deported.\n  We will give the heroes of 9/11 long overdue help. Thousands of first \nresponders who rushed to Ground Zero on 9/11 got terribly sick from the \ntoxins that were present. Everyone should agree they should not have to \nwait any\n\n[[Page S8540]]\n\nlonger than they already have for the health care and compensation they \ndeserve.\n  We will protect middle-class families from a tax hike.\n  We will ratify the bipartisan START treaty to make America safer.\n  We have to confirm the enormous backlog of qualified nominees to the \nbench and other important positions. For example, there are more than \n30 judicial nominees ready to come to a vote. Most were voted out of \nthe Judiciary Committee without a single vote against them. They have \nbeen waiting for a long time to fill these important seats and serve \ntheir country. It is time we let them.\n  We are also going to repeal the discriminatory don't ask, don't tell \nrule. We are going to match our policy with our principles and finally \nsay that in America everyone who steps up to serve our country should \nbe welcomed.\n  Republicans know they do not have the votes to take this repeal out \nof the Defense authorization bill, so they are holding up the whole \nbill. But when they refuse to debate it, they also hold up a well-\ndeserved raise for our troops, better health care for our troops and \ntheir families, equipment such as MRAP vehicles that keep our troops \nsafe, and other critical wartime efforts in Afghanistan and \ncounterterrorism efforts around the world.\n  Obstruction has consequences. None of the issues on this long list is \nnew. Neither is the minority's effort to keep the Senate from working \nand keeping Senators from doing our jobs.\n  It is time to roll up our sleeves--not dig in our heels. My hope for \nthe final weeks of this year is that Republicans finally will realize \nwe all have much more to gain by working together than working against \neach other.\n  Mr. President, would the Chair announce morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "06", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/06/senate-section/article/S8540-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, just 3 days ago, a bipartisan majority of \nthe members of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and \nReform endorsed a package of proposals to reposition our Nation on a \nmore responsible fiscal course.\n  I wish to commend my good friend, the Senator from Illinois, who was \na member of that Commission and took what I thought was an \nextraordinarily courageous vote on a package of proposals. Honestly, I \nknow he didn't agree with every one of them, but he did understand how \nserious this issue is. I thank him and all my other colleagues from \nboth sides of the aisle, along with the economists and policymakers and \nothers who invested the time and effort and courageously grappled with \nthese difficult choices.\n  On Friday, 11 of the 18 members of the Commission voted to support a \ntough, bipartisan prescription for fiscal health. I regret that the 11 \n``yes'' votes fell short of the 14 votes required to forward this plan \nto Congress for our consideration.\n  In the hours leading up to Friday's vote, I was proud to work with 13 \nof my Senate colleagues, including the Presiding Officer, to draft a \njoint letter to the White House and to the bipartisan congressional \nleadership.\n  This letter, signed by 14 Senators and distributed before the \nCommission's final vote on Friday, requested that the panel's \nrecommendation come to Congress for our consideration regardless of the \noutcome of the Commission's final vote.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a copy of this joint \nletter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 3, 2010.\n     President Barack Obama,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Speaker Nancy Pelosi,\n     Office of the Speaker,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Majority Leader Harry Reid,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Minority Leader John Boehner,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Minority Leader Mitch McConnell,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Our growing national debt poses a dire threat to this \n     nation's future. Ever since the economic downturn, Americans \n     have had to make tough choices about how to make ends meet. \n     Now it's time for leaders in Washington to do the same.\n       The report issued Wednesday by the National Commission on \n     Fiscal Responsibility and Reform is a courageous first step \n     in tackling our national debt. The report shows in stark \n     terms that solving the debt problem will require difficult \n     choices. There is no easy way out, and Washington must lead \n     the way. The strong bipartisan support its recommendations \n     have already received demonstrates we can, and must, come \n     together to solve this impending fiscal crisis. Every day \n     that we fail to act the choices become more difficult.\n       We believe that now is the time to act. The situations in \n     Ireland and Greece demonstrate that rising debt levels, left \n     unchecked, can quickly and unpredictably force a country to \n     take drastic austerity measures. If we don't choose to act \n     now, we will be forced to act later with fewer and more \n     painful options available to us.\n       While there are plenty of provisions in the Commission plan \n     we do not support, our nation would be far better off with a \n     comprehensive deficit reduction plan than without one. The \n     report shows that we can stabilize our debt over the long \n     term, while fostering our economic recovery now, improving \n     our country's global competitiveness, and maintaining our \n     commitment to protect the most vulnerable in our society. \n     Specifically, we commend the Commission's efforts to:\n       Protect our economic recovery by gradually phasing in \n     deficit reduction and still allowing for critical \n     investments;\n       Fundamentally reform and simplify the tax code in a way \n     that lowers rates for all taxpayers, increases progressivity, \n     and improves the ability of businesses to compete in the \n     global marketplace;\n       Ensure that Social Security will be there to support \n     seniors for at least 75 more years, while adding a new \n     minimum benefit and further support for our oldest seniors \n     and long-term disabled;\n       Preserve and better target tax benefits that support home \n     ownership and charitable giving; and,\n       Further control the costs of health care.\n       Prompt action is needed to bring the country's deficit into \n     balance and stabilize our debt over the long term. Regardless \n     of whether the Commission's report receives the support of at \n     least 14 of its 18 members, we urge legislative action to \n     address these problems. The American people deserve--and \n     demand--that we pull together to avert this looming crisis. \n     Your leadership on this issue will be crucial to our success.\n           Sincerely,\n         Mark R. Warner, Claire McCaskill, Mark Begich, Thomas R. \n           Carper, Jon Tester, Jeanne Shaheen, Joseph I. \n           Lieberman, Mark Udall, Michael F. Bennet, Dianne \n           Feinstein, Mary L. Landrieu, Amy Klobuchar, Kay R. \n           Hagan, Evan Bayh.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have a reason for coming to the floor \nand drawing attention to our letter and this issue again.\n  The seriousness of our Nation's fiscal challenges--the compelling \nneed to address these issues in a responsible and bipartisan way--did \nnot suddenly dissipate or magically disappear over the course of the \nweekend that just ended.\n  In fact, since the Commission's final meeting ended on Friday \nafternoon, the national debt--the running tally of what the U.S. \nGovernment owes--has increased by an estimated $15 billion. Our total \nnational debt is a staggering $13.8 trillion. I will repeat that. Our \nnational debt is approaching $14 trillion.\n  Every day you can listen to a lot of talk from people in this town \nabout deficit reduction. But as I said, when the Commission first \nunveiled its proposals 1 week ago, while I would have made some \ndifferent choices, we were being presented with a unique opportunity to \nfinally get real about the deficits and debt.\n  Actually, when the Commission came out, I was a little more blunt \nthan that. I said that after all the campaign rhetoric about deficit \nreduction, the time had come to put up or shut up. I believe this \nCommission earned credibility by describing our fiscal challenges in \nstark and honest terms. They\n\n[[Page S8541]]\n\ndeserve our respect for crafting a clear roadmap to help steer our \nNation back to a more responsible fiscal path.\n  The Commission's leaders and its members made difficult decisions, \nand they didn't shy away from examining expenditures and revenues.\n  They concluded, correctly, that our Nation's fiscal challenges are \ntoo serious, and the fiscal hole we have dug ourselves into is too deep \nto be solved by simply looking at only one side of the ledger. To say \nwe can tax our way out of this or cut spending alone will not get us \nthere.\n  To be sure, there is something for everyone to dislike in these \nrecommendations, but that is simply a reflection of how large the \nproblem is.\n  Whether you look at this report and are concerned about the viability \nof Social Security or tax rates, levels of Defense spending or any \nother specific government program or service, failing to act makes \nthose choices and decisions even tougher with every day that goes by.\n  The fiscal commission came forward with a framework for improving our \ncountry's global economic competitiveness while still maintaining our \nshared commitment to protect our most vulnerable citizens. One of the \nthings that got lost in the headlines was that while this took a \npositive step toward deficit reduction, this Commission did two other \nthings we talk about. One is that they would lower business tax rates \nand also dramatically simplify the individual Tax Code and get rid of a \nlot of clutter.\n  This Commission also deserves enormous credit for recognizing that \nthe hard work of getting our Nation's fiscal house in order is also an \nurgent matter of national security because it is clear America cannot \nbe a leader in the world, projecting strength and promoting democracy, \nif we are weakened at home by our deficits and debt.\n  Ever since this economic downturn began, individual Americans and \ntheir families have been required to make tough choices of their own \nabout how to make ends meet. It is time we did the same here in \nWashington.\n  Many of you know I came to public service after a relatively \nsuccessful career in business. In the business world, investors and \nshareholders have a reasonable expectation that at the end of each \nfiscal year, we would end up balancing our company's books. Similar to \nthe Presiding Officer, who was a mayor of a great city, I had the honor \nof serving as the Governor of Virginia, where there was a 2-to-1 \nRepublican legislature. We worked in a bipartisan way to make the tough \nchoices required to balance our State's budget during tough economic \ntimes. Proudly, Virginia has been named as the best-managed State and \nthe best State for business.\n  I have only been in this body, as has the Presiding Officer, for \nabout 2 years. One thing I have already learned is that if Washington \ncan find an excuse to punt on a difficult decision, it almost always \nwill.\n  Most days, it is easier to retreat to our partisan corners and \ndefault to the political gamesmanship you see every day on cable TV.\n  As the current economic upheaval in Europe so clearly demonstrates, \nwe cannot simply ignore this challenge because it is inconvenient or \nbecause the choices are too tough. Maybe 20 years ago our country had \nthe luxury of having the rest of the world have to wait until we got \nour act together before they could move forward. But anybody who \nsurveys the other economies around the world realizes China, India, and \neven Brazil are not waiting for us to get our financial house in order \nor get our act together.\n  Now is the time to make these tough choices--not when the bond \nmarkets lose their patience and confidence in our long-term economic \nviability, which is what recently happened in Greece and now Ireland \nand who knows who is next.\n  The fact is that if interest rates were not at historic lows today, \nwe would already be in a world of hurt at this point. As it is, if we \ndon't take action soon to stabilize our debt, we could be spending \nupward of $1 trillion a year just on debt service by 2020. Think about \nhow many taxes would have to be raised and programs that would have to \nbe cut just to meet basic debt service.\n  So now it is time for us to agree that we will not allow the perfect \nto be the enemy of the good. Our own political discomfort should not be \nused as an excuse to delay holding an honest and long overdue \ndiscussion about the complicated fiscal choices confronting us today. \nEvery day, every week, every month that we put off that discussion, our \noptions become more limited and the choices become tougher.\n  Resolving America's fiscal problems must be one of our top \npriorities. Yes, it will require difficult decisions. There is no easy \nfix or easy way out. But those of us who were hired by folks across the \ncountry should expect nothing less.\n  I appreciate the chance to address this issue. Again, I compliment my \ngood friend, the Senator from Illinois, for his courage and leadership \non this issue and for his vote on what I know had to be a very \ndifficult decision. He and some other Members on the other side said \nthat even though this was not a perfect plan, it was more important to \nbring this discussion forward. I compliment them on their action, and I \nthank the Presiding Officer for joining me and a number of other \ncolleagues. We will be back to continue to bring this issue before our \nfellow colleagues and the people of the country.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Virginia--\noriginally from Illinois--for those kind words. It was not an easy vote \nto vote in favor of the deficit commission report, but I felt it was \nthe right vote.\n  To explain my vote, 40 cents out of every $1 we spend, whether it is \nfor a new missile system at the Pentagon or food stamps for the poorest \namong us--40 cents out of every $1 is borrowed. We primarily borrow it \nfrom countries such as China and the OPEC nations.\n  The fact that we are indebted to them for generations to come will \nnot allow those of us on the progressive side to see a more fair and \njust America. We are an America that is mortgaged, and those who hold \nour mortgage have power over us economically and politically. That is \nwhy I voted for this.\n  There are parts of this report I don't like at all. One of the things \nit does that I commend to my colleagues is something I have never seen \nin the time I have served in the House and Senate. It takes a look at \nthe Tax Code, tax expenditures. The Senator talked about the day coming \nsoon when we will spend $1 trillion a year on interest on the debt. \nEach year, now we spend or through taxes forgive $1.1 trillion. That is \nmoney that doesn't go into the Treasury that otherwise would. It \ndoesn't go in because it is a deduction, a credit, an exclusion or a \ntax earmark. So $1.1 trillion a year through the Tax Code is added to \nour debt.\n  You have to ask yourself: What are those provisions? Some of them are \nvery important and some are controversial. The No. 1 tax deduction in \nAmerica is for health insurance. We have it as Members of Congress, and \neverybody wants that. If we are going to continue this deduction, we \nneed to ask hard questions: Do we go too far? Are there things we can \nreasonably do to contain the growth in that particular deduction? How \nabout the mortgage deduction? Currently, mortgage interest can be \ndeducted from your income tax. I use it. Most people do who itemize, \nbut 70 percent of Americans don't itemize. In other words, they don't \nget the advantage of any of these because they do a simple form and \ntake a standard deduction. For 70 percent of Americans, even the \nmortgage interest deduction has no value to them.\n  We currently put a limit on the value of a home, where you can apply \na mortgage interest deduction of $1 million. Is that the right number? \nShould that be lowered today? Should we focus more on working families? \nHow about the charitable deduction? Should we take adjusted gross \nincome--one idea of the Commission was that any charitable deduction \nover 2 percent of adjusted gross income would be deductible, but the \nfirst 2 percent would not be. You will hear from churches, charities, \nand universities saying we should not do this because they want people \nto give more. Each of these ideas carries controversy with it.\n\n[[Page S8542]]\n\n  If you eliminated all the deductions, credits, exclusions in the Tax \nCode, basically closed it up and set it aside, you could dedicate each \nyear almost $200 billion to deficit reduction, and with the remainder \nof $900 billion reduce tax rates across the board in our economy. The \nlowest tax rate would go from 15 percent to 9 percent.\n  The next tax rate--I am trying to remember--would go from about 24 \npercent to 16 percent. The top tax rate in America would go from 36 \npercent down to 26 percent. So you say to Americans: Do you want to \ndeduct your mortgage interest costs--because it is a value to you and \nyour family--and measure that against a reduction in your Federal \nincome tax rate of one-third? Under which scenario do you come out \nahead?\n\n  Those tax deductions--tax expenditures, as they call them, the $1.1 \ntrillion a year--are greater than either all the personal income taxes \ncollected in America--in other words, all the personal income taxes we \npay in go in to cover the tax deductions--or greater than the \ndiscretionary spending side of the budget, defense and nondefense. It \nis huge. In 28 years, we have never opened that door and looked inside. \nWe have to now. Deficit reform should include tax reform.\n  I brought this up to our friend and colleague, Max Baucus, chairman \nof the Finance Committee. He agrees. I think we ought to pursue this. \nWe had a bipartisan group saying: Let's get into this. Let's make this \npart of the conversation. It isn't just entitlement programs, such as \nMedicare and Social Security, and it isn't just spending--both domestic \nand defense spending--it is also tax expenditures. Put it all together. \nI think we have an honest conversation.\n  Yes, there will be honest sacrifice for all of us, and I thank the \nSenator from Virginia for raising this whole issue. As we discuss more \ntax cuts for America, we are proposing making the deficit hole deeper. \nEach of these tax cuts takes money out of the Treasury. I would argue \nwe should not hit the deficit brake on tax cuts for working families in \nthe middle of a recession. They need spending power to get through. \nGive them a helping hand now until the recession is behind us. But how \ncan we rationalize tax cuts for the most wealthy Americans when we are \nfacing this kind of deficit? We should be more sensible. We should be \nable to make these judgments.\n  Last Saturday, we had a vote which suggested we have no support on \nthe other side of the aisle for restraining tax cuts. They want them \nall. While they give their speeches about deficits, they turn around \nthen and vote for tax cuts, which make the deficits worse. So that is \nthe dilemma we face.\n  The last point I will make: The good news is that of the 18 members \nof the deficit commission, there were some 12 elected officials, and 6 \nof us--3 Democrats and 3 Republicans--voted for the Commission's \nreport. It was good. It was a breakthrough. It might have been \nhistoric.\n  I would thank the Senator from Virginia for his remarks and his \nconcerns about this issue. He has been working on this with Senator \nConrad and others for a long time, as has Senator Begich, and I thank \nhim for that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator from Illinois yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator from Illinois for laying out the \nfacts, but there is one additional fact--again, vis-a-vis the Bush tax \ncuts--that I think has been absent from some of this debate.\n  The efforts of the Senator from Illinois--Herculean as it was--to try \nto get 11 out of 18 votes, and all the painful choices the Senator made \nin terms of spending cuts, raising revenues, opening, as I think the \nSenator appropriately said, the whole question of tax expenditures, if \nmy memory is correct, over the next decade-plus, the commission's \nplan--as dramatic as it was and as controversial as it was--basically \ntook out about $4 trillion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Four trillion; that is right.\n  Mr. WARNER. If we were to make permanent--as some on the other side \nof the aisle have stated--all the Bush tax cuts, that adds another $4 \ntrillion to our deficit; is that not correct?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Virginia is exactly right. The point I \nam trying to make is--and he made it so well--that 10 months' work to \nfind $4 trillion that we could reduce from the deficit would be wiped \nout by the insistence on the other side of continuing these Bush tax \ncuts indefinitely.\n  I argued, and continue to argue, do what we have to do now to get out \nof this recession, but as soon as we see a positive, solid footing for \nthis economy, let's start stepping forward and be very serious about \nthis deficit reduction. I think the Commission gives us a roadmap.\n  I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "06", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/06/senate-section/article/S8542-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8542-S8548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I noted last week that President Obama \ntook a surprise trip to Afghanistan and visited with our troops, and it \nwas heartwarming to see the reception our Commander in Chief received \nin Afghanistan. I looked out at that large crowd of young men and women \nin uniform who have volunteered--volunteered--to serve our Nation and \nrisk their lives and saw how happy they were that the President \nacknowledged they were there and what they were doing. I am glad he did \nit. I am sure it was no fun flying all night, but it is certainly no \nfun to be under enemy fire, as these young men and women are almost \nevery day. Those of us here in the comfort and security of the Senate \nChamber or in our homes in America should never forget the sacrifice of \nthese individuals.\n  I also read over the weekend we have now lost over 1,400 in \nAfghanistan. I pour through the names each day and, I guess \nunderstandably, look first for someone from Illinois. Recently, we have \nhad several. I have attended two funerals in the last 2 or 3 weeks of a \nsoldier and a marine who died in Afghanistan from my home State of \nIllinois. It is heartbreaking to meet the young wives carrying babies, \nthe moms and dads, and share their grief as they stand by their fallen \nheroes and acknowledge that they have carried on a great tradition in \nAmerica of being willing to volunteer to protect our freedoms. But they \npaid the ultimate price. The lives of those families will never ever be \nthe same because of that loss.\n  Many of us, on both sides of the aisle--Democrats and Republicans--go \nout for unannounced tours to the hospitals in the Washington, DC, area, \nparticularly Walter Reed. We see these incoming soldiers who are about \nto become veterans who have been injured in battle and face many \ngrievous injuries. They come home to get the very best in medical care \nso they can return, as much as possible, to a normal life on the \ncivilian side as veterans, having given so much to this country.\n  The first person I ever visited at Walter Reed was after the invasion \nof Iraq. He was a young guardsman who had lost his left leg below the \nknee. It was amazing to me, as I talked to him, thinking how his life \nwould be changed now, when he said the one thing he couldn't wait to do \nwas to get his prosthetic leg and go through rehab so he could return \nto his unit in Iraq. What a great comment that is on the training and \ndedication of the men and women who serve us.\n  I wish to comment this afternoon and talk about one aspect of that \nbeing discussed here in Washington and try to add some perspective to \nit. I remember the early days of the war in Iraq. They were \ncontroversial. As our young men and women went into harm's way in an \neffort to displace Saddam Hussein and bring some order and civility to \nthat country, great sacrifices were made.\n  In 1990, a young man named Eric Alva joined the Marines at the age of \n19. Thirteen years later, at 32 years of age, he was serving in Basra \non the first day of the war in Iraq on March 21, 2003. This young \nmarine--Eric Alva--went into the invasion of Basra and stepped on a \nlandmine. He became the first U.S. casualty of the war in Iraq. As a \nresult of that occurrence, his right arm and left leg sustained \npermanent damage and his right leg was simply gone.\n  He was saved and sent to hospitals in Landstuhl, Germany, then here \nin the United States, where they did everything humanly possible to \nrepair his broken body--the broken body of this young marine who was \nthe first casualty of the war in Iraq.\n\n[[Page S8543]]\n\n  As he lay in that hospital going through countless surgeries to \nrestore his life, he was visited by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld \nand then by First Lady Laura Bush and President George Bush, who \npersonally awarded him a Purple Heart. It was the least this country \ncould do to acknowledge his courage and heroism and being in the first \nwave of marines who went into Iraq and who paid such a heavy price.\n  Eric Alva tried to put his life together after that devastating \ninjury. Finally, after several years, he spoke up and said there is \nmore to the story. After 4 years, Eric Alva told the world he had lied \nto become a member of the U.S. Marine Corps because he is gay and he \nkept that a secret. When he finally spoke out against don't ask, don't \ntell in 2006, he said: I have risked my life to save this country, but \nas a gay American veteran I still don't have the full rights of every \nAmerican.\n  MAJ Margaret Witt has also felt the injustice of don't ask, don't \ntell. Major Witt was an Air Force flight nurse. For 17 years, she rose \nsteadily through the Air Force and Air Force Reserve, winning strong \nperformance reviews from superiors and service medals from the \ndepartment. Almost no one--not even her parents--knew about her sexual \norientation. That ended in 2004, when her commanders discovered she was \nin a committed relationship with a civilian woman. After an \ninvestigation and hearing, the Air Force discharged her in 2007 under \nthe don't ask, don't tell policy.\n  After all those years--17 years of service to the country--they \ndischarged her. Her suspension came less than a year before she would \nhave earned her full pension. There she was, 17 years after joining, \nall the years of good performance reviews, 1 year away from her \npension, and she was suspended.\n  In 2006, Major Witt said: This is worth a fight. She sued the Air \nForce, claiming it had violated her rights. Her suit was dismissed by a \nFederal judge. Two years later, an appeals court panel overruled that \njudge, holding that before the military can discharge a gay service man \nor woman, it must first prove their firing furthers military goals.\n  This year, Major Witt went back to court to try to get her job back. \nShe faced the same judge who had dismissed her claim earlier--U.S. \nDistrict Court Judge Ronald Leighton. Former Air Force MSG James \nSchaffer, one of the four witnesses who testified on behalf of Major \nWitt, said he thought Major Witt's dismissal was so unfair it was part \nof the reason he retired from the Air Force himself in the year 2007.\n  Judge Leighton issued his ruling in the case in late September of \nthis year. Judge Leighton is no liberal. He was nominated to the \nFederal bench by President George W. Bush. In his ruling, Judge \nLeighton hailed Major Witt as a ``central figure in a long-term, highly \ncharged civil rights movement.'' He said her discharge advanced no \nlegitimate military interest. To the contrary, he said, her dismissal \nhurt morale in her unit and weakened the squadron's ability to carry \nout its mission.\n  Major Witt's case is now on appeal.\n  Judge Leighton was the second Federal Court judge in less than a \nmonth to find that don't ask, don't tell was unconstitutional. Earlier \nin September, in a case brought by the Log Cabin Republicans, a Federal \njudge in California ruled that don't ask, don't tell ``infringes on the \nfundamental rights of United States servicemembers in many ways,'' and \nhe said violates the due process clause of the fifth amendment and the \nfree speech protections under the first amendment. That ruling as well \nis under appeal.\n  Many of my colleagues have said they are inclined to support the \nrepeal of don't ask, don't tell, but they wanted to reserve final \njudgment until the Defense Department studied this issue in-depth. \nWell, the study is complete--one of the most exhaustive studies in the \nhistory of the Pentagon. According to the Pentagon's own study, more \nthan 70 percent of the 115,000 servicemembers and 44,000 military \nspouses who responded said the effect of repealing don't ask, don't \ntell would be ``positive, mixed or nonexistent.''\n  Think about the responses there--115,000 members of the military and \ntheir spouses responded to the question, and 70 percent said it was \ntime to end don't ask, don't tell.\n  In releasing that study, Defense Secretary Robert Gates acknowledged \nthat there are challenges behind unwinding don't ask, don't tell. He \nworried that leaving this matter to the Federal courts could be the \nwrong thing to do. A decision for one of these Federal courts could be \ndone in a very short period of time, but better, he said, that Congress \nstep up and accept its responsibility to repeal don't ask, don't tell \nand put in place a transition period to have the least negative impact \non our military. He basically put us on the spot and said those of us \nwho serve in Congress, don't stand on the sidelines and wait for the \ncourts to decide. Pick up the issue and decide yourselves.\n\n  President Obama supports repealing don't ask, don't tell. Many of us \nwant to join him. But, unfortunately, we are being stopped by other \ncolleagues who do not want this matter to come before the Senate. They \nrun the risk that any day a Federal court can do, in one opinion, what \nwe should be doing in an orderly, sensible way.\n  Defense Secretary Gates also added:\n\n       Those that choose not to act legislatively are rolling the \n     dice that this policy will not be abruptly overturned by the \n     courts.\n\n  He urged us to move and move quickly.\n  This is not the first time we fought battles involving discrimination \nin our military. As proud as I am of the men and women who have served \nin our military throughout our history, military historians and those \nwho serve will be honest and tell you that in times gone by, some \nthings have occurred which should not have happened. In World War II, \nour colleague, Senator Danny Inouye of Hawaii, and other Japanese-\nAmericans, defended our Nation even as many of their family members \nwere imprisoned in internment camps in this country. Senator Inouye's \nunit, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, was made up entirely of \nJapanese-Americans who initially were denied the right to even \nvolunteer and serve for our country. They became, once they were \nallowed to fight, one of the most highly decorated units in the history \nof the Army.\n  Our friend, Senator Inouye, in World War II lost his arm fighting in \nItaly for America. Yet when he returned from the war, a clearly \ndisabled veteran, a hero in a U.S. Army uniform, he went into a barber \nshop where the barber refused to give him a hair cut and said: ``We \ndon't cut Jap hair.''\n  The discrimination he faced before he was allowed to serve our Nation \nand even after is a reminder that even in this great Nation there are \ntimes we have to step up and stand up for the cause of civil rights.\n  Incidentally, we know in this Chamber, and those who follow this \ndebate should know, in the year 2000 our colleague, Senator Dan Inouye \nof Hawaii, was awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism in World War \nII.\n  Edward Brooke was another man who served in the Senate. He was \nelected in 1966, the first African-American to serve since \nReconstruction, a Republican from Massachusetts. He is a recipient of \nthe Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal. In \nWorld War II he served in an all-Black regiment in the infantry. As he \nsaid, he and his fellow African-American soldiers fought tyranny in \nEurope even as the U.S. military fought to protect White troops from \nhaving to live and fight alongside of them. The military, for all \nintents and purposes, was basically segregated at that time.\n  This past June, Senator Brooke wrote in the Boston Globe calling for \nan end to the don't ask, don't tell policy. It was a powerful call for \njustice, and I want to read part of it. Here is what Senator Brooke, a \nRepublican from Massachusetts, said:\n\n       Military service requires extraordinary sacrifice and love \n     of country, and every man and woman in uniform deserves our \n     respect and gratitude. However, the ``don't ask, don't tell'' \n     policy that bars openly gay and lesbian soldiers from serving \n     in the military shows disrespect both for the individuals it \n     targets and for the values our military was created to \n     defend. It is a discriminatory law that must be repealed.\n\n  Senator Brooke said that under Don't Ask, Don't Tell: The military is \ndivided into soldiers who are judged solely on their merit, and those \nwho\n\n[[Page S8544]]\n\ncan be condemned for a personal characteristic unrelated to their \nperformance. We've been here before, and history shows that prejudice \nwas the wrong policy.\n  He added:\n\n       Regardless of its target, prejudice is always the same. It \n     finds novel expressions and capitalizes on new fears. But \n     prejudice is never new and never right. One thing binds all \n     prejudices together: irrational fear. Decades ago, black \n     service members were the objects of this fear. Many thought \n     that integrating black and white soldiers would harm the \n     military and society. Today, we see that segregation itself \n     was the threat to our values. We know that laws that elevate \n     one class of people over another run counter to America's \n     ideals. Yet due to ``don't ask, don't tell,'' the very people \n     who sacrifice the most to defend our values are subject to \n     such a law. We owe them far more.\n\n  Whether it was the Marine Eric Alva, the first serious casualty of \nthe war in Iraq, or Major General Witt, in the Air Force, who after 17 \nyears of service was basically told to leave, we understand we owe them \nand so many more the right to serve without discrimination.\n  More than 24 nations allow gays and lesbians to serve openly in the \nmilitary. They include Canada and the United Kingdom. Other nations \nthat have lifted their bans include Australia, Austria, Belgium, the \nCzech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, \nLithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Slovenia, \nSouth Africa, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n  Israel, too, has lifted its ban against service by those who are of a \ndifferent sexual orientation. Does anyone think for one minute the \nIsraelis would allow gay men and women openly in the military if they \nthought it would harm their military readiness and national security? \nOf course not.\n  Let me add, there is currently no discrimination against those who \nare gay who wish to serve in the CIA, Secret Service, or FBI. Only in \nthe U.S. military is that discriminatory policy still part of the law \nof the land.\n  Our military leaders have told us they can implement repeal and do it \nin an orderly way. Secretary of the Army John McHugh, former \nCongressman of New York, has said that. Secretary of the Navy former \nGovernor Raymond Mabus, Admiral Gary Roughhead, Chief of Naval \nOperations, and General Douglas Fraser, commander of the U.S. SOUTHCOM \nall agree the military is up to the challenge--everyone.\n  In releasing the Pentagon survey, Defense Secretary Gates said:\n\n       One of the most important things to me is personal \n     integrity and a policy or law that in effect requires you to \n     lie gives me a problem. Such a policy is fundamentally \n     flawed.\n\n  Admiral Mike Mullen, the highest ranking military leader in America, \ntestified and said:\n\n       Speaking for myself and myself only, it is my personal \n     belief that allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly would \n     be the right thing to do. No matter how I look at the issue, \n     I cannot escape being troubled by the fact that we have in \n     place a policy which forces young men and women to lie about \n     who they are in order to defend their fellow citizens.\n\n  He added:\n\n       I have served with homosexuals since 1968. Everyone in the \n     military has.\n\n  Indeed, there are an estimated 66,000 gay men and lesbians serving in \nour military today. Ending don't ask, don't tell is the right thing to \ndo for those troops and for our Nation.\n  I want to salute Senator Lieberman for being the author of the \namendment to repeal don't ask, don't tell, and I am proud to cosponsor \nit with him. This amendment gives us the right to begin the process of \nrepealing it in an orderly way. It says specifically that before don't \nask, don't tell can be repealed, the President, Secretary of Defense, \nand Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff must all certify that the new \nrules are consistent with the standards of military readiness and \neffectiveness.\n  Over the last 60 years, the U.S. military has ended racial \nsegregation and integrated women into its ranks. In many respects the \nmilitary, after realizing that prejudice did not serve our country \nwell, has led our Nation in opening up to equal treatment and equal \nopportunity men and women of different racial backgrounds as well as \nobvious changes in gender.\n  Ending the ban against gays and lesbians serving openly will require \nleadership and care, but I am confident America's leadership, the \nfinest in the world, is up to the task.\n  Let me close with one last comment from Senator Brooke. In his op-ed \nhe wrote:\n\n       Civil rights progress doesn't happen automatically or \n     without resistance. History almost always obscures that fact \n     because after the battles are won, it is difficult to \n     understand why we needed to fight them in the first place. \n     Laws change and values change with them. I'm confident that \n     repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell will be the same. A law \n     believed to be necessary becomes a relic that the next \n     generation finds curious and shameful.\n\n  In this case the values have already changed. The vast majority of \nAmericans, including the majority of our top military leaders, our men \nand women in uniform and their spouses, support ending don't ask, don't \ntell. It is time to stop coming up with excuses to continue this \ndiscrimination. We owe to the men and women in the military not only \nour respect for what they do and how they serve our country but our \nrespect for their judgment, and in their judgment it is time for don't \nask, don't tell to end.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Durbin for his eloquent \nremarks. I urge everyone who wants to get a full understanding of this \nissue of don't ask, don't tell to read his remarks.\n  I would only say, if you sum it up, what my colleague has told us is \nthat ending don't ask, don't tell will make us a stronger nation \nbecause we will have the unqualified support of people who are serving \nin the military in a situation where they have to hide who they are. \nThis can't be good. Many of them are thrown out of the military.\n  Frankly, if we do this, it means we are listening to the American \npeople, a strong majority of whom support ending don't ask, don't tell; \nand listening to Secretary Gates, our Defense Secretary, who tells us \nhe supports repeal; and listening, frankly, to the members of the \nmilitary who have taken a survey and over 70 percent of them say we \nshould end don't ask, don't tell.\n  It is hard to understand why this is not being done. Senator Durbin \nis right. If it is done by the courts--which, by the way, I want it to \nbe done by everyone, courts included--but if it is done by the courts \nbefore we deal with it, it means there will be more of a rush to change \nthings, and it will take a lot of the control out of the hands of the \nDefense Secretary so he can phase in this change in policy.\n  I have to say, as someone who way back in 1993 spoke out against this \npolicy and offered an amendment to keep it out of the rules and out of \nthe law, I tried to say let's just leave it up to the military and not \nhave a congressional statement on it--I offered that amendment. I don't \nknow, we got how many votes--about 12 or 13 votes at the time.\n  Imagine all those years ago I was so blessed to be here then to speak \nout against this policy, and now I am here at a time when we can \nfinally end it. What that means is we are moving civil rights forward.\n  In this great Nation of ours we have a lot of ups and downs, we have \na lot of disagreements, we have a lot of open debate, as it should be \nas a democracy. But at the end of the day, we always expand freedom. We \nalways expand equality.\n  We started off with only White men of property could vote, when we \nstarted off as a nation. It was a big struggle to get the African-\nAmerican vote. It was a big struggle to get the women's vote. Then we \nextended the age downward so we had the 18-year-old vote because we had \npeople going to war and they couldn't vote, so we expanded that. This \nis a country that includes our people. This policy runs counter to that \nwhole notion of inclusion. In fact, it makes people who are willing to \ndie for their country lie about who they are.\n  We want to stop that policy, at least the vast majority of the \nAmerican people do--the Secretary of Defense does, the majority of the \npeople in the military do. We have a couple of people on the other side \nof the aisle, frankly, who keep raising the bar. They said we will end \nthis don't ask, don't tell when we have a survey. Then the survey came \nout and they said: You know what. We didn't like the survey. Let's have \nanother survey.\n\n[[Page S8545]]\n\n  What are they going to do, keep designing different surveys until the \nanswer comes back the way they want it? Come on. That is wrong. That is \nholding back something so important that we have to do.\n  We have a chance to stand up for civil rights and human rights and I \ndon't want to give it away to the courts. I hope the courts continue to \nrule the way they have. By the way, the courts have been, to me, \neloquent on the point. But we ought to be eloquent as well.\n  Here we are in a postelection session called a lameduck, but this is \nno reason for us to be lame, and there is no reason for us to be \nlimping out of this session. We can do some good things. I am here \ntoday to look at where we are, what we have done, what we have to do, \nand what I hope we will do.\n  Let me say we did do one positive: We did pass the Food Safety \nModernization Act by a vote of 73 to 25. One Senator held it up and \nheld it up. We know thousands of our people die every year of foodborne \nillness. This was a no-brainer. This was easy. The industry itself \nwanted to do this. We had to have a big fight and cloture votes and the \nrest of it. At the end of the day we passed it, and I am grateful and, \nbelieve me, many people in our country will be grateful when they see \nthe changes that will be put in place.\n  We are increasing the number of FDA inspections at foreign and \ndomestic facilities to make sure our food is safe before we have an \noutbreak of a disease. And it will allow removal of contaminated food \nfrom store shelves far faster by enhancing the tracking and tracing of \nhigh-risk foods. It is going to mean the FDA has clear mandatory recall \nauthority. We have more surveillance systems out there. So this is \ngoing to lead to a healthier nation.\n  Then we got a letter from the Republicans, my friends, and they said: \nWe are not voting on one more thing until you extend tax cuts for all \nAmericans. So, listen, we did that. The Democrats passed two--not one \nbut two versions of tax cuts for every single American. One said: We \nwill make sure those tax cuts stay in place for the first $250,000 of \nincome. That passed with a majority. We needed 60 because our friends \nfilibustered. We got 53. Then we had another version that said: Let the \ntax cuts continue for up to $1 million of income. Just so people \nunderstand what that means, it means we gave tax cuts to every single \nAmerican, every single one, and we gave a bonus tax cut to people \nearning up to $1 million, an additional tax cut.\n  That was not enough for my Republican friends. They brought down \nthose two bills that meant tax cuts for everyone because they want a \nbonus for people earning over $1 million. Let me tell you how many \npeople there are in this country--307 million Americans. Let me tell \nyou how many Americans earn more than $1 million--315,000. That is one-\ntenth of 1 percent. My Republican friends voted no on a bill that gave \nevery American a tax cut but stopped a bonus tax cut for 315,000 \nfamilies who earn over $1 million. Not only that, they said: We are not \ngoing to do one more thing in this Senate until we get that tax cut for \nthose people. Give me a break. Give me a break.\n  I read into the Record a letter signed by 90 millionaires. Do you \nknow what they said? Thanks, but no thanks. We do not want this extra \ntax money. Do it up to $1 million. After that, it is a waste. We are \nnot going to spend it in the economy. We are not going to stimulate \nthis economy. Give it to everybody else, not us.\n  But, oh, no. Oh, no. They voted no. And they are stopping everything.\n  You know, a lot of people complain because there is debate going on \nbetween the two major parties. I understand it. We have to get things \ndone, and we do. But every once in a while, it is good for the American \npeople to see who is fighting for whom. And put me down as fighting for \n99.9 percent of the American people. Put them down as fighting for one-\ntenth of 1 percent of the American people. This is unreal.\n  People said: You have to meet the Republicans halfway. Absolutely. \nThat is why I said I would vote to retain the tax cuts for people up to \n$1 million. We talked about it just being the first $250,000. We moved \nto $1 million. That covered almost everybody. They will not meet us an \ninch of the way. We went all of the way over here, and they will not \nmeet us here at all. It would require a little baby step.\n  So where are we? You see us. We are not voting on anything, folks, \nbecause they voted down the tax cuts and now they will not do anything \nelse. And let me tell you some of the things they have already stopped. \nThey have already stopped help for the unemployed. Two million \nAmericans in this Christmas season, this Hanukkah season, are not going \nto get their unemployment benefits that they paid for through \ninsurance. They are hard-working people. I read their stories into the \nRecord, and I hope people will look at those stories. They touch your \nheart. We have veterans who cannot get a job. We have single moms who \ncannot get work. We have children saying: I cannot go to college now \nbecause my family is unemployed; I have to quit college and go back to \nwork. And $300 a week is the benefit. That is what they stopped on the \nother side so they could get $460,000 a year in tax cuts, additional, \nfor people who earn $10 million. Think about that. Think about that.\n  They stopped $300 a week going to the long-term unemployed, not the \nones who have reached the 99 weeks--after that, they do not have any \nmore--just to get them up to that 99 weeks, if necessary. They blocked \n$300 a week because they are very upset about the cost. Yet they are \nfighting for a tax cut of $460,000 a year extra to someone earning $10 \nmillion a year, adding hundreds of billions of dollars to the deficit. \nThey don't care about that. They don't care about paying for that. Oh, \nthey do care about paying for the extension of unemployment insurance.\n  So every once in a while, when people get upset and they say the \nparties are battling, trust me, every once in a while it is worth the \nfight. Every once in a while it is worth the fight because our country \nis worth the fight, because our middle class is worth the fight, \nbecause our working people are worth the fight.\n  This is where we stand. Look at this. We are doing no legislative \nbusiness because everything is being held hostage for the millionaires \nand the billionaires, the top one-tenth of 1 percent of the people. \nJust read the letter the Republicans sent us. They said they would not \ncompromise. We said: We will give you the first $1 million of income, a \nlower tax. That was not good enough. That was not good enough. They \nwant every penny over $1 million to get that tax break. So talk about \nthe party of no--the GOP is the n-o-p-e party.\n  Here are some other things they blocked and they are blocking. How \ncould we ever forget 9/11? I certainly can't. No American can ever \nforget it. And who could ever forget the heroes who went down and \nworked to clear the debris, the toxic debris from 9/11. They went down \nto find survivors, then they went down to find remains. They never \nthought about themselves.\n  The Bush EPA said the air was safe. They went down there, and they \nare sick, and we need to help them. We have a bill that passed the \nHouse. The Republicans are blocking it to fight for tax breaks for the \npeople who earn over $1 million, for the people who earn $1 billion.\n  Right now, they say we can't do any other work. They have stopped the \nSTART treaty, a treaty supported by none other than George Schultz, \nHenry Kissinger, Howard Baker, all very well-respected Republicans. \nThose Republicans turned their backs on those Republicans because they \nare fighting for the top one-tenth of 1 percent of earners in this \ncountry, and we can't make our country safe. We have no inspectors on \nthe ground in Russia. We need to inspect their nuclear program. I \nremember asking all of our national security people what is their \nbiggest fear. Republicans, Democrats, all of them. Do you know what \nthey said? A terrorist getting hold of a nuclear weapon. We have to do \ninspections and make sure that nuclear arsenal is safe from terrorists. \nOh, no, we can't do that because the people who earn over $1 million \nneed more tax help. Thank you. That is the answer from the other side.\n  We are now ready to give $250 back to Social Security recipients who \ndidn't get a cost-of-living adjustment. As far as I know, that is being \nstopped. Nothing is happening here.\n  We want to help our firefighters, these heroes, negotiate so they can \nget the benefits they deserve. Oh, no, that is being held up.\n\n[[Page S8546]]\n\n  I can tell you personally that they held up the unemployment benefits \nI talked about before because I made a unanimous consent request to get \nthose unemployment benefits out there. Oh, no.\n  Senator Barrasso: I object. I don't want these benefits going to the \npeople who have been on unemployment benefits for more than 99 weeks.\n  I said: Well, wait a minute, my friend--he is my friend--we are not \ndoing anything for people longer than 99 weeks; we are just trying to \nmake sure that up to 99 weeks you have help.\n  Oh, he still objected. They want to pay for it. But they don't want \nto pay for the benefits to the millionaires. It is going to lose us \nhundreds of billions of dollars and add to our debt.\n  This is a time to show the difference between the parties. This is \npostelection. There is no election until a couple of years from now. \nLet's just show the difference. This is nothing to do with voting; \nthese are the true colors of the parties.\n  It is important that people understand we cannot do the business of \nthis country. We have a significant number of clean water bills to help \nthe Chesapeake Bay, to help the San Francisco Bay, to clean the \nwaterways, to help the Great Lakes. We voted them out of our committee, \nthe Environment Committee. I am proud to chair that committee, so \nproud. They are not even controversial. We didn't even have barely a \n``no'' vote from anybody on either side of the aisle. We can't get that \ndone either.\n  Don't ask, don't tell--you heard Senator Durbin talk about that. It \nis attached to the Defense bill. The Defense bill is critical. We are \nin two wars. Whether you support those wars or not, we support the \ntroops and want to get them what they need. The don't ask, don't tell \nrepeal is in there, and we can't get that done.\n  Let me tell you something else we have not been able to get done--the \nDREAM Act. I wish to talk about that, and I want to put a human face on \nit, so I am going to tell you some stories about it. I am going to tell \nyou the stories, and then I am going to tell you what the bill is we \nwant to do.\n  I am going to show you a picture of this handsome young man who is \nthe drum major of the UCLA Bruin Marching Band. Anyone who knows \nanything about universities knows UCLA is a great university. If you \nwant to get into UCLA, you have to be darn smart. You have to be at the \ntop. David Cho is very smart. He is the drum major of the UCLA Bruin \nMarching Band, and every week he leads them as they cheer on the Bruins \nin the Rose Bowl. Here is a beautiful picture of him.\n  Last weekend, the Bruins hosted their crosstown rivals from USC at \nthe Rose Bowl, and you might have seen David on your TV screen Saturday \nnight. There at the 50-yard line of the most iconic football stadium in \nAmerica, leading the Bruin Marching Band as they played ``Sons of \nWestwood,'' was David Cho, the face of this team and their cheerleaders \nand the face of the DREAM Act.\n  David is a senior at UCLA studying international economics. He has a \n3.6 GPA at UCLA. That is not easy. In his free time, he tutors local \nhigh school students. If ever we saw it, this is Americana--a smart, \nmotivated leader in the community, giving back. What is the problem \nwith David? He was born in Korea. He came here on a family visa with \nhis parents when he was 9 years old. His family spent 8 years trying to \nnavigate their way to legalized status. They found out their sponsor \nerred in filling out the paperwork. They tried and tried and could \nnever fix it. David did not learn he wasn't an American citizen until \nhe started applying to college.\n\n  He writes:\n\n       I feel like I'm living inside an invisible prison cell. I \n     want to serve in the Air Force . . . I want to attend the \n     Kennedy School of Government. I dream of becoming a U.S. \n     Senator because I want to serve and change this country for \n     the better. This is the American Dream I want to achieve, but \n     I am unable to fulfill it because of my status.\n\n  Years ago, when the Republicans were in charge of the Senate, a bill \ncame out called the DREAM Act. It would say to these young people who \nare here without the proper papers, not because they did anything wrong \nbut because their parents did, they grew up thinking they are American, \nAmerica is their home, some came at 6 months, some came at 2 years, \nsome came at 4 years, David came at 9 years--it sets them on a path, if \nthey hold up their average in school, if they join the military.\n  The military wants this bill passed. They call it a recruiter's \ndream.\n  We have many other stories, and I will quickly go through a few. I \nask unanimous consent to speak for an additional 5 or 6 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Pedro Ramirez is the student body president of Fresno \nState University. He is studying political science and agricultural \neconomics. He is another face of the DREAM Act. His parents brought him \nto the United States When he was 3 years old. Did Pedro know he was \ndoing anything wrong at 3? Nor did David know he was doing anything \nwrong at 9. Pedro discovered he was in this country illegally, again, \nwhen he began applying to college when he was 18. His immigration \nstatus became public knowledge when an anonymous e-mail to the Fresno \nBee detailed how he was forced to waive a small stipend the university \nprovides to its student president. He had to waive that. Pedro is \npaying his tuition with private scholarships and by mowing lawns. This \nis what he writes:\n\n       The DREAM Act itself symbolizes what it is to be an \n     American, which is our goal. We want to contribute to the \n     United States, and utilize the degrees and skills we gained, \n     to make it a better place.\n\n  Now let's look at Maria Duque, 19 years old. She is the vice \npresident of student government at Fullerton College. When she was 5 \nyears old, she moved to Los Angeles from Ecuador with her parents who \nwere seeking a better life for their children. As a high school \nstudent, she finished sixth in her class with a 4.4 grade point \naverage. I don't know how one gets over 4; I guess by doing bonus work \nand getting an A-plus-plus. This is what we are talking about. She was \nalso student body president, yearbook editor, and a newspaper editor. \nAt Fullerton College, Maria's excellent record continued. She has a 3.9 \nGPA. She volunteers at a nonprofit organization that helps low-income \nhigh school students prepare for college. She was accepted into top \nuniversities but is unable to afford to attend them because she does \nnot qualify for student aid. On weekends she sings in public arenas \nasking for donations to help her afford tuition.\n  How do we make our country better when our laws don't recognize \nstudents such as these? Who could answer that question for me? How do \nwe make our country better when we don't help students such as these?\n  She hopes to transfer to UC-Berkeley or UCLA and complete her double \nmajor in political science and history. Then she wants to go to law \nschool. She wants to continue her work helping others pull themselves \nout of poverty. She is another face of the DREAM Act. She writes:\n\n       My bachelor's diploma, my masters and law degree in the \n     future will only be a piece of paper. It might tell of my \n     accomplishments, but I will not be able to use it to help \n     others in this country which I consider my home.\n\n  She came here at 5 years old. She doesn't know anything else but \nAmerica. She says that DREAM Act students ``are like any other young \nperson in the [U.S.], aspiring to do more for society, our fellow \nneighbors, and our home, the United States of America. The DREAM Act is \n. . . a source of hope.\n  Lastly, Luis Perez. He graduated in May from UCLA school of law, the \nfirst undocumented student to do so. Luis is another face of the DREAM \nAct. Brought to the United States by his parents at the age of 9, he \nhas lived in this country for 20 years. He grew up in an area infested \nby gangs and drugs, and he rose way above those distractions and \ndangers. He went to community college. He transferred to UCLA where he \nearned a degree in American government, and he went to UCLA law. That \nis such a hard school to get into. He has worked side jobs to help pay \nfor room and board.\n  Tell me, somebody, how does it make our country a better place when \nwe turn our backs on these students?\n  He writes:\n\n       May 7th marked my graduation from UCLA law school. I am now \n     forced to look\n\n[[Page S8547]]\n\n     beyond the joy of graduation. Instead I must now reassess my \n     current situation, as I am deprived the luxury of making \n     long-term plans.\n       I have done and continue to do everything within my means \n     and ability until Congress does their part and passes the \n     DREAM Act. I have faith that our Founding Fathers entrusted \n     us with the legislative process to make just laws.\n       I am living the American Dream. I am a living example of \n     what education, opportunity, and community support can \n     produce regardless of challenges and disadvantages.\n       I have learned firsthand that it is only during times of \n     adversity that we have the opportunity to be a leader and \n     show true courage. As I acknowledge the difficulties with \n     immigration reform, I am hopeful that this Congress will give \n     me the opportunity to fulfill my Dream; after all, being an \n     American really means to stand up for what's right, even when \n     we are standing alone.\n\n  This is a bill that has had bipartisan support over many years. It \nstarted in 2001. I have statements from my Republican friends about how \nimportant this bill is and why.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record quotes from my \nRepublican colleagues.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 Quotes\n\n\n                            Bipartisan Bill\n\n       The Dream Act has always been bipartisan; in fact, it was \n     first introduced in the 2001 by Republican Senator Hatch, \n     with six (6) other Republican cosponsors.\n       Senator Hatch reintroduced the Dream Act in the 2003--this \n     time with thirteen (13) of his fellow Republicans as \n     cosponsors.\n       Since the first Hatch bill was introduced in 2001, Senate \n     Republicans have cosponsored the Dream Act 39 times.\n       In 2007, the Senate held a vote on the Dream Act. The bill \n     was filibustered, but 10 Republicans voted for it, including \n     Senators Brownback, Collins, Lugar, and Snowe.\n       Some of the most moving words about the importance of the \n     Dream Act have been spoken by my Republican colleagues.\n       In 2004 the Senate Judiciary Committee, led by Senator \n     Hatch, issued a report on the Dream Act:\n       ``Most came to America as children, playing no part in the \n     decision to enter the United States, and may not even know \n     they are here illegally. A great many grow up to become \n     honest and hardworking young adults who are loyal to our \n     country and who strive for academic and professional \n     excellence.\n       ``It is a mistake to lump these children together with \n     adults who knowingly crossed our borders illegally. Instead, \n     the better policy is to view them as the valuable resource \n     that they are for our nation's future.''\n       Senator Hatch in 2003 on the Senate floor:\n       ``I believe the DREAM Act will live up to its name. It will \n     allow these illegal immigrant children the opportunity to not \n     only dream of the infinite possibilities that their futures \n     may hold in the United States, but it will also afford them \n     the opportunity to realize their dreams.''\n       Senator Chuck Hagel, in 2007:\n       ``The DREAM Act would make it possible to bring these young \n     people out of shadows and give them the opportunity to \n     contribute, work, and pay taxes--giving back to the \n     communities in which they were raised.''\n       ``The DREAM Act is not amnesty. It is a narrowly tailored \n     piece of legislation that would help only a limited, select \n     group of young people earn legal status. This is not an \n     incentive for more illegal immigrants to enter our country.''\n       In 2009, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush co-wrote a report \n     for the Council on Foreign Relations. The report said:\n       ``The DREAM Act is no amnesty. It offers to young people \n     who had no responsibility for their parents' initial decision \n     to bring them into the United States the opportunity to earn \n     their way to remain here.''\n       And last week the Wall Street Journal editorialized about \n     the importance of the Dream Act:\n       ``What is to be gained by holding otherwise law-abiding \n     young people, who had no say in coming to this country, \n     responsible for the illegal actions of others? The DREAM Act \n     also makes legal status contingent on school achievement and \n     military service, the type of behavior that ought to be \n     encouraged and rewarded.''\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. We have a situation where people were brought to this \ncountry by their parents. The kids had nothing to say in the matter. \nThey grew up thinking they were Americans. They did everything American \nkids do, and they excelled. They went to the top. This bill is crafted \nin such a careful way that essentially we are taking the cream of the \ncrop and giving them a path to legality, a path so their hopes and \ndreams can be realized and, therefore, they will help this Nation \nrealize its hopes and dreams.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to listen to the students in their \nStates who are desperate to earn a chance for this dream. They are here \nin Washington, and they are going to various offices. They love their \ncountry. Never before in U.S. history have we punished children for the \nactions of their parents. To deny these students an opportunity to earn \nthe dream would be a dark moment in our Nation's history, in my view.\n  The American dream is real. It is not easy to attain. We have to work \nhard. We have to work hard always from the time we are a kid in school \nand we get our first job. Here we are talking about young people who \nexcel. All they want to do is be able to reach their dream and help us \nmove this country forward. This is the next generation of community \nleaders, the next generation of military leaders, the next generation \nof entrepreneurs. We don't punish children for the sins of their \nparents. We don't do that. That is wrong.\n  Let us do the right thing. Every once in a while we have to say: We \nhave to do the right thing. Is it a tough vote? Will some people ask, \nwhy are you doing that? Of course. But that is true about anything we \ndo.\n  We have so many golden opportunities to be on the right side of \nAmerican history. We are presented them every day. We are presented \nthem in this postelection session. We could end don't ask, don't tell. \nWe could pass the DREAM Act. We can pass an unemployment benefits \nextension. We can help our firefighters. We can help our heroes from 9/\n11 get help with their illnesses, with their breathing problems, with \ntheir cancer problems. Let's not say no because the Democrats said: \nYes, we will give everybody in this country a tax cut for the first $1 \nmillion of income and after that, we have to worry about the deficit. \nWe go all the way up to $1 million, and we take care of everybody in \nthis country. Everybody gets a tax cut. If one is over a million, they \ndon't get their little bonus tax cut. We help reduce the deficit which \nis an issue absolutely on our agenda.\n  Why would someone then say no to everything else, after we have met \nthem all the way up to the $1 million level of income. It is \nunbelievable.\n  America, pay attention. Pay attention to who is fighting for you and \nwho is fighting for 315,000 of the richest families, many of whom say \nto us: Don't do this. It is more important to cure the deficit. \nEconomists tell us at that level of wealth, they are not going to spend \nthe money at the corner store. Look at Mark Zandi's comments, the \nRepublican economic adviser to John McCain. He told us: You give out \nunemployment benefits, for every dollar, you increase economic activity \nby $1.61, because that money is spent right away at the corner store. \nYou give huge, enormous tax breaks to people over $1 million, they are \nnot going to spend it. They are going to put it in a trust fund.\n  Let's put that money toward deficit reduction. For me, speaking for \nmyself, this postelection session has been one of the most interesting \nI have ever seen. Because the true colors of the parties are coming \nout. I know people get very frustrated about our debates. They want us \nto come together. I want to come together. I went all the way to the \nRepublican side and said: The first million of income will get a tax \ncut. Only over that, that one-tenth of 1 percent, let's put that to \ndeficit reduction. And my Republican friends won't move that inch over \nto me and to us. At the same time they are blocking action on all those \nimportant bills I laid out.\n  I wanted to lay this out for history. I think we sometimes forget. \nThe battles we wage here tell the country who we are.\n  I am very pleased to have this opportunity. I thank the people of \nCalifornia for giving me this opportunity again. It means a lot to me \nto be able to weigh in on these issues of the heart and soul of the \ncountry that I love so much as a first-generation American on my \nmother's side. I thank them for that.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nspeak\n\n[[Page S8548]]\n\nfor up to 25 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "06", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/06/senate-section/article/S8548-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8548-S8549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               DREAM ACT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I understand it is likely the majority \nleader will seek to bring up the DREAM Act in a day or two. This is a \nvery bad piece of legislation, and it is being presented at a time when \nwe have massive illegality at our borders.\n  One of the fundamental things that separates America from the other \nnations of the world is our commitment to the rule of law. We enforce \nour contracts and our statutes. We punish corruption. One of the great \nadvantages this Nation has over others is the degree to which there is \nintegrity in our process here. We protect the rights and privileges of \ncitizenship. We know one of our most unique and valuable \ncharacteristics is our legal system.\n  Law is a necessary condition for a free society. Freedom cannot \nflourish in chaos. Prosperity cannot arise in an uncertain environment. \nYet we have allowed our borders to descend into chaos and lawlessness. \nFor decades, we have failed to uphold the rule of law. We have failed \nto protect the integrity of citizenship in America and the law.\n  Even now, in a post-9/11 world, we still lack control over who comes \ninto our country. Every day, guns, drugs, unknown people, unlawfully \npour across our broken border.\n  The consequences of the government's failure are felt keenly by those \nliving in our border States. Ranchers living on U.S. soil must confront \nthe chaos as a reality of daily life. They are denied the peaceable \npossession of their private property. Phoenix, the capital of Arizona, \nis now known as one of the kidnapping capitals of the world.\n  Yet it does not have to be this way. With enough will and determined \nexecution of a carefully developed plan, executed by a President and \nsupported by a Congress that has as its serious goal the elimination of \nthis illegality, it will be successful and can be successful in just a \nfew years.\n  It is not impossible. That is what the public wants and this is what \nour political leaders have obstinately refused to do. Americans are \nwilling--and I am certainly willing--to consider some sort of status \nfor those who have peacefully lived and worked in our country for some \nextended period of time, but only after we have secured the border. As \nlong as you continue to provide amnesty for people who come into our \ncountry and stay here for a period of time, you incentivize further \nillegality.\n  Well, this is because passage of amnesty bills, such as the DREAM \nAct, is an immediate reward for the illegal entry, with no serious plan \nto stop the illegal flow. Indeed, the legislation incentivizes the flow \nor the entry of people into our country illegally.\n  What does this type of legislation say to the rest of the world and \nto anyone thinking about coming illegally? It says if you can get in \nthe United States and hang on for a number of years, sooner or later we \nare going to reward you by forgiving your illegal behavior and putting \nyou on a path to citizenship. That is not the message we need to send.\n  The public will not allow us to repeat the mistakes of the 1986 \namnesty. We have discussed that so many times. They will not fall for \nthe ruse that we can have amnesty first and security later. They \nunderstand that if we do not secure the border first, we may never \nsecure it at all. We certainly have not done so as of this date.\n  Despite this--and despite historic losses in the recent election--the \nDemocratic leaders of this Congress are now pushing a reckless proposal \nfor mass amnesty known as the DREAM Act.\n  At a time when our Nation is struggling with high unemployment and \nrunaway government spending, the bill would authorize millions of \nillegal workers and impose an even greater burden on the taxpayers. \nMaking matters worse, those eligible for the DREAM Act amnesty include \nillegal aliens with criminal records. And all of this is being rushed \nthrough a lameduck Congress with no committee review.\n  The Democratic leaders have even introduced four versions of the same \nbill in just over 2 months--3 in the last 13 days. It has been a shell \ngame that abuses the legislative process. Is it any wonder that the \nAmerican people have lost faith in this institution?\n  Americans want us to enforce the laws, but we are considering a bill \nthat would reward and encourage their violation. Americans want \nCongress to end the lawlessness, but this bill would surrender to it.\n  Consider a few of the DREAM Act's most troubling provisions:\n  First, the DREAM Act is not limited to children. Illegal aliens as \nold as 30 or 35 are eligible on the date of the enactment of the bill. \nAnd they remain eligible to apply at any future age, as the \nregistration window does not close. You do not need a high school \ndiploma, a college degree, or military service in order to receive \namnesty under the DREAM Act as proposed.\n  Illegal aliens can receive indefinite legal status as long as they \nhave a GED, the alternative to a high school diploma. They can receive \npermanent legal status and a guaranteed path to citizenship as long as \nthey complete just 2 years of college or trade school.\n  One version of the DREAM Act offers illegal aliens in-State tuition \nfor which many Americans are not eligible. All four versions provide \nillegal aliens with Federal education benefits, such as work-study \nprograms, Federal student loans, and access to public colleges that are \nalready short on spaces and resources.\n  The Congressional Budget Office is the entity that gives us technical \ndata about legislation. It is a pretty objective group. It is hired by \nthe Democratic leader, the Democratic majority, but I think most of the \ntime they try to do the right thing. They say the bill would add $5 \nbillion to the deficit. But that number really, I have to say, is low. \nThe CBO clearly failed to account for a number of major cost factors \nassociated with implementation of the DREAM Act. Of course, they \nhaven't had much time to make this analysis since the most recent \nversion was introduced just 5 days ago. The CBO fails to account for \nunemployment, public education cost, chain migration, and fraud. \nFurthermore, it did not take into account what history has proven: \npassing amnesty will incentivize even more illegality and lawlessness \nat the border.\n  In addition, the CBO assumes a large portion of these individuals \nwill obtain jobs, but there is no surplus of job opportunities in \nAmerican today. Unemployment just went up from 9.6 to 9.8--almost 10 \npercent. It has remained high for an exceedingly long period of time. \nThe economists are telling us we are going to have to look forward to \nmuch higher unemployment than we have been used to in the past. Well, \nnobody is scoring the fact that many American job seekers will not get \na job if large numbers--a million or more--of illegal aliens are \nconverted to legal status and start competing for jobs, and perhaps \ndenying them that job, which may have good benefits and good pay.\n  Conservative estimates say that between 1.3 and 2.1 million illegal \naliens will be immediately eligible for this DREAM Act amnesty, but \nthat number will grow significantly as the bill has no cap or sunset to \nit. Moreover, those who obtain legal status can then petitions for \ntheir relatives. Under the DREAM Act, illegal aliens are put on a path \nto citizenship--first they receive conditional status, then legal \npermanent resident status, and finally citizenship. After they are \nnaturalized, they can then, through the chain migration process, apply \nto bring in their relatives. Some of the people they might apply to \nbring in are likely to be the persons who brought them here illegally. \nAs a result, the number of green cards granted could easily triple what \nis expected.\n  Many with criminal records will also be eligible for the DREAM Act's \namnesty. They simply must have less than three misdemeanor \nconvictions--under the Act, Congress is arbitrarily determining that \ntwo misdemeanors is OK while three is not so good. Those potentially \neligible would include drunk drivers, gang members, and even those who \nhave committed certain sexual offenses.\n  The most recent version of the bill also gives the Secretary of \nHomeland Security broad authority to waive ineligibility for even the \nmost severe criminal offenders and those who pose a threat to our \nnational security. Many such offenses include indecent exposure, DUI, \nsmaller thefts, and drug\n\n[[Page S8549]]\n\ncharges. Some of them are charged as felonies and very routinely \nreduced to misdemeanors. Two misdemeanor drug convictions won't bar you \nfrom being protected under this act and being able to have a guaranteed \npath to citizenship.\n  Those who commit document fraud or who lie to immigration authorities \nwill be eligible for the bill's amnesty as well. This is particularly \ntroubling as it contains a potential loophole for high-risk individuals \nplaced on the pathway to citizenship. One of the warning signs we \nmissed prior to 9/11 was the fraudulent visa applications submitted by \nthe 9/11 hijackers. This bill would likely make it more difficult to \ncombat immigration fraud from the dangerous regions of the Middle East \nwhere we have had an unfortunate history of abuse.\n  This DREAM Act even contains a safe harbor provision--very \nsignificant--that would prevent many applicants from being removed as \nlong as their application is pending. If they have a serious criminal \nrecord, they would normally be subjected to deportation. This provision \ncould dramatically hinder Federal authorities and will undoubtedly \nunleash a torrent of costly litigation that will suck up untold hours \nof our law enforcement personnel's time and ability and resources that \nought to be focused on the border.\n  If somebody who has been apprehended for illegally being in the \ncountry or committing a serious crime can come into court and assert \nthey have filed a petition under the DREAM Act, they can not be \ndeported. This is really a problem because if a facility does not have \nenough bed space, what are we supposed to do? Are we now going to have \ninvestigators drop what they are doing and go out and try to prove that \nsomeone was here before the age of 16? Did they really have a GED or is \nthat a forged document? How many criminal convictions do they have? \nThis all has to be investigated now. It could takes weeks or even \nmonths. So what happens? Are we going to keep those individuals in jail \ninstead of deporting them? How much cost is involved in that? All of \nthat is not counted in this process.\n  I just want to say that my experience in law enforcement is that \nthere are not enough people to do those investigations and we are going \nto have millions of applications. How do we prove somebody came here at \nage 15 instead of age 18? How do we prove they have been here 5 years? \nHow do we prove they came here 5 years ago and came at age 17 or 15 or \n14? Who is going to investigate that and dispute it, if they submit a \nstatement and say they have been here for 5 years? We have to take the \ntime now to investigate all of that?\n  This is not what we need to be doing right now. We have more serious \nchallenges to end the illegal flow. And for people who have been here a \nlong time and who have otherwise been good citizens and have worked \nhard, we can figure out some way to deal with their future. But I do \nnot believe this is the right step. It is not the right step.\n  In short, I believe the bill will be a disaster. Yet our Democratic \nleadership remains committed in their push for this amnesty provision. \nThey are again defying the public will and sending the world a message \nthat our Nation is not serious about the integrity of our borders and \nour laws.\n  American citizenship is the envy of the world, but central to our \nNation's greatness is our respect for the rule of law. None of us that \nI am aware of in this Senate is proposing to in any significant way \nreduce the number of people who come to our country lawfully. Indeed, \nthere are many provisions to increase the number who come lawfully. But \nthe American people are rightly saying: We have to do something about \nthe illegality. By eroding the respect for law through reckless and \nirresponsible amnesty provisions, we would do a disservice not only to \nthe 300 million Americans who call this Nation their home but to all \nthose future citizens who are applying and waiting in line to enter our \ncountry lawfully.\n  I feel strongly about this. Hopefully, this matter will not be \nproceeded with. We need to wrestle with how to bring our immigration \nsystem under control. We can do that. I have studied it for some time. \nI truly believe it can be done.\n  Senator McCain from Arizona, who has been to the border a great deal, \nhas said that within a year or two we can end this massive illegality. \nI have been saying that for a number of years. I truly believe it. But \nwe need to focus on that, not focus on rewards for those who have \nentered illegally. That is why this legislation should not pass.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in China, as I speak, there is a man in a \nsmall prison cell lit by one single lightbulb. He has been in prison \nfor 11 years in the country of China. On Friday of this week, in Oslo, \nNorway, he will be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. His name is Liu \nXiaobo. His wife has written me asking me to come to the Nobel Peace \nPrize presentation in Oslo, Norway, this Friday in honor of her \nhusband. I am not able to go to Oslo this Friday. The Senate is going \nto be in session the rest of the week. I regret I can't be in Oslo for \nthe awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize, but I did want to take a moment \nto remember what is happening this week.\n  This is Liu Xiaobo. He is in prison in China. He has been in prison \nfor 11 years. That is his sentence. I wish to describe why the Chinese \nhave put Liu Xiaobo in prison. It is not the first time he has been in \nprison, as a matter of fact.\n  Let me tell my colleagues just a little about Liu Xiaobo. He was born \nin 1955, grew up in an industrial city in China's northeast. As a young \nman, he wanted to study literature, so he went to Beijing and he became \na Ph.D. in comparative literature. He became a professor and dedicated \nhis days to teaching and to writing.\n  By 1989, he had the good fortune to be allowed to travel abroad as a \nvisiting scholar. He was at Columbia University in New York, in the \nUSA, when the demonstrations began to grow in Tiananmen Square. He cut \nshort his visit to Columbia University as a visiting scholar and \nreturned home to China, joining students in Tiananmen Square in a \nhunger strike. Then, on the night of June 4, a scholar whom the \nstudents had grown to trust, persuaded a group of students to withdraw \nfrom the square to save their lives. That was Liu Xiaobo. Authorities \nin China labeled him a subversive and sentenced him to 18 months in \nprison.\n  Eighteen months later, upon his release, he was told he could neither \nteach nor publish. He described his plight then in these words:\n\n       Simply for expressing divergent political views and taking \n     part in a peaceful and democratic movement, a teacher lost \n     his podium, a writer lost the right to publish, and an \n     intellectual lost a chance to speak publicly.\n\n  On his release in 1991 he continued to write and again he was placed \nunder house arrest in 1995, then sent to a labor camp where he was \ndetained until 1999.\n  In December of 2008, Liu Xiaobo called for political reform and was a \nsupporter of something called Charter 08 in China. He was once again \ndetained, then formally arrested, and then sent to prison for 11 years.\n  Let me describe what Charter 08 calls for. A group of people in China \nwho want the expression of freedoms that are available to all of us had \ncreated Charter 08. It calls for the guarantee of human rights, an \nindependent judiciary, the freedom to assemble, the freedom of \nexpression, the freedom of religion, protection of private property--\nand so on.\n  So someone who advocates this and pushes for these kinds of reforms \nis now sitting in a small prison cell with a single light bulb.\n  On Friday, in Oslo, Norway, when they award the Nobel Peace Prize, \nthere will be one empty chair on the stage for the man to whom the \nNobel Peace Prize is being awarded.\n  There will be empty chairs in the audience because his wife is not \nallowed\n\n[[Page S8550]]\n\nto go. She is detained under house arrest in China. I want to describe \nthat as well. His wife has been barred from traveling to Oslo to accept \nthe honor, and all of Liu's family has been barred from traveling. The \nNobel committee will postpone bestowing the actual medal, but the \nceremony will go on on Friday. There have now been just over 100 \ndocumented incidents since October in which Chinese citizens have been \nharassed, interrogated, and subjected to police surveillance, detained, \nor placed under house arrest for their expressions of support for Liu \nXiaobo. Some supporters reportedly have just disappeared.\n  The travel restrictions are pretty unbelievable. A violinist, Lynn \nChang, an American of Chinese descent who teaches at the Boston \nConservatory, and who will be playing at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony \non December 10, expressed concern about the personal and professional \nrepercussions his family might have in China for his accepting the \ninvitation to play at the ceremony.\n  Out of about 140 Chinese activists invited by Liu's wife to attend \nthe ceremony, only one at this point has been able to say: ``I will be \nthere.'' More than a dozen and far more have been blocked from flying \noverseas since Liu won the Peace Prize in October.\n  This is a photograph of Liu Xiaobo and his wife. Both are courageous \ncitizens, who, in my judgment, are owed our respect and all that we can \ndo to say to the Chinese Government: You cannot possibly continue to do \nthis and then insist that you believe in democracy.\n  Mr. President, in a recent interview with CNN, Premier Wen Jiabao of \nChina said this:\n\n       Freedom of speech is indispensable. . . . The people's \n     wishes for, and needs for, democracy and freedom are \n     irresistible.\n\n  I hope the Chinese Government and Chinese officials will understand \nthey cannot talk about these principles in that way and then continue \nto imprison someone such as Liu Xiaobo, whom the rest of the world will \ncelebrate as a courageous man striving for greater human rights in \nChina, the very things we take for granted every morning we wake up in \nthe United States. This man is spending 11 years in prison just for \nwriting about his aspirations for himself and the rest of the people in \nChina to have those freedoms.\n  As I said, I will not be in Oslo on Friday. I am enormously honored \nby Liu Xiaobo's wife asking me to be present. As chair of the \nCongressional Executive Commission on China, I have held many hearings \non the issues that exist between us and China. I held a hearing within \nthe last month about the issue of Liu Xiaobo's Nobel Peace Prize and \nwhat it means when a government says: Rather than be at a place of \nhonor and our country celebrating your winning the Nobel Peace Prize, \nwe will have you in a prison cell once again.\n  That is not what we would expect, or what anybody should expect, from \nthe Government of China. I said previously there are things that have \nimproved in China in recent years for some Chinese. China is a big \ncountry. It will be a significant part of our future. We are not quite \nsure how that is going to manifest itself.\n  Our country has decided affirmatively that our relationship with \nChina ought to be a constructive relationship in which we have \nconstructive engagement through trade and travel, and that is \nanticipated to move China toward greater human rights. In fact, there \nhave been some areas of progress. But this is a disgrace. Liu Xiaobo is \na hero. He ought not be a prisoner. Liu Xiaobo will be honored whether \nthe Chinese like it or not this Friday in Oslo, Norway. The Chinese are \ntrying to do everything they can to keep people away from that \nceremony. They have been calling other embassies in Oslo saying: Do not \ngo to that ceremony.\n  I think what has been happening is pretty unbelievable. I hope all of \nthe American people this Friday understand there is someone we ought to \nthink about who has exhibited great courage in support of freedom for \nthe people of the country in which he lives, and that is Liu Xiaobo. On \nFriday, he will still be in prison, but the world can celebrate his \ncourage and say to the Chinese in every way we know that they cannot \ncontinue to talk about freedom and then keep a Nobel Peace Prize winner \nin a dark prison cell in the farther reaches of China.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 69 years ago tomorrow, one of the \nmost deadly attacks on our Nation that we have ever seen, the horrific \nattacks on Pearl Harbor killed more than 2,000 U.S. troops and \ncivilians. President Franklin D. Roosevelt said December 7 is a date \nwhich will live in infamy. No matter how long it may take us to \novercome this premeditated invasion, the American people, in their \nrighteous might, will win through to absolute victory, and we did.\n  In the aftermath of Pearl Harbor, America succeeded not only \nmilitarily, we succeeded morally as well. Our Nation bonded together \nwith a newfound resolve to help those who sacrificed so much for our \nNation and to take care of our fellow citizens.\n  In the months that followed the attacks, Democrats and Republicans \nknew exactly what had to be done. Congress came together, not only to \ndeclare war but to pass legislation that provided health care and \ncompensation to each and every civilian who was injured during that \nPearl Harbor attack--every citizen who sacrificed for America that day. \nIt did not take 9 years for that to be done. Congress acted bravely and \nswiftly, without partisanship, without gridlock, with a clear moral \ncompass and a clear determination that we as a nation have an \nundeniable moral obligation to help the people who were harmed during \nthat attack on Pearl Harbor.\n  Pearl Harbor was the most deadly attack on our Nation, the most \ndeadly attack until the morning of September 11, 2001, when 3,000 \ninnocent people perished and tens of thousands of people came to their \nrescue. In the days that followed the 9/11 attack, America showed the \nvery same resolve it had shown nearly 60 years prior, and now we have \nseen thousands of heroes and thousands of survivors sick and dying from \nthe toxins released at ground zero. It is a time for us to show that \nvery same resolve again.\n  As President Roosevelt said: No matter how long it will take us, we \nwill win through to absolute victory. We will provide the firefighters \nand police officers and the construction workers and the cleanup \nworkers and the people and the children who go to school and live at \nground zero with the health care and compensation they justly and \nrightly deserve.\n  There are few things we do in Washington that are clearly a choice \nbetween right and wrong. There is no gray area when it comes to this \nissue. We truly have a moral and undeniable obligation to help these \nmen and women. For the past week on display in the Russell rotunda we \nhave shown 29 police badges that belonged to 29 members of the New York \nCity police force who died since September 11 because of the diseases \nrelated to those toxins that were released when the towers fell. The \n30th police officer, David Mahmoud, died last month of a very rare, \ndisfiguring form of cancer after he worked 60 hours at the site of \nground zero.\n  Perhaps the most disturbing fact about the deaths of these 30 police \nofficers is the fact that the average age of these men and women is 46 \nyears old.\n  The badges we displayed were not just a memorial to those we lost, \nthey are a call to action for each and every one of us who call \nourselves public servants and for those of us who are here to serve on \nbehalf of this Nation. Every single Member of the Senate should visit \nthat memorial today to see and be reminded of those men and women who \nhave perished. Over 13,000\n\n[[Page S8551]]\n\nWorld Trade Center responders are sick today and receiving treatment; \nnearly 53,000 responders are enrolled in medical monitoring and 71,000 \nresponders are enrolled in the World Trade Center Health Registry, \nindicating they were exposed to these toxins.\n  These men and women are from all over this country, from every State \nin the Union. In fact, approximately 10,000 individuals came from \noutside the New York area, including every State in this country, to \nsave lives and to clean up after the devastation that struck New York. \nTheir illnesses range from respiratory, gastrointestinal, and mental \nhealth conditions caused by the inhalation of pulverized cement, glass, \nlead and asbestos and other fatal toxins that were caused by the \ndestruction of those buildings on 9/11.\n  The James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act provides the \nproper congressional authorization and statutory structure to the 9/11 \nhealth programs that have received $326 million through annual \nappropriations since 2003. Our bill would establish the World Trade \nCenter health program within the National Institute for Occupational \nSafety and Health to provide permanent ongoing medical monitoring and \ntreatment for related conditions to the World Trade Center responders \nand community members.\n  The program administrator will establish a nationwide network of \nproviders so the eligible individuals who live outside of New York can \nreasonably access monitoring and treatment benefits near where they \nlive. These eligible individuals are included in the caps on the \nnumbers of participants in the responder and community programs.\n  I wish to emphasize one important aspect of this bill that typically \ngets overlooked. Our legislation will provide a level of accountability \nand transparency for the disbursement of funds that has not been seen \nup until this point with the current programs. It terminates all of the \nexisting six billing programs that were hastily put together in the \nchaotic aftermath of September 11, and establishes one third-party \nadministrator who will set reasonable rates, track expenditures, and \nenforce eligibility requirements. It will be 100 percent transparent \nand accountable.\n  Further, our bill limits the health program to 10 years and caps the \nnumber of people who can receive treatment at approximately 109,000 and \nlimits the treatment to respiratory, gastrointestinal or mental health \ndiseases that have already been medically certified to have been \nassociated with breathing the toxins and other hazards at ground zero.\n  Under this bill, the government is the payer of last resort. \nIndividual health insurance or funds from workers compensation claims \nwill all pay for treatment first. The Federal Government will only \ncover those after those first two payers pay. The city of New York is \nrequired to contribute 10 percent matching cost shares of the community \nhealth program.\n  The legislation will also formally reopen the September 11 Victims \nCompensation Fund to provide compensation for economic damages and loss \nfor individuals who did not file or did not become ill before the \noriginal cutoff date of December 22, 2003. The payments will be limited \nto $4.2 billion over 10 years.\n  Our bill would strictly enforce limits to attorney payments to 10 \npercent of the payments from the fund, and it would provide liability \nprotections for the World Trade Center contractors and the City of New \nYork, limiting liability of defendants for claims previously resolved, \ncurrently pending or filed through December 22 of 2031.\n  Last, I wish to emphasize this bill is entirely pay-go compliant. \nThat means the bill is paid for. It will not add to our debt or our \ndeficit. It is capped, mandatory funding that is offset completely by a \npay-for that closes a loophole that foreign companies use to avoid \npaying their fair share of U.S. taxes, which fundamentally makes our \ncompanies have to play on an unlevel playing field. We want to help \nAmerican businesses and that is what this pay-for does.\n  In closing, I wish to make it crystal clear what this bill is about. \nThis bill is about our first responders. This bill is about our heroes, \nand their families. This bill is about the victims who lived at ground \nzero. This bill is about the children who are currently suffering from \nasthma, the most vulnerable in our communities who could not tolerate \nthese toxins in their bodies.\n  I am going to tell you about three individuals whose stories are \nparticularly moving. At a time when most people were running away from \nlower Manhattan, Joseph Picurro rushed to the World Trade Center site \nto volunteer his expertise as an ironworker for these rescue efforts. \nFor 28 days Joe helped cut steel beams on the pile to find survivors \nand to clear debris, often sleeping on the floor of a nearby office \nbuilding, rather than returning to his home and his family in New \nJersey at night.\n  In the years following his dedicated work at Ground Zero, Joe was \ndiagnosed with sarcoidosis, a reactive airway dysfunction syndrome and \nsevere acid reflux. He suffered from constant joint pain, seizures, \nblackouts, and relied on dozens of different medications.\n  Unable to work for years, Joe had to fight to get his workers \ncompensation for his illness. In October, Joe passed away at the age of \n43. He left behind his wife and his daughter Allison. Joe's wife Laura \nrecently wrote me a note of plea. She said:\n\n       Our financial situation is bad--I mean bad. For 6 years \n     I've had to beg for help, borrow from family and I just can't \n     do it anymore, and shouldn't have to. We need to reopen the \n     Victim Compensation Fund.\n\n  This bill is also for people such as Frank Fraone of California. \nFrank was a division chief of the Menlo Park Fire Department in \nCalifornia. He was thousands of miles away from New York City on 9/11 \nfighting wildfires. Along with thousands of other brave men and women \nwho came from all across this country, Chief Fraone traveled to New \nYork to aid local rescue workers at Ground Zero. He had seen his fair \nshare of destruction during his career, but nothing had prepared him \nfor what he saw at Ground Zero.\n  He worked 16-hour days with fellow rescue workers inhaling that toxic \ndust that later left him with lower respiratory airway disease. Living \nacross the country, far from New York City, Chief Fraone still feels \nthe effects of working at Ground Zero, which he said limited his \nability to respond to other disasters such as Hurricane Katrina. Chief \nFraone has had difficulty getting health care in California for his \nailments, and says that:\n\n       Living out here in California, I cannot get confirmation or \n     talk face-to-face with anyone affiliated with [9/11] health \n     issues. I do not know to this date if I am going to be \n     covered for my health concerns. What happens when this health \n     issue disables me and I can no longer work or care for my \n     family?\n\n  Our bill would meet the needs of this division chief and this man and \nthis hero who came to help when he was needed.\n  The last story I wish to give is that of Robert Helmke. Police \nOfficer Helmke died at the age of 43 from stage IV metastatic \ncolorectal cancer caused by inhaling and swallowing the toxins at \nGround Zero. He was 43. I am 43. Robert worked numerous hours of duty \nat the World Trade Center. He ate food and unknowingly inhaled the \ntoxins while he was working. At no time while he was working at the \nsite was he instructed ever to wear protective gear or any kind of \nbreathing apparatus, nor was he told by our government that the air was \nin any way unhealthy or bad for him.\n  Stage IV metastatic colorectal cancer is a form of cancer that \naffects the upper GI tract. It is very rare in someone so young. He was \ntold that treatment would not cure him, that it would only help him to \nlive a little longer. I want to read to you his reaction to the \ndiagnosis in his own words. He said:\n\n       Talk about crushing news! My wife and I sat in the car and \n     cried as I asked her what did I ever do to deserve this. On \n     July 11th, 2006, I had major surgery to remove two tumorous \n     parts from my small colon and have radiation on the large \n     tumor in my liver. Before my surgery, I had four chemotherapy \n     treatments and was in an emergency room three times to be \n     treated for dehydration before finally having to go on an all \n     liquid diet and intravenous feeding. I have a wife, Greta, \n     and two young children, Garrett and Amelia, who have seen my \n     health worsen since participating in the World Trade Center \n     recovery. My favorite things in life are slowly being taken \n     away from me. My work, food, helping others and caring for my \n     family.\n\n  Officer Helmke died on July 28, 2007. These are the stories that tell \nus what this bill is about--men and women who\n\n[[Page S8552]]\n\nare suffering; men and women who have died; men and women who have \nsuffered so much because they did the right thing.\n  What message are we sending here from this body, this esteemed body, \nif we cannot help those who came to our rescue, who were there to find \nsurvivors, who were there then to find remains, and who were there to \ndo the cleanup when our government asked them to help?\n  You must remember the days after \n9/11. This country would have done anything to help those who had \nsuffered so much in New York and across this country. This was the most \ndeadly terrorist attack in the history of America. And now 9 years \nlater this body cannot come together to do what is right? This is the \nclearest example of right versus wrong that I have seen in this body in \nmy 2 short years.\n  We must recognize the undeniable obligation we have, a moral \nobligation to protect these men and women and their families because \nthey did the right thing. It is now time for this body to do the very \nsame.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of SFC Barry \nEdward Jarvis of the U.S. Army and Tell City, IN.\n  Sergeant Jarvis was assigned to the 1st Squadron of the 61st Cavalry \nRegiment, 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, KY. He was 36 years \nold when he lost his life on November 29, 2010, serving bravely in \nsupport of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan's Nangarhar \nProvince.\n  Sergeant Jarvis and his family moved to Indiana when he was a boy. He \ngraduated from Tell City High School in 1993 and finished Army basic \ntraining in 1998. A cavalry scout, Sergeant Jarvis was assigned to Fort \nCampbell in May of 2009 and deployed to Afghanistan 3 months later.\n  He was known by many as a genuine and dedicated soldier who found his \ncalling in serving his country, and his numerous awards and \ndecorations, including the Meritorious Service Medal, the Army \nCommendation Medal, and the Army Achievement Medal, bear out that \nreputation.\n  I join Sergeant Jarvis' family and friends in mourning his death. He \nis survived by his wife Tina Louise Jarvis of Clarksville, TN; his \nchildren Kitaira Aleesha, and William, also of Clarksville, and \nDonavon, of Evansville, IN; his father William Edward Jarvis of \nAtlantic Beach, FL; and his mother, Alma Jean Jarvis of Tell City, IN.\n  As we struggle to express our grief over this loss, we take pride in \nthe example of this American hero. We cherish the legacy of his service \nand his life.\n  As I search for words to honor this fallen soldier, I recall \nPresident Lincoln's words to the families of the fallen at Gettysburg: \n``We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this \nground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have \nconsecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world \nwill little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never \nforget what they did here.''\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of SFC Barry Edward Jarvis in the \nRecord of the U.S. Senate for his service to our country and for his \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "06", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/06/senate-section/article/S8553-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TAX CUTS\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, Nebraskans want both \nRepublicans and Democrats to work out a bipartisan plan soon that will \nextend all, or nearly all, of the income and other tax cuts which \nexpire on December 31, 2010. In today's votes, I opposed the first \namendment because it would raise taxes for a number of small businesses \nin Nebraska and nationwide, penalizing the best job creators in our \neconomy. I supported the second amendment extending the tax cuts for \nmost taxpayers because it won't affect most small businesses.\n  I believe that any revenue generated by ending tax cuts for some \nAmericans should go not for new government spending but to pay down the \nnearly $14 trillion debt. Debt reduction is essential for all \nAmericans' economic future, and for our Nation to remain the leader of \nthe free world. I will continue pushing for extending all of the tax \ncuts to provide the certainty, clarity, and continuity we need to get \nour economy going strong again. I hope the Senate will come together \nsoon to pass major tax cuts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "06", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/06/senate-section/article/S8553-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "06", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/06/senate-section/article/S8553-4", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "06", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/06/senate-section/article/S8553-5", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8553-S8554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that pursuant to \nsection 1002 of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 \n(Public Law 107-306) as amended by section 701(a)(3) of the \nIntelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (Public Law 111-\n259), and the order of the House of January 6, 2009, the Speaker \nappoints the following member on the part of the House of \nRepresentatives to the National Commission for the Review of the \nResearch and Development Programs of the United States Intelligence \nCommunity: Dr. Shirley Ann Jackson of Bridgewater, New Jersey.\n  The message also announced that pursuant to section 1 of the Library \nof\n\n[[Page S8554]]\n\nCongress Trust Fund Board Act (2 U.S.C. 154 note), and the order of the \nHouse of January 5, 2009, the Speaker appoints the following members on \nthe part of the House of Representatives to the Library of Congress \nTrust Fund Board for a 5-year term: Mr. Richard Fredericks of San \nFrancisco, California, Ms. Barbara Guggenheim of Los Angeles, \nCalifornia, and Mr. James Kimsey of McLean, Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "06", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/06/senate-section/article/S8554-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ENROLLED BILL PRESENTED\n\n  The Secretary of the Senate reported that on today, December 6, 2010, \nshe had presented to the President of the United States the following \nenrolled bill:\n\n       S. 3307.

Res. 695\n\n       Whereas the National Institutes of Health (referred to in \n     this preamble as the ``NIH'') Office of Research on Women's \n     Health (referred to in this preamble as the ``ORWH'') is a \n     leader in the national commitment to research, research \n     training, and science-based education programs on women's \n     health and sex differences research;\n       Whereas the ORWH was originally established in 1990 in \n     response to congressional, scientific, and advocacy concerns \n     regarding the lack of systemic and consistent inclusion of \n     women in NIH-funded clinical research and the lack of \n     scientific data and information regarding women's health;\n       Whereas the ORWH has made significant progress in \n     developing and implementing policies to ensure the inclusion \n     of women in NIH clinical research and, in this manner, has \n     encouraged the increased reporting in scientific literature \n     of sex- and gender-related factors in health and clinical \n     trial analysis;\n       Whereas the ORWH initiated the ``Building Interdisciplinary \n     Research Careers in Women's Health'' program in 1999 and has \n     supported the career development and advancement of \n     approximately 400 early-stage research scientists to become \n     independent researchers and obtain academic promotions at \n     major research institutions throughout the United States;\n       Whereas the ORWH initiated the ``Specialized Centers of \n     Research on Sex and Gender Factors Affecting Women's Health'' \n     program in 2002 to support interdisciplinary and sex \n     differences research, including basic, translational, and \n     clinical investigations, by accomplished scientists;\n       Whereas in 2009, the scientists participating in the \n     ``Specialized Centers of Research on Sex and Gender Factors \n     Affecting Women's Health'' program published 116 journal \n     articles, 176 abstracts, and 63 other publications;\n       Whereas the ORWH collaborates with NIH Institutes and \n     Centers to support basic, clinical, population, and \n     translational research in laboratory, clinical, and community \n     settings throughout the United States;\n       Whereas the ORWH pursues research efforts to benefit all \n     individuals burdened by diseases and disorders that are \n     within the scope of the mission of the ORWH, including men, \n     women, older and younger adults, children, minority \n     populations who are disproportionately affected by certain \n     diseases, people from economically-disadvantaged backgrounds, \n     and other understudied or underrepresented populations;\n       Whereas ORWH-supported research has dramatically increased \n     vital understanding of sex differences research, from single \n     cells to multiple biological systems and mechanisms, and has \n     prompted sex differences research in the fields of \n     endocrinology, immunology, epigenetics, systems biology, and \n     neuroscience, as well as in new technology-enabled fields \n     such as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics;\n       Whereas research conducted and supported by the ORWH has \n     been instrumental in revolutionizing policies, research, and \n     programs focusing on the health, prevention, diagnostic, and \n     treatment strategies for girls, women, and their families, \n     leading to remarkable improvements in health and quality of \n     life;\n       Whereas the ORWH sponsors education and outreach programs, \n     with materials tailored for diverse audiences, to improve \n     women's health by disseminating science-based information to \n     women and their families, those at risk for disease, health \n     care educators, and the general public;\n       Whereas the ORWH has initiated or participated in \n     collaborative and coordinated research efforts and science-\n     based public education programs in order to maximize the \n     Federal investment in research and synergize expertise across \n     the NIH, with other Federal agencies, and with public and \n     private organizations;\n       Whereas the ORWH has a farsighted research agenda for the \n     next decade entitled ``Moving Into the Future With New \n     Dimensions and Strategies: A Vision for 2020 for Women's \n     Health Research'' that is based on the culmination of a 2-\n     year strategic planning process, involving more than 1,500 \n     leading scientists, advocates for women's health, public \n     policy experts, health care providers, Federal, State, and \n     local elected officials, and the general public in 5 regional \n     scientific meetings;\n       Whereas the ORWH research agenda is visionary and addresses \n     the 6 major goals of--\n       (1) increasing the study of sex differences in basic \n     research studies;\n       (2) incorporating findings of sex differences in the design \n     and application of new technologies, medical devices, and \n     therapeutic drugs;\n       (3) actualizing personalized prevention, diagnostics, and \n     therapeutics for girls and women;\n\n[[Page S8556]]\n\n       (4) creating strategic alliances and partnerships in order \n     to maximize the national and international impact of research \n     on women's health;\n       (5) developing and implementing new communication and \n     social networking technologies to increase understanding and \n     appreciation of research on women's health; and\n       (6) employing innovative strategies to build a well-\n     trained, diverse, and vibrant women's health research \n     workforce; and\n\n       Whereas ORWH-supported initiatives and programs continue to \n     make strides in addressing the expanded concepts of women's \n     health across the entire lifespan of a woman, while \n     continuing to explore understudied areas of reproductive \n     health and the menopausal transition, developing distinct \n     research career paths for investigators in women's health, \n     sex differences, and interdisciplinary research, increasing \n     the number of investigator-initiated women's health research \n     studies in areas such as cardiovascular disease and stroke, \n     musculoskeletal and immune disorders, and mental health and \n     substance abuse, and increasing the scientific knowledge on \n     the health, diseases, disorders, and conditions that affect \n     diverse populations of women: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the 20th anniversary of the National \n     Institutes of Health Office of Research on Women's Health \n     (referred to in this resolution as the ``ORWH'');\n       (2) commends the ORWH for its leadership in women's health \n     research, research training, and science-based education \n     programs;\n       (3) recognizes ORWH-supported scientists whose studies have \n     improved women's health and whose research continues to yield \n     promising discoveries;\n       (4) recognizes the volunteers who participate in clinical \n     studies and the patient and professional health organizations \n     that contribute to the shared research goals of preventing, \n     treating, and curing the diseases and disorders within the \n     scope of the mission of the ORWH; and\n       (5) reaffirms the support of the Senate for the ORWH and \n     the continued commitment of the ORWH to carrying out research \n     to improve women's health.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "06", "month": "12", "url":

Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RELIEF OF SHIGERU YAMADA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. 4010.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 4010) for the relief of Shigeru Yamada.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I offer today private relief \nlegislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Shigeru \nYamada, a 28-year-old Japanese national who lives in Chula Vista, CA.\n  The Senate passed S. 124, a private relief bill on behalf of Mr. \nYamada on Friday; however, that version of the private relief bill did \nnot include an explanation of the zero budgetary impact of the bill. \nFor this reason, I am introducing and seek passage of a new version of \nthis private bill for Mr. Yamada, so that the Congressional Budget \nOffice's assessment of the zero budgetary impact of this bill can be \ntaken into consideration when this bill reaches the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Mr. Yamada legally entered the United States with his mother and two \nsisters in 1992 at the young age of 10. The family was fleeing from Mr. \nYamada's alcoholic father, who had been physically abusive to his \nmother, the children and even his own parents. Since then, he has had \nno contact with his father and is unsure if he is even alive.\n  Tragically, Mr. Yamada experienced further hardship when his mother \nwas killed in a car crash in 1995. Orphaned at the age of 13, Mr. \nYamada spent time living with his aunt before moving to Chula Vista to \nlive with a close friend of his late mother.\n  At the time of her death, Mr. Yamada's family was living legally in \nthe United States. His mother had acquired a student visa for herself, \nand her children qualified as her dependents. Her death revoked his \nlegal status in the United States. In addition, Mr. Yamada's mother was \nengaged to an American citizen at the time of her death.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 695, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 695) recognizing the 20th anniversary \n     of the National Institutes of Health Office of Research on \n     Women's Health and the continuing leadership and achievements \n     of the Office on Women's Health in conducting and supporting \n     biomedical research to improve women's health.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate one of the \ngreatest recent achievements in women's health--the 20th anniversary of \nthe founding of the Office of Research on Women's Health at the \nNational Institutes of Health. I could not be prouder of all that the \nOffice of Research on Women's Health has done for women's health, and I \nam honored to be a part of its history.\n  As an advocate of women's health, a supporter of scientific research, \nand a woman myself, this is an emotional day for me. Twenty years ago, \nwomen did not have much to celebrate when it came to scientific \nadvances. In fact, we were not even at the table. Remember that famous \nstudy that said, ``an aspirin a day keeps the doctor away''? That study \nincluded 10,000 men but not a single woman. The same went for the \nfamous study on heart disease factors: 13,000 men were surveyed but not \na single woman.\n  We had a big problem. Women were being systematically excluded from \nNIH clinical research. It was not sound science, and it was not \nacceptable. Our worst concerns were confirmed by a 1990 GAO report, \nwhich proved that women were not being included in clinical trials.\n  I had to do something about it. I remember it well: I called up my \nwomen colleagues, and they agreed. We piled into the car on a hot \nAugust day, and we drove to NIH in Bethesda, MD. Our aim was to \nassemble all 12 institutes, communicate our concerns, and see what \ngoals they could come up with to resolve this unfair exclusion. We \nshowed up: Connie Morella, Olympia Snowe, Pat Schroeder, and I--and so \ndid the TV cameras and Time Magazine. We made it clear that the time \nhad come to include women in scientific research, remember their place \nin the Federal budget, and treat them with respect.\n  We got Dr. Bernadine Healy appointed as the first female director of \nNIH, and that was a notable accomplishment. But we needed more. We \nneeded an Office of Women's Health at the NIH to be on the law books. \nSo Senators Kennedy, Harkin, Kassebaum, and I worked together to create \nand fund it in statute. The first thing that Dr. Healy did with that \nfunding was to put it toward the Women's Health Initiative, a now-\nfamous hormonal study that has helped decrease breast cancer deaths by \n15 percent, saving millions of lives.\n  Dr. Healy then appointed Dr. Vivian Pinn to serve as the first \ndirector of the Office of Research on Women's Health, ORWH. These women \nempowered researchers to look at disease in a gender-specific way, such \nas heart disease and depression. They also made great strides in breast \ncancer and cervical cancer research, as well as AIDS research and \nmapping the human genome. None of this would have been possible just a \nfew years earlier. And it would not have been possible without my dear \nfriend, Dr. Ruth Kirschstein. She led the fight for women's health on \nthe inside of the scientific community, and I was proud to help her \nfrom the outside.\n  Today, we are keeping up the fight. There are now 17 women in the \nSenate, and women's health is one issue that always brings us together. \nDuring the health reform debate, we would not stand for insurers \ntreating gender as a preexisting condition or for restricted access to \nmammograms and other preventive care. That is why I introduced the \nwomen's health amendment--the first amendment to pass during the Senate \nhealth reform debate--that provides preventive care for women with no \nco-pays and no deductibles and ends gender discrimination in health \ncare. I was proud when my amendment passed the Senate 61-39. We also \nincluded the Women's Health Office Act in health reform, so that now \nall women's health offices throughout the Department of Health and \nHuman Services are set in law. That means we have offices of women's \nhealth standing sentry for drug approvals, mental health and substance \nabuse issues, quality measures, and public health initiatives that will \nhelp women.\n  But our work goes on. To quote my dear friend Teddy Kennedy, ``The \nwork goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives and the dreams \nshall never die.'' I thank the people who made the Office of Research \non Women's Health a reality. I thank the office itself for all of its \nhard work, and I look forward to another 20 years of ground-breaking \ndiscoveries.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I note that the main mover of this matter is \nSenator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland. She worked very hard to recognize \nthis important office, and she did it for a number of reasons, some of \nwhich I worked with her on.\n  There was a massive study done on the effect of aspirin on people \ntaking it as a way to alleviate heart problems. I don't remember the \nexact number, but a huge number of people were tested--like 10,000. But \nthere was not a single woman. It was all done with men. That kind of \nraised the ire of Senator Mikulski.\n  We found, in doing this, that there were many situations where the \ndiseases we focused on were diseases related to men. An example is \ninterstitial cystitis--a disease I got involved in early on, about the \nsame time we did this. Interstitial cystitis is a disease where 90 \npercent of the people who have it are women. It can best be described \nas the pain is like shoving slivers of glass up and down someone's \nbladder. The pain is excruciating and awful. It was a disease that \npeople said was psychosomatic because it was only women who had the \nproblem, so they overlooked it. If it had been men--and we were an all-\nmale legislature at the time--I am sure it would have gotten more \nattention. I added my assistance to Senator Mikulski, and we were able \nto establish a protocol. Now people understand this, and it has made a \nlot of progress. This is one example of why the work of Senator Barbara \nMikulski has been so important.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and that any statements \nrelated to this resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S8558]]\n\n  The resolution (S. Res. 695) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 695\n\n       Whereas the National Institutes of Health (referred to in \n     this preamble as the ``NIH'') Office of Research on Women's \n     Health (referred to in this preamble as the ``ORWH'') is a \n     leader in the national commitment to research, research \n     training, and science-based education programs on women's \n     health and sex differences research;\n       Whereas the ORWH was originally established in 1990 in \n     response to congressional, scientific, and advocacy concerns \n     regarding the lack of systemic and consistent inclusion of \n     women in NIH-funded clinical research and the lack of \n     scientific data and information regarding women's health;\n       Whereas the ORWH has made significant progress in \n     developing and implementing policies to ensure the inclusion \n     of women in NIH clinical research and, in this manner, has \n     encouraged the increased reporting in scientific literature \n     of sex- and gender-related factors in health and clinical \n     trial analysis;\n       Whereas the ORWH initiated the ``Building Interdisciplinary \n     Research Careers in Women's Health'' program in 1999 and has \n     supported the career development and advancement of \n     approximately 400 early-stage research scientists to become \n     independent researchers and obtain academic promotions at \n     major research institutions throughout the United States;\n       Whereas the ORWH initiated the ``Specialized Centers of \n     Research on Sex and Gender Factors Affecting Women's Health'' \n     program in 2002 to support interdisciplinary and sex \n     differences research, including basic, translational, and \n     clinical investigations, by accomplished scientists;\n       Whereas in 2009, the scientists participating in the \n     ``Specialized Centers of Research on Sex and Gender Factors \n     Affecting Women's Health'' program published 116 journal \n     articles, 176 abstracts, and 63 other publications;\n       Whereas the ORWH collaborates with NIH Institutes and \n     Centers to support basic, clinical, population, and \n     translational research in laboratory, clinical, and community \n     settings throughout the United States;\n       Whereas the ORWH pursues research efforts to benefit all \n     individuals burdened by diseases and disorders that are \n     within the scope of the mission of the ORWH, including men, \n     women, older and younger adults, children, minority \n     populations who are disproportionately affected by certain \n     diseases, people from economically-disadvantaged backgrounds, \n     and other understudied or underrepresented populations;\n       Whereas ORWH-supported research has dramatically increased \n     vital understanding of sex differences research, from single \n     cells to multiple biological systems and mechanisms, and has \n     prompted sex differences research in the fields of \n     endocrinology, immunology, epigenetics, systems biology, and \n     neuroscience, as well as in new technology-enabled fields \n     such as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics;\n       Whereas research conducted and supported by the ORWH has \n     been instrumental in revolutionizing policies, research, and \n     programs focusing on the health, prevention, diagnostic, and \n     treatment strategies for girls, women, and their families, \n     leading to remarkable improvements in health and quality of \n     life;\n       Whereas the ORWH sponsors education and outreach programs, \n     with materials tailored for diverse audiences, to improve \n     women's health by disseminating science-based information to \n     women and their families, those at risk for disease, health \n     care educators, and the general public;\n       Whereas the ORWH has initiated or participated in \n     collaborative and coordinated research efforts and science-\n     based public education programs in order to maximize the \n     Federal investment in research and synergize expertise across \n     the NIH, with other Federal agencies, and with public and \n     private organizations;\n       Whereas the ORWH has a farsighted research agenda for the \n     next decade entitled ``Moving Into the Future With New \n     Dimensions and Strategies: A Vision for 2020 for Women's \n     Health Research'' that is based on the culmination of a 2-\n     year strategic planning process, involving more than 1,500 \n     leading scientists, advocates for women's health, public \n     policy experts, health care providers, Federal, State, and \n     local elected officials, and the general public in 5 regional \n     scientific meetings;\n       Whereas the ORWH research agenda is visionary and addresses \n     the 6 major goals of--\n       (1) increasing the study of sex differences in basic \n     research studies;\n       (2) incorporating findings of sex differences in the design \n     and application of new technologies, medical devices, and \n     therapeutic drugs;\n       (3) actualizing personalized prevention, diagnostics, and \n     therapeutics for girls and women;\n       (4) creating strategic alliances and partnerships in order \n     to maximize the national and international impact of research \n     on women's health;\n       (5) developing and implementing new communication and \n     social networking technologies to increase understanding and \n     appreciation of research on women's health; and\n       (6) employing innovative strategies to build a well-\n     trained, diverse, and vibrant women's health research \n     workforce; and\n\n       Whereas ORWH-supported initiatives and programs continue to \n     make strides in addressing the expanded concepts of women's \n     health across the entire lifespan of a woman, while \n     continuing to explore understudied areas of reproductive \n     health and the menopausal transition, developing distinct \n     research career paths for investigators in women's health, \n     sex differences, and interdisciplinary research, increasing \n     the number of investigator-initiated women's health research \n     studies in areas such as cardiovascular disease and stroke, \n     musculoskeletal and immune disorders, and mental health and \n     substance abuse, and increasing the scientific knowledge on \n     the health, diseases, disorders, and conditions that affect \n     diverse populations of women: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the 20th anniversary of the National \n     Institutes of Health Office of Research on Women's Health \n     (referred to in this resolution as the ``ORWH'');\n       (2) commends the ORWH for its leadership in women's health \n     research, research training, and science-based education \n     programs;\n       (3) recognizes ORWH-supported scientists whose studies have \n     improved women's health and whose research continues to yield \n     promising discoveries;\n       (4) recognizes the volunteers who participate in clinical \n     studies and the patient and professional health organizations \n     that contribute to the shared research goals of preventing, \n     treating, and curing the diseases and disorders within the \n     scope of the mission of the ORWH; and\n       (5) reaffirms the support of the Senate for the ORWH and \n     the continued commitment of the ORWH to carrying out research \n     to improve women's health.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "06", "month": "12", "url":
