Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Economic Stimulus\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have learned this morning that the \nunemployment rate has gone to 7.2 percent. Percentages don't mean much \nto a household in which one spouse comes home and says: Honey, I lost \nmy job. We have seen now more than 2.5 million people lose their jobs \nin the last 12 months. We face a very severe and deep financial crisis. \nThere is no question\n\n[[Page S240]]\n\nabout that. There has not been a debate in the Senate about whether \nthere is a problem. This is probably the first area of agreement. There \nis a big problem with this economy.\n  The question is, What do we do about it? What can give people \nconfidence that we can pull this economy out of the ditch and try to \nprovide for growth and opportunity and expansion once again?\n  It is interesting. I read in the newspaper yesterday that the New \nYork Yankees offered a pitcher $22 million a year to pitch for the next \n8 years. So not all of the economy is in deep trouble, apparently. \nThere is at least one baseball team and one pitcher smiling today. But \neven as we read those kinds of stories, many American families are \nworried about losing their jobs and their homes, concerned about what \nthe future holds. I wanted to talk about that today.\n  All of us understand the economic engine of America has stalled. All \nof us understand the mechanics of starting an engine. If the engine of \nthe ship of state is stalled, I am all for hooking up jumper cables and \ntrying to start it. That is the discussion we had in our caucus for 2 \nhours yesterday--about what kind of emergency actions can jump-start \nthe economy, what kind of jumper cables or hand crank or whatever \neffort one wants to make will help get the economy up and running \nagain. The point I made yesterday was, that is important to do, and I \nsupport it. But we ought to focus like a laser if we are going to spend \nmoney we don't have to put together an emergency plan for some sort of \neconomic recovery. That means we are going to borrow money. If we are \ngoing to borrow money at a time of escalating substantial Federal \ndeficits, I want every single penny to go toward creating a job that \nwill put somebody back on the payroll and give their family hope for \nthe future.\n  This is all about building confidence. But even as we do that, if we \nignore the fundamental requirement to rewire this engine, then we have \nmissed the boat. By rewiring, I mean this financial system has \ncollapsed. The biggest names in finance have collapsed. They have been \nthe recipient of hundreds of billions of dollars of Federal help. We \nhave to rewire the whole thing. If we don't rewire that system and make \nbasic fundamental reforms, we will not restore confidence in the \nAmerican people about the financial system going forward. That means \naccountability looking back and accountability looking ahead.\n  It means making certain we end what we have seen created in recent \nyears--a house of cards. I have the house on top because this starts \nwith an unbelievable scandal in the mortgage industry, subprime \nlending, and so on. I know we read in the papers about Mr. Madoff \nhaving absconded with $50 billion of investor money by building a Ponzi \nscheme. The tongue and groove of all of the rest of this fits and is no \ndifferent than the Ponzi scheme of Mr. Madoff. It was brokers, mortgage \nbankers, investment banks and hedge funds. It was collateralized debt. \nIt was securitized instruments. It was exotic structured financial \ninstruments created for one purpose: to give everybody a lot of money \nas they all wallowed in the creek. So the fact is, we have to fix it.\n  Everybody is talking about jump-starting economy, putting people back \nto work. I am all in favor of doing that, but I want to make certain we \nrewire this system. I want to talk a little about what needs to be \ndone.\n  Let me say also that people who created this wreck, the people who \nsteered this country into the ditch, are not going to be the ones who \nshow up with an ambulance. They will not be the ones we will turn to \nfor advice on how to fix it. That is just a fact. My great worry is we \nhave already authorized $700 billion for the Treasury Department's \nTroubled Asset Relief Program. Isn't it interesting that the title of \nthat program has nothing to do with what is happening? I didn't vote \nfor it because I didn't think those who requested it had the foggiest \nidea what they were going to do with it. The request came from the \nSecretary of the Treasury saying: I need $700 billion in emergency \nmoney, and I need it in 3 days. Here is a three-page bill to do it. \nThat made no sense. He wanted to relieve financial institutions of \ntroubled assets.\n  Why did they have all these troubled assets? Because they were greedy \nand dumb, buying things that now in retrospect had very little value \nand very big risk. So we ended up with the biggest financial \ninstitutions in the country having massive amounts of assets on their \nbalance sheets that have lost value.\n  So the Treasury Secretary said: Give me $700 billion of taxpayer \nmoney so I can go buy those bad assets and relieve those poor companies \nof these failed assets. So the Congress voted for $700 billion, $350 \nbillion of which was made available right away.\n  The Treasury Secretary then decided: I really don't want to do that \nat all. I don't want to buy troubled assets, despite the fact that is \nin the name of the program. What I would like to do is provide capital \nfor big banking institutions so they can expand lending because that is \nthe circulatory system of our economy. We need to expand lending.\n  So a rather substantial amount of money was given to the biggest \nfinancial institutions, $125 billion in one tranche to nine of the big \nfinancial institutions. It was essentially no-strings-attached money. \nThe money was provided to those financial institutions without saying \nto them: By the way, you have to use this to expand lending in order to \ndeal with the credit freeze. There were no restrictions that said: If \nyou take this money, you can't then give it out in executive bonuses. \nIn fact, we now have a report from December of last year on the \nTroubled Asset Relief Program by the GAO. It says:\n\n       The standard agreement between Treasury and the \n     participating institutions does not require that these \n     institutions either track or report how they plan to use or \n     do use this money.\n\n  Isn't that unbelievable? We gave all this money to the biggest banks, \nand there is no requirement that they track or report on how they plan \nto use or do use the money? Then when a number of them were asked what \nthey did with the money by the GAO, many executives of those companies \nsaid: Well, money is fungible. They don't intend to track or report \nwhat they did with that capital.\n  That is unbelievable to me. This is apparently some sort of no-\naccountability Government. There is nothing I am aware of, of course, \nin the U.S. Constitution that decides this is the way that \nrepresentative Government ought to perform.\n  But when the Treasury Secretary came to the Congress, along with the \nChairman of the Federal Serve Board--talk about secrecy, by the way, \nthat is another institution that has another story attached to it--but \nthey came to the Congress--the two of them; the head of the Fed and the \nTreasury Secretary--and here are the kinds of things we heard from \nthem: We need oversight. We need protection. We need transparency. I \nwant it. We all want it.\n  Well, the administration the Treasury Secretary works for--after he \ntold us that--has failed. This is a Washington Post report: The \nadministration has failed to establish sufficient oversight over its \n$700 billion program and must move rapidly to guarantee that banks are \ncomplying with the limits on conflict of interest, lavish executive \ncompensation. So they say, yes, we agree. Give us the money. There will \nbe oversight. And we discover: Well, there is no oversight at all.\n  The Federal Reserve Board, they are refusing to identify the \nrecipients of almost $2 trillion of assistance backed emergency loans \nfrom American taxpayers. They refuse to identify the troubled assets \nthey are accepting as collateral. The Federal Reserve opened it window \nfor the first time in history to noninsured banks. They have all kinds \nof programs now to move money out. I understand there is an urgency \nhere, but I do not understand why the American taxpayers are told: By \nthe way, you are the guarantor of a lot of these debts, you are going \nto pick up the pieces, and you are going to pay for it, but we are not \ngoing to tell you what it is we are doing. Mr. President, $2 trillion \nof emergency loans for troubled assets and they say: You don't deserve \nto know. We are not going to tell you.\n  In fact, Bloomberg, the news organization, had to sue the Federal \ngovernment to try to get details about the\n\n[[Page S241]]\n\ntotal has gone out in terms of guarantees and capital which, by the \nway, is over $8 trillion. It does not mean we are going to lose all \nthat. My point is, why should a news organization have to sue the \nGovernment in order to give the American people some information about \nhow much they are on the hook for with all of this emergency activity?\n  About $8.5 trillion is what we have discovered as a result of \nBloomberg and the work of some other enterprising reporters. It \ncertainly is not the work of a Federal agency that has come to the \nCongress to say: Oh, by the way, here is exactly what you need to know. \nIn fact, just the opposite has happened. The Federal Reserve program \nhas about $5.5 trillion now they have engaged. I understand that is an \norganization that prints money, but I also understand that \norganization, in the end stage, is an organization created by the U.S. \nCongress, and any liabilities existing there are liabilities of the \nAmerican people. The FDIC program is $1.5 trillion; the Treasury \nDepartment, $1.1 trillion; and Federal housing, $300 billion. That is, \nat this point, a compilation of about $8.5 trillion of liability that \nexists out there.\n  Now, I want to make a couple points before I try to describe what has \nhappened and what I think should happen.\n  This has been a consumer-driven economy. It is not surprising. I \nbrought to the floor of the Congress one day a whole stack of letters. \nAt that point, I had a 12-year-old son, and the Diners Club had written \nto my son offering him a credit card, preapproved, suggesting perhaps a \ntrip to Europe would be in line. So I brought that and probably a dozen \nor two dozen other solicitations to my children from credit card \ncompanies--from MasterCard and Visa and Diners Club and American \nExpress--all of them writing to my kids. Obviously, they had no idea \nwhose kids they were or how old they were. They were just names in some \nsort of a name bank. They were writing to them to say: Here is a \npreapproved credit card for you. Go have a good time.\n  What has happened all across this country is they are wallpapering \ncollege campuses with credit cards. It is unbelievable. On most college \ncampuses, many kids don't have a job. They are going to school. Yet \ncredit card companies understand that is the best place to go find a \ncustomer.\n  So there are credit cards all around, wallpapering the entire country \nwith credit card solicitations. In fact, if you have another card, get \nrid of it. Bring it to us. We will charge you zero interest for 3 \nmonths. We don't tell you, by the way, if you have a little problem one \nmonth, we are going to jack your rate up to 25 percent or whatever it \nis they are doing these days in rates and fees.\n  The fact is, that dramatic runup in the last couple of decades in \ncredit card debt has been unbelievable, and that is what has been \nsupporting a substantial amount of the consumption.\n  In addition, about $300 to $350 billion a year has been supporting \nadditional American consumption because of the increase in home values \nwhich, of course, represents that huge bubble that was created in home \nvalues. That allowed people to believe they had more money because \ntheir home was more valuable and they could borrow against the home, \nand that contributed another $350 billion to the economy. But it was a \nsubstantial amount of consumer initiative coming from credit card debt \nand from home values that they could borrow against which it turns out \nwere illusory increases in home values because those values have now \ncollapsed.\n  My point is that our consumer-driven economy was driven by, in some \ncases, fumes that are not going to be around in the future, and we are \nnot going to be able to replicate that to build a new economy with that \nsame kind of debt consumer-driven initiative.\n  As you know, about at that point, oh, 8, 10 years ago, as the bubble \nbegan to develop in home values, there was this issue of thinking that \neverybody could make a lot of money by developing new and exotic \nmortgages for homes and putting people into their homes who probably \ncould not buy a home or finding people who were in existing homes and \nsaying to them: You are paying way too much. So what happened was, a \nhuge industry developed in this country. Even as they were securitizing \ncredit card debt and selling it back upstream, they began to develop a \nnew industry to finance homes, and then found a way to securtize those \nhome mortgages and sell those back upstream as well.\n  This is what we began to see in this country. Everybody saw it. All \nyou had to do was watch your television set and you saw the commercial \ncome across. This was Countrywide, which was the biggest bank: Do you \nhave less than perfect credit? Do you have late mortgage payments? Have \nyou been denied by other lenders? Call us.\n  The biggest mortgage company in the country said: Are you a bad \nperson because you can't pay your bills? Are you a bad credit risk? Do \nyou have lots of trouble? Are you buying things you can't pay for? Hey, \nI tell you what, we have a deal for you. Come. We will give you a loan. \nThat is Countrywide.\n  By the way, this company failed and has been purchased by someone \nelse. But the head of this company, Mr. Mozilo, was given the Horatio \nAlger award as one of the best executives in America, and from what I \ncan tell, he it appears to have walked away with about $200 million. So \neven though his company is gone and he does not have the job he had, he \ncertainly cannot be weeping, or if he is, he is wiping his tears with \n$200 million of cold cash.\n  So it was not just Countrywide. Millenia Mortgage--again, we saw all \nthese. This was not some dark secret: Twelve months no mortgage \npayment. That's right. We will give you the money to make your first 12 \npayments on your home. Just call in 7 days. We will pay it for you. Our \nloan program could reduce your current monthly payment by 50 percent \nand allow you to make no payments for the first 12 months. Just call \nus. Pretty enticing, right? You want a home, you want a mortgage, you \ndon't want to make a payment for a year. No problem. Just call us up.\n\n  ZoomCredit. ZoomCredit says in their advertisement: Credit approval \nis seconds away. Get on the fast track at ZoomCredit. At the speed of \nlight, ZoomCredit will preapprove you for a car loan, a home loan, or a \ncredit card. Even if your credit is in the tank, ZoomCredit is like \nmoney in the bank. ZoomCredit specializes in credit repair, and debt \nconsolidation, too. Bankruptcy, slow credit, no credit--who cares?\n  Can you imagine a company that says: I have a new model. We are so \nproud of our company, we actually specialize in giving credit to people \nwho don't deserve it?\n  Now, does one wonder--when companies such as this sprang up all over \nthe country--why our economy is in a wreck, why we have experienced \nthis economy being driven into the ditch by a lot of bad people? Three \nmortgage companies--and, oh, by the way, just in case you are \nwondering, is it over? No.\n  This is from the Internet: Low-doc loans and no-doc loans. What does \nthat mean? It means if you go to the Internet, you can still find a \ncompany that says, just as the others did: We have a new financial \ninstrument for you that is really intriguing--no documentation of your \nincome. That is right. We will loan you money without you having to \ndocument your income to us. Does that sound ignorant? It does to me. \nBut we will charge you a higher interest rate in exchange for your \ndeciding not to document your income. No-doc loans: no doc, no payments \nfor the first 12 months. And, oh, by the way, when you do first start \nmaking payments, you don't have to make any payments on principal, just \ninterest. If that is not good enough, we will give you a no-doc loan, \nno payments for 12 months, no principal, and you don't have to pay all \nthe interest because we will wrap the principal and some of the \ninterest on the back side. Does anybody wonder why we had a financial \nwreck?\n  So we had all these companies put out this sort of Ponzi scheme. Yes, \nMadoff is apparently a pretty awful guy because he ran a Ponzi scheme \nof $50 billion, it appears to me. This was all a Ponzi scheme as well, \nand everybody was involved in it.\n  So these mortgage companies put people in these mortgages called \nsubprime mortgages, and then the broker made a lot of money because the \nbroker was able to get people into these mortgages. And I did not \nmention, they put prepayment penalties into the mortgages so you could \nnot pay it off early or you had a big penalty? Then they wrapped it \ninto a big\n\n[[Page S242]]\n\nsecurity. They put all of them together, like you put a snowball \ntogether, in a big security--that is called securitization--and then \nyou sell it. So you sell it to perhaps an intermediary or perhaps you \nsell it to a Wall Street firm that takes a look at it and says: That is \npretty good. That has a high rate of return because you have prepayment \npenalties and all these things, and the interest rates were really low, \nbut they reset in 3 years to be really high. What a good deal. So I am \ngoing to buy these securities.\n  Everybody is buying securities like hogs in a trough. The brokers are \nmaking money. The mortgage company is making massive amounts of money. \nThe people who are securitizing it are making money. The big investment \nbanks are making money. In fact, the current Secretary of the \nTreasury--his firm and four other firms came to the Securities and \nExchange Commission one day in 2004 and said: What we need you to \nprovide is some relaxation for us so we can take on more debt to buy \nmore of these kinds of securitized instruments and make more money.\n  In the basement, deep in the bowels of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, after a hearing, by unanimous vote, the SEC, for the \ncompany that was headed by the current Treasury Secretary and four \nother of the largest investment banks, said: It is OK. We will allow \nyou to take some of this money you set aside in the event of failure of \nyour assets--the reserves--and you can take some of those reserves and \nuse them now to make more money by these investments. That meant some \nof those firms went from 12 times leverage to 30 times leverage.\n  Isn't that unbelievable? They were all fat and happy, making money \nleft and right. And then the whole thing crashed. That financial \nscandal, this subprime scandal, took this country right to the edge of \na cliff. It was not just this, but it was led by this, and it was \nespecially this.\n  At the same time all of this carnival of greed was going on in this \ncountry--at the same time we were spending, in budget policy--President \nBush leading the charge; and Congress, Republicans and Democrats, a \npart of it--spending in fiscal policy way beyond our means, $600 \nbillion a year. Oh, I know the reported budget deficit was $400 billion \nlast year. It was not $400 billion. What your deficit really is is what \nyou had to borrow for the year. That was over $600 billion. So we were \n$600 billion out of balance in fiscal policy, and that is going to be \nover $1 trillion this year.\n  Then add to that a trade problem of $700-plus billion a year, \nconsuming 3 percent more than you produce every year--year after year \nafter year--and then energy prices on a roller coaster. Oil runs way up \nto $147 a barrel in day trading, just like that, and then collapses \nright back down, and now goes back up because of the circumstances in \nthe Middle East between Israel and the Palestinians. Then health care \nis busting everybody's budget--the family budget, the business budget, \nthe Government budget. All of those together is an almost perfect \nstorm.\n  So the question is, What do we do about all that because this economy \nis a mess? It is in very serious trouble, and the one thing that unites \nme and the smartest economist or the most prescient business mind in \nthis country is that neither of us have ever been here before. We are \nwalking in woods that have no maps. We do not know. None of us know \nexactly how you are going to move people out of this situation, how you \nmove this country. I taught economics in college ever so briefly but I \ndo know this: This is not about charts and bar graphs, and it is not \nabout supply demand curves. It is all about confidence. Will we see the \nrestoration of confidence? Because if people are confident about the \nfuture, they do things that manifest that confidence. If they are \nconfident about themselves and their jobs, they buy a suit, they buy a \ncar, buy a home, take a trip; they do the things that expand America's \neconomy. If they are not confident, they do exactly the opposite. They \ndefer the purchase. They decide not to take the trip, not to buy the \ncar. That is the contractional side of the business cycle, but this is \nmuch more than a business cycle. Still, confidence is at the root of \nour opportunity to put this country back on track.\n\n  I have great hope for this country, but I wish to say this again. I \nhave described some of the unbelievable circumstances of the carnival \nof greed that has led us into this economic trap, and if we don't \naddress both sides of this issue--first, to try to jump start this \nengine of ours and rewire it at the same time--but if we don't at the \nsame time, then, make those in this kind of financial industry \naccountable for past actions and for future actions, we will not in any \nway give the American people confidence about the future.\n  So the question of what do you do in addition to a recovery package \nor stimulus program--which I will speak about in a moment--the question \nof what you do in addition to that leads me to the discussion I had \nwith my colleagues last evening. I said we must revisit unbelievably \nbad decisions and judgments that have been made in the last 10 and 15 \nyears. For example, in 1999, the Financial Modernization Act was passed \nby this Congress; financial modernization to help create the large \nfinancial holding companies, to take away the Glass-Steagall Act--\nabolish the very act that was put together following the Great \nDepression that said: You have to separate banking interests from risk \ninterests. You have to separate securities and you have to separate \nreal estate. That was Glass-Steagall. You have to keep them separate. \nIn 1999, this Congress, in legislation called Gramm-Leach-Bliley, after \nSenator Phil Gramm from Texas, said: You know what. We have to do \nsomething that modernizes our financial system. We have to get rid of \nGlass-Steagall. We have to create big bank holding companies. We have \nto allow that to be the case, and we have to allow banks to merge with \nreal estate, with insurance, with securities.\n  Now, I was one of eight Senators to vote no. On the floor of the \nSenate, here is what I said in 1999: This bill will, in my judgment, \nraise the likelihood of future massive taxpayer bailouts.\n  I regret I was right.\n  It will fuel consolidation and mergers in the banking and financial \nservices and it will be done at the expense of the American people.\n  I said at the same time in that debate: I say to people who own \nbanks--talking about the folks who pushed this--and, by the way, this \nwas pushed because one large bank wanted to merge with one large \ninsurance company and they couldn't do it because the law wouldn't \nallow it. What is the response? We will go get the law changed. It \nwasn't just this Congress; it was President Clinton and his advisers--\nsome of whom, by the way, are going to work in this new administration. \nThey said all of this is good. We are going to modernize the system. I \nthought it was nuts. Three years before this, I had written a cover \nstory for the Washington Monthly Magazine, talking about derivatives \nand what I had previously described as securities sold upstream by the \nbig mortgage companies, and the title of my cover story, in 1994, I \nbelieve it was, in Washington Monthly Magazine: ``Very Risky \nBusiness.'' From that time, I have introduced five pieces of \nlegislation to require the regulation of derivatives and to prohibit \nbanks from trading on derivatives on their own proprietary accounts but \nto no avail because there were too many people who believed we need to \nmodernize the system--meaning, they said, take away the restrictions \nthat were put in place after the Great Depression. Take away the \nrestrictions that prohibited banks from engaging with real estate and \nsecurities and other things that were risky. Well, they succeeded. I \nfailed in stopping it. The fact is, it is what set up this \nunbelievable, spectacular financial collapse in this country. The \nquestion is: Now what?\n  I am going to introduce some legislation today, and I wish to talk \nabout, specifically, the requirements of the legislation. I am not \nwilling--as I was not willing last fall on the $700 billion proposal--I \nam not willing to advance assistance proposals unless the American \npeople are protected. I am going to introduce the Taxpayer Protection \nAct that does four things that are tough, certain, and require \naccountability. I don't know whether there is the support or the \nstomach to pass this kind of legislation, but I will not be advancing \nsupport for additional taxpayers' money until and unless we have some \nassurance that these things are done. First of all, establishing a \nFinancial Market Investigation and Reform Commission.\n\n[[Page S243]]\n\n  Back at the end of the Roaring Twenties, which, by the way, the \nhistory books will certainly compare the era of the Roaring Twenties \nwith the Gay Nineties and the unbelievable excess and greed--but at the \nend of the twenties and early thirties, the Congress put together a \ncommittee that investigated and subpoenaed and brought people here to \nfind out what happened, who did it, how did it happen, and what do we \ndo to stop it from ever happening again. That needs to be done again. \nThere ought to be a select committee of the Congress doing that right \nnow, and I hope we will do that. Some will say: Well, we have existing \nauthorizing committees in the Congress that can do that. The fact is \nthey are not going to do it. They have never done it and will not do \nit. If we don't put together those kinds of committees or commissions \nhere and now and issue subpoenas and discover what happened, we will \nnot know how to prevent it from happening again. We need to establish \nthat reform commission to investigate and then propose reforms. That is \nthe rewiring portion of what I described.\n  Second: I want all emergency economic assistance programs, including \nthe troubled asset relief program--the $700 billion that I didn't vote \nfor, but others did--to have oversight, accountability, and \ntransparency. That needs to be required for all of that. There is no \noversight for $7.8 trillion in emergency economic assistance at this \npoint that has been issued by the Federal Reserve Board. No oversight \nat all. None. The same requirements in the TARP program ought to be \napplied to every other bailout by the Fed or by the Treasury or others \nproviding similar help.\n  Third: we should make conditions imposed on one company receiving \nemergency economic aid applicable to all companies, and that is limits \non executive compensation, prohibiting bonuses and golden parachutes, \nand payment of dividends and private aircraft ownership, and more. We \nshould require those private entities receiving the emergency economic \nassistance to be subject to audit, provide detailed monthly reports, \ntell us: What did you do with that money? Is that money advancing the \neconomic interests of this country to put this country back on track?\n  Finally, we should create a Taxpayer Protection Prosecution Task \nForce to investigate and prosecute financial fraud cases and other \nviolations of laws that contributed to the collapse of this country's \neconomy.\n  It is unbelievable to me that a couple things conspired at the same \ntime. One, Congress passes the Financial Modernization Act, which was a \ncomplete disaster for this country. Two years later, President Bush \ncame to town and hired a bunch of folks who were supposed to be \nregulators who, actually, in some cases, boasted: We don't intend to \nregulate. We want to be willfully blind. That combination has injured \nthis country in a very significant way.\n  Our country's financial markets--the Wall Street Journal said in an \narticle by Arthur Levitt on October 23--are in their darkest hours in \n76 years. We are in this situation because of an adherence to a \nderegulatory approach. Our regulatory system failed.\n  I know there are people I serve with who think regulation is a four-\nletter word. It is essential. The free market must, in certain areas, \nhave proper regulatory authority.\n  Alan Greenspan, who bears a significant part of this responsibility \nas then chairman of the Fed, here is what he says now: I made a mistake \nin presuming that the self-interests of organizations--specifically \nbanks and others--were best capable of protecting their own \nshareholders and their equity. What he was saying, if I translate this \nto English, he was saying: I believed in self-regulation, or I believed \nin no one regulating because they will self-regulate.\n  I come from a small town and a small school. I graduated in a high \nschool class of nine. That wouldn't pass a laugh test in second grade. \nJust let them all go and they will do what is in the country's best \ninterests? That is unbelievable to me.\n  So we have a lot of work to do. The banking system after 1999 evolved \nso that we had a lot of banks that were considered too big to fail, but \nthey weren't big enough to regulate, apparently. Too big to fail, which \nmeans that if they get in trouble, we are the ones who are going to \npick up the costs. We bear the burden. We will be responsible. But they \nare not big enough to regulate, so they get the best of all worlds. \nThey get taxpayer protection with no requirements, no accountability. \nThis is just a few of them.\n  Let me make an aside. Even as I have described on the floor of the \nSenate in the past, some of the same firms that, by the way, require \nbailouts are firms that have been so irresponsible in other areas. Yes, \nI am upset about the way these mortgages were put out. I am upset about \nthe greed and the avarice and all the money people were making; one guy \nmaking $20 million a year and his buddy making $30 million a year, \nrunning one of the biggest investment banks into the ground, by the \nway. One of the biggest bailouts has been of one of the biggest \ninvestment banks. To my knowledge, nobody lost their jobs, nobody \nparked their airplanes.\n  Wachovia Bank. Wachovia Bank went sour, so they had to be purchased, \nbut it wasn't just because they were involved in toxic assets. Wachovia \nBank--it is a culture apparently here. They had bought a German sewer \nsystem. You might ask the question: Why would an American bank buy the \nsewer system of a German city? Because they like sewers? Because they \nhave a sewer department in the bank? Because they have special \nknowledge of sewers? No. They bought a German city's sewer system and \nleased it right back to the city because you are not going to dig up \nthe sewer pipes of a German city, right? Why would you want to own it \nin a German city? Because you can lease it right back. It is a big scam \nbecause you can reduce your U.S. tax bill to the U.S. Government by \nhundreds of million of dollars.\n  I shouldn't pick on Wachovia because there are plenty of others who \ndid it. This happens to be a convenient case. A big old bank buying a \nsewer system of a German city so they can avoid paying U.S. taxes. By \nthe way, the same company got in trouble with bad assets; part of the \nwhole scam in terms of what happened with the scandal of the subprime \nsystem that steered this country into the ditch.\n  Now, let me say that this issue of President-elect Obama proposing to \nus a stimulus program or economic recovery program is a very important \nissue for us to consider. I am a chairman of one of the subcommittees \non appropriations. We are working on my portion of this effort to find \nout what could we invest in, in what some call ``shovel ready jobs'' \nthat will put people to work immediately. There are water programs, \nhighways, bridges, schools, things we can do that will put people to \nwork and do it immediately, put people back on payrolls. At the end of \nthat expenditure, you have better schools, better roads, better \nbridges, and water projects that will enhance life. So those are the \nright things to do. But we all know there are plenty of people who have \nproposals that have nothing to do with putting people back to work. I \nam very concerned about that.\n  I am also concerned about the tax side of this. We are talking about \n40 percent of this proposal representing the tax side. I think there \nare some things we can do in the tax system to encourage investment \nwhich encourages employment. Here are some of the proposals I have \nmade: $250,000 expensing for small business equipment so we encourage \nthe decisions to make or buy or build equipment right now. That puts \npeople to work. So there are some things on the tax side that I think \nmake some sense, but I worry about 40 percent on the tax cut side. No \none is going to have a problem saying: Yes, give us a tax cut. \nEverybody likes that.\n  But the proposition on the expenditure side, a whole lot of folks are \ncoming in with projects that have nothing to do with creating jobs. I \ndon't want to be part of that. Money is going to be borrowed in any \nevent. We need to get this right. I am willing to participate, and I am \nwilling to support the kinds of investments that will put people back \nto work and create an asset for our country--better roads, better \nbridges, better schools, water projects that we need for the future. I \nam willing to do all that if it puts people back to work. But we ought \nto be looking\n\n[[Page S244]]\n\nwith a laser at what is it that will put people on payrolls to try to \njump-start the economy.\n  Even if we do that, if we don't rewire this system and do the \nfinancial reform I described in the legislation I am introducing today, \nwe are not going to succeed because the people will not be confident \nabout the future.\n  We have to fix what has helped cause this scandal, and that includes \nfixing a trade system where we consume 3 percent more per year than we \nproduce, fixing a trade system where we have $700 billion a year trade \ndeficit, fixing a fiscal policy budget situation that is way out of \nbalance. We have to do all those things.\n  I would not be able to come to work in the morning if I were not \nhopeful. I still have great hope for this country. I am an optimist. \nYes, I want to look back and hold people accountable. I want subpoenas, \nand I want to prosecute wrongdoing. I want to do all those things with \nrespect to this financial scandal. I think it is big. I think a whole \nlot of folks took the $30 million, and they are at home and they are \nwiping their tears with American currency while a lot of other people \nhave lost their homes and their jobs. I want us to investigate. I want \naccountability looking back, and I want accountability going forward. \nAll of that is very important to me. But I do want to say this: I am \nsomebody inspired by the ability of this country to recover and to ask \nthe American people to be a part of something bigger than themselves \nand to come together and do things that will pull up this country, lift \nthis country.\n  The other day, I was reading a news report of a guy, and I was so \ninspired by it. It is so typically American of somebody out there--way \nout there thinking: I can do this. I read about a guy named Ken Mink. I \ndon't know Ken Mink from a cord of wood.\n  Ken Mink comes into the house one night and says to his wife: Honey, \nit is back.\n  She said: What is back?\n  He is 73 years old.\n  Honey it is back.\n  What is back?\n  My shot.\n  He had been out shooting baskets in the backyard.\n  My shot--I am shooting baskets. I am not missing any.\n  He had been a college basketball player, and because of a prank, he \ngot kicked out of college. At the age of 73, he is shooting baskets in \nhis backyard and says: Honey, it is back.\n  So he sat down and wrote applications to college. A junior college \nsaid: Yes, we will give you a shot; you can come to school here and try \nout for the basketball team. At the age of 73, Ken Mink played \nbasketball with a junior college team just a month ago and made two \nfree throws. He was the oldest man, I think, by 42 years to ever score \na point in a college basketball game. Isn't that wonderful? It is so \ninspiring that people don't know what they can't do.\n  As an aside, my Uncle Harold is 88 years old, and he is training for \nthe Senior Olympics because he qualified to go to San Francisco to run \nin the 100-meter dash. He runs it in under 19 seconds, by the way, at \nage 88. My aunt thinks he had a stroke, she thinks he has gone crazy \nbecause he runs all over the country running races. My uncle is 88 and \ncan run faster than most people his age and has 100 medals. I am \ninspired by my Uncle Harold and by Ken Mink, and I am inspired by \npeople who don't know what they can't do.\n  I hope in the coming days when we talk about all the ingredients of \nall the issues, the proposals that are complicated and difficult, I \nhope all of us will understand, if we ask the American people to be a \npart of something bigger than themselves, to help this country recover \nand put this country back on track. You go back over two centuries of \nhistory, and there is not much this country cannot do. There is just \nnot much America cannot do. This is a country that rolls up its sleeves \nand has great hope for the future.\n  I know my colleague from Oklahoma is here to speak. I appreciate his \nforbearance. I will be back Monday to talk some more about these \nissues.\n  There is no social program in this country as important as a good job \nthat pays well. The reason I say that is the root of giving people hope \nabout the future is to have opportunities for the American people to \nfind a good-paying job, keep a job that has some benefits, to give them \nan opportunity to take care of their families. That is where we start.\n  I hope in the coming days, as we discuss and work on these issues, we \nwill have the opportunity to call on what is the best in this country \nrather than the worst and come together and do what we can to restore \nto America the kinds of opportunities we have always felt will exist \nfor our children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business, the time I might consume not to exceed 1 hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, let me give some praise to my chairman of \none of my committees. He hit right on the nose. Confidence is what the \nAmerican people need to see. We have great resources in this country, \nand I am not talking materially. The resource we have that is the most \nbountiful and most productive and strongest and made of steel is the \nAmerican people. When we get together, united as a nation, there is not \nanything we cannot accomplish.\n  I appreciate his words very much. I also appreciate some of his \nwisdom and foresight we heard today. I am hopeful that in the months \nand years to come, we can continue to work and we can draw on that \nAmerican spirit which he so directly outlined, which is what makes us \nunique and allows us to come from behind and accomplish the things in \nfront of us. I thank him for his words.\n  I wish to spend a few minutes--we are going to have several votes \nbetween now and next week over the Bingaman lands bill. I thought we \nought to spend some time today to do that since I know we won't want to \ncome in early on Sunday. I wish to talk about procedure for a moment so \nwe can understand.\n  We are going to be here on Sunday not because we have to but because \nthe majority leader has decided that we will. There are other things we \ncan be accomplishing. And goodness knows, the problems in front of this \ncountry require extra effort on our part. We are going to have a $10 \nbillion to $12 billion bill in front of us again that will have no \namendments available to it and very limited discussion. As a matter of \nfact, I think I am the only one who has discussed anything on this bill \nthus far, and we probably will not see a lot of discussion.\n\n  There are a lot of issues we need to address, and my colleague, \nSenator Dorgan, just outlined the most important of them; that is, \nconfidence, how do we reestablish confidence in this country. It is my \nposition that we are not going to reestablish confidence in the country \nuntil we reestablish confidence in this institution.\n  Since July 16, the Republicans have had one amendment allowed on the \nfloor of the Senate. In the last 6 months, one amendment--that was \nSeptember 10. In 6 months of legislation, we have had one amendment \nallowed to the minority side to express the views for greater than 50 \npercent of the American people.\n  If the Senate is about anything, it is about the ability to debate \nand amend the interests of the American people. What we have seen over \nthe past 6 months is that the rights of Americans have been taken away \nin terms of discussion, debate, and amendment of the very large issues \nthat are in front of us.\n  My position on this bill--which the American people should know is a \nhodgepodge of a ton of bills; it is not just all lands bills--is about \npriority. It is about reestablishing confidence. It is about doing the \nmost important things that are of the highest priority for our country \nand not doing the things that are of the lowest priority even though it \nmay make us look extremely good back home.\n  Some will contend this is just an authorization bill, that it doesn't \nspend any money whatsoever, that it will have to be appropriated. I \nremind them there is mandatory spending in this bill, so there is \nactual spending involved.\n  Also--and I won't do this, but I am prepared to do so if I need to--I \nwill\n\n[[Page S245]]\n\noffer into the Record the press releases of everybody talking about all \nthe money that is going to be spent because of this bill. You cannot be \non the Senate floor saying this does not spend any money and at the \nsame time send a press release out telling your constituency that you \njust passed a bill that will spend money that will do something because \nyou are actually creating a false expectation if you don't expect to \nappropriate the money.\n  So let's be clear about why we cannot afford to pass this bill. It \nhas to do with a whole lot of things. One is we cannot continue to \noperate the Senate where there are no amendments for the minority \nbecause what it does is it cuts off the voice of over half the American \npublic, by populations that are represented by the minority. But there \nare other greater reasons.\n  We have a $10.6 trillion debt at this point. We are going to have a \n$1.8 trillion deficit next year. That is $1.2 trillion as a minimum \nestimate by CBO, which does not include the $160 billion we will steal \nfrom Social Security and will not include half of the money that is \ncoming in a stimulus package. If you take 300 million Americans and \ndivide them by $1.8 trillion, what you get is $6,000 per man, woman, \nand child that we are going to run in the red next year, real dollars, \nreal loss in the future, and we are going to have to pay that back \nsometime. The people in this room, the Members of the Senate are not \never going to be attached the cost of the price to pay that back.\n  Last year, we paid $230 billion in interest alone. That is about $900 \nper man, woman, and child in this country--$860, actually--that we are \npaying in interest, which is going to double over the next 4 years. So \nnot only are we going to run a $6,000 deficit, we are going to run \nanother $800 in interest costs that are going to take away the \npotential of families across this country who are struggling, and that \nis what we are going to put into their future.\n  So when my colleague talks about confidence, what I want the American \npeople to see is us working on the real problems that are at hand, not \nproblems that are not real or are not a priority.\n  We offered several amendments. We were told we were getting no \namendments to this bill. I am going to spend some time going through \nthose amendments because I think a lot of them make sense. I am also \ngoing to spend the majority of my time talking about the main reason I \noppose this bill.\n  If you will recall, back in the summer we were paying $4 for \ngasoline. We saw oil at $146 a barrel, which is now around $40. And the \nassumption of this bill is we will never see high oil and gas prices \nagain. The very time to be fixing our future energy needs is now, not \nwhen there is a crisis again.\n  What this bill does is essentially take 1.3 trillion barrels of oil \nin this country and say: You can never touch it. That is 1.3 trillion \nbarrels that we will never, ever--regardless of our technology, \nregardless of whether we can do it totally without any impact \nwhatsoever on the environment, we will never be able to touch it under \nthe auspices of this bill. It takes 9.3 trillion cubic feet of known \nnatural gas that is in proven reserves right now, enough to fuel this \ncountry for 2\\1/2\\ years, and it says: You cannot touch that; you can \nnever touch it. And then another couple hundred trillion cubic feet \nthat are known to exist, with the technology that is here today.\n  Why would we do that? We just went through a big problem, and because \nwe are in an economic cycle, we are seeing the only benefit of that is \nlower energy costs. Yet through this bill, we are going to tie the \nhands of our children for available energy.\n  This is not about whether you believe in global warming or \nCO2 as an anthropogenic gas because even if I agreed with \nthat 100 percent, and everybody would agree with it, we are going to \ntake 20 years to transition away from hydrocarbons. Every dollar we \nsend out of this country for the purchase of energy is part of that \n$700 billion my colleague, Senator Dorgan, just noted as one of our big \nstructural financial problems. So why would we pass a bill that is \ngoing to eliminate our ability to achieve some greater level of energy \nindependence?\n\n  Another area of why I oppose this bill: property rights are--should \nbe--pristine in this country, and this bill adds 15 new heritage areas, \nand the Federal Park Service will then fund those who are against the \ndevelopment of the land around it or in it, against the homeowners, the \nlandowners who are actually part of it, through zoning. Even though \nseveral of the individual bills in this bill put a prohibition on \neminent domain, the vast majority of the bill has no prohibition on \neminent domain.\n  One of the rights fought for, one of the foundational principles of \nthis country, is property, the right to have and hold property and be \nfree, as long as you are not endangering somebody else with that \nproperty. Yet we are going to step all over that with this bill. Five \nseparate property rights groups who recognize this is a protected \nguarantee under the Constitution have come out supporting the defeat of \nthis bill because it tramples on property rights.\n  Finally, one of the reasons I am opposing the bill is the fiscal \nnature of what it does. It sets in motion $12 billion ad infinitum over \nthe next 5 years--year by year by year by year--that we are going to \nspend, and it is going to go into the mix of priorities that are not a \npriority. Now, there are some things in this bill, I will admit, 20 or \n30 items, that should go through here. But the vast majority of the \nbills in this mega bill are not a priority for this country. They are \nnot a priority whatsoever right now considering the condition in which \nwe find ourselves. So as we contemplate this bill, I believe it \ndemonstrates that we are more interested in looking good at home than \nfixing the real problems that are facing the country.\n  So let me for a moment summarize the bill and highlight some of the \nthings that are in it, and then ask the American people to answer this \nquestion: Should we add four new National Parks at a time when we have \na $9 billion backlog in maintaining the parks we have today? We can't \neven take care of the parks we have today. We have 10 million gallons \nof raw sewage in Yellowstone, in the Grand Tetons, which seeped out \nbecause we didn't maintain the pipelines. We have a $700 million \nbacklog on The National Mall; in Lake Mead, NV, a $258 million backlog.\n  We are not addressing any of the backlogs whatsoever. Yet we are \ncreating greater responsibilities for the National Park Service and the \nresources they have today. In a declining discretionary budget, because \nof the fiscal nature in which we find ourselves, we are going to make \nworse and worse this situation. We are going to create 10 new heritage \nareas and study 15 others.\n  Now, remember what happens when we create a new heritage area. We \ncreate the inability to ever extract minerals, oil, gas, timber, and \nother resources. We are saying: Off limits and, by the way, if you like \nto enjoy the outdoors--maybe you want to go hunting or maybe you want \nto ride a three-wheeler or four-wheeler or a motorcycle--that may not \nbe available to you. It may be limited.\n  There are 19 separate provisions in this bill that directly withdraw \nFederal land from mineral leases, such as oil and gas and geothermal. \nNineteen specific. That doesn't have anything to do with the \nundergirding statutes in terms of the National Park Service, the Bureau \nof Land Management, and heritage areas that will eliminate the \nopportunity for exploration of energy and make us more energy \nindependent.\n  There are 130-plus bills in this legislation, 1,300 pages, that was \nintroduced two nights ago. I will tell you, other than my staff and \nprobably the committee staff, nobody in this body has looked at it--\n1,300 pages. It is going to get passed out through the body next week, \nand the vast majority of the Senators and their staffs will have never \ntaken a look at it, at a time when we should be about building \nconfidence not undermining it.\n  We have 1.2 million acres in one small area of Wyoming that in the \n1960s, 1970s, and 1980s contained the greatest and largest and most \npowerful pressurized source of natural gas the country had ever seen. \nAs a matter of fact, we didn't have the technology to handle it, so we \ncapped it. It eliminates any additional leasing. It sets it up so those \npeople who have a lease will have a lawsuit filed against them. It will \nnever be developed. It will never be developed because the cost of \nfighting the\n\n[[Page S246]]\n\nlawsuits will be greater than the benefit of developing the natural \ngas. The companies that developed that came from Oklahoma. We now have \nthe technology to handle that. It is a proven reserve.\n  We have 92 new scenic rivers in this bill. Now, I am all for scenic \nrivers, but we should understand the consequences of a scenic river \ndesignation. What does it mean? There will be no power lines across it, \nthere will be no transmission lines, there will be no natural gas \npipelines, water pipelines, or slurry lines that can cross a scenic \nriver. What we know, with our desire to use alternative energy, \nespecially in terms of the Southwest for solar and in my part of the \ncountry on up through the wind corridor, is that we are going to have \nto develop transmission lines, probably up to 40,000 miles of \ntransmission lines, and we are going to double the cost of developing \nthose lines because we would not be able to cross a scenic river. There \nis a prohibition in this bill.\n  We will eliminate the ability to take the natural gas that is \navailable in abundance in Alaska today, in proven known quantities, and \nthe pipeline that is scheduled to come down to the greater 48 will be \ntripped up by these designations. Again, another way to shoot ourselves \nin the foot when energy independence ought to be part of our goal.\n  The people who want to do the things in these bills are highly \nmotivated for good reasons, but the judgment is suspect at the time in \nwhich we find ourselves. We find ourselves dependent on energy and in a \nfinancial mess. Yet we are going to make both of those problems worse \nwith this bill.\n  Today, in this country, we have 108 million acres of developed land. \nNow, that is cities, that is manufacturing sites, that is towns, and \nthat is highways. That is all of it. We have 109 million acres right \nnow of wilderness designation already, which is twice what was ever \nthought about being accomplished when the wilderness designation was \nfirst started in the 1950s and early 1960s. Then the Government owns \nanother 656 million acres of land. So we are not only robbing the \nfuture from our children because we have been fiscally irresponsible, \nwe are robbing their future potential to make decisions about \nindependence and freedom in the future because we are going to be \ntotally indebted in the 20 years that we transition from a carbon-based \neconomy to a noncarbon-based economy. We are going to make that \nextremely painful, much more difficult, and extremely more expensive.\n\n  Let me talk about why the National Park Service is overburdened for a \nminute and the things we ought to be doing. We have in Hawaii the USS \nArizona Memorial. Now, 1,117 Americans died on that ship. The visitors' \ncenter--and if you have ever been there, you go out on a boat to the \nvisitors' center--is sinking. The maintenance backlog is about $33 \nmillion. What are we going to do? What should we be doing? Creating \nthese new ones or should we take care of the memorial for the USS \nArizona? Which one is a priority? Should we maintain what we have or \nshould we do something and say we did it through a press release, even \nthough we are probably not going to have the money to do much of this, \nand create a false sense of expectation with the American people?\n  The Gettysburg National Battlefield has a $29 million backlog; the \nStatue of Liberty Park, a $197 million backlog right now. Remember when \nLee Iacocca helped to raise funds for the Statue of Liberty in 1976, \nand we did all that. That is the last time we have done any regular \nmaintenance. So we have let it fall down. We haven't been responsible. \nWe haven't put the money there. As a matter of fact, today President-\nelect Obama, in a press conference, asked for ideas as to how to spend \nmoney that will actually create jobs and create an investment. Well, I \ncan tell you how I would spend the money. Let's fix up our parks, let's \nfix up The Mall, let's take care of the $29 million backlog we have on \nsome of the greatest treasures we have in this country before we add to \nthe maintenance headaches of the National Park Service by creating new \nNational Parks. That is a way we could actually create some jobs and \ninvest our money; things we are going to have to invest in someday \nanyway.\n  The Grand Canyon National Park has a $299 million backlog. These \naren't my numbers, these are National Park Service numbers. And there \nis the National Mall, as I talked about earlier.\n  What is in this bill that doesn't make sense just from a commonsense \nstandpoint, maybe something we should do at the right time? How about \nspending $5 million to compensate ranchers for losses from gray wolves \nthat we reintroduced into the wild? We put them back in there, and now \nwe are going to pay ranchers for the cattle they lost to them. We \nrepopulated a species that is now overgrowing its habitat and coming \nonto private lands, and our answer to that is, well, we will just pay \nthe losses.\n  Do we have the money to waste $5 million paying for cattle losses \nfrom wild wolves? We might at some point in time. I hardly think we \nhave the money to do that right now. The ranchers aren't going broke. \nThere is no question it is an irritation and a cost to them, but I am \nnot sure the Federal Government ought to be responsible for the cost.\n  What about the coyotes in Oklahoma that kill our sheep and our \nchickens? Should we compensate the chicken farmers and the sheep \nfarmers for the coyotes that kill their livestock?\n  How about $1 billion and counting on the San Joaqin River project to \nmake sure we restore 500 salmon? You heard me right--$1 billion is \ngoing to be spent over the next 10 years, and then money after that, to \nmake sure we restore at least 500 salmon. How does that fit with our \npriorities? It may be something that we ultimately ought to do. How is \nit that we should do that now? Why should we even be thinking about \ndoing that? How does that fit with any air of common sense?\n  How about building a road to 800 residents, after we provided a \nhovercraft to get there? One hundred environmental groups are against \nbuilding this road through a very pristine area. We do have access \nanother way. Yet we are going to do that, and we are going to spend $2 \nmillion per mile over 17 miles, building a one-lane road that many \ntimes is not going to be accessible in the winter, through some of the \ngreatest pristine areas that we have. Therefore, 100 environmental \ngroups are adamantly opposed to including this in this bill. You can \nunderstand why they think that might not make sense for protecting such \npristine land.\n  This is my favorite: $3.5 million to the city of St. Augustine, FL, \nto plan--just to plan--for a birthday party 16 years from now for the \n450th birthday of St. Augustine, FL. Does that restore confidence in \nthe Senate, that we would say we are going to spend $3.5 million on a \ncity that has been having a birthday party every year? Yet we are going \nto put another $3.5 million into the kitty to plan for a big one? There \nis no doubt we should recognize the historic significance of the \nlongest lived settlement in this country at 450 years. But the question \nis, in today's economic climate, is that something we should be doing? \nWho out there without a job today would agree that we should do such a \nthing?\n  How about spending a quarter of a million dollars to go down to the \nVirgin Islands to study whether Alexander Hamilton's old home down \nthere ought to be made into a park? Is that a priority now? What would \na quarter of a million dollars do for somebody who is unemployed right \nnow? How many mortgages would it get people out from behind who are in \narrears? How many people would not default if we could leverage \n$250,000 to them? We have our priorities messed up.\n  The reason there is a lack of confidence in the Congress, with an \napproval rating of 9 percent, is because it is deserved.\n  There is also $12 million for us to build a new greenhouse for \norchids for the Arboretum. We may need to do that. There is no question \nwe should preserve the things that mark our heritage. But is now the \ntime to build a new greenhouse in Maryland to grow orchids? Is it the \ntime? What can we do with that $12 million? Who could we help with that \n$12 million? Could we use it in a better, more efficient way so that \nthe American people would benefit? If we are going to spend $12 \nmillion, couldn't we spend it in a better way?\n  My State has Route 66 all through it. We have all these tourism \nthings that are in this bill. Now is not the time for\n\n[[Page S247]]\n\nus to be working with grants to promote Route 66 in Oklahoma. Now is \nthe time to be putting that money to work on something that is going to \ncreate a job or save a foreclosure or absolutely make a difference in \nsomebody's life, not an aesthetic benefit of the past. We need to start \nthinking about the benefits of the future.\n  I talked about the Wyoming range. It will be disputed by the Wyoming \nSenators, but the fact that the Bureau of Land Management used the \nlatest geologic data and their study uses one that is 2 years old and \nmakes the assumption that all land in Wyoming is the same would refute \nsome of my statistics. But all of the geological engineers in this \ncountry and all the oil and gas exploration would remind us of the \ntremendous loss we are going to achieve by cordoning all that off and \nnot making it available.\n  I talked about the wilderness designations. I am not against, \nnecessarily, new wilderness designations as long as we limit their \nimpact on property rights. But we do not. As a matter of fact, they \ndirectly impact property rights. They directly limit individual \nproperty rights. So as we add wilderness areas and zoning requirements \nwithin them, we take away the right of the landowner because we fund a \nspecialized group through the National Park Service to change the \nproperty rights to the disadvantage of the property owner. People who \nhave no ownership in it will decide what the property's zoning rules \nwill be because they will be funded by the Federal Government. If you \nare opposed to that, you are disadvantaged because the Government is \ngoing to send dollars to your opponent, so we attack property rights at \nthe very basic level. Not only do we challenge them, we take your own \nmoney and support your opponent on what you can and cannot do with your \nown property.\n  I love scenic rivers. We have the Illinois River in Oklahoma. It is a \nbeautiful, pristine river. It has had some tributary problems, but we \nactively worked and cleaned it up and it is markedly improving every \nday. It is a real pleasure.\n  Should every river in America be a scenic river? And, if it is, how \nare we going to cross them with utility lines, power transmission \nlines, natural gas lines, coal slurry lines, bridges, roads? How are we \ngoing to do that? We can't. Yet the goal of some is to make everything, \nevery river, a scenic river. Now is not the time for us to do that \nbecause it will limit our ability to achieve greater energy \nindependence.\n  Those are not just threats. A 2001 lawsuit was filed against the U.S. \nForest Service for failure to protect wild and scenic rivers in Arizona \nbecause a transmission line was coming across a 30-yard segment of it. \nGuess what happened. We didn't build the transmission line, so power \nwas not made available.\n  As we think about wind energy and solar energy, especially in the \nSouthwest in the wind corridor, it will do us no good to put windmills \nout there if we do not have a way to send that energy somewhere else. \nYet with this bill there are multiple instances, over 50 instances, \nwhere we are going to block our ability to send transmitted power to \nother areas of the country.\n  In 2002, on scenic rivers, the lawsuit was won that said within the \ncollection territory of the Los Padres National Forest in California we \nwill not ever permit oil, gas, or mineral development within the river \ncorridor. What happens if we can drill from outside? What if we can \nsend a line 20 miles from the outside? What we are doing is we are \nsaying no matter what the technology you ever develop, no matter how \nyou ever attempt to make us energy independent, it is never going to be \nOK; we are never going to allow it.\n  If you look at what this bill does in terms of geothermal--this is \nthe potential geothermal source of energy. It is clean, renewable in \nthis country. We markedly go after some of the most potent areas of \ngeothermal availability in this bill. We say you can't use them. We can \nuse geothermal--clean, alternative energy. But because we want to look \ngood, because we want to say we did something, we changed that.\n  Just so we might all be informed about how much land the Government \nactually owns, as you can see in the Western States, in Alaska, the \nvast majority of the land is owned by the Government. But that is not \nnearly as significant as what is happening with this bill because large \nportions of what is not owned by the Government now is very difficult \nto develop because when we try to get a permit for extraction of \nminerals, geothermal, gas, coal, or oil, it is hit with lawsuit after \nlawsuit.\n  Now, in addition to these high percentages, nearly 50 percent, we are \nadding all these other things on top of it, the vast majority of which \nare moving to the west. It makes no common sense, no matter whether you \nare an avid global warming enthusiast or you are an energy explorer, if \nwe want to stay warm in the winter, it doesn't make sense to anybody.\n  Mr. President, 29 percent of all the land in this country is owned by \nthe Federal Government. We are markedly increasing that by 2.2 million \nacres in this bill. We are going to threaten property rights. We are \ngoing to use eminent domain. We are going to use very sophisticated and \npoised sleight-of-hand zoning requirements to change land that is not \nowned by the Federal Government--to change the ability of the owner of \nthat land to use that land if we pass this bill.\n\n  There are about 40 of the bills in this bill that we don't have any \nproblem with. They make sense; they don't cost a lot of money; they \naccomplish some of the things that are a priority. Let me spend a \nminute, if I might, just talking about the amendments we were going to \noffer had we had the ability to offer them. I note again, since July 16 \nthe minority has had the opportunity to offer one amendment in this \nbody, one amendment. In the greatest deliberative body in the world, \nthe minority has had the opportunity to offer one amendment.\n  One amendment we wanted to offer that I thought made sense: ``No \nfunds can be made available . . . to establish a new unit of the \nNational Park System or National Wilderness Preservation System, a new \nNational Heritage Area . . . new Wild and Scenic Rivers, new wilderness \nareas . . . until the Secretary of the Interior certifies that the \nmaintenance backlog at the Statue of Liberty National Monument, Grand \nCanyon National Park, Yellowstone National Park, Glacier National Park, \nGettysburg National Park, Antietam National Battlefield, the National \nMall'' in Washington, are up to date.\n  Why wouldn't we want to take care of what we have now before we add \nto it?\n  The Grand Canyon cannot even keep its trails open right now, or \nemployees, due to lack of funding. There are 10 million gallons of raw \nsewage in Yellowstone. The Pearl Harbor USS Arizona Memorial is \nsinking. The manager of the Glacier National Park declared his park \nbankrupt--the manager. His words: ``We are bankrupt.''\n  At Gettysburg the number of employees has gone down. Their ability to \nmaintain that significant monument to the history of us coming back \ntogether through war, through the results of ending that war and the \ntremendous number of lives that were lost on that day, General \nPickett's charge--the fact is, we are ignoring them. According to some, \nthe National Mall has now become a national disgrace because it is not \nmaintained. We are going to see some of the great difficulties with \nthat when we swear in our next President, with the tremendous burden \nbeing placed on it.\n  Eleanor Holmes Norton, the delegate from DC, said we should be \nashamed of what the average Mall visitor sees. It is not a priority. We \nmade it politically expedient. We made looking good at home a priority. \nWe have not taken care of our national treasures.\n  The second amendment we offered, having been through this crush of \nenergy price escalation, what we did was to prohibit new restrictions \non American exploration and production--new restrictions; have not \nchanged any of the old ones; we just said: Let's not put any more \nroadblocks in the way right now until we have a cogent energy policy \nthat does not put us at the mercy of the nations that would like to see \nus destroyed. That is all we said: Let's not hurt ourselves any worse.\n  But let me show you what occurs in this bill 19 times. Here is what \nit says:\n\n       Subject to valid existing rights, all Federal land within \n     this proposed area is withdrawn from all forms of entry, \n     appropriation or disposal under the public land laws (in \n     other words, we can never sell it) location, entry\n\n[[Page S248]]\n\n     and patent under the mining laws, or disposition under all \n     laws relating to mineral or geothermal leasing.\n\n  It says that 19 times. What we have done is we have completely \nexcluded any ability to get any energy. The ability for us to solve our \nenergy problems over the next 20 years is being tremendously hampered \nby this bill. That does not include the 2.2 million acres that are \nadded to the wilderness area.\n  Amendment 3 to strike the Wyoming Range leasing withdrawal \nprovision--if we can extract natural gas and oil and do it in a totally \nclean, environmentally friendly way and we know we have 300 million \nbarrels of oil and 8.8 trillion cubic feet, probably closer to 15 \ntrillion cubic feet of proven reserves now, why would we take that \naway? Why would we do that? Tell me how it makes sense to tell OPEC: \nKeep doing what you have been doing through the years because we know \nwe have some oil, but we are never going to touch it. In the fields \naround this Wyoming Range, we know there are another 30 trillion cubic \nfeet of natural gas.\n  Locking the resources away is not a partisan issue. My colleague from \nLouisiana, Senator Landrieu, claims this bill is moving us backward, \nnot forward.\n  Amendment 4 was to strike the $1 billion and counting for 500 salmon.\n  Amendment 5 was to not spend $3.5 million on a birthday party for St. \nAugustine, FL, even though it is not directed at--Florida beat Oklahoma \nlast night. It is kind of hard for me to offer that today thinking that \nis just revenge, but I wrote this long before we lost that game.\n  Cut the $200,000 for a tropical botanical garden in Hawaii. Should we \nbe spending $200,000 on a tropical botanical garden right now? I mean, \ndoes it make sense to anybody in America, when we are going to have a \n$1.8 trillion deficit, that we just throw $200,000 out there for a \nbotanical garden? Is that a priority? I am not suggesting that we \nabandon everything, but what I am suggesting is that we ought to be \nabout priorities, and I cannot see that as a priority at this time.\n  How about a cave institute in New Mexico to receive unlimited Federal \nfunding, an authorization that puts no limits on this funding. What \nhappened is this used to be a Federal program, but it could not take \nprivate money. So they took it and made it to where it was a private \nprogram, hoping to get matching money from Federal grants. Well, they \nwere not successful in getting matching money for Federal grants, so \nnow we are going back and saying it is going to be a Federal program \nand it gets all the Federal money it wants. Is it a priority for us to \nhave a cave institute right now? I do not think it is a priority.\n  An amendment to limit Federal employees from using eminent domain to \ntake away the private property rights of American citizens. We either \nhave a right or we do not. But the more we take away property rights, \nit is not going to be long before we lose other rights. Simple, \nstraightforward amendment, vote it up or down, but at least let the \nAmerican people see where you stand on property rights for them.\n  How about an amendment, very straightforward--the Federal Government \ndoes not know what it has and what it does not have. How about an \nannual report detailing the amount of Federal property the Federal \nGovernment owns and the cost of Government land ownership to taxpayers. \nAs an aside, we do know the Federal Government is currently holding \nabout $20 billion worth of property that is costing them about $4 \nbillion a year to maintain that they do not want but we can't sell. And \nlast year, property disposal legislation failed to go through this \nbody, even though it costs us $4 billion a year. Common sense.\n  How about to make sure we can always have a hunting preserve in this \ncountry, to limit the restriction on hunting activities as far as the \nland use on Federal lands with reason, control. We have lots of Federal \nlands that are overpopulated with species that need to be thinned. Yet \nwe limit the ability of sportsmen to address that.\n  There were several others. We do not expect to get all of those \namendments or the rights for those. As a matter of fact, if the record \nis right, if you look at what the last 6 months have been, the minority \nwill get one amendment over the next 6 months. We represent over half \nthe population of this country in the greatest deliberative body in the \nworld.\n  So how are we to rebuild confidence in this country? Is it by \npackaging 134 bills together and ramming them through because everybody \nhas something in it? Even though some of them may be very much a \npriority, the rest of them do not have and do not pass the priority \ntest. Is that what we are about? Is that going to build confidence in \nthis country? Is that going to restore the American people's confidence \nthat we are up to the task of attending to the very real and practical, \nsevere needs of this country at this time? Is this something President-\nelect Obama would say: This is the first thing I want you to pass out \nof the Senate in terms of a priority. It would not even pass his smell \ntest.\n  My hope is that we go forward, but that as we go forward, we do it in \na way that the American people would like to see us do. The goal is not \nto delay, the goal is to make the point that we ought to have an option \nto amend and debate bills. These bills got here because they were \ntrying to be passed without any debate, with no amendment, passed by a \nprocedure called unanimous consent.\n  It is important that the American people know what that is. Unanimous \nconsent is where a bill comes to both cloakrooms, whether it has gone \nthrough committee or not, and it is said, can we pass this bill? Well, \nthe problem is, I read the bills and I put a test on them: Are they a \npriority? Are they a necessity? Are they something that lessens our \ndebt? Are they within the role that has been granted to us under the \nenumerated powers of the Constitution as something we ought to be \ndoing? If they are not, I am not trying to stop the bill; all I am \nsaying is, bring it to the floor and let's have some debate and \namendments on it. And what we have seen is that there is something \nwrong if you won't, in the dark of night, let bills go through that the \nAmerican people never hear anything about. Well, the American people \nneed to hear about it all. This stuff all needs to be online.\n\n  There needs to be 30 Senators here today debating this. Instead, we \nare not. And we are going to let status quo, poor priority, lead us \ndown the path to where we do not have the courage to do what is \nnecessary to fix what is wrong in our country. And this is symbolic of \nwhat is wrong, is that we do what is politically expedient rather than \nwhat is in the best long-term interests of our country.\n  I have already readily admitted there are several, maybe 60 bills I \nhave no problem with; I think they are a priority. But when they are \npackaged together, that takes away property rights, that eliminates our \nability to be independent in terms of energy in the future, and that \nblocks the ability to take alternative forms of energy and create \ntransmission lines so that we can use it somewhere after we produce it. \nI am going to stand up every time--every time. As a Senator \nrepresenting 3.8 million people from Oklahoma, that voice is going to \nbe heard; it is not going to be stifled. It may not have an amendment, \nbut it is going to be heard. This country is worth us fighting for. And \nthis is not worth our priority at this time. At the dilatory state we \nfind ourselves in, we ought to be about bigger and better things that \nreally impact people both in the long run and short run and get us out \nof the problems we are in.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business for \nwhatever time I shall consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, yesterday I spent over an hour on the \nfloor talking about a report that we put together that is pretty \nincredible, the numbers of scientists coming forth now who were always \non the other side, or 10 years ago were on the other side of\n\n[[Page S249]]\n\nthis issue and at that time were agreeing with former Vice President \nGore in saying that manmade gases, anthropogenic gases, CO2 \nand such were the major causes of global warming. Now these scientists \nare coming over in droves, even individuals who are leading riots in \nthe streets throughout the world talking about having to do something \nor we are all going to die. I spent more time than I should have on it \nbecause it deserved the time. But I had to read a lot of the stuff. I \nknow you go to sleep when you think about things like this, and it does \nget to be heavy lifting. What I am trying to say is, we need to view \nthis with a fresh look because so many things have happened.\n  It is going to be difficult for many of my colleagues whom I deeply \nrespect who crawled way out on the limb saying it is manmade gases and \nwe will have to have expensive cap-and-trade solutions to the problem; \nthey now are facing a very liberal constituency that is saying: Wait a \nminute. Now we have the White House, the House, and the Senate. We have \neverybody lined up on this issue, as if it is a done deal, a fait \naccompli; we are now expecting you to come forward.\n  This is totally ignoring the fact that everything has changed from \nwhat it was before. Last year we had the Lieberman-Warner bill. Let's \ngo back further than that. Let's go back to the original Kyoto Treaty. \nQuite frankly, way back 7 years or so ago, when I became chairman of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, all we ever heard was that \nmanmade gases were causing global warming and, therefore, we have to do \nsomething about it.\n  Frankly, when the Kyoto Treaty was first suggested, I was one who \nthought it must be true because that is all we heard in the media. When \nI became chairman, I knew that I would have an impact on the decisions \nthat were made that would concern global warming. I thought at that \ntime it was something we should address.\n  Then the Wharton School of Economics came out with the Wharton \nEconometric Survey. This was something that was pretty well done, and \nit is still out there. In fact, I have a Web site, epw.senate.gov. If \nyou access that, you can see this in more detail than you probably \nreally want. If you are not a believer in the cost of this issue, then \nyou would want to do that. The Wharton Econometric Survey asked: What \nwould it cost the United States if we were to ratify the Kyoto Treaty \nand live by its emission requirements? They came to the conclusion that \nit would be in the range of between $300 to $330 billion a year. I \nalways hesitate to use figures such as that because it is hard for \npeople to conceive how that affects them. What I normally do is take \nthe number of families in America who file tax returns, and then I do \nthe division. That $330 billion a year it would cost us to comply with \nthe treaty comes out to be almost $3,000 a family. We are talking about \nsomething that is big. This is huge.\n  After looking at that, I thought: If it is going to cost that much, \nlet's be sure the science is real and it is there. After looking at it, \nwe found that the science was not there. Even though you had the \nappearance of it being there because the National Academy of Sciences \nand the United Nations all said the science was there, the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, something started by the \nUnited Nations--I hasten to say I have never been much of a fan of the \nUnited Nations to start with. Maybe I am a little bit biased in this \nanalysis. When they put together the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange, they did so for the purpose of trying to do something to force \nthe whole world to be involved and say: This is a world problem that we \nwill have to correct.\n  This is just a suspicion I have. Every once in a while the United \nNations comes out with something that totally contradicts our \ninterests. My good friend from Alabama and several of us put together \nresolutions. These resolutions say we will withhold 20 percent of our \ndues to the United Nations unless they reverse their position. The \nUnited Nations doesn't like that. They would like not to have to answer \nto anyone. Consequently, if they could ever get in a situation of \nglobal taxation, which is what they have openly been promoting for many \nyears, they would be in a position not to be accountable to anyone.\n  This is kind of what happened. So this was the Kyoto Treaty.\n  Fastforward then to 2003 and 2005 when we had two bills, the first of \nwhich was McCain-Lieberman. Those bills were also cap and trade. Cap \nand trade costs about the same amount of money. This is very \ninteresting. You will hear a lot of people during the next few months \nsay: We want some kind of controls on CO2. But we are not \ngoing to do it in a way that will cost a lot of money. We will have \noffsets. The bottom line is, it is going to cost about the same $300 \nbillion regardless of what scheme we adopt and how we massage it.\n  I have to say, there has been an awakening in the last few years. In \n2005 there were only two Senators who came to the floor and helped me. \nI was the one, as chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, who was charged with fighting this issue. It was on the \nfloor of the Senate for 5 days, 10 hours a day. That is 50 hours. We \nonly had about 3 hours of other Senators coming to assist me. Now \nfastforward to 2008. That was the Warner-Lieberman bill. We had 25 \nSenators, including the Senator in the Chamber presently from Alabama, \nwho came down to assist in this debate. That is a huge difference. We \nresoundingly defeated that bill, mostly on the economic arguments, not \non the scientific arguments.\n  When we started the debate, I said: I don't believe the science is \nthere. Evidence is showing that it is not there. But let's assume for \npurposes of this debate that the science is there, that manmade gases, \nanthropogenic gases, CO2, methane, are all responsible for \nclimate change and for increasing the temperature or global warming. \nLet's assume that. So the debate started, and we talked about the \neconomics of the issue. Even assuming the science is there, we defeated \nthat by a huge margin. In fact, Barbara Boxer was handling the \nDemocratic side. They only had 37 Democrats committed for final \npassage. That is a big change from 2005.\n  Now we have something where everybody is assuming that it is going to \npass because the Democrats have control of everything. They have the \nWhite House, the House, and the Senate. I remind them not to get too \narrogant because we went through the same thing, or they went through \nthe same thing in 1992, and things turned out pretty well after that.\n\n  If you look at where the attitudes of people are right now, that we \nare going to be passing something, I wouldn't get too far ahead. What \nwe are trying to do and what I did yesterday--and I took far too long \nin doing it--was talk about the size of the tax and the fact that the \ntax is going to be a regressive one.\n  I have to say also that I was one of the few people who actively \nopposed the $700 billion bailout. Again, when we relate that to each \nfamily that files a tax return, it is about $5,000 a family. That was \ngiving an unelected bureaucrat the sole control over $700 billion. One \nof the things I don't like about that, not only was it the wrong thing \nto do, but that also got people changing their thinking as to these \nlarge numbers. Now that $300 billion a year that it would cost us, if \nwe had a cap-and-trade policy, doesn't seem nearly that big. But it \nwould be, and it would be regressive.\n  The argument on the other side is, you may be right in the regressive \nnature of a tax because everybody has to buy energy. Everybody has to \nbuy gasoline and heat their homes, so a larger percentage of the \nexpendable income of someone who is in a lower income is going to be \nfar greater than it would have been otherwise, but we can take care of \nthat by redistribution of wealth toward low-income consumers. They have \nactually said that. That sounds a little bit un-American to me. Keep in \nmind, if we are talking about redistributing wealth, somebody has to \ncreate wealth before it can be redistributed. Right now--and we are \nlooking at the figures going around now--there will not be a lot of \nwealth to redistribute, if we get to that point.\n  Anyway, that was the main argument I was using yesterday and have \nused up through the last 7 years. I have had occasion to give 13 rather \nlengthy floor speeches on the science on global warming. What I did \nyesterday was use this report that we put together of the 650 very top \ninternational scientists who refute all the arguments used\n\n[[Page S250]]\n\nheretofore. I would like to concentrate for a moment on some of the \nleft-of-center scientists, environmentalists, and activists we are \ntalking about, the so-called consensus.\n  The Huffington Post is a left-leaning publication. We all understand \nthat. Harold Ambler was demanding an apology from Al Gore for promoting \nunfounded global warming fears. The Huffington Post article accused \nGore of selling ``the biggest whopper ever sold to the public'' in \nAmerican history.\n  We see a former Greenpeace member who was in Finland. His name is \nJarl Ahlbeck. He says there has been little or no global warming since \n1995. This is interesting. Everyone is talking about global warming. We \nare in a cooling spell now. It has been that way since the turn of the \ncentury. Nobody argues that. I am sure that upset a lot of people, the \npromoters, because it is kind of hard to be talking about some very \nexpensive scheme to fight global warming when we are going through \nglobal cooling.\n  Nonetheless, we have all types of people, and I cited a long list of \nthem, who say we are in the middle of this cooling period right now.\n  Going into the liberal side or the left-leaning scientists, one of \nthem is Martin Hertzberg, a meteorologist with a Ph.D. in physical \nchemistry. He said:\n\n       As a scientist and life-long liberal Democrat, I find the \n     constant regurgitation of the anecdotal fear mongering clap-\n     trap about human-caused global warming to be a disservice to \n     science.\n\n  You have some of the punishment that has been covered in this report. \nThey talk about how they no longer can get grants from various \norganizations, whether it is the Heinz Foundation or others, unless \nthey go along with their philosophy.\n  The other argument that has come up that we want to use and make sure \neverybody understands is, even if you are a believer that manmade gases \ncause climate change, global warming, the things we are looking at now \nand the things we looked at after Kyoto, Kyoto actually made more sense \nthan some of the bills I have been talking about that happened in 2003 \nand 2005 and 2008 because that would single out the United States and \nsay: This is what we are going to do regardless of what they do in \nChina and Mexico and India and other countries.\n  So, obviously, if we did it, and we had this punitive tax \narrangement, that would drive our manufacturing base overseas to places \nwhere they wouldn't have this heavy expense. Consequently, it would be \ngoing to countries such as Mexico and China where they have almost no \nrestrictions on their emissions. It would have a net increase on the \namount of CO2 going into the atmosphere.\n  As to the manual we have with over 650 scientists, I would like to \nsuggest to you that you compare that to the IPCC reports. The IPCC--\nthat is the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change--\nreport is called a Summary for Policymakers. We never saw the report. \nWe just see the summary. That was put together by 52 scientists who are \npretty much owned by the politicians who are wanting to come to these \nconclusions.\n  So if you canvas the scientists now in Canada who came out with a \nreport just recently--51,000 Canadian scientists--68 percent of them \ndisagree that global warming is a science that is settled. At the same \ntime, you have the same percentage--and this came from the \nInternational Geological Congress which just had their meeting in \nNorway--an overwhelming number of the scientists were skeptical. Two-\nthirds of the presenters and question askers were hostile and even \ndismissive of the U.N. IPCC report. So the same two-thirds keeps \nreappearing in terms of what the scientists are saying about this \nissue.\n  Now, yesterday, I did not get into this, but if you look at those \nscientists who are on the left side, Dr. Robert Giegengack, the former \nchair of the Department of Earth and Environmental Science at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania, actually was a strong Gore supporter in the \n2000 election. He now states that global warming does not even qualify \nas 1 of the top 10 environmental problems facing the world. This is not \nme or any other Senator talking. This is one of the far left leaning \nenvironmental scientists.\n  With Alexander Cockburn it is the same situation. He is a maverick \njournalist who leans left on almost all topics. He lambasted the \nalleged global warming consensus on a political Web site called \ncounterpunch.org, arguing that there is no evidence that humans are \ncausing the rise in global temperature. This gets to the intimidation \nfactor. He said:\n\n       I have been treated as if I have committed intellectual \n     blasphemy.\n\n  Alexander Cockburn stated:\n\n       This turn to climate catastrophism is tied into the decline \n     of the left, and the decline of the left's optimistic vision \n     of altering the economic nature of things through a political \n     program.\n\n  I guess what he is saying is, these intellectuals, any of these \nscientists who were formerly on the far left side who have come over--\nas most of them now have; more than 50 percent of them have--are beat \nup pretty badly by the scientific community, or at least by the \nNational Academy of Scientists.\n  Another left-leaning individual is Denis Rancourt, professor of \nphysics and an environmental science researcher at the University of \nOttawa. He stated that the global warming campaign does a disservice to \nthe environmental movement by beating this drum. He is a big \nenvironmentalist. When, obviously, the science is not there, it is \ndoing a great disservice, and I think that is right.\n  Then you get into the three I like the best. Dr. Claude Allegre is a \nsocialist. He is one of the top French scientists. He is the one who \nwas marching in the streets with Al Gore 10, 15 years ago. Claude \nAllegre is recognized by everyone. He has now totally reversed his \nposition. He was the top guy in France. With Dr. David Bellamy from the \nUK, it is the same situation. He was on the far left side of this \nissue. He has come around.\n  I have all the quotes by these individuals. There is not enough time \nto read them. The same thing is true with Nir Shaviv. Nir Shaviv was a \nscientist in Israel who is now quite outspoken in his opinion that the \nscience just flat is not there.\n  Ecologist Dr. Patrick Moore, he was a founder of Greenpeace and has \nnow joined the ranks of the dissenters. He said:\n\n       It is clear the contention that human-induced \n     CO2 emissions and rising CO2 levels in \n     the global atmosphere are the cause of the present global \n     warming trend is a hypothesis that has not yet been elevated \n     to the level of a proven theory.\n\n  So this goes on and on and goes over many of these areas. I think \neven some of the mainstream media has begun to take notice of this \nissue. An article in Politico noted the other day--that is a paper we \nare all familiar with in the Senate--that a ``growing accumulation'' of \nscience is challenging warming fears, and added that the ``science \nbehind global warming may still be too shaky to warrant cap-and-trade \nlegislation.''\n  Canada's National Post, which is always promoting cap and trade, is \nnow saying ``the number of climate change skeptics is growing \nrapidly.''\n  So I leave with three thoughts: First of all, the left is now \nabandoning the whole global warming fear concept, and we have all the \nnames. I can recall when we had our 2-hour session with former Vice \nPresident Al Gore, and I never saw any sweat coming off his forehead \nuntil we started talking about people such as Claude Allegre, David \nBellamy, and Nir Shaviv, who were always on his side before.\n  Second is the cost. If you do not want to use my $300 billion-a-year \ntax increase figure, use the figure that was used in the Boxer-\nLieberman-Warner bill last year. It was $6.7 trillion.\n  The third thing to keep in mind has to do with Kyoto. It would have \nbeen bad enough, but for us to do it unilaterally would really be a \nvery bad idea.\n  I would suggest people go to a Web site. I have the Web site: \nepw.senate.gov/minority. ``EPW'' stands for Environment and Public \nWorks--epw.senate.gov/minority. I have a lot of documentation there for \nanyone who might be interested in the truth, not that that always \nproduces a lot of interest around here.\n\n\n                            Bailout And Jobs\n\n  Lastly, Mr. President, I want to go into one other thing unrelated, \nand I do not want to use too much time because others want to speak.\n  I have said--I do not think it is unfair, at least in my mind--that \nas to\n\n[[Page S251]]\n\nthis whole idea of the $700 billion bailout, 75 percent of the House \nand the Senate supported this legislation. Let's keep in mind that was \nto give an unelected bureaucrat the power to do with the first half of \nthe $700 billion anything he wanted to do.\n  In fact, when Secretary Paulson--he actually said at one time: I \npromise this is going to be used to buy damaged assets. Well, we found \nout that, obviously, 3 our 4 minutes after he received the money, it \ndid not go to that. I have heard, and just this past Wednesday an \neconomist gave a presentation, that if we had used that for the \nintended purpose, it might have had an effect. They contend this did \nnot have any effect at all on what has happened.\n  So with the concern that several of us have, I would only like to say \nthat it has fallen on deaf ears. But I have been trying to get Members \nof this body to understand--I am talking about Democrats and \nRepublicans; we have some Democrats, such as Bernie Sanders, who do \nunderstand this--and that is, the concept of giving the money to an \nunelected bureaucrat is wrong.\n  This is something we can do now on the second half of the $350 \nbillion that remains. They spent every cent of the first $350 billion. \nAs to the second $350 billion, if we leave the law like it is today, \nthey can come forward and say this: Well, I want to have the other $350 \nbillion. I am going to spend it on this and this and this--and maybe \nnot even talk about the whole amount. They may be very uncertain as to \nwhat he is going to use it for. But then the only way to stop that \nwould be to pass a resolution of disapproval.\n  Now, it would be very difficult to pass a resolution of disapproval. \nIn fact, for obvious procedural and other reasons, it could not be \ndone. What I have proposed, in S. 64, is to make a modest change in \nthat law, and instead of saying it is going to automatically pass \nunless a resolution of disapproval, in a 15-day period, is successfully \npassed, say that you have to come forward and show us what it is going \nto be, how you are going to spend the money.\n  I have been trying to get more sponsors on this legislation. As I \nsay, I already have some Democratic sponsors, and I applaud them for \nhaving the courage to come out and say: We want accountability. We \ndon't care who it is in the White House, we need to have \naccountability.\n\n  So as we get toward the bailout bill, the last thing I want to \nmention is something I have very strong feelings about, and that is \nthis: The figures I have heard--and at this point I do not think anyone \ncan intelligently say exactly what the bailout bill is going to be--we \nhave heard figures batted around about $1.2 trillion, huge amounts of \nmoney. But the report I got from the President-elect's team, they \ntalked about out of $1.2 trillion, only $25 billion in total investment \nwould be on infrastructure. That is nothing, $25 billion out of $1.2 \ntrillion.\n  Now, I would say this: My good friend, Jim Oberstar, over in the \nHouse of Representatives, with whom I served on the Transportation \nCommittee for 8 years before coming over here, has come up with a much \nmore ambitious portion of it.\n  Now, if we are going to spend money for a stimulus bill, let's spend \nmoney on something that will actually come up with some jobs. I am not \nsaying I want to spend all this money, but if it is going to be spent \nanyway.\n  I do not want to play down the whole idea of tax relief. We all \nknow--we have learned from experience--what can happen if tax relief is \ndone in the right way. We all remember what Woodrow Wilson did after \nWorld War I. He decided to cut taxes because the war was over. He did \nnot need them anymore, and he expected revenue to drop down. It did \nnot. It increased.\n  A very smart President of the United States, in the 1960s, John \nKennedy, said--this is an exact quote--we need more money for the Great \nSociety programs, and the best way to increase revenue is to decrease \nmarginal rates. So he decreased rates, and it increased revenue.\n  Remember in 1980, the total amount of money that was raised from \nmarginal rates was $244 billion. In 1990, it was $466 billion. That was \nduring the 10-year period that had the largest tax reductions in the \nhistory of this country.\n  So we know we can stimulate the economy. I fear that is not going to \nbe that type of tax reduction if we just merely have a redistribution \nof wealth and give money to people who do not pay taxes. That is not \ngoing to do it. So I say that because if tax relief were done properly, \nI would not be standing here and saying we ought to have a larger \npercentage of this spent on infrastructure. We have huge critical needs \nin the United States on our infrastructure. We are in a position right \nnow where we had passed the last authorization bill, and it was a $286 \nbillion bill in 2005. That was the transportation reauthorization. We \nare going to do it again. But if we could get a running start and spend \nsome of the money that is going to be spent anyway on providing jobs \nimmediately, we have $80 billion ready to go right now for jobs, where \nwe could have the spade in the dirt tomorrow.\n  Then we have the categoric exclusion projects that are out there in \naddition to this. Those are projects that do not increase capacity, do \nnot increase the footprint, but just maintain some of the crumbling \nbridges and infrastructure that is out there. So all that can be done. \nI think Gary Ridley is the best director of highways anywhere in \nAmerica. He is our highway director in Oklahoma. We have, just in our \nState, one billion dollars' worth ready to go right now. So this is \nwhat we want to do.\n  On Monday, I am going to elaborate a little more on our opportunities \nthat we have for infrastructure. I have been ranked most of the time as \nthe most conservative Member of the Senate, and yet I am a big spender \nin some areas. One is in national defense, but another certainly is in \ninfrastructure. That is what we are supposed to be doing.\n  I think we have an opportunity to do what we are supposed to be doing \nand at the same time produce jobs, and that will be my intent. I plan \nto talk about this in more detail on Monday.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Briefly, Mr. President, I see the Senator from Hawaii \nis in the Chamber. I see he has some remarks, and I would be pleased to \nyield to him and would ask unanimous consent that I be recognized after \nhe has full opportunity to make any remarks he desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for giving me this \nopportunity to speak at this time.\n\n\n                     Tribute To Senator Robert Byrd\n\n  Mr. President, this year marks my 19th year in the Senate, a mere \nfraction of the time served by my esteemed colleague and good friend, \nSenator Robert Byrd, the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Senator Byrd has been a Senator as long as Hawaii has been a State--\n50 years. I rise here today to pay tribute to this great human being, \nthis great man, this great Senator, who has served for those many years \nhere for our country. His contributions are well documented, his \ninfluence legendary, and his grasp of history and knowledge about our \ndemocracy and our institutions is without equal.\n  It is my great honor to serve alongside the distinguished Senator \nByrd. I consider him my Senate mentor. He has been a mentor for many of \nmy colleagues. He has taught me much, both trivial and profound. For \nexample, one of the first things he told me was to always wear my pin \nwhile at work. In the early years, it helped distinguish me from all \nthe other people wearing suits at the Capitol. So as Senator Byrd can \nsee, I learned that lesson well, and I do wear my pin every day. He \nalso taught me the intricacies of presiding over the Senate. He said: \nSpeak in sentences, and don't take any of your work with you to do \nwhile you are presiding. I have done that when I did preside. His point \nwas respect for the Senate as an institution.\n  As I mentioned, I have learned a lot from Senator Byrd, but I chose \nto share with my colleagues those two\n\n[[Page S252]]\n\nlessons, as simple they may seem, so they can appreciate how much he \ncares about his colleagues and the Senate. For him, no detail is too \nsmall and no challenge is too big.\n  Many know that Senator Byrd usually carries a copy of the U.S. \nConstitution in his pocket and frequently displays it to make a point. \nIt is an appropriate place; it is close to his heart.\n  Senator Byrd, God bless you abundantly, and congratulations on 50 \nyears of distinguished service to the people of West Virginia and the \nUnited States. Thank you for all you have done for me. I cherish your \nfriendship and look forward to our continued work together on behalf of \nour great country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n\n\n                      Erosion of Senate Traditions\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Akaka for his comments \nabout the Senate and Senator Byrd, and I would share those. Certainly \nit is a good lead-in, I think, to the remarks and thoughts I wish to \nshare right now.\n  In the Senate, individual Senators have traditionally had substantial \npowers to participate in the debate and to offer amendments to improve \nlegislation. The Senate has been described as the saucer which allows \nthe hot coffee to cool, and I think that is a good description.\n  I have been very concerned that Senator Coburn of Oklahoma, who has \ndesired to offer just one or two amendments to legislation that is \npending in the Senate before it becomes automatically passed into law, \nhas systematically been denied that right and has been held up as \nsomeone who does not respect the body and is doing something wrong. I \nthink that is a very bad analysis of the principled stands he takes. I \nthink he is one of the finest Members of this Senate. He has the odd \nbelief that a Senator should actually read the legislation, and if it \ncan be improved and should be improved, a Senator has an obligation to \noffer an amendment to fix that, and he has done so. However, as we \nknow, Senators have gotten into the habit of believing that if they \nhave produced a piece of legislation and it is essentially a piece of \nlegislation that a lot of people would agree ought to be passed without \nany debate and/or without, certainly, any amendments--and the majority \nleader, who I have to say is going to have to watch this and is going \nto lead continued activity in this area--to deny the fundamental right \nof Senators to debate and vote to improve legislation cannot continue \nwithout causing very serious disruption of the body because it changes \nthe historical nature of it.\n  I participated in a bankruptcy bill. It was my subcommittee. We \npassed the bankruptcy bill. It took several weeks. It was an important \npiece of legislation. We had 39 votes asked for by the Democrats, who \nwere in the minority. They got those votes, and eventually the bill \npassed with 83 or 87 votes, I have forgotten which. That is what this \nbody is capable of doing and should do much more often.\n  Let me go back to what has happened here. Senator Coburn has objected \nto various pieces of legislation. They asked unanimous consent that the \nbill be passed without amendment and basically without debate. That is \nwhat the request is. Senator Coburn has said: Well, I have an \namendment. I don't like section such-and-such. I don't approve of \nprovisions in this bill that will restrict further our already \nrestricted ability to produce oil and gas in America, for example or I \ndon't want to see that become law or I think that expenditure in the \nbill is unacceptable and it ought to be eliminated or cut substantially \nor my constituents think this is not good policy for America, and I \nwish to at least be able to offer an amendment to it. Well, the powers \nthat be are not comfortable with that. It has been done during \nRepublican times, but it has gotten to the high-water mark now, where \nthe leadership of the Senate systematically denies people the right to \nvote.\n  I was really taken aback that Senator Coburn has announced that not a \nsingle amendment has been voted on in this Senate since July. How can \nthat be? It is unthinkable to me that that has been the case, but I \ncan't remember any. I know they were able to ram through a $700 billion \nTARP financial bailout without an amendment. Unthinkable.\n  So I think the history, the integrity, the traditional role of the \nSenate is being eroded because leadership does not want votes. They \ndon't want their members to have to take tough votes. That is what you \nhear. They want to pass bills quickly--let you have a little say and \nthen pass the bill, but nobody really gets to try to offer amendments \nto make the bill better and anybody who insists on that is obstructing.\n  So basically what has happened in this body is that we now have a \npublic lands bill that has attached to it some of what Senator Coburn \nhas objected to, and they want to move the bill without any amendments. \nI don't think that is right.\n  Let me just say this about Senator Coburn: He is a medical doctor. He \nworks extraordinarily hard. He is highly intelligent. He has been a \nsuccessful businessman, an inventor, and one of the smartest Members of \nthis body. He campaigned in his State that he was going to read the \nlegislation that comes before this Senate and he would work to make it \nbetter. He committed to his people that he would work to control \nwasteful Washington spending. I think almost every Member of the Senate \nhas said the same; the only difference is he does it with a tenacity \nand a courage and an analytical ability that few of us possess. He is \nwilling to come down here and ruffle feathers by saying: I know, \nSenator, you love this bill and you think it is perfect, but I have a \ndifferent view. I think this part of it ought to be fixed. I have an \namendment, and I want a vote on it to see if my colleagues agree with \nme. We have gotten in the habit of denying this opportunity.\n  If anybody thinks this is such an insignificant matter--when we \npassed last fall, over my objection, the financial bailout, the $700 \nbillion bailout, I think I can say without fear of contradiction it was \nthe greatest expenditure in the history of the Republic or allocation \nof Federal money in the history of the Republic. Not one amendment was \nallowed. Blame it on President Bush. Blame it on President Bush, but \nthe Democrats had the majority in the Senate. I didn't support it. I \nwould have been delighted to stand with them to object to the breadth \nof this bill, the lack of control that was exercised over $700 billion \nin taxpayers' money. But Senator Reid brought it up in a fashion that \nallowed no amendments, and they rammed it right through the great \nSenate of the United States, and we committed this country to $700 \nbillion in expenditures and guarantees.\n  Well, how did it work out? Most economists now tell us that using \nthat money to buy stock in banks, private banks, to buy stock--$100 \nbillion-plus--in a big insurance company with taxpayers' money has not \nhelped the economy. Had the money been spent on buying toxic assets, as \npromised, it might have worked. At least we would have been further \nalong in the game. Why did that happen? Secretary Paulson told us he \nwanted to buy toxic assets. He told us he didn't want to buy stock. He \nwas asked about that in the House committee. He said: No, I don't think \nwe should buy stock. But one thing Secretary Paulson told the \nCongress--and I was stunned by it, really--he said it publicly and \nrepeatedly: I want maximum flexibility to do what I think is necessary \nto fix this economy. That is what this Senate gave him. Within a week \nof getting $700 billion to buy toxic mortgages to try to stabilize the \nhousing market, he was spending the money to buy stock in banks and \ninsurance companies--directly contrary to what he said.\n  All I am saying to my colleagues is that the Senate is a great body. \nI am just commencing my third term. I remember when I first came up \nhere and I attended a luncheon and they asked me to say something \nbriefly. The words I recall saying were that I can think of no greater \nhonor than to represent the people of Alabama in the greatest \ndeliberative body in the history of the world. That is this Senate. But \nwe are eroding that tradition, that heritage. If we can't have \namendments, it can no longer be called the great U.S. Senate. I think \nSenator Byrd can't help but be uneasy about these trends in the Senate \nhe has so loved and served for so long.\n  We ought to be appreciative of Senator Coburn from Oklahoma for \ntaking\n\n[[Page S253]]\n\nthe time to study this legislation, to offer amendments to fix it and \nto make it better, and to serve in the classical manner of ``Mr. Smith \nGoes to Washington'' to serve the American people. We ought not create \na freight train designed to run over him and to silence and muzzle him \nand to deny him the ability to offer amendments. That is what we are \nabout.\n  There is no reason for us having to vote on Sunday except the \nmajority leader has insisted on it and tried to blame Senator Coburn. \nIf we are going to stay in session until Sunday, why are we not voting? \nWhy don't we have some votes? What are they afraid of to have a vote? I \nam serious. What could be so fearful about casting votes? Isn't that \nwhat we were sent here to do? We know on every vote, we are going to \nmake somebody unhappy. The Senate, since the founding of the Republic, \nhas found it acceptable to vote. Why are we stopping voting now?\n  I want to be counted in his favor. I know the legislation before us \ntoday has a number of good provisions in it. I support some of them, \nand some of them I have worked hard to support and see they are in the \nlegislation. I don't think it is a horrible piece of legislation. But \njust as a matter of procedure, we ought not to deny good Senators the \nright to offer amendments. I object to that procedure.\n  I believe we will have to confront this change in the procedures of \nthe Senate because we are going to wake up and find it is not the same \nSenate we used to know.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak a few minutes in support \nof the motion to proceed to S. 22, the Omnibus Public Lands Management \nAct.\n  S. 22, which I introduced earlier this week, is a collection of over \n160 bills. Primarily, they are bills that came out of our Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources. The question before us is whether the \nSenate should proceed to consider the bill. I strongly believe we \nshould, and that is the vote the majority leader has scheduled us to \nhave on Sunday.\n  Although S. 22 itself is a new bill, the individual pieces of \nlegislation contained in it and incorporated in it are not. This \npackage includes 159 bills which were considered by our committee \nduring the previous Congress. Several of the bills in the package have \neven been considered in one or more Congresses prior to the previous \nCongress.\n  Let me make the obvious point that needs to be understood by everyone \npaying attention to this issue. This is not a partisan bill. The bills \nin this package have been developed on a bipartisan basis. Last year, \nwe developed this legislation hand in hand with Senator Domenici, who \nwas at that time the ranking member of the Energy Committee. This year, \nwe have worked with Senator Murkowski, who is taking over as the \nranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, to \ndevelop this legislation.\n  Almost all of the bills that were reported from our committee were \nreported on a unanimous vote. In cases where there was not a unanimous \nvote, we have made further modifications in some of those bills in an \neffort to address remaining concerns.\n  Collectively, the legislation that is before us or that we are going \nto vote on whether to proceed to is one of the most sweeping \nconservation laws that has been considered by the Senate in recent \nyears. It will designate over 2 million acres of wilderness in nine \ndifferent States. It will establish three new units of the National \nPark System, a new national monument, and three new national \nconservation areas. It will codify the Save America's Treasures and \nPreserve America historic preservation programs.\n  In addition, it will designate over 1,000 miles of new additions to \nthe national wild and scenic river system, including several hundred \nmiles in Wyoming that are dedicated to our late friend and colleague, \nCraig Thomas, and will help protect 1.2 million acres of the Wyoming \nrange. This is in large part due to the leadership of Senator Barrasso, \nwho is on the Senate floor and intends to speak following my remarks.\n  The bill designates four new national scenic or national historic \ntrails, enlarges the boundaries of several existing units of the \nNational Park System, and establishes 10 new national heritage areas. \nIt establishes in law the Bureau of Land Management's National \nLandscape Conservation System and the collection of national monuments \nand conservation areas that are administered by the BLM.\n  The package is not just about new designations. The bill authorizes \nnumerous land exchanges and conveyances to help local communities \nthroughout the West. It includes several provisions to improve land \nmanagement, such as the Forest Landscape Restoration Act which will \nfacilitate collaborative landscape-scale restoration to help reduce \nfire risk and fire costs and provide new forest product jobs.\n  Another example which is in my home State of New Mexico, the bill \nwill reauthorize the Rio Puerco Management Committee. This committee \nhas become one of the most effective collaborative land management \nefforts in the Southwest which, for more than 10 years, has helped to \nfacilitate the restoration of the highly degraded Rio Puerco watershed, \nwhich is a major tributary leading into the Rio Grande.\n  This package incorporates 30 separate bills that, taken in their \nentirety, will have an unprecedented positive impact in helping address \ncritical water resource needs on both the local and national level. It \nauthorizes a range of studies to assist several communities conduct \nindepth reviews of local water supplies and evaluate the best ways to \nmeet their future water challenges.\n  There are also approximately 18 specific authorizations for local and \nregional projects that enhance water use efficiencies, that address \ninfrastructure that is in disrepair, that provide a sustainable supply \nof water to rural communities, and conserve water to promote \nenvironmental health and alleviate conflicts that arise under the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  The overall understanding of our critical water resources, including \nthe impact of climate change on our water resources, is also promoted \nby provisions in this legislation.\n  Finally, I note that the bill will reduce the workload of water \nlawyers in the West by ratifying three extremely important water \nsettlements in the States of California, Nevada, and New Mexico. These \nsettlements, involving Indian tribes, agricultural and municipal water \nusers, environmental interests, and the applicable States themselves, \nwill resolve decades old litigation in a manner that is consistent with \nFederal responsibilities and with the broad support of diverse \ninterests in each of these situations.\n  As most who are familiar with the history of western water can \nattest, it is a near impossible task to bring competing interests \ntogether to agree on long-term solutions. That has been achieved in \nthis bill, and this bill ensures that the Federal Government will be a \nfull partner to help implement reasonable solutions to complex water \nissues.\n  I think it is important to note the lengthy public process associated \nwith many of the individual bills in this package. Many of these land \nand water bills began as an effort by local citizens to resolve \nimportant resource issues within their States. In many cases, local \nworking groups were formed and discussion took place over a period of \nyears, before a local consensus developed.\n  Following all of that, many of these proposals then spent additional \nyears under consideration in Congress, often with further negotiations \nand modifications. In my opinion, this is exactly the way the \nlegislative process should work, and this process reflects why there is \nsuch strong local support for many of these provisions.\n  Based on the action of our committee last Congress, there is also \nstrong bipartisan support in the Senate for the bills in this package. \nI commend the majority leader for his commitment to pass this bill in \nsuch a timely manner, and I urge my colleagues to support the motion to \nproceed and, following that, passage of the legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to put into \nperspective some statements made by my\n\n[[Page S254]]\n\ngood friend from Oklahoma, and he made those with regard to the Wyoming \nRange Withdrawal Act. This is a bill that I introduced.\n  I am especially pleased to be giving this speech from this desk. \nPeople back home in Wyoming ask about the desk and whose desk do you \nhave? As you know, after the election and the new swearing in of \nSenators, some of the desks switched around. Due to the generosity of \nSenator Shelby--and I am very grateful to him--he has allowed me to \nhave this desk because this is the desk of F.E. Warren, who was \nWyoming's first Senator when we became a State in 1890. He took the \noath of office, and he served for almost four decades. This is the desk \nhe got when he came to the Senate on day one.\n  It is important to give this speech from this desk because we are \ntalking about a part of Wyoming's past and a part of Wyoming's future \nthat is very important, and it is the Wyoming range. Wyoming has a long \nhistory of getting it right when it comes to multiple use of the land. \nWe have done it for 119 years that we have been a State, and we will \ncontinue to do it forever.\n  I am here to tell you and to tell the people of Wyoming, tell the \npeople of America that I introduced this bill, the Wyoming Range \nWithdrawal Act, to fulfill a commitment I made to the people of Wyoming \nand to complete the work that was started by my good friend, Senator \nCraig Thomas. We lost Senator Thomas in 2007. At the time of his death, \nhe was working on this bill. He had traveled the State. He had visited \nwith people, listened to people. That is exactly what I did when I took \nthe oath of office--having town meetings, traveling to all of the parts \nof the State, visiting, listening to people, and then working to try to \nimprove the bill that is in front of us today as part of this lands \npackage.\n  I am here to tell you that right now, today, there is oil and gas \ndevelopment going on in the Wyoming range. I have a picture of the \nWyoming range, a beautiful part of western Wyoming. It means so much to \nso many people. There are certain places that are so special and so \npristine that they need to be protected for future generations. But we \ndo it right in Wyoming. We rely on multiple uses of the land.\n  This legislation we have heard about today seeks to protect from \nfuture oil and gas activity--let me say that again--from future oil and \ngas activity, lands in the Wyoming range that are not currently under \nlease. And there are lands in Wyoming that are currently under lease.\n  As we can see in this picture, it is still a very pristine, beautiful \narea, but some of this land is under lease for oil and gas \ndevelopment. The legislation in this lands package does not--does not--\naffect areas that have been currently leased for exploration. There are \n18 oil and gas leases within the proposed withdrawal area. These leases \ncover over 70,000 acres. These leases are primarily located in areas \nthat have some of the most significant potential, the most significant \npotential for mineral development. They represent valid existing \nrights, and they will not be canceled in any way by this bill. I \nrepeat: These leases represent valid existing property rights and will \nnot be canceled by this bill.\n\n  In addition, there are 35 oil and gas leases covering almost 45,000 \nadditional acres that have been issued and are under protest or have \nbeen sold but not yet issued. The legislation does not cancel any of \nthese areas which are being contested. There does exist an appropriate \nadministrative process whereby the Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. \nForest Service is evaluating these contested leases to determine their \nstatus. I repeat: This legislation today does not cancel any of these \ncurrently contested leases. Everyone should keep in mind that the acres \ncurrently leased or currently leased but under protest represent the \narea where the most promising reserves exist. This bill does not touch \nthat.\n  Now, my colleague from Oklahoma stated that the legislation would \ntake off the table 8.8 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas \nand over 300 million barrels of recoverable oil. Well, let us first set \naside whether those figures are accurate, and we will get to that in a \nminute. I reiterate: The areas believed to hold the majority of the oil \nand gas reserves are leased, those areas are leased, and those are \nvalid existing rights and will not be changed by this piece of \nlegislation. Now, regarding the figures. I have an updated estimate, an \nestimate of the reserves of the Wyoming Range that has been prepared by \nthe U.S. Department of Interior, the U.S. Geological Survey, and this \nwas prepared on June 19, 2008. I have shared these numbers with Members \nof the Senate.\n  Under the revised estimates, the best minds, the best geological \nthinking, they believe there is some natural gas potential in this area \nof 1.5 trillion cubic feet, not 8.8, and an oil potential of 5 million \nbarrels, not 300 million barrels.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, \nfollowing my remarks, the USGS letter to the chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources, Senator Bingaman, who \nearlier spoke.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, these figures, particularly the \nestimated gas reserves, are still not a small amount, but they are \nsignificantly lower than the previously stated estimates and much \nsmaller in size and in scope relative to other known gas reserves in \nthe area of western Wyoming. Currently, in this area, there are 4,300 \nproducing oil and gas wells in the three counties that are touched by \nthis legislation. There is a proposal being considered for up to 4,339 \nadditional wells that would not be affected by this legislation. There \nis production currently taking place in the Wyoming Range that will not \nbe stopped by this legislation.\n  The people of Wyoming are doing their part to keep America's energy \nflowing. We in Wyoming are the largest net exporter of energy in the \nUnited States. We support development of our coal, of uranium, of oil, \nof gas, and of renewable resources--the electricity from wind. We have \nnever been a State that has said: Not in my back yard. We are No. 1 in \ncoal production in the country, we are No. 1 in uranium production in \nthe country for nuclear power, and we are No. 2 in the country in \nproduction of onshore natural gas. The people of Wyoming continue to do \ntheir part.\n  We also recognize, through 119 years of statehood, that there must be \na balance, a balance between helping the Nation meet its energy needs \nand maintaining the quality of life the people of Wyoming have come to \nenjoy. The Wyoming Range Withdrawal Act has bipartisan support \nthroughout the State of Wyoming. The Governor of Wyoming, Governor Dave \nFreudenthal, a Democrat, came to Washington to testify at a hearing \nbefore the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and he spoke \nin favor of the bill. My colleague in the Senate, Senator Mike Enzi, is \na cosponsor of the bill. It truly is a bipartisan measure.\n  The Wyoming Range Withdrawal Act strikes the proper balance. I have \ncome to the Senate floor today to put this bill in context with what is \noccurring on the ground in Wyoming, as well as what is occurring under \nthe ground. My goal is to provide an accurate and a complete picture \nfor the Senate and, much more importantly, for the American people.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                  U.S. Department of the Interior,\n\n\n                                       U.S. Geological Survey,\n\n                                                       Reston, VA.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter of May 27, \n     2008, and your request for U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) oil \n     and gas resource information regarding the Wyoming Range \n     Withdrawal Area (WRWA), outlined in S. 2229.\n       Based on the map your staff provided, the withdrawal area \n     encompasses parts of two geological provinces assessed by the \n     USGS--the Southwestern Wyoming Province and the Wyoming \n     Thrust Belt Province. The USGS conducts assessments of the \n     undiscovered, technically recoverable oil and gas resources \n     of the entire geologically defined province.\n       To approximate the amount of the estimated resources \n     underlying the proposed withdrawal area, we placed the map \n     provided to us into a geographic information system (GIS), \n     calculated the amount of WRWA area that overlaps the \n     assessment units we had analyzed and assessed in the two \n     geologic provinces, and calculated the percentage geographic \n     area that the WRWA represents of each assessment unit. We \n     then calculated a\n\n[[Page S255]]\n\n     first approximation of the potential undiscovered, \n     technically recoverable oil and gas resources in this region \n     by taking the mean estimates of each resource category and \n     multiplying by the percent geographic area of each assessment \n     unit. Results are as follows:\n       Mean oil potential in the WRWA is 5 million barrels.\n       Mean natural gas potential is 1.5 trillion cubic feet.\n       Mean natural gas liquids potential is 60 million barrels.\n       Please note that these GIS-analyzed estimates can only be \n     considered approximations, for the following reasons: (1) The \n     map provided to us of the WRWA was a general outline and \n     therefore subject to error when calculating the geographic \n     extent of the assessment units relative to the WRWA; and (2) \n     a homogeneous distribution of oil and gas resources was \n     assumed across each entire assessment unit.\n       For an overview of USGS mean estimates for undiscovered, \n     technically recoverable natural gas resources for geologic \n     provinces within in the United States and their relative \n     sizes, please see the map at http://certmapper.cr.usgs.gov/\ndata/noga00/natl/graphic/2007/total_gas_mean_07.pdf\n       Please let us know if you have any further questions or we \n     can be of further help.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Mark D.

Mr. President, today marks the 4-year anniversary of \nthe signing of Sudan's Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which brought an \nend to the tragic north-south civil war that raged for over two \ndecades; a war, frankly, that for a long time seemed virtually endless. \nWe should keep the CPA in mind as we lament the horrific suffering that \nendures in eastern Congo, Darfur, Somalia, and Zimbabwe. I am hopeful \nthat 2009 will be a year in which we make significant progress toward \npeace in all of these countries, and that the United States plays an \nactive role in that progress. The CPA is a remarkable testament to the \nfact that transformation is possible in even the most seemingly \nintractable conflicts when there is political will. I am proud of the \ncritical role the United States played in bringing about this historic \nagreement 4 years ago, and it is a testament to the hard work of \nSpecial Envoy Jack Danforth and the leadership of President Bush.\n  Nevertheless, the CPA is not merely about a piece of paper or a \nmoment in history but a commitment to secure lasting peace throughout \nSudan. Unfortunately, this process remains unfinished and increasingly \nfragile, as evidenced by the clashes that broke out in the oil-rich \nAbyei region last May. Several flashpoints in the states of South \nKordofan, Jonglei, and Blue Nile remain highly volatile. There remain \ntoo many arms and armed actors in these areas that are capable of \nundermining the agreement. Both sides, anticipating future clashes, are \nspending increased resources to build up their militaries. It is not \ndifficult to imagine a minor incident causing renewed fighting in these \nareas, which could quickly plunge the north and the south back into \nfull-scale war. Such a scenario would not only be devastating for the \nSudanese but could have dramatic repercussions for the wider region.\n  With elections under the CPA scheduled for this year, 2009 may well \nbe a watershed year for Sudan. The United States must renew and \nintensify its support for the implementation of the CPA as part of a \ncomprehensive strategy for Sudan. We must continue to demonstrate, both \nin terms of our diplomacy and resources, a commitment to rebuild \nsouthern Sudan's institutions, and support the approaching elections. \nSimultaneously, we must work with our international partners to ensure \nthat the UN Mission in Sudan, UNMIS, is doing all it can to monitor and \nkeep the peace in Sudan's flashpoints. I am confident that the Obama \nadministration understands the importance of implementing the CPA and \nwill bring bold leadership and a holistic vision to peace efforts in \nSudan.\n  Finally, we cannot ignore how the continued violence and humanitarian \ncrisis in Darfur is a deep stain on the vision of a peaceful Sudan. \nEfforts at peacebuilding in Sudan will prove futile without a workable \npolitical solution for Darfur. Too often in the past, we have made the \nmistake of focusing on one region of Sudan at the expense of others. \nThis kind of piecemeal approach has proven limited, if not \ncounterproductive at times. In this critical year ahead, we need a \ncomprehensive approach that can pave the way for lasting peace and \nstability for all of Sudan. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues and the Obama administration to make that a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/09/senate-section/article/S255-4", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S255-S256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO HELEN SUZMAN\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD.

A bill to create and extend certain temporary district court \njudgeships; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nprovide urgently needed relief to federal district courts in \nCalifornia, Hawaii, Kansas, Nebraska, and Ohio.\n  This bill is supported by both Senators from all five of the States \naffected Senators Boxer and myself, Senators Brownback and Roberts, \nSenators Akaka and Inouye, Senators Nelson and Johanns, and Senators \nBrown and Voinovich.\n  The bill is identical to a bill passed by the Senate by unanimous \nconsent last year. I hope that my colleagues will move expeditiously to \nconsent to this bill once again.\n  The bill creates one new temporary judgeship in the Eastern District \nof California and one in the District of Nebraska, and it extends \ntemporary judgeships in the District of Hawaii, the District of Kansas, \nand the Northern District of Ohio.\n  The bill has broad, bipartisan support because the relief it provides \nis sorely needed. All of these courts face overwhelming caseloads that \nare leading to judicial burnout and long delays in the administration \nof justice. The bill, put simply, provides assistance to districts that \ndo not have enough judges to handle the work assigned to them.\n  I have been concerned about this problem in the Eastern District of \nCalifornia for many years now.\n  According to statistics provided by the Administrative Office of the \nUnited States Courts, the Eastern District's caseload burden is higher, \non a sustained basis, than any other district in the country.\n  In 2008, the judges in the Eastern District handled 968 cases each. \nThat is twice the number of cases that the Judicial Conference \nrecommends. In fact, the Judicial Conference has recommended that \nCongress create a new judgeship in a district whenever a threshold of \n430 cases per judge is reached.\n  A caseload burden of this magnitude is not only a problem for judges. \nThe people who live in the district and other litigants who appear \nbefore the court are also affected.\n  Victims of crime are forced to endure long waiting periods to see \njustice done. Citizens find that they are unable to resolve their civil \ndisputes promptly. And plaintiffs face extensive delays in getting \ndamages or restitution for harms that they have suffered.\n  Currently, people who have cases in the Eastern District court are \nfacing delays of approximately 42 months from filing to verdict. That \nis three and a half years--twice the national average for federal court \ndelays. This kind of delay is simply unacceptable.\n  The delays are by no means the fault of the district judges either. \nBy every measure, the judges in the Eastern District are among the most \nproductive in the nation.\n  In 2008, each of the district's active judges completed 903 cases. In \naddition to this extraordinary effort, two of the five senior judges \ncarry a full load.\n  One senior judge has explained that he has not reduced his workload \nfor two reasons: ``[F]irst the district is so short of needed judges \nthat it appears to me unjust to leave those who require a court either \nto resolve criminal cases or resolve their civil cases; second, I have \nfelt great compassion for my colleagues who would be left with a still \nmore unmanageable case load if I left or even cut down on my load.''\n  In California, the overwhelming burden on the Eastern District court \nis no secret. This past summer, the Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit \ncalled on all judges in the Circuit--district and circuit judges \nalike--to volunteer to hear 15 cases in the Eastern District each. \nAlthough 84 federal judges generously stepped forward to relieve the \nDistrict of more than 1,000 cases, thousands of cases remain pending.\n  The Eastern District of California should not be forced to rely on \ntemporary assistance from judges from other districts. Each court needs \nenough judges to handle its caseload in a reasonably timely manner.\n  Although not sufficient, one temporary district judgeship would \nprovide much needed relief to the hardworking judges of the Eastern \nDistrict and the litigants who come before them. Based on last year's \nfilings, one new judgeship would reduce the filings per judge from 968 \nto 572.\n  Congress has not authorized a new permanent judgeship for the \ndistrict since 1978. In 1992, a temporary judgeship was authorized, but \nthat judgeship expired in 2004. Last year, a bill that I co-sponsored--\nthe Federal Judgeship Act of 2008--would have provided four new \npermanent judgeships, but that bill stalled before the full Senate \nafter being favorably reported out of the Judiciary Committee.\n  This bill was introduced by Senator Leahy last year, and I want to \nthank him for all of his work on its behalf. The bill passed the Senate \nby unanimous consent. This year, the need is only greater, as caseloads \nhave only increased.\n  I urge my colleagues to consent to this bill once again, and to do so \nin an expeditious manner.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 193\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983 to \nrequire the Secretary of Agriculture to help offset the costs of \nintrastate transportation, storage, and distribution of bonus \ncommodities provided to States and food assistance agencies under the \nemergency food assistance program; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Bonus TEFAP \nAssistance Act of 2009 with my colleagues Senator Snowe and Senator \nVoinovich. Our bill provides immediate and valuable assistance to our \nnational food banks and the families who rely on food banks to put \nmeals on the table by ensuring that food banks can accept and \ndistribute food donations they might otherwise have had to decline. Our \nbill has the support of Feeding America, formerly known as America's \nSecond Harvest, the national hunger relief charity that operates a \nnetwork of over 200 food banks across America.\n  We are in the middle of a crisis. The on-going economic crisis is the \nworst in a generation, but this crisis is more than stock prices and \nmarket certainty. The economic crisis has a face. The faces of \nhardworking Pennsylvanians who suddenly find themselves unable to \nafford food for the family meals. The economic crisis is also a hunger \ncrisis--a crisis that is pushing more people to apply for Federal \nnutrition programs and stand in line at the local food bank. It is a \ncrisis that threatens to undo all of the progress we have made over the \npast few decades to end hunger in America.\n  The United States Department of Agriculture, USDA, reported that, for\n\n[[Page S258]]\n\n2006, 35.5 million Americans did not have enough money or resources to \nget food for at least some period during the year. This figure was an \nincrease of 400,000 over 2005 and an increase of 2.3 million since \n2000. With the fragile State of our economy, it is extremely likely \nthat these figures for 2007 and 2008 will be even more devastating. The \nonly recourse for these millions of families is to turn to federal food \nassistance programs and emergency food banks for their basic food \nneeds.\n  Unfortunately, as articles in national publications like the USA \nToday and the New York Times have highlighted, there is a critical lack \nof food inventories available in local food pantries across the \ncountry. Rising demand, sharp drops in federal supplies of excess \ncommodities, and declining donations have forced food banks to cut back \non rations, and in some cases, close their doors. In short, America's \nfood banks are facing critical shortages now.\n  As a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry, I was proud to help create last year's farm bill. The bill \nhelps food banks by providing additional annual funding to shore up \nfood bank supplies. But there are additional measures that we can take \nto help ensure that food banks can continue to fulfill their mission.\n  That's why today I'm pleased introduce the Bonus TEFAP Assistance Act \nof 2009. This legislation provides the critical support needed to \nensure food assistance agencies, already in desperate need of supplies, \ncan take full advantage of the distributions of bonus food commodities \nsupplied by USDA through the Emergency Food Assistance Program, TEFAP. \nBy helping to offset the intrastate storage, transportation, and \ndistribution costs the food assistance agencies incur to distribute \nthese bonus food surpluses, the bill ensures that commodities reach the \ngreatest number of needy individuals.\n  The Emergency Food Assistance Program began in 1981 as a temporary \nprogram with dual purposes; it was intended to help reduce the Federal \nfood inventories and storage costs while also assisting the needy. \nBecause of the program's success in helping distribute food to those in \nneed, in 1988, after much of the federal inventory was depleted, the \nHunger Prevention Act authorized funds to be appropriated to purchase \nfood for TEFAP.\n  Under current-day TEFAP, the USDA provides states and food assistance \nagencies with commodities bought specifically for the program and with \nfunding to help cover distributing agencies' intrastate storage, \nhandling, and distribution costs. In addition, when available, USDA \nprovides any excess food not needed to fulfill other program \nrequirements to States for allocation to local food assistance \nagencies. This excess food is known as ``bonus TEFAP.'' Unfortunately, \nwhile the USDA generously distributes these bonus TEFAP commodities to \nthe States, many of the State and food assistance agencies are unable \nto accept the bonus TEFAP commodities because they do not have the \nresources to store, transport, or distribute them.\n  The Bonus TEFAP Assistance Act of 2009 that I am introducing today \nalleviates this problem by providing offsetting funds to recipient \nagencies to assist with the costs of storing, transporting, and \ndistributing bonus TEFAP commodities. The funds provided through this \nlegislation will help to provide more food to those in need through \nfood banks, food pantries, emergency shelters, soup kitchens, and other \norganizations that directly provide these resources to the public.\n  To solve the problem the inadequacy of local resources causes, the \nbill authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to use existing funds \ngranted under Section 32 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1935. \nCurrently, Section 32 funds are used to fund child nutrition programs \nand other programs to support the farm sector at the discretion of the \nSecretary. Through this legislation, a small portion of Section 32 \nfunds would be allocated to each eligible recipient agency in the \nlesser amount of $0.05 per pound or $0.05 per dollar value of bonus \nTEFAP commodities. With this modest increase in funding, the States and \ntheir food assistance agencies will be able to accept more food \ndistributions from the USDA through TEFAP, benefitting the many low-\nincome recipients who rely on the program for emergency food and \nnutrition assistance.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join Senator Snowe, Senator Voinovich \nand me in ensuring that the States and food assistance agencies can \naccept the available excess commodity foods the USDA provides under the \nEmergency Assistance Food Program. Food assistance agencies are in dire \nneed of funds, food, and supplies and we owe it to them to ensure that \nthey can take full advantage of every opportunity to serve those in our \nnation who are in desperate need.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 194\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bonus TEFAP Assistance Act \n     of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I am introducing the Crane Conservation \nAct of 2009. I am very pleased that Senator Crapo has once again agreed \nto lead on this legislation with me. I am always glad to work with my \ncolleagues from across the aisle. We are pleased to be joined by \nSenators Boxer, Brownback, Cardin, Kerry, Kohl, Landrieu, and Martinez, \nwho are cosponsors of this legislation.\n  The Crane Conservation Act will ensure we do our part to protect the \nexistence of these birds, whose cultural significance and popular \nappeal can be seen worldwide. This legislation is particularly \nimportant to the people of Wisconsin, as our state provides habitat and \nrefuge to several crane species. But this legislation, which authorizes \nthe United States Fish and Wildlife Service to distribute funds and \ngrants to crane conservation efforts both domestically and in \ndeveloping countries, promises to have a larger environmental and \ncultural impact that will go far beyond the boundaries of my home \nState.\n  Congress' efforts to help protect and recover species throughout the \nworld began in earnest in 1994 when Congress passed and the President \nsigned the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act. The passage of this \nact provided support for multinational rhino and tiger conservation by \nauthorizing the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to distribute \nup to $10 million in grants every year to support projects in \ndeveloping countries. Since 1994, Congress has established the \n``multinational species conservation fund'' to cover other\n\n[[Page S259]]\n\nspecies, such as elephants and great apes.\n  Today, with the legislation I am introducing, I am asking Congress to \nadd cranes to this list. Cranes are the most endangered family of birds \nin the world, with 11 of the world's 15 species at risk of extinction. \nSpecifically, this legislation would authorize up to $5 million of \nfunds per year for fiscal years 2008 through 2012 to be distributed as \nconservation project grants to protect cranes and their habitat in \nAsia, Africa, and North America. In keeping with my belief that we \nshould balance the budget, this bill proposes that the $25 million in \nauthorized spending over 5 years for the Crane Conservation Act should \nbe offset through the Secretary of Interior's administrative budget. \nThis bill is similar to legislation I have introduced since the 107th \nCongress and I was very pleased that last Congress the bill passed the \nHouse of Representatives and the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee and was positioned to pass the Senate before stalling late in \nthe last Congress.\n  I am offering this legislation due to the serious and significant \ndecline that can be expected in crane populations worldwide without \nfurther conservation efforts. Those efforts have achieved some success \nin the case of the North American whooping crane, the rarest crane on \nearth. By 1890, the whooping crane disappeared from its main migratory \nroute from Idaho through Wyoming and Colorado to New Mexico. In 1944, \nonly 21 birds remained along the migratory route between Montana and \nTexas' Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, via the Dakotas, Nebraska, \nKansas, and Oklahoma. Unfortunately, the breeding grounds for this \nremaining flock were unknown, but since they were discovered in Canada \nin 1955, cooperative efforts between the United States and Canada have \nbeen under way to recover the species. Today, this flock remains the \nonly wild flock of North American whooping cranes that breeds in \nnorthwest Canada, and spends its winters in coastal Texas.\n  In 1980, a new course was chartered for recovering the species, and \ncaptive breeding efforts began at Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in \nMaryland in hopes of rearing chicks for release in the wild--today, \ncaptive breeding centers are also located at New Orleans' Audubon \nSpecies Survival Center and Canada's Calgary Zoo.\n  These breeding efforts blossomed into efforts to reintroduce a \nmigratory flock of whooping cranes into their historic range in the \nEastern United States. In 2001 this became a reality when the first \nclass of whooping cranes followed their ``mother'' (actually an ultra \nlight aircraft) over 1,300 miles to their wintering grounds.\n  The movement of this flock of birds shows how any effort by Congress \nto regulate crane conservation needs to cross both national and \ninternational lines. As this flock of birds makes its journey from \nWisconsin's Necedah National Wildlife Refuge to Florida's \nChassahowitzka National Wildlife Refuge and back, the birds rely on the \necosystems of a multitude of states in this country. Along the journey \nwhich traverses through Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, and \nGeorgia the birds face threats from pollution of traditional watering \ngrounds, collision with utility lines, human disturbance, disease, \npredation, loss of genetic diversity within the population, and \nvulnerability to catastrophes, both natural and man-made.\n  However, the birds can also rely on private landowners, the vast \nmajority of whom have enthusiastically welcomed the birds to their rest \non their land. Through its extensive outreach and education program, \nthe Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership has obtained the consistent \nsupport of farmers and other private landowners to make this important \nrecovery program a success. On every front, this partnership is unique. \nThis ongoing recovery effort would not be possible without the \ncooperative efforts of federal and state governments, landowners, \nvolunteers, and non-governmental organizations. Seven years later, \nthese partnerships support an ever-growing eastern crane population, \nnow numbering over sixty.\n  While over the course of the last half-century, North American \nwhooping cranes have begun to make a slow recovery, many species of \ncrane in Africa and Asia have declined, including the sarus crane of \nAsia and the wattled crane of Africa.\n  The sarus crane stands four feet tall and can be found in the \nwetlands of northern India and south Asia. These birds require large, \nopen, well watered plains or marshes to breed and survive. Due to \nagricultural expansion, industrial development, river basin \ndevelopment, pollution, warfare, and heavy use of pesticides prevalent \nin India and southeast Asia, the sarus crane population has been in \ndecline. Furthermore, in many areas, a high human population \nconcentration compounds these factors. On the Mekong River, which runs \nthrough Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and China, human population \ngrowth and planned development projects threaten the sarus crane. \nReports from India, Cambodia, and Thailand have also cited incidences \nof the trading of adult birds and chicks, as well as hunting and egg \nstealing in the drop in population of the sarus crane.\n  Only three subspecies of the sarus crane exist today. One resides in \nnorthern India and Nepal, one resides in southeast Asia, and one \nresides in northern Australia. Their population is about 8,000 in the \nmain Indian population, with recent numbers showing a rapid decline. In \nSoutheast Asia, only 1,000 birds remain.\n  The situation of the sarus crane in Asia is mirrored by the situation \nof the wattled crane in Africa. In Africa, the wattled crane is found \nin the southern and eastern regions, with an isolated population in the \nmountains of Ethiopia. Current population estimates range between 6,000 \nto 8,000 and are declining rapidly, due to loss and degradation of \nwetland habitats, as well as intensified agriculture, dam construction, \nand industrialization. In other parts of the range, the creation of \ndams has changed the dynamics of the flood plains, thus further \nendangering these cranes and their habitats. Human disturbance at or \nnear breeding sites also continues to be a major threat. Lack of \noversight and education over the actions of people, industry, and \nagriculture is leading to reduced preservation for the lands on which \ncranes live, thereby threatening the ability of cranes to survive in \nthese regions.\n  If we do not act now, not only will cranes face extinction, but the \necosystems that depend on their contributions will suffer. With the \ndecline of the crane population, the wetlands and marshes they inhabit \ncan potentially be thrown off balance. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin supporting legislation that can provide funding to the local \nfarming, education, and enforcement projects that can have the greatest \npositive effect on the preservation of both cranes and fragile \nhabitats. This modest investment can secure the future of these \nexemplary birds and the beautiful areas in which they live. Therefore, \nI ask my colleagues to support the Crane Conservation Act of 2009.\n  This legislation is endorsed by African Wildlife Foundation, American \nBird Conservancy, American Veterinary Medical Association, Association \nof Zoos and Aquariums, Audubon Nature Institute, Born Free USA, \nConservation International, Defenders of Wildlife, Dian Fossey Gorilla \nFund International, Fauna & Flora International, Humane Society of the \nUnited States, Humane Society International, International Crane \nFoundation, International Fund for Animal Welfare, International Rhino \nFoundation, National Wildlife Federation, National Wildlife Refuge \nAssociation, The Nature Conservancy, Sierra Club, Wildlife Alliance, \nWildlife Conservation Society, and the World Wildlife Fund.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 197\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of Transportation to waive \nnon-Federal share requirements for certain transportation programs and \nactivities through September 30, 2009; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nVermont, Senator Sanders, to introduce a bill that will help states \nstruggling with meeting non-federal match requirements for federal \ntransportation funding under the Safe, Accountable, Flexible and \nEfficient Transportation Equity Act, SAFETEA. Representative Peter \nWelch from Vermont introduced identical legislation in the House today \nas well.\n  Our States are struggling with enormous budget deficits due to the \ncurrent economic crisis. As a result, nearly every one of our states \nhas been forced to make drastic cuts to their transportation budgets. \nOn top of that, state and local governments around the country report \nthey do not have the necessary funding in their budgets to match any \nnew Federal transportation money possibly forthcoming in an economic \nstimulus package. The inability of our states to improve roads and \nbridges, support public transit agencies facing record demand, and \nupgrade rail lines puts a strain on our already sagging economy.\n  Waiving the non-federal match requirements for all highway, transit, \nand rail projects contained in SAFETEA would allow cash-strapped states \nto implement high priority transportation projects immediately--at no \nadditional cost to the Federal Government. Since State and local \ntransportation officials have ready-to-go projects that simply cannot \nmove forward without untying the strings of the required match, our \nlegislation would waive the non-federal matching requirements of \nSAFETEA through September 30, 2009.\n  I hope my colleagues will take a good look at our bill and support \nthis important legislation that will stimulate needed transportation \ninfrastructure investments all across the country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Casey):\n  S. 199. A -bill to establish the Steel Industry National Historic \nSite in the State of Pennsylvania; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation that will honor the importance of the steel industry in the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Nation by creating the ``Steel \nIndustry National Historic Site'' in southwestern Pennsylvania.\n  The importance of the steel industry to the development of the United \nStates cannot be overstated. A national historic site devoted to the \nhistory of the steel industry will afford all Americans the opportunity \nto celebrate this rich heritage, which is symbolic of the work ethic \nendemic to this great Nation. The legislation offered today would \ncreate a national historic site that would be affiliated with the \nNational Park Service. There is no better place to honor our Nation's \nsteel industry heritage than in southwestern Pennsylvania, which played \na significant role in early industrial America and continues today.\n  I have long supported efforts to preserve and enhance the historical \nsteel-related heritage through the Rivers of Steel National Heritage \nArea, which includes the city of Pittsburgh, and seven southwestern \nPennsylvania counties: Allegheny, Armstrong, Fayette, Greene, \nWashington, and Westmoreland. I have sought and been very pleased with \ncongressional support for the important work within the Rivers of Steel \nHeritage Area. I have consistently advocated for increased funding to \nsupport our National Heritage Areas and I am hopeful that this support \nwill continue. However, more than just resources are necessary to \nensure the historical recognition of this site and our steel heritage. \nThat is why I am introducing this legislation today.\n  It is important to note why Pennsylvania should be the home of the \nnational site that my legislation authorizes. The combination of a \nstrong workforce, valuable natural resources, and Pennsylvania's \nstrategic location in the heavily populated northeastern United States \nallowed the steel industry to thrive in the 19th and 20th centuries. \nToday, the remaining buildings and sites that were devoted to steel \nproduction are threatened with deterioration. Many of these sites are \nnationally significant and perfectly suited for the study and \ninterpretation of this crucial period in our Nation's development. Some \nof these sites include the Carrie Furnace Complex, the Hot Metal \nBridge, and the United States Steel Homestead Works, which would all \nbecome a part of the Steel Industry National Historic Site under my \nlegislation. As testimony of the area's historic significance, on \nSeptember 20, 2006, the Carrie Furnaces were designated as a National \nHistoric Landmark by the Secretary of the Interior.\n  Highlights of this proposed national historic site would commemorate \na wide range of accomplishments and topics for historical preservation \nand interpretation, including industrial technology advancements and \nmilestones in labor-management relations. One of the sites that would \nbe included in the historic site would be the location of the Battle of \nthe Homestead, waged in 1892 between steelworkers and Pinkerton guards. \nThe Battle of the Homestead marked a pivotal moment in our Nation's \nworkers' rights movement. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, \nindividuals, and public and private entities have attempted to protect \nand preserve resources such as the Homestead battleground and the Hot \nMetal Bridge. For the benefit and inspiration of present and future \ngenerations, it is time for the Federal Government to join this effort \nto recognize their importance with the additional protection I provide \nin this bill.\n  I commend my colleague, Representative Doyle, who has been a \nlongstanding leader in this preservation effort and who has sponsored \nthis legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives. I look forward \nto working with officials in southwestern Pennsylvania and Mr. August \nCarlino, president and chief executive officer of the Steel Industry \nHeritage Corporation, to bring this national historic site designation \nto fruition. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 199\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Steel Industry National \n     Historic Site Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Certain sites and structures in the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania symbolize in physical form the heritage of the \n     steel industry of the United States.\n       (2) Certain buildings and other structures in the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania are nationally significant \n     historical resources, including the United States Steel \n     Homestead Works, the Carrie Furnace complex, and the Hot \n     Metal Bridge.\n       (3) Despite substantial efforts for cultural preservation \n     and historical interpretation by the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania and by individuals and public and private \n     entities in the Commonwealth, these buildings and other \n     structures may be lost without the assistance of the Federal \n     Government.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to ensure the \n     preservation, interpretation, visitor enjoyment, and \n     maintenance of the nationally significant historical and \n     cultural sites and structures described in subsection (a) for \n     the benefit and inspiration of present and future \n     generations.\n\n     SEC. 3.
