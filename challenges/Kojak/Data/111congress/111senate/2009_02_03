Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 1, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1) making supplemental appropriations for job \n     preservation and creation, infrastructure investment, energy \n     efficiency and science, assistance to the unemployed, and \n     State and local fiscal stabilization, for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2009, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid (for Inouye-Baucus) amendment No. 98, in the nature of \n     a substitute.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, today, we continue consideration of the \neconomic recovery bill. Our country is facing a serious economic \nchallenge. America is in the middle of the most significant economic \ndownturn in the lifetimes of most Americans, and the bill before us is \na serious response.\n  The Finance and the Appropriations Committees have sought to assemble \nthe most effective tools available to help our economy recover. Ninety-\nnine percent of the Finance Committee's response will take effect in \nthe first 19 months of the bill. I repeat: 99 percent of the Finance \nCommittee's response will take effect in the first 19 months of the \nbill.\n\n[[Page S1372]]\n\n  Today, we begin work in earnest on the bill. We hope to consider a \nnumber of amendments. We have taken extraordinary steps to ensure the \nSenate is considering this bill with a fair process. We posted the \nFinance Committee part of the bill on the Internet last Friday, and \nChairman Inouye and I submitted our substitute amendment to the \nCongressional Record last Friday as well. So the legislative text of \nthe measure before us has been available for 4 days.\n  During the Finance Committee's consideration of the bill in \ncommittee, we had a thorough and open amendment process. The committee \nconsidered the bill over the course of 11 hours. Senators filed more \nthan 200 amendments. The committee voted on 30 amendments.\n  As we proceed to consideration of the bill on the Senate floor, we \nalso hope to have an open amendment process. We hope it will proceed \nmuch as it did on the children's health bill last week. As Senators \nwill recall, last week the Senate considered the children's health bill \nover the course of 4 days. Senators offered 27 amendments, and the \nSenate conducted rollcall votes on 14 amendments. I do not believe we \nturned any Senator away from offering an amendment last week. We had a \nthorough process, and the Senate passed the children's health bill with \nan overwhelming 66-to-32 vote.\n  This week, on the economic recovery bill, we hope once again to \nprocess a number of amendments. We intend to begin with an amendment by \nthe Senator from Washington, Senator Murray, regarding infrastructure. \nThis afternoon, we expect to consider amendments by Senator Mikulski \nregarding automobiles, Senator Boxer regarding repatriation, and \nSenator Feingold regarding earmarks.\n  We hope to consider multiple amendments during the day. This is a \nsignificant bill. We have a work product from both the Appropriations \nand the Finance Committees represented in the pending substitute. \nSenators Inouye and Cochran will manage the bill for the appropriations \nmatters and Senator Grassley and I will be managing the bill for \nfinance matters.\n  I urge Senators to let the managers know of their intentions to offer \namendments. We will want to make sure the appropriate manager is here \nto respond to the amendment. As much as possible, we would like to give \nall Senators notice about what subjects will be coming up. In other \nwords, we are working on possibly grouping subjects so as to give \nSenators a little more notice and to help make the process a little \nmore orderly.\n  I thank all Senators for their cooperation, and I look forward to a \nhealthy debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I wish to talk about not just \nthe stimulus bill but how we need to address this overall economic \ncrisis, which the more we hear about, the worse it gets. If we don't \nwatch out, we are going to be in a downward economic spiral.\n  Look back to where we got into the mess. Wall Street allowed banks to \nmake too many bad home loans. They were home loans the homeowners could \nnot afford, and many times they were rushed into signing these kinds of \nagreements when their income level would not support that kind of \nmortgage. Then Wall Street bundled thousands of those mortgages--\nsometimes you heard them referred to as subprime--and sold them as a \nsecurity. Those were bought and sold throughout the financial process, \nfrom financial institution to financial institution. They were sold at \na profit. There was little or no regulation. Of course, the bankers \nwalked away with billions of dollars in bonuses and the taxpayers now \nhave to clean up the mess.\n  Well, what began as trouble in the housing market quickly spread to \nthe financial system and, from there, to the economy as a whole. The \nrevenue stream for these mortgages was cut off because people weren't \npaying their monthly payments on the mortgages, and therefore the \nrevenue from these bundled securities of bad mortgages weren't paying \noff, and that started rippling through the entire financial system for \nwhoever held those bundled mortgages.\n  What started as an American problem now has become a global problem. \nForeign governments, many of their investors, had invested in these \nbundled securitized mortgages. Foreign governments have seen their \nexports decline, and they are finding themselves shut out when they \nseek loans from the world's banks. The banks aren't lending because \nthey do not have the security of knowledge that those borrowers are \ngoing to pay off. Lo and behold, since this thing has spread globally, \neven to foreign governments, some of the governments may even default \non their own debts, which would be a devastating blow for any nation.\n  That is a story that has yet to be told. We may have foreign \ngovernments defaulting on their debts and going into insolvency. Such \ndefaults could clearly pose a national security threat for us, as \nalready fragile governments fall and are replaced by forces that are \nhostile to American interests.\n  At the same time, our current economic crisis will soon become a \nfinancing problem for our own Government. We are running up a large \ntab. We are spending nearly $900 billion in this bill to stimulate the \neconomy. Maybe we are going to have to spend that much again to relieve \nthe banks of the toxic assets--these bad assets that are so \nunderwater--in order to get these toxic assets off the books of the \nbanks.\n  Well, when you look down the road, it is hard to fathom that we are \ngoing to put this financial burden on our children, but economists--\nconservative and liberal--across the spectrum agree that the burden \ncould be far worse if we don't take bold and immediate action, as \nevidenced in what is on the floor of the Senate now. We need to act, we \nneed to act boldly, and we need to act now.\n  This economic recovery bill that we will consider this week begins to \nmove us in the right direction. Now, there ought to be some tweaks and \nsome iterations on it, and we are going to consider that in the \namendatory process, but let's consider the thrust of it. It funds \nshovel-ready infrastructure--those projects that are ready to go--which \nare going to strengthen our Nation while creating jobs in the \nconstruction sector.\n  We heard the chairman of the Finance Committee say that over 90 \npercent of all the spending that occurs as a result of the tax cuts and \nthe tax incentives--he said over 90 percent of all the tax portion of \nthe bill is going to take effect in the first 19 months. Now that is \nthe kind of stimulus we need.\n  This bill provides health and education assistance to State \ngovernments. It protects the most vulnerable, while putting money back \ninto the economy. The legislation before us creates incentives for the \nprivate sector to put money into innovative ideas in health care \ntechnology, in energy efficiency, and in a smarter electricity grid.\n  I think this bill moves us in the right direction. But we have to \nwatch out that we do not get sidetracked. We need to make sure we are \ninvesting in sectors where the economy is idle, where Americans stand \nready to work on the projects we fund. As we debate the bill's tax \nprovisions, we need to make sure they provide incentives for employers \nto create new well-paying jobs.\n  I saw something that is disturbing to me. I saw that a group of our \nSenators is trying to do some cuts in this, and in a publication this \nmorning they singled out NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration. The chairman of the Appropriations Committee has helped \nthose of us who work in this kind of specialty here before the Senate. \nWhat this group of Senators does not realize is that is directly \nrelated to job stimulus because of the horrible situation we have \nourselves in where we are going to shut down our American vehicle to \nget to space, the space shuttle, and it is going to be another 5 years, \nunder the present plan, to get the new rocket ready to get to our own \nspace station that we have built and paid for. As a result, the Kennedy \nSpace Center, the Johnson Space Center in Texas, and the Marshall Space \nCenter in Alabama are looking at massive layoffs. My space center in \nFlorida is looking at 5,000 jobs being laid off. The chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, who has an insight into this, has provided \nthat money for stimulus for those jobs. So let's keep that\n\n[[Page S1373]]\n\ngoal in mind--jobs. That is what we want to do with this stimulus bill.\n  The legislation alone is not going to move us beyond the total \nproblem we are facing, the potential downward spiral. Experts, liberal \nand conservative, now agree that the Nation's banks are going to need \nongoing support at a cost that might exceed what we have committed \nalready. If the banks are going to continue receiving Government \nsupport, they must grant taxpayers a meaningful ownership stake. They \nmust boost lending to individuals and to small business, and they must \naccept real limits on executive compensation.\n  Of course, there is another story chronicled in this morning's \nnewspapers about how all of these banks have gotten all of these \nbillions of dollars, and that not only has not increased lending, their \nlending to borrowers has actually decreased. That is unacceptable.\n  If we provide the banks with more support--and I suspect we are going \nto have to--in this next tranche of $350 billion, then we still are \ngoing to have to address the mortgage foreclosure crisis, which is the \nroot cause of the current circumstance. We need a credible plan for \nGovernment-backed mortgage refinancing, whether it is through Freddie \nor Fannie, the FDIC, or whether we create a new loan facility that is \ncreated specifically for that purpose. I talked to the Secretary of the \nTreasury three times about this, and I am encouraged that the \nadministration appears to support such a plan.\n  I am telling you, every one of us knows that our constituents, \nparticularly those near retirement age and retired, are dramatically \nconcerned about the loss of their retirement savings which has \naccompanied the markets' collapse.\n  Since the 1980s, what happened? We have seen a shift away from a \ndefined benefit pension, toward a market-based individual retirement \naccount. Many Americans now rely on such accounts as a vital source of \nretirement income--the IRAs, the 401(k)s--and for those who have \nreached retirement--and every one of us has a lot of retirees in our \nState--or for those who hope to retire in the near future, the markets' \ncollapse has delayed or laid waste to their plans, all the while Wall \nStreet executives walk off with billions of dollars in bonuses. These \nare folks who have worked. They played by the rules. They have saved \nall of their lives. They deserve our attention more than the bankers \nwho got us into this mess.\n  I want to quote from an Indiana newspaper, the Evansville Courier. To \nour colleagues from Indiana, I wish to compliment the editorial from \nyour newspaper on February 2:\n\n       The middle class retirees who saved in their IRA and 401(k) \n     plans, and who intended to use their Social Security \n     entitlement to supplement their investment income, and \n     thereby to live out their days in modest comfort, now face \n     the complete loss of that dream. It was not a dream of \n     luxury, just a hard-won freedom from daily work and maybe a \n     trip to somewhere warm in the winter.\n\n  That is what they saved for. And once this economy recovers--and it \nwill, hopefully sooner than many predict--we are still going to have a \nlot of work that will remain. We need to look at the current causes of \nour crisis, and we need to better regulate our financial markets. As \nthe economy recovers, we will need to keep a close eye on the Nation's \nmonetary policy. Interest rates now are at historic lows, and our \nmonetary policy is looser than it has been in decades. As we step on \nthe fiscal gas, in addition to the monetary loosening, we need to make \nsure we do not overshoot the mark and trigger a new period of \ninflation.\n  So our problems are many and our options are few. Things may get \nworse before they get better. If we put aside the differences and \nreason together, they will get better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am going to proceed for a few moments on my leader \ntime.\n  Evidently, the President had a meeting with House and Senate \nDemocratic leadership last night, impressing upon them, obviously, the \nurgency of approving a stimulus bill that actually works. But I think \nit is safe to say that the version House Democrats approved last week \ncertainly does not meet that test. Most of the infrastructure \nprojections it includes would not impact the economy for at least a \nyear.\n  I was recently talking to my Governor, and he indicated basically \nthat the spend-outs were in year 2 and 3 in much of this, thereby kind \nof illustrating my point that in terms of immediate impact, it is quite \ndeficient. Worse still, permanent spending--or what we call, inside the \nBeltway, ``entitlement spending''--is actually increased by $200 \nbillion.\n  The President has talked on a number of occasions--I know I have \nspoken with him about it--about my willingness to work with him on a \nbipartisan basis to get entitlements or permanent spending under \ncontrol. We know it is going to ruin our country in the near future. \nThis bill, in the name of stimulus, actually increases permanent \nspending, entitlement spending, by $200 billion, making an already \nincredibly difficult problem worse. As everybody--almost everybody--is \nnow fully aware, the House bill was, of course, additionally loaded \nwith wasteful spending. Unfortunately, the version Senate Democrats put \nforth is not a whole lot better.\n  President Obama said 75 percent of the bill's discretionary projects \nshould be paid for within 2 years. Yet more than half of the spending \nin the Senate version would not be spent until after 2 years. President \nObama said 40 percent of the bill should be tax relief. Yet less than \none-third of the spending in the Senate version would go to tax relief. \nAnd like the House bill, the spending portion in the Senate version is \nsimply way too big. The spending portion is way too big. If you include \nthe interest payments on all of this money we are purportedly about to \nspend, the Senate Democratic bill is nearly $1.3 trillion. So I cannot \nimagine President Obama is terribly pleased with the proposal Democrats \nin the House or the Senate have put forward at this point. I am hoping \nhe convinced them last night that it is time to put forth, together, a \nbill that gives an immediate jolt to the economy and creates jobs right \nnow, not a bill that increases permanent spending, not a bill that \nspends out in years 3 and 4. A stimulus package ought to do something \nright now to stimulate the economy.\n  President Obama has acknowledged that Senate Republicans have a \nnumber of good ideas that he would like to incorporate into the final \nbill. So has the senior Senator from New York. Republicans will be \npursuing these ideas this week, and how they would help President Obama \nachieve his goal for the stimulus bill. We Republicans think we can \nsend the President a simpler, more targeted stimulus bill that gets \nright at the root of our current economic troubles, that does not waste \nmoney we do not have on projects that do not create jobs now.\n  Most people recognize that housing is at the root of the current \neconomic downturn, so we would fix this problem before we do anything \nelse. Republicans believe that one way to do that is to provide a \nGovernment-backed, 30-year fixed mortgage at approximately 4 percent to \nany creditworthy borrower. That would reduce monthly mortgage payments \nand increase demand for homes. According to this proposal, the average \nfamily would see its monthly mortgage payment drop by over $400 a \nmonth. That comes out to over $5,000 a year. Over the life of a 30-year \nloan, that is a savings of over $150,000. That is a proposal to get \nright at the housing problem now.\n\n  Next, in order to get money into the economy quickly, Republicans \npropose that we cut income tax rates for working Americans right now. \nThe Federal Government imposes a 10-percent tax on married couples for \nincomes up to $16,700. By cutting that rate in half, we put $500 into \nthe pockets of every working family and give an immediate jolt to the \ncountry. Incomes between $16,700 and $67,900 are taxed at 15 percent. \nRepublicans would cut that rate to 10 percent, putting another $1,100 \ninto the pockets of working couples. And single filers would get \nsimilar rate reductions. In other words, everyone who works and pays \nincome taxes would see an immediate increase in pay. This simpler, \ntargeted plan gets at the root of the problem, which is housing. It \nputs money into people's pockets immediately.\n  President Obama asked Congress to put together a bill without \nwasteful\n\n[[Page S1374]]\n\nspending that creates jobs now. We Republicans believe we have better \nideas for doing both. We look forward to having the chance to explain \nthese ideas this week to the American people through our amendments, \nand we look forward to having votes on those amendments in the hope \nthat many of them will pass.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Res. 70 (110th \n     Congress), the concurrent resolutions on the budget for \n     fiscal years 2008 and 2009.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, last year was tragic for workers who \nlost their jobs and their homes in this economic crisis. Through no \nfault of their own, millions of people are now wondering where they are \ngoing to find the next dollar to pay for groceries or to keep a roof \nover their heads. For them, putting money away to save for college or \nfor a secure retirement is simply a dream. It is clear we need to take \nbold action to get us through this recession and back on the road to \neconomic recovery. I believe the American recovery and reinvestment \nplan now before the Senate is that kind of bold investment.\n  Before I continue, I particularly congratulate our new Appropriations \nchairman, Senator Inouye, and commend him for his management and \ntremendous work on getting this bill and this part of it to the floor. \nHe has always shown evenhandedness and poise, as he has managed dozens \nof bills on the Commerce and Appropriations Committees. We are very \nfortunate to have him as our chairman on the Appropriations Committee, \nhelping us with this critical piece of legislation. I also thank our \nformer chairman and ranking member for his long dedication to the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Cochran. I truly appreciate his \ncontribution to this committee.\n  I rise to offer an amendment that will make this good bill even \nbetter by boosting our investment in infrastructure and creating \nthousands more good-paying American jobs. Our economy needs a jolt. We \nhave to create jobs, and we have to get commerce going again. I believe \none of the best ways we can do that and bring stability to communities \nis by investing in construction projects throughout the entire country. \nThe amendment I offer today will get more than 650,000 Americans back \nto work by injecting $25 billion into our highways and roads, mass \ntransit systems, and water and sewer networks.\n  Investing in construction projects is the tried and true way to put \npeople back to work. My amendment not only supports over 650,000 jobs, \nit supports the kind of good-paying jobs we desperately need to help \nfamilies put meals on the table or send their kids to school or save a \nlittle money for retirement. These are also the jobs our State \nGovernors and local mayors say they are praying for to help their \ncommunities. States and municipalities have felt the economic crisis \nparticularly hard. They have had to make some painful cuts and layoffs. \nThey are even canceling projects now under way to conserve cash. This \nweekend Governor Granholm from Michigan told CNN that her State could \n``have dirt flying within 180 days'' if we pass a bill that increases \nFederal infrastructure investments.\n  With the amendment we are offering today, States such as Michigan \ncould create jobs as fast as they are able to spend the money, and \nthousands of people in all 50 States would benefit. It would support, \nfor example, more than 18,000 jobs in Georgia, 27,600 jobs in Florida, \nover 20,000 jobs in Michigan, more than 13,000 jobs in the State of \nWashington, to name a few.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a chart that displays \nwhat this will do for every State.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1375]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS03FE09.001\n\n\n\n[[Page S1376]]\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. But this amendment doesn't only help the economy today \nby creating new jobs. This amendment will literally pave the way for \nfuture economic growth across the country. These investments will help \ncommunities provide cleaner drinking water and roads that are free of \ncongestion. They will help create modern railroads that will get \nworkers to their jobs more quickly and safely. They will help improve \nour ports so they are more efficient and more competitive. We all know \nbusinesses need good transportation and stable water and sewer systems. \nLess traffic means more productivity, cleaner air, and a stronger \neconomy. These investments will pay off for years to come because \ncommunities will be stronger and more competitive in the global \neconomy.\n  Finally, this amendment is critically needed because roads, bridges, \nand water and sewer systems are literally falling apart. Year after \nyear, we have had to put off repairs, while we have spent billions of \ndollars in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In August of 2007, we all \nstood aghast and watched in horror as the I-35W bridge in Minneapolis \ncollapsed into the Mississippi River. That tragedy brought home to \neveryone how critical it is that we invest in the national highway \nsystem.\n  Last week, we had another reminder when the American Society of Civil \nEngineers issued its annual report card on the condition of America's \ninfrastructure. The results were truly dismal. The leading experts on \nthe state of our Nation's infrastructure have reduced the grade point \naverage of our entire system of roads and bridges and transit and sewer \nplants to a D. Let me make it clear, that was a D average for all of \nthe Nation's infrastructure. Several specific areas which I am \ntargeting in the amendment did even worse. Wastewater treatment \nsystems, on which I have worked with Senator Feinstein, got a D-minus. \nThe engineers pointed out that leaking pipes across the country lose an \nestimated 7 billion gallons of drinking water each and every day. The \nNation's roads got a D-minus since a third of the major roads are \nconsidered to be in poor or mediocre condition. More than a third of \nurban highways are congested. American families now spend about 4.2 \nbillion hours each year stuck in traffic. That is costing the economy \nalmost $80 billion every single year. These are roads in every one of \nthe States. It is time to fix them.\n  Our transit systems only got a D, but that is still not acceptable. \nWith ridership skyrocketing, it could get worse, if we don't make the \nupgrades and improvements so dramatically needed.\n  Speaking as a mom and a former teacher, a D-minus or a D is not going \nto cut it. As far as I am concerned, when it comes to infrastructure, a \nD stands for disappointment. A D means demand change, demand attention, \nand demand investment.\n  The amendment I have offered is going to help us address these \ndeficiencies head on and put over 655,000 Americans back to work. For \nany of my colleagues who are worried about whether we can spend \ninfrastructure dollars fast enough, I want to be clear: More than a \nmillion workers across the country are today ready and able to start \ntomorrow. The unemployment rate in the construction industry is now \njust under 16 percent. More than 1.5 million construction workers are \nout of a job, a 54-percent increase over a year ago. Skilled workers \nall across the country are now forced to try to pick up whatever odd \njobs they can to pay for their week's groceries. This amendment is \nabout bringing jobs back to those workers and stability to their \nfamilies and making the kinds of investments America has ignored for \ntoo long.\n  I am proposing in the amendment that we invest another $25 billion in \nthis bill, bringing the total spending on infrastructure to $167 \nbillion. My amendment would increase transportation investments from \n$45.5 billion to more than $63.5 billion, with the largest boost going \nto highway construction. It would give all States and communities the \nequivalent of 2 years of Federal highway contributions at once, \nenabling them to support 362,000 construction jobs alone, and another \n$5 billion would go to mass transit, supporting 139,000 jobs. Senator \nFeinstein will discuss how it will increase water and sewer grants \nwithin the Environmental Protection Agency by $7 billion, supporting \n154,000 new jobs.\n  It is a scary time for millions of families across America. They are \nextremely worried about their stability and the future of their \nfamilies. They are worried about how they will pay their bills and \nwhether they will be able to keep their homes. They have put their \nfaith in all of us and in our new President to set us on a path that \nwill not only turn things around but leave our country stronger and \nmore resilient than ever. Today they are watching this debate, and they \nare expecting us to take bold, swift action to get us started. This \namendment is that kind of bold action. It supports 655,000 new, good-\npaying jobs. It will help us rebuild roads, bridges, mass transit \nnetworks, water and sewer systems that we have neglected for too long. \nMost importantly, these investments will leave communities stronger and \nmore secure in the future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and help put thousands \nof American workers back on the job and the country back on its feet.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I am extremely impressed by the Senator's presentation. I \nam proud to say that I support the measure. It will provide 655,000 new \njobs. As the boys in the back room would say: This is just what the \ndoctor ordered. Congratulations.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nIowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the matter before this body is the \nmajority's stimulus bill. It merges the products of last week's markup \nin the Finance Committee and the Appropriations Committee. Twenty-three \nSenators were involved in the Finance Committee markup. In that group, \nthere were 13 Democrats, 10 Republicans. Thirty Senators were involved \nin the other committee's markup, the Appropriations Committee. In that \ngroup, there were 17 Democrats and 13 Republicans. So if we add that \nup, it means over half the Senate has been involved in either the \nFinance Committee part or the Appropriations Committee part of this \nlegislation. For the first time, however, all Senators will have to \nconsider this very large and complicated piece of legislation. That \nstarted yesterday and will go on for a week. So the public who want to \nfollow Congress will have a long time to follow the issue.\n  We ought to take that sort of time with an $800, almost $900 billion \npiece of legislation. First, I will discuss process and then focus on \nsubstance. Because I am the senior Republican on the Finance Committee, \nI will focus on the Finance Committee's portion. I, like 69 other \nSenators, am still studying the Appropriations Committee part.\n  First, I thank my friend from Montana, Chairman Baucus, for \ncourteously and professionally consulting Members on this side. We had \none bipartisan Members' meeting where Chairman Baucus patiently heard \nall of us out. In addition, Chairman Baucus apprised me of the \nnegotiations between Democratic leadership of both bodies and the Obama \nadministration. Those Democrats-only negotiations were extensive. Folks \non our side who read press reports could see how extensive they were. \nFurther evidence of that deal making is the relatively small \ndifferences between the basic structure of the Committee on Ways and \nMeans of the House of Representatives and the Finance Committee of the \nSenate. I congratulate Chairman Baucus on those negotiations. The fruit \nof that labor is the Finance Committee package.\n  One significant change followed a recommendation I made in early \nJanuary. That change was made in committee. That was the addition of \nthe alternative minimum tax patch for this year which means over 24 \nmillion families need not worry about an average tax increase of at \nleast $2,000 per family for this year. But let no one be mistaken that \nthis bill is the result of bipartisan negotiations. While Republicans \nwere courteously consulted at the Member and staff level, we were never \nat the negotiating table. Speaker Pelosi best described the bottom line \nof the process from the Washington\n\n[[Page S1377]]\n\nPost, dated Friday January 23, when she said:\n\n       Yes, we wrote the bill. Yes, we won the election.\n\n  Indeed, there was a rumor floating around about an informal agreement \namong Democratic Members. The agreement appeared to be to vote against \nany Republican amendments, no matter what the merits of the amendments \nmight be. As proof of that, if one would review the markup, they will \nfind that nearly all Republican amendments were defeated on a virtually \nparty-line vote. They will also find, for the first time in recent \nFinance Committee tax legislative history, small issues or \nmodifications raised by dissenting Members, with a couple exceptions. I \nthank the leadership for those exceptions. None of these smaller issues \nwere even accommodated.\n\n  So let's be clear. We knew at the outset the markup would be \nratifying a deal made between Democratic leaders of the House and \nSenate: No Republican ideas need apply. With the exception of that AMT \npatch amendment, this was the basic outcome.\n  Since the largely partisan markup process finished, we have been told \nby the President and members of the Democratic leadership that this \nbill is open to improvement by amendment, and I am hopeful we will see \nthat follow through, and before the day is over, I am sure we are going \nto have some votes where we can do that.\n  If I could define ``bipartisanship'' just for a minute, I would \ndefine it kind of the way I have seen it work over the past decade in \nthe Finance Committee but probably other committees do the same thing. \nDays before you want to bring up a bill, you sit down and you negotiate \nbetween the two leaders, and maybe other people, but you consider every \nmember's position to some extent, and you come out with what is called \na bipartisan mark.\n  In our committee, for some times that was Grassley-Baucus, for other \ntimes it was Baucus-Grassley. It is a little bit like buying a new car. \nIf it is going to be a family operation, Chuck Grassley does not go up \nto Barbara Grassley and say: I have made a determination that we are \ngoing to buy a Ford Taurus, and it is going to be blue, and it is going \nto have these accessories, et cetera, et cetera. No. You sit down. \nChuck and Barbara Grassley sit down, and we decide what color car do we \nwant, what brand do we want, what do we want for accessories, et \ncetera, et cetera. And you go to the dealer, and you have a uniform \nfamily position of what kind of a car you buy.\n  That is the way bipartisanship ought to work here. That is the way I \ndefine it. That is the way it has worked over a long period of time. \nBut it is not the way it worked in the product we have before us.\n  Now we have the President of the United States saying to leaders of \nhis party, when they meet at the White House: Republicans have good \nideas, and we want to work toward bipartisanship. Now we have a process \nin place. Will the President's leadership make a difference to the \nmajority party here on Capitol Hill?\n  Before I get into substance, though, I wish to pull back and talk \nabout the larger picture for a couple minutes. Majority Leader Reid \nopened debate on this bill yesterday. Yesterday we also had Groundhog \nDay. My first chart is a depiction of Punxsutawney Phil, that famous \nweather forecaster there in Pennsylvania. Yesterday, Phil saw his \nshadow. Groundhog Day is a recurring event. ``Groundhog Day'' is also \nthe title of a famous film starring Bill Murray.\n  I have another picture for you of Phil and Bill driving along. In the \nmovie ``Groundhog Day,'' Bill Murray finds himself continually \nrepeating the same routine. Now, my friend, Chairman Baucus, last year \nrightly pointed out the message of the film. The message was that Bill, \nguided by Phil, eventually had to figure out what he was doing wrong. \nOnce Bill figured it out, he escaped the infinite loop.\n  On this bill before us, we need to learn from Bill's and Phil's \nadventure. We cannot and we should not legislate in a hasty manner and \nplace ourselves in an infinite loop of repeating the same exercise. \nDemocrats and Republicans and the President need to get this right, \nparticularly in the time of the terrible economic recession we are in. \nWe cannot casually deficit spend and ask American taxpayers to clean up \nthe fiscal mess with high taxes down the road.\n  To me, there is a particularly compelling irony to the fact that we \nare debating another stimulus bill at roughly the same Groundhog Day \ntimeframe. One year ago, almost to this exact date, the Senate spent a \nweek debating an economic stimulus package. The target time set for \nenacting legislation was similar to the one for this package. I am \ntalking about the Presidents Day recess. Let's keep the Groundhog Day \nirony in mind as we move forward this week and next week. Let's not \nrepeat the same exercise, except this time with even much bigger \ndollars. Let's get it right.\n  Now to substance. I want to make it clear that most on our side agree \nwith President Obama that stimulus is necessary. The economy is flat on \nits back. Too many Americans who want to find work cannot find those \njobs. A lot of Americans are worried their job will be the next to go. \nWe get that on our side. Everyone here knows we need to do everything \nwe can to get the economy moving again. Where we differ between parties \nis the degree to which the engine ought to be Government or the engine \nought to be the private sector, especially America's biggest job \ncreator, our small business sector, where you hear quite regularly from \neconomists that 70, 80 percent of the new jobs are created. In fact, in \nthe year 2007, big business created no new jobs. All the new jobs in \n2007 were created by small business.\n  These are honest, well-intentioned, philosophical differences between \nour two parties: Government or the private sector. But those are \ndifferences that are there. On our side, we want the new jobs to come \nfrom the private sector. On the other side, the preference is to grow \nemployment through an expansion of Government.\n  Many on the other side and opinion makers who agree with them are \ninvoking the example of Iowa-born President Hoover. Iowa is my home \nState. They seem to be doing it to portray anyone who questions the \ntrillion-dollar package as a reincarnation of what we call Hoover \neconomics. It is an unfair characterization. Again, let's be clear. \nFolks on our side recognize the need for action. So do not accuse us of \nHooverism.\n  Also, though Iowans are rightly respectful of the only Iowan to be \nPresident, President Hoover, you have to recognize history. I would \ninstruct the other side on a couple lessons from the Hoover era, too, \nwhere President Hoover was wrong. One lesson: Do not obstruct free \ntrade. The highest tariff levels in the history of this country--the \nSmoot-Hawley tariffs--were enacted in the middle of his Presidency, and \nit shut down world trade. We have to think about that right now because \nthe latest reports have the first reversal of the growth of trade \nworldwide since 1982. There is little doubt those protectionist \nbarriers that were put up in 1930 or 1931 made the Great Depression \nworse. So let's not repeat that mistake. There is some evidence on the \nother side of the aisle that they do want to repeat that mistake and \nbuild up protectionist walls.\n  Now, there is another lesson from the Hoover era I want the other \nside to be aware of. President Hoover signed into law significant tax \nincreases that made that Depression worse. Like high tariffs, economic \nhistory tells us that these burdensome taxes retarded the economy's \nability to recover--a recovery that did not happen until World War II \ncame along. We do not want war to get us out of a recession.\n\n  On this side, we agree the lessons from the Hoover era need to be \nlearned. We cannot be passive. President Hoover was passive. Errors of \nomission on fiscal stimulus should be avoided by all of us. Likewise, \nerrors of commission on fiscal stimulus, such as impeding free trade \nand raising taxes, also should be avoided.\n  By the conclusion of this debate, those differences will be plain to \npeople at the grassroots of America. I will tell you, all you have to \ndo is go to Iowa, go to church on Sunday, go eat at the Village Inn \nafter church with your family, go to a University of Northern Iowa \nbasketball game, and talk to your neighbors. The public knows what is \ngoing on here. They see this as a big spending bill and not a stimulus \nbill.\n\n[[Page S1378]]\n\n  We will see differences fleshed out in the debate and on the \namendments. That is the way it should be. As I indicated above, most on \nour side want to improve this bill. Our amendments, large and small, \nwill be offered as improvements. We hope the other side is sincere and \nwill follow our President's admonition yesterday in their desire to \nchange the bill in a way that can garner a bipartisan majority. Whether \nRepublicans or Democrats have been in control, the test of proper \nstimulus boils down to three words.\n  That famous Harvard economist, former Secretary of the Treasury, a \ngood person, Larry Summers, had this to say that ought to be a lesson \nfor both political parties:\n\n       As with any potent medicine, stimulus, if misadministered, \n     could do more harm than good by increasing instability and \n     creating long run problems. A stimulus program should be \n     timely, targeted, and temporary.\n\n  He may not be an MD, but there is a lesson from that Ph.D. we can \nlearn. It is a lesson of medicine: First, do no harm. Well, we want to \nmeasure this bill according to what Dr. Summers says. If you apply the \nthree ``T's'' test to much of the spending in this proposal, you will \nfind it fails the test. We will get into that when we examine and \ndebate the bill.\n  Some folks might ask: What is the problem if we overshoot and flunk \nthe test? The first problem is running out of budget room. The bill \nbefore us will, when interest costs are included, add up beyond that \n$900 billion to $1.3 trillion added to the deficit. All of this extra \ndeficit increase would be proposed when the baseline deficit for this \nfiscal year will hit $1.2 trillion. That amount exceeds all historical \nrecords. As a percentage of our economy, that will mean 8.3 percent of \ngross domestic product.\n  I have read some economists saying that is more stimulus than we have \never had in the history of this country. Maybe 8.3 percent is enough. I \nthink in a bipartisan way, and with the President, we concluded it is \nnot enough. But above that, it seems to me, we ought to be cautious and \nmake sure it is timely, temporary, and targeted because this amount of \n8.3 percent easily exceeds the 5.7 percent in 1983. It is almost 50 \npercent above any comparable post-World War II levels.\n  The figures on Federal debt held by the public are likewise \nstaggering. In the period of 2001 to 2007, debt held by the public \nincreased by comparatively smaller amounts, roughly 1 percent per year. \nThis year's change easily exceeds all of that, as you can see from this \nchart of how the deficit continues to go up. You also see it there, as \na percent of gross national product, higher than it has been for a 40-\nyear average.\n  So we need to acknowledge the deficit situation we are in. It is very \nserious. So whatever we do, we ought to not make the long-term fiscal \nsituation worse than it is. You can see from this chart in the outyears \nhow bad that situation is going to be.\n  The other problem is if we prime the pump too much and the pumped-out \nstimulus does not materialize until after the hoped-for recovery is \nupon us, then we might risk too much stimulus. The result could be \ninflation.\n  Let's look at the timely part of Dr. Summers' statement. That needs \nto be brought into sharper focus. The Congressional Budget Office tells \nus that less than half of the appropriations amounts will be spent out \nby the end of fiscal year 2010. So only half of the spending in the \nbill is timely. The Finance package does a little better. Ironically, \nthe tax policy stimulus, much maligned by the hardcore of both \nDemocratic caucuses, helps the spend-out ratio greatly in the Finance \npackage.\n  The theory for erring on the side of overloading the spending side is \nthat we need to direct dollars to the folks most likely to spend them. \nThis is the reason we are told we need extra FMAP money, expanded \nentitlements, and other State aid.\n  It misses the point that the U.S. fiscal policy system already has an \narsenal of antirecessionary automatic stabilizers directed to the very \nsame populations. These stabilizers provide immediate assistance to \nthose most vulnerable who have been hit by an economic downturn. The \nCongressional Budget Office says that these benefits, including food \nstamps, unemployment insurance, and Medicaid, will grow to $250 billion \nthis year. That built-in, lower income-population stimulus will be \nequal to 1.8 percent of gross national product.\n  It also misses the point, when you argue that you ought to err on the \nside of overspending, about ensuring that the lessons of moral hazards \napply to the States. The fiscal problems faced by many of our States \nand localities are largely the result of their inability to keep \nspending in line with revenue. Between the third quarter of 2006 and \nthe third quarter of 2008, State revenues increased 7 percent and State \nspending increased twice that amount--15 percent. In other words, the \nStates and localities spent $2.22 for each additional dollar of \nrevenue. The States have been on a spending spree, and they have dug \nthemselves into a hole.\n  Now, we will hear that the Medicaid money we are adding--which I \nrefer to as a slush fund for States--is necessary to avoid tax \nincreases at the State and local level. We will also hear that vital \nservices will be cut unless we cut a big blank check to States. Just as \nwe did during the Finance Committee markup, some on our side will test \nthese assumptions with amendments on these points. An open-ended slush \nfund is not targeted. It is not going to bring about sound, responsible \nfiscal policy in the States that need it, and this is true no matter \nhow you dress up this issue.\n  Perhaps the most disturbing stimulus test failure is on the third \n``t''--that it should be temporary. This is what bothers me most about \nthis bill. I am referring, of course, to the temporary test. In this \npackage, there are many new popular spending programs labeled \n``temporary.'' Those programs total $140 billion. If these programs are \nextended or made permanent, we can expect another $1.3 trillion added \nto future deficits. I will challenge anyone on the other side to tell \nme these programs will be turned off once enacted. With large \nDemocratic majorities and a Democratic President, I would say any such \npromise is dubious in this Congress. It is about as deliverable as a \npromise to sell the Brooklyn Bridge.\n  Just so appropriators don't get too far out on a limb, I wish to \nquote from what Chairman Miller of one of the House committees had to \nsay. He was talking about these built-in expenditures that are going to \ngo beyond the 2 years; things that ought to be handled by the \nAppropriations Committee on an annual basis, considering all of the \npriorities that come to us from all segments of the economy and from \nall government programs. If you think you are building this into the \nbase, this is Chairman Miller--I am going to quote here from Congress \nDaily:\n\n       Chairman Miller in the House was asked about the fact that \n     funding for education programs disappears in two years, and \n     he said the word he got from the Obama administration is that \n     these funding levels will NOT become the baseline and that in \n     two years, we can expect that the President's Budget Request \n     will be lower than these new levels. That means schools will \n     see a short-term jump for these programs, but any teacher or \n     programs they put in place may be cut in two years.\n\n  Now, let me just ask my colleagues about that. Is it smart to use \nsomething that is absolutely needed--a stimulus bill--for an excuse to \njack up spending well into the future? That is going to be done in 1 \nweek. Isn't that something appropriations committees generally take \nseveral months to do before they make decisions to go down that road? \nThat is something for my colleagues to consider.\n  To sum it up, this package meets a different three t's test. We start \nwith trillion-dollar deficits. We have a bill that, with interest \nadded, adds more than another trillion dollars to future deficits. We \nhave a bill that has new spending ostensibly labeled as ``temporary'' \nbut likely to be extended, that bakes into the cake another $1 trillion \nof future deficits. Passing this three t's--as in trillions--test ought \nto be a Senator's pause, and we hope during this debate that pause \nhappens. From our side's view, these are major shortcomings on the \nsubstance.\n  Although we saw execution of a deal to vote down our amendments in \ncommittee no matter whether our ideas were meritorious or not, we would \nlike to be and will be constructive, and we will build on parts of the \npackage that we support. But make no mistake about it, we are going to \ntry to use Dr. Summers' guideline of, first, do no harm--he didn't say \nthat--but the\n\n[[Page S1379]]\n\nthree t's test he put on the chart from his quotation. In other words, \nwe hope our amendments will be more openly received on the Senate floor \nthan they were in committee.\n  In this respect, we will go back to major differences between the \nparties on how to get the economy moving. On our side, we would like to \npush more incentives for long-term growth of private sector jobs. There \nis a good start on a broad-based middle-income tax cut in the package. \nWe would like to expand the tax cut to cover all middle-income \ntaxpayers.\n  During this fall's campaign, the President described as middle class \nfamilies making less than $250,000. Many of the tax cuts don't apply to \nmillions of families making less than $250,000. It doesn't make sense \nto me to call a proposal a middle-class tax cut if it doesn't apply to \nmillions of middle-class families. We would like to direct that at \nlabor and capital income earned by middle-income taxpayers.\n  Since we weren't at the negotiating table to offer these progrowth \nideas, you will see them arise as constructive offers to improve the \npackage.\n  I wish to speak for just a minute to some health provisions in the \nbill.\n  Spending in this bill should be judged based on two criteria: Will it \nstimulate the economy, and is the money being well spent? In committee, \nwe aired our honest disagreements over whether several of these \nprovisions were actually stimulative. Improving health information \ntechnology is critical for health care infrastructure. I support many \nof those provisions, but I have to ask: Will it stimulate our economy, \nand is this money we should add to the deficit rather than offsetting \nit?\n  It wasn't so long ago that $16 billion was a lot of money around \nhere. Providing assistance to States makes sense if we are concerned \nabout States raising taxes or cutting spending. But is $87 billion the \nright number, and is increasing Medicaid spending the right way to do \nit beyond what is necessary to take care of the millions of people who \nare going to lose their health insurance? That is a much smaller \nfigure; somewhere around $10 billion to $12 billion rather than $87 \nbillion. Could we better stimulate economic recovery using all or part \nof that money elsewhere?\n  The Finance Committee package also includes a 2-year extension of our \ncurrent Trade Adjustment Assistance Programs. I am working with the \nchairman to see if we can agree with our counterparts on the House Ways \nand Means Committee on a broader reauthorization of these programs, but \nthat is still a work in progress.\n  Apart from trade adjustment assistance, I am disappointed that this \nadministration isn't focusing on trade as a component of an economic \nstimulus package. As I said, we should heed an important lesson from \nthe Hoover era. Economic growth comes from expanding free trade, not \ncontracting it, because protectionism in the 1930s brought us to World \nWar II. Opening new markets for U.S. exporters should be a part of the \nmindset to stimulate our economy.\n  Right now, 20,000 people are being laid off from Caterpillar. I don't \nthink John Deere has laid off very many yet, but 22 percent of John \nDeere workers have their jobs because of international trade--tractors \nmade in Waterloo, IA, getting on boats in Baltimore to go overseas. We \ndon't want to shut down those kinds of jobs, and without emphasis upon \ntrade being a very important part of a stimulus package, we are sending \na message that trade does not matter. Trade does matter. For instance, \nwe have these pending agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea \nwhich would provide significant opportunity to do just that, and they \nshould be implemented as soon as possible.\n  As we go through the bill, our side will offer several amendments \nthat I hope will be accepted to try to make the bill better and answer \nthe questions I and other Members have raised. The people back home see \nCongress spending vast amounts of taxpayers' money. They are counting \non us to ensure their money is spent wisely and not wastefully, and \nthat means to make sure this is a stimulus bill and not a ``porkulus'' \nbill.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I know the Senator \nfrom California wishes to make a statement.\n  Very briefly, I might just say first how much I enjoy working with my \ngood friend, Senator Grassley from Iowa. He is a joy to work with. I \nknow of no finer Senator. He is a man of his word. He is a man of \nintegrity and good will. He is a terrific Senator. I have enjoyed \nworking with him on the committee in many respects.\n  I also wish to thank him for his kind words about the openness with \nwhich I have attempted to conduct the committee. I also wish to commend \nhim for his AMT amendment to make sure Americans don't pay more taxes \nover the next year. The amendment he offered, as well as the Senator \nfrom New Jersey, Mr. Menendez--the two of them offering the amendment \nwas the right thing to do. Some have suggested we drop that amendment. \nI vigorously resisted that because I think it is a good idea that we \nhave the AMT patch.\n  There are other provisions in here which remind all of us to help \ntaxpayers. One is extending the small business expensing provision for \n2 years. That is going to help small business. That also included an \nentire threshold that was enacted last year. Added to that, we have \npayback periods for net operating loss extended from 2 years to 5 \nyears, as well as business tax credits extended from 2 years to 5 \nyears. So businesses can carry back losses with respect to credits they \nhave otherwise earned, whether it is an R tax credit or an energy \ncredit.\n  So I want to continue working with the good Senator from Iowa as we \nimprove this bill. I do not know whether I agree with all of the \namendments some Senators on his side of the aisle will be offering, but \nwe will certainly do our very best to keep improving the bill. There \nare some very good tax provisions in here to help individual taxpayers \nand business taxpayers.\n  So I just wish to thank the Senator for working with us on this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \nSenator Murray has just sent to the desk which would add $25 billion to \nthe infrastructure portion of the bill. I thank her for her work on \nthis amendment.\n  I also thank the chairman of the committee, Senator Inouye. Senator \nInouye became chairman of the committee approximately 1 week before \nthis bill came out of committee, so it really represents a great deal \nof work in a very short period of time, and I believe he is to be \ncommended for that.\n  In my view, as a former mayor, a stimulus means job production, very \nsimply. As this bill stands, only 16 percent of the stimulus package \ngoes toward infrastructure, which is the physical basis on which a \nnation's economy functions, while 39 percent would finance tax cuts.\n  To be very candid with you, I am one of those who do not believe tax \ncuts are necessarily stimulative. The reason I don't believe that is \nbecause I believe the buying habits of Americans in this particular \ncrisis have changed. I don't think $80 a month in the form of a tax \ncredit is going to change that. We put $135 billion out in a rebate, \nand less than 15 percent of it, it was estimated--by the best chance--\nwent into the economy. So I really worry that this package is tax cut \nheavy and doesn't do what it should do with respect to the production \nof jobs to repair this physical base on which a nation's economy can \nfunction.\n  The amendment, as Senator Murray said, is cosponsored by 21 of us. I \nvery much appreciate all of the Senators' support. It adds $18 billion \nfor highway and rail. Those of you who have ridden high-speed rail from \nTokyo and Osaka know that it was built in the mid-sixties. Here we are \nin 2009, and we don't have a real high-speed rail, either by MAGLEV or \nsteel wheel, anywhere in this country today. If you travel through \nEurope, you travel on fast trains. If you go from Pudong in Shanghai to \nthe airport by transit, you can take a MAGLEV system, which does 30 \nmiles in less than 20 minutes. Our highways are jammed. People go to \nwork in gridlock. The newspaper this morning reported that metropolitan \nWashington, D.C. has some of the highest commuter travel times in \nAmerica.\n\n[[Page S1380]]\n\n  We need to repair this infrastructure, and the beauty of doing it as \npart of this package is that it puts people to work immediately on \nprojects that are shovel ready. So I believe $18 billion in this bill, \nwhich is for highway and rail, and an additional $7 billion in \nrevolving loan funds for clean water and sewer projects is really \nnecessary. You might say: $25 billion--what does that do in this \npackage? I will tell you what it does. It raises the percentage of \ninfrastructure from 16 to 19 percent. That is all it does. That is how \nbig this package is and how little of it is really the kind of \ninfrastructure we should be producing.\n  For the water infrastructure portion alone, this amendment could \ncreate as many as 154,000 additional jobs beyond that which is \nestimated in the stimulus package. The transportation portion of the \namendment would add 501,000 jobs. So, as Senator Murray said, in total, \nthis amendment would create a net new 655,000 jobs--jobs that are \ndesperately needed to put Americans back to work and revive our \ncountry.\n  I come from a State that is big. It is the seventh or eighth largest \neconomy in the world. It has stopped all public works projects, and it \nis furloughing State employees. It is in deep trouble. Where California \ngoes, because it is such a big part of the economic infrastructure of \nthis Nation, affects other States as well.\n  I want to expand a bit as chairman of the Interior and Environment \nSubcommittee of Appropriations because I am very concerned about what I \nbelieve has been insufficient funding for clean water and sewer \nprojects. We put over 50 percent of our allocation into these projects. \nIt wasn't enough. We have a huge water infrastructure problem in \nAmerica. Our sewer systems are deteriorating; they are old and they are \nbroken. Each year, aging and overburdened sewer and storm water systems \noverflow; they break and release more than 860 billion gallons of \npartially treated sewage into our rivers and streams, polluting them. \nLast year, contamination from these spills and overflows was the second \nleading cause of beach closings and water health advisories \nnationwide--more than 4,000 closings and advisories--and the problem is \nonly getting worse.\n  Investment in our Nation's water systems has not kept pace with the \npopulation growth or sprawling development.\n  The Government Accountability Office and EPA report that the Nation \nfaces a $300 billion to $500 billion water and wastewater funding gap \nover the next 20 years. So by investing now in needed water and \nwastewater infrastructure, we can, in fact, create millions of jobs \nhere at home and better protect human health.\n  With this amendment, the total for the water and wastewater State \nrevolving fund will be $13 billion, with $10 billion for wastewater \nprojects and $3 billion for drinking water projects. As I said, the \nEPA, which oversees this Federal program, has indicated to us that they \ncan move these additional dollars quickly. These funds will go directly \nto the States, which in turn make them available to local communities. \nBecause the law is a revolving loan fund, there is language in this \nthat effectively makes these loans grants to States. The $6 billion \ncurrently in the bill will fund 1,290 wastewater projects and 769 \ndrinking water projects. By increasing this funding by $7 billion, for \nthe total of $13 billion, this amendment would triple the number of \nwastewater projects to 3,226 and provide 30 percent more drinking water \nprojects.\n  The States will choose these projects based on their most urgent \nneeds. Here are some of the projects that have been funded in the past \nthrough this program:\n  The aquifer in Rockland County, NY, was being polluted by sewer waste \nfrom septic tanks. The local sewer district used $80 million from the \nClean Water State Revolving Fund to replace these septic systems with a \nnew collection system and wastewater treatment plant. The county also \ninstalled advanced treatment technology to protect the millions of \nresidents downstream of its facility.\n  The town of Easton, MD, was flushing huge nutrient loads into the \nChesapeake Bay. It received a $20.5 million loan to expand its \nwastewater system to install enhanced nutrient-removal technologies and \nnow exceeds Chesapeake Bay's water quality goals.\n  A subdivision with septic systems in Lexington County, SC, needed a \nconnection to the nearest town's public sewer. The area septic systems \nhad been improperly maintained and were in jeopardy of contaminating \nthe groundwater. Thanks to funding from this program, it has a \nconnection.\n  In my State, Orange County is using $162.9 million to implement a \nground water replenishment system, the largest of its kind in the \nworld. Highly treated wastewater will be pumped into basins, where it \nwill percolate back into the ground. This project not only improves \nwater quality but reliability and supply in an area facing long-term \ndrought.\n  This amendment, as I said, waives the State match requirement in an \neffort to maximize the use of the funds. This funding, which can be put \nto use immediately, will assist the municipalities of our Nation in \nupgrading their wastewater systems and ending the damage to our \nenvironment. But it is not only these benefits that speak to the merits \nof increasing this funding--and we could do more; we could do at least \nanother $3 billion more under EPA's ability to move the money.\n  The U.S. Conference of Mayors estimates that every dollar spent on \nwastewater infrastructure generates a return of $3 to $7 that flows \nback directly into the economy. The Commerce Department estimates that \nfor each additional job created in the water and sewer industry, 3.68 \njobs are created in all industries. So it has a ripple effect.\n  The Association of State and Interstate Water Pollution Control \nAdministrators indicates that nearly $20 billion of shovel-ready \nwastewater infrastructure projects await financing today throughout the \ncountry.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, the problem I have with this package is \nthat, in my view, it is heavy on tax cuts which go right to the bottom \nline of the deficit and the debt and will reduce allocations to \nappropriators to fund the next 2 years' budgets, unless we drive this \ncountry deeper into debt and deficit. It is shy on the infrastructure, \nwhich is the stimulus projects.\n  Let me make one other point on the change of America's buying habits \nwhich I believe has taken place. If you look at people actually laid \noff from Caterpillar and you look at retail closures--the latest of \nwhich is Macy's, as of last night, indicating that they are terminating \n7,000 people from their jobs--you will see that people are buying less. \nIt is reflected in automobile sales, it is reflected in tractor sales, \nand it is reflected in shopping and electronic equipment shopping.\n  I believe the important thing of this package is to put people back \nto work. My State has 1.7 million people who are out of work. We need \nto do those things that are necessary, such as extend unemployment \ninsurance, protect the safety net, and have a massive program to \nrebuild what is a failing economic infrastructure in this country, so \nthat America can compete in this new millennium.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add as \ncosponsors Senators Schumer and Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Feinstein for her \ncosponsorship and working with me and the chairman on including this \namendment that would provide 655,000 jobs.\n  I heard the Senator from Iowa earlier talking about providing or \nincreasing Government jobs. I would let our colleagues know that this \namendment before us is about private construction jobs.\n  In fact, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nletter from AGC of America, Associated General Contractors, as well as \na letter from FasterBetterSafer, Americans for Transportation Mobility, \nwhich represents the American Public Transportation Association, the \nAmerican Road and Transportation Builders Association, the Associated \nEquipment Distributors, the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, the \nAssociated General Contractors, the American Society of Civil \nEngineers, the International Union of Operating Engineers, the Laborers \nInternational Union of\n\n[[Page S1381]]\n\nNorth America, the National Asphalt Pavement Association, the National \nStone, Sand, and Gravel Association, the United Brotherhood of \nCarpenters and Joiners of America, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, in \nsupport of this amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            The Associated General\n\n\n                                       Contractors of America,\n\n                                  Arlington, VA, February 2, 2009.\n     Re: Support Murray/Feinstein Amendment.\n\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: The Associated General Contractors of \n     America urges you to support the Murray/Feinstein amendment \n     to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The \n     amendment will provide additional funding to critical surface \n     transportation and water infrastructure projects across the \n     country.\n       Construction employment has tumbled by 899,000, or 11.6 \n     percent, since peaking in September, 2006. Unfortunately \n     because of dwindling public and private funding more than a \n     million more good workers could face layoffs in 2009 without \n     significant construction stimulus.\n       Providing a significant investment in funding for \n     construction projects would help address our nation's \n     infrastructure investment gap and create good jobs in \n     communities across America. AGC estimates that, an additional \n     $1 billion of investment in nonresidential construction \n     supports or creates 28,500 jobs. More than half of the gain \n     would impact non construction elements of our economy, as \n     workers and owners in the construction and supplier \n     industries spend their added income on a wide range of goods \n     and services.\n       We estimate that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act \n     would create or support more than 1.85 million new jobs \n     between now and the end of 2010, including over 620,000 \n     construction jobs, 300,000 jobs in supplying industries and \n     930,000 jobs throughout the broader economy.\n       The construction industry stands ready to participate in \n     the economic recovery spawned by the American Recovery and \n     Reinvestment Act of 2009. Thousands of AGC members across the \n     country have expressed their personal commitment to putting \n     this funding to use quickly. Please support the Murray/\n     Feinstein amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Jeffrey D. Shoaf,\n\n                                        Senior Executive Director,\n     Government and Public Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                 February 2, 2009.\n       To the Members of the U.S. Senate: The Americans for \n     Transportation Mobility (ATM) Coalition strongly supports the \n     inclusion of funding for highways and public transportation \n     in S. 336, the ``American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of \n     2009,'' and urges the Senate to increase funding levels for \n     highways and public transportation to at least the levels \n     provided in H.R. 1, the House-passed version of this \n     legislation.\n       Preserving and creating jobs through highway and public \n     transportation infrastructure investment is a key element of \n     this economic recovery package. The investments in near-term \n     transportation projects supported by this legislation would \n     protect and create jobs to support broad recovery and address \n     particularly hard hit sectors like construction. \n     Transportation spending also results in long-term economic \n     benefits: transportation infrastructure plays a critical role \n     supporting the nation's economy by facilitating safe, \n     efficient, and reliable movement of people and goods.\n       The recovery package is an important step toward renewing \n     highway and transit infrastructure, but it is only a \n     beginning. The ATM Coalition looks forward to working with \n     the Senate in the coming months on reauthorization of the \n     Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity \n     Act--A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), which must build on the \n     investment in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act by \n     providing the policy and programmatic reforms as well as \n     long-term funding needed for highways and public \n     transportation.\n       ATM urges you to increase funding for highways and public \n     transportation investments in S. 336 to at least the House-\n     passed levels.\n           Sincerely,\n                            Americans for Transportation Mobility.\n       ATM Management Committee Members: American Public \n     Transportation Association, American Road and Transportation \n     Builders Association, Associated Equipment Distributors, \n     Association of Equipment Manufacturers, Associated General \n     Contractors, American Society of Civil Engineers, \n     International Union of Operating Engineers, Laborers \n     International Union of North America, National Asphalt \n     Pavement Association, National Stone, Sand, and Gravel \n     Association, United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of \n     America, U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the point is these are private sector \njobs. In fact, less than 1 percent of these will go to Government jobs, \nand those jobs will be oversight and accountability to make sure our \ntaxpayer dollars are spent wisely.\n  I look forward to having a vote on this amendment as soon as our \nchairman determines the time. I ask our Senate colleagues to join us in \nmaking sure we create the kind of investment, infrastructure, job \ncreation that we have told America about, and we know will get us back \non our feet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I applaud the Senator from Washington in \nbringing this point to the attention of the American people, as I have \nbeen trying to do, that in this stimulus bill--and the same is true on \nthe House side--there is far too little construction, far too little \njobs.\n  I found it very difficult to believe that in the bill that came over \nfrom the other side there was only some $30 billion. I can share now, \nbecause it has been public, that 8 days ago on Monday, President Obama \naddressed our conference. During that conference, we talked about the \nstimulus bill. He was very generous with his time. In fact, he was \nthere for an entire hour. I said: It is inconceivable to me--and here \nwe were talking about the bill that was being considered on the other \nside--that with some $800 billion or $900 billion--that is without \ninterest--it is going to be over $1 trillion when you add interest--but \nwith those amounts, you only have $30 billion of roads and highways.\n  Quite frankly, President Obama was not sure my statement was \naccurate, and he asked Larry Summers, who was in the meeting. We were \nall a little bit confused about that, except I wasn't because very \nspecifically it said $30 billion on roads and highways.\n  To be fair, there is another $19 billion in water projects. \nInfrastructure was a little higher than that. My concern is roads and \nhighways.\n  The reason I am concerned is that we went through the 2005 \nTransportation reauthorization bill. At that time, Republicans were in \nthe majority, so I was taking the lead on passage of that bill. I had \nthe support of the ranking member at that time, who was Senator Boxer \nfrom California. We worked closely together on that bill. We actually \nwere increasing all we could as time went by because the idea of \nfunding infrastructure and funding roads and highways has a history to \nit.\n  When I was first elected, every year we had huge surpluses in the \nhighway trust fund. That is probably the most popular tax out there. \nWith the highway trust fund, people know or they believe that money is \ngoing to be used to increase capacity and increase the condition, the \nrepairs, the maintenance of the transportation system we have now.\n  Senator Boxer and I worked together on that bill to do all we could \nto enhance it, to raise the amounts because even as large as that bill \nwas, that did not even maintain what we have today.\n  Over the years, as people saw the surpluses in the highway trust \nfund, their tendency, as is always the tendency around this place, was \nlet's grab it and put it into something else. We started having hiking \ntrails, we started having other elements of transportation, over and \nabove roads and highways, bridges and maintenance. Those are the things \nthat originally the highway trust fund, way back in the early fifties, \nwas there for. That is what was established back in the Eisenhower \nadministration.\n  We have gone over the years, and this took a turnaround a few years \nago with so many people loading on to the highway trust fund and less \nand less was used for maintenance and expansion of our highway system. \nWe got into the position where in 1998, during the Clinton \nadministration, he witnessed the very large surplus that was in the \nhighway trust fund. He took it and put it into the general fund. The \ntotal amount was $9 billion. That was something to which I was very \nmuch opposed because I thought of that as a moral issue. The people of \nthis country were led to believe that if they paid for gas at the pump, \nthat money was going to enhance our highway system. That used to be the \nsituation. Anyway, we were able to successfully remove that and bring \nthat back into the highway trust fund a matter of a few weeks ago. We \nimproved that a little bit. Still, we have a deficit that cannot do the \njob the American people expect.\n  I am considered by some of the rating organizations to be one of the \nmost\n\n[[Page S1382]]\n\nconservative Members of the Senate. Yet I am a big spender in some \nareas--national defense, infrastructure. That is what we are supposed \nto be doing, and we have these opportunities to do it.\n  As I said, I applaud the Senator from Washington for recognizing the \nneed to increase the amount of money for roads and highways.\n  During the reauthorization bill of 2005, we talked about what our \nneeds were. We happen to have a guy in the State of Oklahoma, a guy \nnamed Gary Ridley, the best highway director anywhere in the United \nStates. What he has done is put together what do we have in the State \nof Oklahoma that is spade-ready to employ people tomorrow if we are \nable to have enough money to take care of some of the things that are \nalready authorized; we don't have to go through the environmental \nimpact statements and other statements. This is all ready to go.\n  For that reason, I thought if this job stimulus bill is going to do \nsomething to stimulate the economy, it is going to have to hire people. \nTo hire people, you are going to have to get a much larger percentage.\n  Getting back to 8 days ago when President Obama was before the \nRepublicans, at that time I said: If I am right and you are wrong in \nterms of the fact that you only have 3.5 percent of the total amount of \nmoney that will go to roads and highways, would you be willing to raise \nthat to some 10 percent? I am not sure the answer was very clear, but \nnonetheless, it is something that is very reasonable to make as a \nrequest.\n  I have one problem with the Murray bill. First, I agree that we need \nto have a larger percentage of the money going into roads and highways. \nBut I think we also need a little bit of truth in advertising. If we \nare going to call this package a stimulus bill, then we need to direct \nthe resources to the programs that have demonstrated the ability to \ncreate jobs immediately. However, merely adding the total number, as \nthis amendment does, without giving priority to programs that are truly \nstimulative is perhaps not all that responsible.\n  In addition, the major problem I have is that the stimulus needs to \nbe offset. You cannot tell me, if we are looking at $900 billion out \nthere, we cannot find something to offset in order to take care of the \nimmediate problems we have in this country in terms of our \ninfrastructure.\n  I do not see the Senator from Washington on the floor now, but I \nwould ask her--and I asked her a few minutes ago--if she was willing to \noffset this money. I believe her response was not at the present time. \nSo if it changes as this develops, then perhaps I will change.\n  I will say this: If you are not going to be able to offset this \namount, then I certainly would oppose this amendment. There will be \nlots of opportunities to increase the infrastructure investment over \nthe next few days that do not add to the size of the bill. We cannot \nadd to the size of this bill.\n\n  To me, the whole idea--well, the amount is inconceivable to most \npeople, most thinking people, in America, and it cannot be increased.\n  We have numerous opportunities. We have the Boxer-Bond amendment to \nincrease highway investment by $5.5 billion. It is fully offset. I \nstrongly support Senator Boxer and Senator Bond in this effort. The \nprogram they eliminate is a discretionary program that would not even \nselect projects for an entire year.\n  Then the program provides an additional 3 years to finish the \nproject. That makes sense to me. My chairman, Senator Boxer, and I as \nthe ranking member of Environment and Public Works Committee, go along \nwith a bipartisan group of colleagues who will have a second amendment \nto add $50 billion to highway transit and clean drinking water. This \namendment would take funds not obligated within a year up to $50 \nbillion from programs in the stimulus that are not spending and \nredirect them to infrastructure projects that are ready to have a \ncontract awarded within 120 days after receiving the funding. That is \nwhat we call a stimulus. That puts people to work in jobs. And it \ndoesn't add to the cost of the bill.\n  Those are two opportunities coming up; we will have to get this done. \nIt also moves the money from programs that are not stimulating the \neconomy, which I think is a good idea.\n  I at this time urge my colleagues to oppose the Murray amendment even \nthough I agree with what she is trying to do. I want to have this \noffset. We have these two opportunities that I mentioned coming up \nwhere we will have the opportunity to accomplish the same objective and \nhave them offset.\n  Frankly, the amount she is talking about is not as much as I would \nlike. I would like it to be an additional $50 billion which we will be \ntalking about in another amendment coming up.\n  Since it is not going to be offset, I make a point of order against \nthe Murray amendment's emergency spending designation under 204(a)5A of \nS. Con. Res. 21 of the 110th Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nInouye be able to make a UC and then I be granted the floor to speak in \nfavor of the Murray amendment and for the waiver she will need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 12:20 p.m. \ntoday, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Murray-Feinstein-\nSpecter and others amendment No. 110 and that time until then be \nequally divided and controlled in the usual form; that if a budget \npoint of order is raised against the amendment, that a motion to waive \nthe relevant point of order be considered as made; and that no \namendments be in order to the amendment prior to a vote in relation \nthereto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. THUNE. Reserving the right to object, can I clarify exactly then \nwhat the UC is? The Senator from Hawaii would have an opportunity to \nrespond and offer a unanimous consent request, and then the Senator \nfrom California would have how much time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have not asked for a specific time. I would take 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. THUNE. I was hoping I would have an opportunity to make some \nremarks before the vote. The vote is going to occur at 12:20. Very \ngood.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise as the chairman of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee in favor of the Murray-Feinstein amendment, \nand I hope we will vote to waive this budget point of order. I want to \ntell you why.\n  Senator Inhofe is correct that I will be working with him very \nproudly on a couple of amendments which will all be offset. But in \ngeneral, we are in such a crisis in this country that we need to look \nat three things in this package: jobs, jobs, jobs. This package falls \nshort. Once we get to the conference, I think some things will fall \naway. I do. But we need to boost the spending, it seems to me, on the \nmost efficient programs that create jobs, and not just any type of job \nbut good jobs--jobs in the construction industry where we have seen \ndevastation hit our families.\n  In my State of California, we have a 9.2-percent unemployment rate. \nLet me reiterate. In my State of California, we have a 9.2-percent \nunemployment rate. Were it not for our environmental laws which are \nputting people to work, putting solar rooftops on and the rest, I hate \nto think of where we would be because housing construction has \nliterally stopped in its tracks.\n  The importance of the Murray-Feinstein amendment is this: jobs, jobs, \njobs. That is what the people want us to invest in. We know very well \nthat when we invest money in the type of infrastructure we are talking \nabout--highways, water systems, sewer systems--the jobs come along with \nit.\n  We also know a lot of our physical infrastructure is failing. We can \nnever get out of our minds the tragic collapse of the bridge in \nMinnesota. And when we look at the condition of our bridges across this \ngreat Nation of ours, we find there are way too many--maybe a quarter \nof them--in need of repair. So when we talk about this amendment, we \nare talking about adding funding\n\n[[Page S1383]]\n\nfor roads, for bridges, for transit, for rail, for ports, for drinking \nand wastewater infrastructure, which are the most efficient job \ncreators.\n  I think it is fair to ask, are our States and localities ready to \nspend these dollars or will they go there only to sit? The answer is, \nour States are more than ready. According to the U.S. Department of \nTransportation, the backlog of needed improvements to simply maintain \nthe current bridge and highway network is $495 billion. That is the \nbacklog. This amendment is $25 billion, and as I understand it, that is \nbeing added to $27 billion. So we are at least adding more funding that \nis real.\n  To me, it is not enough. That is why Senator Inhofe and I are going \nto have an amendment that says if the rest of the funds in this bill \nare not committed by a time certain, we are going to put up to $50 \nbillion more into these accounts. I hope that passes, but this is a \nvery important amendment. I hope we will pass it on a bipartisan vote, \nbut the first step is to allow the budget act to be waived.\n  The Department of Transportation also told us something else. They \nsaid that for every $1 billion invested in highways and bridges at the \nFederal level--and if that funding is matched--we could create and \nmaintain 34,800 jobs. That is 34,800 jobs for $1 billion invested at \nthe Federal level. I want to sort of shake my friends, in a nice way, \nand remind them that a million jobs were lost in this great Nation in \nthe last couple of months--a half million in December and a half \nmillion in January. By the way, a half million also in November. I want \nyou to think about your States and how many families that is. The \nnumber of jobs that have been lost is bigger than some States--bigger \nthan some States. Close your eyes and imagine the whole State of \nDelaware with every person unemployed. That is what has happened so \nfar, and worse.\n  We need to get ahead of ourselves here. What worries me about the \nSenate is that we are kind of chasing after this tiger called \nrecession. It took the Bush administration forever to call it a \nrecession. Then they finally called it a recession and said, well, \nhopefully, we will get over it quickly. But we keep chasing it, trying \nto grab it by the tail. We have to get in front of this recession or it \nwill become a depression. You get in front of it by doing the things \nyou know will create jobs.\n  Now, is every single item in this bill something I support? No. But I \nsupport the infrastructure part, I support the help to the energy \nsector so we can get off foreign oil, I support building a smart grid, \nI support making sure people who are long-term unemployed get the \nchance to feed their families, and I support doing more about housing. \nBut I surely know this, as chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, a dollar invested in the physical infrastructure, in \nrebuilding it, is a dollar that will create jobs--thousands and \nthousands and thousands of jobs. This amendment is a good amendment. It \ndoesn't overreach. It underreaches. But it is a start.\n  The next question might be: Well, Senator, I agree with you that this \ninvestment will create jobs, but have the States identified projects \nthat will qualify? The State departments of transportation, according \nto the American Association of State Highway and Transportation \nOfficials, have identified over 5,000 projects of over $64 billion in \nvalue which could create nearly 1.8 million jobs. We could restore the \njobs that have been lost in the last 2 months with this amendment. Our \ncommittee, the Committee on Environment and Public Works--and I have my \ngood staff here--has surveyed many of these States and we have \ndetermined these projects are shovel ready.\n  So let me say it again: $64 billion of shovel-ready projects, ready \nto go--1.8 million jobs. And the underlying bill falls short. The \nunderlying bill falls short. If we pass the Murray-Feinstein-Boxer, et \ncetera, amendment, we will in fact move toward equaling that shovel-\nready number we have.\n  The American Public Transportation Association tells us that States \nhave identified 787 ready-to-go public transit projects totaling $15.9 \nbillion that would sustain thousands of jobs. The U.S. Conference of \nMayors tells us there is a total of 15,000 ready-to-go infrastructure \nprojects in 641 cities. So you have the States telling us they are \nready, you have the transit districts saying they are ready, and you \nhave the U.S. Conference of Mayors saying they are ready. And when I \nlook at the underlying bill, I believe it didn't fund these projects to \nthe tune they should have.\n  This amendment also increases investments in drinking water and \nwastewater infrastructure. We are so far behind on those programs. If \nour kids can't drink the water, that is trouble. We need to make sure \nthe drinking water is safe. If we have a sewer spill, that is a \ndisaster. We need to get out ahead of that. A recent EPA study--and, \nMr. President, you will be interested in this--found that failure to \nincrease investment in water and wastewater infrastructure could result \nin a $500 billion water infrastructure gap in the next 20 years. That \nEPA study was done under George Bush. Okay, George Bush's EPA told us \nwe could have an infrastructure gap of $500 billion in the next 20 \nyears. So let's invest in water infrastructure. It will replace aging \nwater pipes, expand treatment facilities, reduce pollution flowing into \nour Nation's rivers and streams and allow for implementation of \nprojects to improve water efficiency.\n  The Murray-Feinstein amendment, my friends, is critical. We don't do \nenough in the underlying bill. And for those who worry about an offset, \nwe will find those in conference. We are going to keep this bill where \nPresident Obama wants it. We know that. But let's walk down the \nbipartisan lane on this one. We all know our States and our localities \nare crying out. We all know our people are hurting because they are not \nworking. With this amendment, we create jobs in areas that we have to \npay attention to anyway. Are we going to wait for our sewers to \noverflow into the streets? Are we going to wait for more bridges to \ncollapse? I say that is ridiculous. You can't be a great economy when \nbridges are collapsing all around you, and our bridges are in trouble.\n  So to say you won't vote for this amendment because it is $25 billion \nin an $800-plus billion, almost $900-plus billion bill, is \nshortsighted. I commit to working with my friends on the other side to \nfind the offsets in this bill. It is not going to be that hard. I agree \nwith Senator Inhofe, they are not in this bill, but we can work to get \nsome offsets in the conference.\n  Local people are saying to us, please, Senators, do something to help \nus get out there, spend the money on these shovel-ready projects--the \nhighways, the bridges, the transit systems, the sewer systems, the safe \ndrinking water issues. Help us do it. We can make this a far better \nbill. Private industry wants this, and these are private sector jobs. \nThese are contracts that will be let for local contractors, small \nbusiness, big business, union members, and nonunion members. This is \nwhat we should be doing in this bill.\n  I signed a letter with Chairman Baucus on this very topic and, guess \nwhat, Senator Inhofe signed it, Senator Bond signed it, and we said we \nneed to do more building of the infrastructure of our great country. \nThe unemployment rate for construction workers is double the national \nunemployment rate. Listen to this: The unemployment rate for \nconstruction workers is 15.3 percent--15.3 percent in December--\ncompared to a 7.1-percent national unemployment. There are plenty of \nworkers available. They are ready and they are excited to get to work. \nThey have to support their families. They are suffering, they are \nworried, and they do not want to be on the Federal dole. They do not \nwant to get food stamps. They do not want it. They want to work. They \nwant to work.\n  This is an important test of whether the Senate has a heart, frankly, \nand a brain, because I think this is where your brain and your heart \ncome together with a yes vote. Because with our heart we know people \nare suffering. With our heart we know construction workers are \nsuffering. With our brain we know that when they go to work and they \npay taxes, we all benefit. With our brain we know when we rebuild the \nphysical infrastructure our country is stronger and we set the \npredicate for a very strong economic recovery into the future.\n  So I feel very strongly, as I am sure you can tell from the sound of \nmy voice. I just hope we don't have a partisan vote. I think this is \none where we\n\n[[Page S1384]]\n\nshould come together. We will find new offsets. President Obama is \ngoing to have a cap. He is going to say we don't want to spend more \nthan X. We will make this work, but let's have a good vote on this \nmotion to waive the budget act. I think our country will be better for \nit, and the people out there who are watching this debate will feel \ngood that we know our construction workers are suffering and our \nconstruction companies are suffering, and this would go a long way to \nboost their confidence.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from South Dakota \nwants to speak for 15 minutes. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Michigan, notwithstanding the pending unanimous consent request, \nbe allowed to speak for 5 minutes following Senator Thune of South \nDakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, this is a very important debate for the \nAmerican people. We have an economy that is struggling, we have a lot \nof people who are hurting, and I think in the context of that debate, \nit is very important that we remember these dollars we are spending are \nthe American people's dollars. Yes, we want to be able to respond to \nthe economic crisis the country is experiencing in a way that allows \npeople to spend more money, that gets more money back into the hands of \nthe American people, that will help grow the economy and create jobs, \nand provide the necessary incentives for small businesses to invest, \nbut I think it is important at the outset of the debate that we give \nserious consideration and thought to what we are doing here and what we \nare talking about in terms of the dimensions and the scale of what we \nare talking about.\n  When we throw around numbers here in Washington, DC, when we talk in \nmillions and we talk in billions, and in this case a trillion dollars, \nwe treat it as if it is something abstract. I think it is sometimes \nimportant to boil it down so that we put in perspective the dimension, \nthe scale, the scope, and the size of what is being talked about this \nweek on the floor of the Senate.\n  I want to put up a chart that illustrates that very point. Imagine \nthinking about a trillion dollars, and putting it back to back or if \nyou put a bunch of hundred dollar bills back to back on top of each \nother and asking people around the country how high that stack would \ngo.\n  I am sure you would get a lot of varying answers. You would probably \nhave some people say it might go 300 yards into the air. Some people \nmight say: Well, it might go 5 miles into the air. But the reality is, \nif you took hundred-dollar bills and stacked them on top of each other, \nyou would have a stack that goes 689 miles high, back to back to back. \nThat is hundred-dollar bills. We are not talking about dollar bills, we \nare talking about hundred-dollar bills.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question on this point?\n  Mr. THUNE. I would say to the Senator, through the Chair, the Senator \nfrom California just had an opportunity. I would like to finish my \nremarks. Then I would be happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you. I will stay on the floor.\n  Mr. THUNE. The point I am making is, you have to sometimes illustrate \nthis in a sometimes very graphic way to help us understand what we are \ntalking about. So I would make my point simply again: Hundred-dollar \nbills stacked back to back to back, if you stacked them on top of each \nother, would equal 689 miles.\n  Now, another way of looking at this is, if you took hundred-dollar \nbills and wrapped them around the Earth at the Equator, in other words, \nyou took hundred-dollar bills, not stack them on top of each other but \nwrap them side by side all the way around the Earth, if you can believe \nthis, it would go around the Earth almost 39 times. That is 969,000 \nmiles of hundred-dollar bills that would go around the Earth if you \ntook a trillion dollars and broke it down that way.\n  That very simply puts into perspective what it is we are talking \nabout. Someone else has described it this way: If you started spending \na million dollars a day on the day Christ was born, and you spent a \nmillion dollars every single day up until today, you still would not \nhave spent a trillion. That is the dimension of what we are talking \nabout.\n  I remember when I was in business school, we had our little business \nanalyst calculators that we used to do financial calculations. You \ncould not even get to this. You could not even get to a trillion \ndollars on calculators back at that time. I hope, today, for purposes \nof doing economic calculations, because of the scale we are talking \nabout, these calculators go that far.\n  But my point is, this is an enormous amount of money, an enormous \namount of money. We are talking about $1.26 trillion of our children's \nand grandchildren's money over the next 10 years. I think there is a \nbasic principle that all Members of the Senate should consider when we \nare spending our fellow citizens' hard-earned dollars. That principle \nis this: We should not spend money we do not have on things we do not \nneed. Let me say that again. We should not spend money we do not have \non things we do not need.\n  Families and business owners understand this principle. \nUnfortunately, it is a principle that has been lost and escaped our \ncolleagues on the other side who have drafted this 700-page, trillion-\ndollar spending bill, which is filled with lots of Government spending \nthat I think most Americans would characterize as wasteful. I am not \nsaying all Government spending is bad. Government spending, if it is \nproperly focused and highly scrutinized, may have some countercyclical \nimpact. One example of that would be infrastructure spending that we \nuse to improve our roads and bridges and provide access to clean \ndrinking water, that can provide jobs in the short term, and can create \neconomic opportunity in the long term.\n  The problem we have is this bill is laden with unfocused, \nunnecessary, and wasteful spending. Now, the stated goal of a stimulus \nproposal, as stated by, I think, Larry Summers earlier this year, was \nit should be timely, temporary, and targeted. I may not be saying these \nin the right order but basically timely, temporary, and targeted, \nbasically three criteria, three metrics by which we would measure a \nstimulus proposal and whether it is effective and whether it works.\n  I would argue this particular bill is none of the above. It is slow, \nit is unfocused, and it is unending. It makes commitments way beyond \nthe 1-year, 2-year window that we are talking about if we want to have \nan impact and create jobs with stimulus.\n  So even with a price tag that is greater than any previous stimulus \npackage in the history of our country, the majority of the spending in \nthis bill is not focused on job creation and fails to meet the job \ncreation goals our President called for and I think the American public \nexpects.\n  With record deficits in the near term, this bill, as drafted, is a \nmistake that I do not believe we can afford to make. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, we have a $1.2 trillion deficit in fiscal \nyear 2009, before any financial stabilization or stimulus measures are \npassed by this Congress.\n  Now, again, we are going to spend $1 trillion. I would point out what \n$1 trillion means. If you took hundred-dollar bills, you put them side \nby side, 969,000 miles, and that is the amount we are talking about \nspending. It is also the amount of the deficit in this particular \nfiscal year, fiscal year 2009. That is before, as I said before, any \nfinancial stabilization or stimulus measures are passed by this \nCongress. Frankly, we expect other requests to come forward in the area \nof financial stabilization.\n  To put the $1.2 trillion deficit into perspective, that is roughly \ntriple the previous record of $455 billion that the deficit came to in \nfiscal year 2008. So it is important to note that already this deficit \nin fiscal year 2009 will exceed by almost three times the deficit in \nthe year 2008. It is going to be over $1 trillion before we do any of \nthese other things.\n  It is also important to note that the Congress, not the executive \nbranch, has the constitutional authority to raise\n\n[[Page S1385]]\n\nand to spend revenue; that is, the power of the purse, by our \nConstitution, falls to Congress. So if we are looking for a scapegoat \nin this whole fiscal imbalance, we need to look no further than the \nHalls of Congress.\n  In fact, in the last couple years--the Democrats regained the \nCongress back in 2007, the Federal deficit has ballooned from $160 \nbillion or 1.2 percent of our gross domestic product in 2007 to over $1 \ntrillion or 8.3 percent of our gross domestic product this year, in \nfiscal year 2009.\n  Now, if we include just the additional spending for this proposal \nbefore us, the 2009 projected deficit, I am talking about now stimulus \nand the deficit as I mentioned earlier that is already projected for \n2009, it would increase to $1.43 trillion, almost $1.5 trillion, in \ndeficits or, put another way, about 10 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct.\n  I have to remind my colleagues that we are still very early in the \nyear. We have almost 9 months left in this fiscal year to spend even \nmore of our children's and grandchildren's tax dollars. The Congress is \nsoon going to consider an omnibus spending bill for the remainder of \n2009.\n  We also will have to consider a war supplemental bill and the \npotential of additional bailouts for the financial sector and we are \ntold that request may be coming as early as next week.\n  Without a question, we are going to end 2009 in perhaps the worst \nfinancial condition the Nation has ever seen. In fact, the last time we \nhad a single-year deficit that the GDP ratio was over 8 percent was the \nyear 1945, during the height of World War II.\n  Now, for comparative purposes, the European Union, the Federal \ndeficit there that we have this year of 10 percent, if you add the \nstimulus in, would not even be good enough to get into the European \nUnion. According to European Union rules, member nations have to have a \nbudget deficit of 3 percent or less. Our Federal deficit this year will \nbe three times higher than the maximum threshold to get into the \nEuropean Union.\n  Of course, European countries are also dealing with the same \ncontractionary forces that we are dealing with in this country, which \nare driving up their collective deficit to GDP ratios to record highs. \nBut even with those factors and influences in those economies, the Euro \nzone's collected deficits will only reach 4.7 percent in 2009. That is \n4.7 percent of their gross domestic product, which will be less than \nhalf the U.S. total.\n\n  When you talk about being faced with such unsustainable deficits, \nCongress, I would argue, has to carefully analyze any and all deficit \nspending. Any additional Government programs that are financed with \nmore deficit spending need to meet the highest standards of job \ncreation and return on taxpayer investment.\n  Unfortunately, the spending bill we have before us contains a long \nlist of Government programs that fail to meet that standard. I can \nstart to go down the list--I will not go through the entire list \nbecause it would take too long--$1 billion for the Census; $20 billion \nfor the removal of small- to medium-sized fish passage barriers; $400 \nmillion for STD prevention; $25 million to rehabilitate ATV or \nrecreational vehicle trails; $34 million to remodel the Department of \nCommerce headquarters in Washington, DC; $70 million to support \nsupercomputer activities for climate research; $208 million for \ndisconnected youth; $1.2 billion for summer employment; $246 million in \ntax breaks for Hollywood filmmakers; $6 billion so bureaucrats in \nWashington can enjoy the benefits of green technology.\n  I happen to be one who supports green technology. I think we ought to \nbe moving in that direction. But we also have many opportunities, \nenergy bills we have made on a regular basis around here, in order to \nengage in how we invest to be moving our country in a green direction.\n  These programs do not create jobs. They hardly justify a $1.2 \ntrillion debt on the shoulders of our children and grandchildren.\n  So I would encourage my colleagues, as we go through the debate this \nweek to scrutinize every line item in this 700-page bill and ask \nthemselves if these provisions will create jobs and justify making \nrecord deficits even worse. We should not spend money we do not have on \nthings we do not need.\n  Over the next few days, several amendments are going to be offered to \nstrike or replace wasteful spending items in this bill. I would call on \nmy colleagues to consider these amendments with an open mind and a \nclear understanding of the dangerous consequences of a trillion-dollar \nmistake. A trillion dollars is a terrible thing to waste.\n  What we are talking about, as I mentioned in terms of the dimensions \nof this, if you look at hundred-dollar bills side by side, 38.9 times \nit goes around the Earth at the Equator. That is what I am talking \nabout.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am astounded by this new-found fiscal responsibility I \nhear from the other side of the aisle. I wish to ask my friend a \nquestion: Do you know what the debt was when Bill Clinton left office \nand George Bush took over and there was a Republican Congress? Do you \nknow what it was at that time?\n  Mr. THUNE. I would say I am not sure I know the answer, but I am sure \nI am going to hear it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The debt was $5.7 trillion when George Bush and the \nRepublicans took over. I will say to my friend, not to ask him a \nquestion, the debt today is $10.1 trillion; a doubling of the debt was \nbrought to you courtesy of the Republicans.\n  Does my friend know--I am sure he does--that when Bill Clinton left \noffice, we had a surplus in our budget. We not only did not have a \ndeficit, we had a surplus. My friend knows what George Bush left us \nwith--hundreds of billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars \nof debt.\n  So for him to stand up now that the people are suffering and \nstruggling and they need jobs and become the Herbert Hoover of current \nday times, I think it is hurtful to the American people. I say to my \nfriend: Why is it that my friend now is suddenly talking about debt and \ndid not discuss it when the Republicans were in charge?\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for her \nquestion. I think we can all talk about what has come before, what has \nhappened in the past. Frankly, there are lots of reasons why we are in \nthe situation we are in.\n  But I would remind my colleague from California that the President of \nthe United States does not appropriate a single penny; that is done by \nthe Congress. That is done by the Congress. We in the Congress have \ncreated this problem. Now, arguably it has happened under Republican \nCongresses, it has happened under Democratic Congresses. But the point \nis, we are here talking about spending an additional trillion dollars \non the top of a historic amount of debt that we have in the country and \ndeficits that this year are going to be $1.2 trillion. That is without \nadding in the stimulus. That is without talking about the financial \nstabilization request that is going to come later. That is without the \nomnibus spending bill, which is for the first time, I might add, going \nto be over $1 trillion, and that is without the supplemental bill that \nwill be coming our way later this year.\n  This Congress is talking about going on a spending spree that is \nunprecedented in American history. Yes, we can all point to the \nmistakes that were made in the past, but I am here to talk about today \nmy concern for the future and what we are doing in the future, to \nfuture generations and our children and grandchildren, when we impose \nthis kind of burden on them.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, may I have 60 seconds?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. May I ask how much time is left on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5 minutes allocated to the Senator \nfrom Michigan. That is all the remaining time.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. As the sponsor of the amendment, I ask unanimous consent \nfor 30 seconds prior to the vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And I ask unanimous consent to extend that for 1\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to take 60 seconds to respond to Senator Thune. He \nsays he doesn't want to point fingers. He is pointing fingers all over \nthe place. He says we are here today talking about a trillion dollars. \nLet me tell\n\n[[Page S1386]]\n\nmy colleagues what we are talking about: the deepest recession since \nthe Great Depression, jobs being lost at 500,000 and 600,000 a month. \nAll of a sudden some of our Republican friends have said: Whoops. Now \nthat we can't give tax breaks to the people who are earning over a \nmillion and now that the Iraq war is winding down, we are not that \ninterested in spending money.\n  Democrats, when we were in control, had our priorities straight. We \nsaid: Put families first. We balanced the budget, and we will do it \nagain. But we must restore this economy. When I use the phrase \n``Herbert Hoover,'' which has become kind of a symbol for doing nothing \nin the face of the middle class crumbling, I know what I am saying. I \nhope we will vote for the Murray amendment. It will create thousands of \njobs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. STABENOW. Mr. President, I commend Senator Murray for her \namendment. I am proud to be a cosponsor, and I strongly support the \nmotion to waive the Budget Act. When my friend from South Dakota said \nwe should not spend money on things we don't need, we need jobs. We \nneed jobs, and that is exactly what this amendment does. The additional \nresources in this amendment of $25 billion, according to the normal \nformulas used, by my calculation would create over 1,187,500 new, good-\npaying jobs. That is exactly what we need to do to get this economy \ngoing again. With all due respect to my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle, the reality is, we have had 8 years of their philosophy, 8 \nyears of a philosophy focused on the supply side of supply and demand. \nStart at the top, it will trickle down. What has that gotten us? In the \nlast year alone, what that has meant to us is 2,956,000 good-paying \nAmerican jobs gone, in 1 year. Over the last 8 years in manufacturing, \nwhich is the backbone of the middle class, we have lost over 4.1 \nmillion manufacturing jobs.\n  What this amendment is about, what this recovery plan is about, is \nchanging the way we do business, changing priorities, focusing on \nmiddle-class workers, communities, folks working hard to stay in the \nmiddle class or get into the middle class, the people who need money in \ntheir pocket to buy things so we can have a strong economy again. We \nare talking about, in this proposal, creating jobs. That is what this \nis about.\n  The philosophy that has been operating for the last 8 years has put \nus in a situation where we lost more jobs last year than any other time \nsince 1945: Eleven million people are out of work. Something has to \nchange.\n  I commend our committee chairmen for their leadership, Senators \nBaucus and Inouye, and all of the good work that has gone into changing \ndirection.\n  The reality is, we are at a point in time where we have to focus on \nthe folks who want a job, who want to go to work in the morning, to be \nable to pay the bills and keep the mortgage and put the kids in college \nand put food on the table. That is what this amendment does. This is \nabout rebuilding America. At the end of it, we as taxpayers get \nsomething for it. We know a quarter of our bridges are in dangerous \ncondition. We know we need to focus on roads and bridges and water and \nsewer systems, building 21st century schools for children, more focus \non public transportation. We need to focus on creating good-paying \njobs. That is what this amendment is all about. We have had enough of \npolicies that only focused on a few. We have had enough of policies \nthat asked the majority of Americans to sit and wait for something to \ntrickle down to them and their families. This recovery plan rejects a \nphilosophy that has not worked. Frankly, it is a philosophy that was \nrejected last November. People are saying they want to change the \nfocus.\n  What have we done? We have put together a recovery plan that focuses \non jobs and rebuilding America. That is what the Murray amendment does. \nWe focus on green manufacturing and green technologies, which are so \nimportant to our future, because as manufacturing was the backbone of \nthe middle class for the last century, a green economy will build on \nmanufacturing, will build on the middle class of the future. We have \nsignificant investments that move us in that direction, that not only \nmake sure we are growing fuels and that we are operating in a more \nefficient manner, but that we are building the green technologies here \nso the jobs are here. That is what this is about. I believe strongly \nthat we need to waive the Budget Act. We need to get on with the Murray \namendment, because the bottom line of all of this is rebuilding the \nmiddle class.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the amendment we have before us is of \ncritical importance. By adopting this infrastructure amendment, we will \nimprove this package by increasing its focus on repairing and upgrading \nour Nation's infrastructure. The fact is, our Nation's highways, \nbridges, and transit and water systems are just not keeping pace with \nour country's needs.\n  For our economy, our workers, and our future, we have to rebuild \nAmerica. This amendment will instantly translate into construction \nprojects in communities across our country and send a quick jolt \nthrough our economy.\n  In all, this amendment will create 655,000 new jobs. We cannot forget \nthat unemployment in construction is higher than in any other sector.\n  We know transportation investments are one of the most effective ways \nto grow our economy. For every dollar we invest in transportation, we \nget an immediate $1.59 in return.\n  But make no mistake--this amendment is not just a short-term fix. It \nis a long-term investment that will pay off for our entire Nation.\n  The truth is, as a Nation, we have neglected our pressing \ninfrastructure needs. More than 25 percent of our Nation's bridges are \ndeficient. Let us not forget the catastrophic bridge collapse in \nMinneapolis just a year and a half ago. Gridlock on our highways means \neach commuter spends an average of 38 hours a year sitting in traffic, \nburning 26 gallons of gas while going nowhere. And travelers in many \nparts of our country are stuck in their cars simply because they don't \nhave the option to board a train. Our economy--the largest in the \nworld--still doesn't have a world-class passenger rail system.\n  This amendment will allow States to invest in highways, bridges, \ntransit systems and expanded rail service.\n  And it will put people back to work. Right now, families across our \ncountry are suffering. Every day more and more people join the \nunemployment line, a line that is right now 11 million people long.\n  We have a tremendous opportunity before us to rebuild our \ninfrastructure, reinvigorate our economy, and create jobs.\n  We have a lot to do in the next week, and I hope we will meet our \nobligations and get the job done.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this amendment directs $25 billion to a \ntargeted list of infrastructure programs, including highway, transit, \nand water and sewer programs. Adopting the amendment will make \ninvestments in our Nation's physical infrastructure a clear focal point \nin the economic recovery bill. And it will create 654,818 jobs.\n  We have shovel-ready projects in every jurisdiction in my home State \nof Maryland.\n  Let me take just a few minutes to explain how this amendment will \nbenefit my State. It is a story that will be repeated across America.\n  Transportation:\n  The amendment calls for a $2 billion increase in transit grants for \nlocal communities, which will be allocated by well-established formula. \nThis provision alone would increase Maryland's share of transit funds \nby $35.8 million.\n  Fixed guideway modernization funding will be increased by $2 billion \nas well, resulting in an $88 million boost for Maryland. Together these \ntwo transit provisions will provide nearly 3,000 jobs in Maryland.\n  The highway provisions in the bill will add $13 billion to repairing \nand improving our network of roads. Maryland's share will be $208 \nmillion, creating 5,580 jobs here in this state alone.\n  Water:\n  Drinking water: the amendment sends an additional $13.8 million for \ndrinking water projects to Maryland to upgrade our aging drinking water \nfacilities.\n  Clean water: this amendment will send an additional $146.4 million \ninto Maryland. We have over a billion dollars in needs to repair and \nupgrade our sewer systems in Maryland. These additional funds will \nprotect Marylanders\n\n[[Page S1387]]\n\nfrom the health effects associated with sewerage overflows. It will \nimprove our water quality in rivers and streams across the State, \nincluding our national treasure, the Chesapeake Bay.\n  Together the water infrastructure funds total an additional $160.2 \nmillion in Maryland that will create 6,270 jobs.\n  This is an amendment that meets our critical infrastructure needs and \ncreates jobs right away, giving our economy the stimulus it needs.\n  But this is also an amendment that is temporary and targeted. We will \nget major infrastructure improvements that will last much longer than \nthe funds themselves. These are investments roads, bridges, sewer \nsystems, drinking water facilities--that typically last 30, 40 even 50 \nyears. This is a smart investment in America's future.\n  I am proud to serve as an original cosponsor of this amendment, and I \nurge my colleagues to give it their enthusiastic support. This is an \namendment that is an investment in America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington, under a previous \norder, is recognized for 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that Senators Carper and Tester \nbe added as cosponsors of the amendment, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senator from Pennsylvania be given 2 minutes prior to my \nclosing remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I believe we do need a stimulus package. \nI have not had an opportunity to speak on the bill generally but will \ndo so later today to express concerns I have about not following \nregular order in having hearings. But I understand the President is \nconcerned about very prompt action. I support this amendment for $25 \nbillion in infrastructure. I believe the bill is too heavily weighted \non items which ought to be in the budget process, very important items, \nbut not in the stimulus package, and more heavily directed to \ninfrastructure on projects which are shovel ready. This amendment is \ndirected to that objective. Governor Rendell has assured me and the \npublic that he can have highway jobs ready in 6 months, shovel ready to \nproceed. So I believe this is what the stimulus ought to be doing.\n  I would have preferred to have seen an offset for this $25 billion. \nThere are funds where it could have been offset; for example, in the \nState Stabilization Program, $79 billion, which is broad, wide-ranging \ndiscretion to the Governors, which ought not to be a part of the \nstimulus package. We will have an opportunity in the balance of this \nbill to find the savings of this $25 billion. The overall bill ought to \nbe less than the $819 billion passed by the House. But for the present \ntime, I will vote to waive the budget, looking for an opportunity to \nfind the $25 billion offset later and looking for other opportunities \nto have an effective stimulus which is not quite so expensive.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania. I \nurge my colleagues to approve this $25 billion for the 655,000 jobs \nacross the country to rebuild roads, bridges, sewers, and \ninfrastructure. This amendment will put people to work, and it will get \nthe country back to the point where we feel strong again. I have heard \nthe arguments about offsets, and I know there are a number of Senators \nwho are working to find agreement on how we can reduce the cost of the \nunderlying bill. We will work with them. But let's make sure we \nunderstand that infrastructure is a priority and approve this \namendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion to waive the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 475, beginning on line 1, strike through page 477, \n     line 17.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, we are in the midst of debating a \n``stimulus bill'' that has been brought forth in the hopes of \nalleviating some of the economic pain we have in this country.\n  Principally, I object to many of the provisions in the bill because \nthey are not stimulatory whatsoever. We all know that. We are going to \nadd $1.2 trillion to the debt and we are not fixing the real problem \nthis country is encountering, and that is the absolute collapse of the \nhousing industry. We can spend all the money we want to spend on \n``stimulus'' packages--which this one isn't--and it is not going to do \na thing, unless we fix housing and the liquidity crisis.\n  I bring up this amendment because it shows how misaligned this bill \nis. This amendment seeks to eliminate a $246 million earmark. It is \nnothing but that. It is a tax earmark for the movie industry. Let's put \nthe history out there. The movie industry today can take advantage and \nwrite off all of its\n\n[[Page S1388]]\n\nproduction costs and take an additional $15 million out of the \ntaxpayers' pocket for every movie they produce in this country, of \nwhich 75 percent of the expenses are actually incurred in this country. \nWhat we have added is an earmark to markedly increase all movies \nproduced in 2009, which is an additional $246 million.\n  I am not against tax breaks that are general across the board and \nwill be truly a stimulus, but this is a tax break earmark that has a \ntremendous odor to it. The odor is this: We already created tax breaks, \nstarting in 2004, for the movie industry that are greater than we have \nfor any other industry, and now we are going to add to it--at a time \nwhen Hollywood is at one of its zeniths of success. As a matter of \nfact, yesterday in USA Today is the headline: ``Billion Dollar January \nis the Box Office's Best in History.''\n  They had the best January in their history--more profits, more \nrevenue, a 20-percent increase in ticket sales. Yet we are going to \ntake a stimulus bill and add another quarter of a billion dollars to \none of the few industries in our country that is faring well.\n  To quote Rob Reiner, whom most people know--and I think this is \nprobably disappointing to him--this is what he said when asked about \nHollywood's relationship with Washington, DC:\n\n       We are a special interest group that doesn't ask for \n     anything, like earmarks, legislation, or tax breaks. We are \n     the one industry that doesn't ask for a quid pro quo.\n\n  What have we done in this bill? We have sent a quarter of a billion \ndollars of our grandkids' money to some of the most profitable \nbusinesses in this country, which at this point in time have not been \nimpacted and don't project to be impacted at all by the recession we \nare currently experiencing.\n  This isn't stimulus; this is a gift. It is not going to stimulate the \neconomy at all. What it is going to do is line the pockets of very \nwealthy individuals who are already not experiencing the downside of \nthe economy. What we should have instead is tax breaks that go across \nthe board to every small business and to every large business. If it is \nwritten that way, I would not object if Hollywood got some of the \nmoney. But we have singled out one industry to give them special \ntreatment, when they already get special treatment under the Tax Code. \nThis is not an appropriations earmark, this is a Finance Committee \nearmark. The chairman of the Appropriations Committee is on the floor \nas we speak. It is not aimed at him.\n  How long are we going to continue to play this game? How long are we \ngoing to continue to confuse the American people about what we are \ndoing? I want the American people to respect what we are doing in this \nbody. When we do things such as this and sneak in a quarter of a \nbillion dollars for our friends, when they don't need it, because we \ncan, we demean this institution. But more importantly, we contribute to \nthe undermining of confidence in this country, showing that we are not \nabout the best interests of all Americans, but instead the best \ninterests of the special interests that have effective lobbying that \ncan get a quarter of a billion dollars for this industry into a bill.\n  I will come back later and talk on this again. I want the people in \nAmerica to ask a simple question: Is this something we ought to be \ndoing right now to help and heal America? Is it going to help people \nwho are out of work? Is it going to help in terms of restarting the \nengine of consumer spending? Is it going to do the things we need to do \nto make a difference in our economic situation in the world today? The \nanswer, on this special interest earmark, is absolutely not. What we \nare going to do is benefit those who are doing the best in the economy \ntoday, not those who are doing the worst.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will speak briefly. I believe Senator \nMikulski is perhaps going to offer the next amendment. I do not want to \ndisadvantage the time that has been allotted. I did want to, however, \npoint out that I intend to talk about three amendments very briefly. I \nfiled two of them; I will file the third shortly.\n  All of us understand what has happened in recent months. In the last \n4 or 5 months we have seen money go out the backdoor of this Government \nunlike any time in the history of our country. In fact, you can read \nthe U.S. Constitution. I don't think you can find a place in the \nConstitution that describes the mechanism by which massive amounts of \nmoney have gone out of this Government--$8.5 trillion, to the extent we \nnow know how much has been moved from our Government to support various \nenterprises.\n  The reason we know that is Bloomberg News sued the Government and the \nFederal Reserve Board, which is the only way anybody got the \ninformation about how much money has been obligated by the Federal \nReserve Board which opened its discount window for the first time in \nhistory to investment banks.\n  It has never before happened. How much money was committed? We know \nsome snippets of all of that. We know that, for example, Citigroup got \nabout $45 billion, and then we are told we have reached an agreement, \nalong with the direct funding to Citigroup, that we are guaranteeing \nnearly $300 billion for toxic assets for Citigroup. We know that. We \nknow how much has gone to some of the other investment banks. We know \nhow much money went to AIG. We have a notion of how money went in \ncertain directions. But no one knows exactly how much went out of the \nFederal Reserve Board, to whom, in what direction, for what purpose. \nHow much from the FDIC, how much from TARP, when, why, how much--we \ndon't know the answers to all of those questions.\n  Here is what I propose: Last week there was a lot of discussion about \nbonuses. I believe last year the Wall Street investment firms lost $35 \nbillion in income and paid $18 billion in bonuses to their employees. I \ndon't know. I have a masters in business. We went through a lot of \ncasework in business school. I don't think I came across a case that \nsaid: Here is good business--lose $35 billion and then pay $18 billion \nin bonuses. I don't guess I saw that in the Harvard Business Review.\n  One amendment is, we ought to, as a government, have the right to \nunderstand what kind of bonuses are being paid by firms that are \nreceiving financial assistance under the structure of the financial \nassistance that has been offered by our Government.\n  I propose an amendment. It is an amendment that would report bonuses \nto the American taxpayers. I want all companies receiving emergency \neconomic assistance from any Federal financial agency to publicly \nrelease information on any bonuses paid, including the bonus recipients \nand the amount of the bonuses. The American people have a right to that \ninformation. After all, these are companies that have asked for and \nreceived Federal assistance. Let's have the American public be able to \nshine a spotlight on what has happened to that money, including, \nespecially, the use of that money potentially for bonuses.\n  Second is an amendment I have filed that is what I call the Jobs \nAccountability Act. This is all about creating jobs. If we are, in \nfact, about creating jobs, then this proposal would be to say we should \nhave quarterly reports in the Congress after this legislation is passed \nbecause tens of billions, hundreds of billions of dollars will have \nbeen spent in the pursuit of creating new jobs.\n  Why is that important? Mr. President, 20,000 people will likely learn \ntoday they lost their job, 20,000 people today and every day; 2.6 \nmillion last year, and they say 2.6 million more in the first 6 months \nof this year. This is a deep crater. We have to care about trying to \ncreate jobs, putting people back on payrolls to give them some hope and \nsome confidence again.\n  If we are spending money to do that in what is called an economic \nrecovery program, let's try to track that money. This amendment is very \nsimple. It is the Jobs Accountability Act. What I propose is that when \nthis money goes out the door to the recipients--State\n\n[[Page S1389]]\n\ngovernments, local governments, and others--we ask them to file \nquarterly reports with the Congress to say three things: One, I \nreceived the money; two, here is how I spent the money; and, three, \nhere is how many jobs I estimate we created with this money. It is the \nonly place we will get this kind of information.\n  Does anybody think we ought to just ship money out the door and not \nask for some sort of reporting requirement about how many jobs we \ncreated? Otherwise, it is sort of the helicopter theory of money. Get \nthe money in bags, take it up in a helicopter, shove it out the side, \nand let it scatter. That is not what this is about. We are supposed to \nbe focusing like a laser on jobs. Let's get the reports from everybody \nwho received this funding in order to determine the effect of what we \nhave done. That is an amendment I have filed.\n  The third amendment I have not filed but will file today is the issue \nof runaway manufacturing plants. It is something I have worked on in \nthe past with my colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski. This is an \ninteresting proposition. We are trying to create jobs because we are \nlosing jobs in this country.\n  We have a perverse provision in our Tax Code that says this: If there \nare two companies in Maryland right across the street from each other, \nmaking exactly the same product to be sold in this country, in our \nmarketplace, and one of them, on a cool January day, decides: You know \nwhat, I am leaving Maryland. I am getting rid of my workers. I am \nmoving my production to China and I will make that product by hiring \n30-cent-an-hour labor and I will ship the product back to America to be \nsold--after that transaction is done. What is the difference between \nthe company that stayed in Maryland and the company that left Maryland \nto produce in China? The difference is the American company that left \nand got rid of their jobs and moved to China has a tax bill that is \nlower than the company that stayed.\n  We actually provide in this tax system of ours the most pernicious \nincentive I can imagine, and that is an incentive to say to companies: \nIf you have a choice, we will actually pay you an incentive in the Tax \nCode to move your jobs overseas. My runaway plant amendment will fix \nthat situation.\n  I have offered it, I believe, four times with my colleague from \nMaryland and some others. We have come up short four times. But we have \na lot of new Senators who I think would very much like to vote on this \namendment. We also have a new President who campaigned on it, a new \nPresident who went all across this country and said: Let's stop the \nincentives for shipping jobs overseas.\n  This is the perfect place, it seems to me, to have this vote. The \nreason is because we have a tax bill on the Senate floor now. This is, \nit seems to me, exactly the wrong incentive. If we are trying to create \njobs, why should we have provisions in our Tax Code that move jobs \nelsewhere? Let's plug that hole, and we can do it with the amendment I \nwill be offering.\n  My amendment has had over the years many cosponsors and the strong \nsupport of my colleague from the State of Maryland. I will file that \namendment today. A tax bill is on the Senate floor. If not now, when \nshould we ever plug this loophole that says as a country, we stand \nbehind shipping jobs overseas. Let's say we stand behind keeping jobs \nhere. No tax advantage for those who export them. Let's provide tax \nadvantages, if we are going to, for those who create jobs and keep jobs \nin this country.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. My question is about the steel industry. As the Senator \nknows, I, along with him, tried to stand up for American steel. So the \nSenator means to say if a steelmaker moves production overseas at a \nvery minimal rate, and then ships steel back, they are going to have a \nlower tax rate than the steel company that struggled, downsized, \nrightsized to try to stay in this country and manufacture steel?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is exactly the case. Most people would not even \nbelieve that to be the case. They would say: How on Earth would someone \nhave constructed a system that allows that to happen? Oh, but they did, \nand they have fiercely protected it.\n  The reason the steel company that stays here pays a higher tax is the \nsteel company that leaves and ships back to this country gets what is \ncalled a deferral of income tax; they don't have to pay the tax until \nsome point later. Of course, we know from history and from the history \nwhat has been described as being filed to this bill, ultimately if they \nare repatriated, they get to pay a tax rate of 5\\1/2\\ percent, \nsomething no other American gets to pay. It is a pernicious tax \nincentive that we certainly ought to put an end to, in my judgment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Will the Senator agree that we are often chastised for \n``Buy American'' amendments, but essentially what exists now is a ``Tax \nAmerican'' situation, and the amendment of the Senator from North \nDakota would remedy that situation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is exactly the case. There is a ``Buy American'' \namendment I helped put in this bill that has caused a fair amount of \ncontroversy, but it is not violative of any trade agreement. It \nrepresents in this bill mostly grants to the States and others for \npublic works projects. It seems to me to the extent we possibly can, we \nought to urge the purchase of steel or iron or skids steer loaders in \nthis country to do so. I recognize it is controversial. I am not \ninterested in being violative of any trade agreement that we have, and \nmy understanding is this provision does not violate trade agreements \nbecause it will largely come from State grants for public works \nprojects.\n  I hope to offer the amendment dealing with the tax issue, and I will \nfile that this afternoon. I hope I can get in line so we can have a \ndebate because it is first and foremost about jobs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 104 to Amendment No. 98\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow an above-\n   the-line deduction against individual income tax for interest on \n indebtedness and for State sales and excise taxes with respect to the \n                  purchase of certain motor vehicles)\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and I call up amendment No. 104.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Reserving the right to object, and I will not, can we \nestablish an order of recognition? I have been on the Senate floor. \nSenator McCain has joined us. Senator Mikulski has been here for a \nwhile. Can Senator Mikulski give us an order of presentation?\n  Mr. REID. Can I make a parliamentary inquiry, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friends, it was my \nunderstanding--I just stepped on to the Senate floor--we had a \nDemocratic amendment that was offered. Senator Coburn offered an \namendment. What we are going to try to do is rotate back and forth. The \nnext in line that we have is Senator Mikulski.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is there a previous unanimous consent agreement?\n  Mr. REID. No. There was just an understanding between Senator \nMcConnell and me that we would rotate back and forth. The Senator can \ndecide on his side who goes next.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I was just asking if there was a previous unanimous \nconsent agreement, I ask the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a pending unanimous consent request \nmade by the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. McCAIN. What is the nature of that request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Maryland restate her \nrequest?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and I call up amendment No. 140.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, would the majority leader \nand the Senator from Maryland object to a sequence of speaking so some \nof us can plan the use of our time at least for the next two or three \nspeakers?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n[[Page S1390]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I was not aware a Coburn amendment had been laid down. I \nthink it would be appropriate to have the Senator from Maryland lay \ndown her amendment and go back to the Coburn amendment. People who wish \nto speak on that amendment should be able to do that before we have the \nspeaking order of the Senator from Maryland. It is my understanding the \nSenator from Arizona wishes to speak on the Coburn amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that \nafter the Senator from Maryland, the Senator from Georgia and whatever \nspeaker on the other side wishes to speak, then I be----\n  Mr. REID. If I may interrupt my friend, all the Senator from Maryland \nwants to do is lay down her amendment so when we complete action on the \nCoburn amendment, we can move to her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], for herself, and \n     Mr. Brownback, proposes an amendment numbered 104 to \n     amendment No. 98.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Monday, February 2, 2009, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, to give a sense of process, I have an \namendment that I think will contribute to both creating jobs and saving \njobs in the American automobile industry. Before I explain my \namendment, I wish to note that my remarks will take about 5 minutes. I \nultimately will want to vote on this amendment later on today, when the \nleadership on both sides of the aisle agrees to a time in sequencing \nthey choose. I know there will be opponents to my amendment, and I will \nreturn to debate at that time. But in the interest of comity, I will \nlay down my amendment, speak for 5 minutes to explain it, and then we \ncan return to the discussion on the Coburn amendment.\n  Mr. President, I think we all agree that our economy is in shambles \nand that Congress needs to act and act very quickly. My amendment does \nwhat the President said he wanted to do, and what the other side of the \naisle says it wants to do, or the other side of my amendment says they \nwant to do. The Mikulski amendment is timely, targeted, and temporary, \nand it is focused on saving jobs and creating jobs in the automobile \nindustry.\n  What does my amendment do? It does this. If you buy a passenger car, \nminivan or light truck within this year, you will get a tax deduction \nfor your sales or excise tax and the interest on your car loan. It \nmeans a family could save approximately $1,500 on a $25,000 car \npurchase.\n  Now, what does this amendment mean and what does it do? This \namendment is actually about creating jobs. Our automobile industry is \nlanguishing--from the people who make them, to the dealers who sell \nthem, to the people who service them, to the back office people, and to \nthe people who also provide the supplies.\n  My amendment is also cost-effective in terms of the Treasury. Not a \nnickel will be spent unless you go buy a car or a minivan or a light \ntruck. So we are not throwing money out of a helicopter, and we are not \nputting money out there and hoping people will spend. We are giving \nmoney to banks hoping they will lend. Under the Mikulski amendment, it \nonly happens if you walk into a dealership, buy an automobile, and then \nonce you complete that purchase, take that deduction for the sales tax \nalong with the interest.\n  Why is this good? First of all, for the consumer, it means they get a \ndeal. It is a market incentive and gets them into the showroom to buy \nwhat they want. Second, it helps the environment because all new cars--\nand this is going only to new cars--get greater fuel efficiency and \nhave lower carbon emissions. It is also the only amendment that affects \nbusiness up and down the chain in our own country. My amendment is not \nlimited to only American cars but it is focused on cars made in the \nUnited States. So whether it is a Ford, a Chevy, a Chrysler, a Nissan \nor a Toyota, it qualifies for the Mikulski amendment.\n  No. 1, it helps manufacturing. If you buy a car, it means they have \nto be built. We are facing a crisis in the automobile industry. We can \ngive all the bailouts we want, but unless people buy cars, the bailout \nwill just become part of the bucket list. My amendment helps \nmanufacturing, which means it also helps the dealerships. There are \n20,000 new car dealerships in the United States, and they employ about \na million people. I have met them in my own State. In many of the rural \nparts of my State, they are the major employer. They are also the major \ncontributors to the United Way, to the rotary clubs, and to the \nathletic leagues. These are human beings who sell cars. They are the \nauto mechanics, with grease under their fingernails but patriotism in \ntheir hearts; they are the taxpayers who pay for the bailout of the \nbanks, but they don't want a bailout, they want people to come in to \nbuy their cars. My amendment also will help the consumer to have one \nmore incentive to be able to buy these cars.\n  One of the auto mechanics said to me he had worked at a Chevy \ndealership for over 23 years. He said: Senator Barb, I have worked all \nmy life, and I love to work on cars. I just love it. I love to fix them \nand I love to repair them, and I think I have done a good job at it. I \nam happy to think I have helped a lot of other people to be in safe, \nreliable vehicles, and all I want is to have a real job and a real \nincome so that I can send my two kids to college.\n  I could elaborate on my amendment, but I know others also wish to \nspeak on it, and I will reserve the right to come back and to further \ndebate it. But if you want to help create jobs, save jobs, keep the \nautomobile industry going, and get our economy back on its wheels, vote \nfor the Mikulski automobile tax deduction amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 109\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to begin by thanking the \nmanagers for their patience and their leadership in this marathon that \nwe are engaged.\n  I rise in support of the Coburn amendment, which strikes the $246 \nmillion Hollywood tax earmark. It is quite an interesting earmark in \nthat the stimulus legislation provides a tax earmark for Hollywood in \nthe amount of $246 million--a quarter of a billion dollars--over the \nnext 11 years, and would allow large Hollywood studios the opportunity \nto choose between the existing tax break for movie studios or to write \noff 50 percent of the entire production cost for movies and TV shows \nmade in 2009. In the years that follow the remainder of the production \ncost would be written off according to existing depreciation law. The \n50-percent accelerated depreciation in the first year is a ``bonus \ndepreciation.'' Obviously, this amendment would strike that special \nearmark.\n  I would point out to my colleagues that Hollywood is doing okay. They \nraked in over a billion dollars in January--the biggest January ever \nfor the movie industry. That is testimony to the attractiveness of the \nproduct. Box office receipts were up nearly 20 percent in January 2009, \nwith ticket sales up 16 percent over January 2008, when January is \ntypically considered a weak month for the industry.\n  Movie director Rob Reiner was recently asked about Hollywood's \nrelationship with Washington, DC, and claimed:\n\n       We are a special interest group that doesn't ask for \n     anything like earmark legislation or tax breaks. We are the \n     one industry that doesn't ask for a quid pro quo.\n\n  Well, rather than targeting tax breaks at big-time political donors, \nthe stimulus should have targeted its tax break toward mainstream \nAmerica.\n  I regret that I can't support the so-called stimulus bill that has \nbeen presented. We have an opportunity to craft a bill that would \nprovide real relief for the American people at a time of great economic \nuncertainty. Unfortunately, that opportunity has so far\n\n[[Page S1391]]\n\nbeen rejected. Once again, parochial partisan and special interests \nhave taken precedence over the interests of the American people.\n  This bill has become nothing more than a massive spending bill, \nexpected to cost taxpayers more than $1.2 trillion, according to the \nlatest estimate by the Congressional Budget Office, and $1.2 trillion \ndwarfs any Government program in history, after adjusting for \ninflation. It is bigger than the New Deal and the Iraq war combined. \nThe interest alone will be costlier than the Louisiana Purchase in \ncurrent dollars or the amount the United States spent to land on the \nMoon.\n  During a press conference in November 2008 to introduce the new \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget, then President-elect \nObama said:\n\n       The new way of doing business is, let's figure out what \n     projects, what investments are going to give the American \n     economy the most bang for their buck, how we protect taxpayer \n     dollars so that this money is not wasted, restore a sense of \n     confidence among taxpayers that, when we spend our money, it \n     is on that which is actually going to improve their quality \n     of life, create jobs that are so desperately needed, help to \n     spur on economic growth and business creation in the private \n     sector. That is all part of the new way of doing business.\n\n  1I was very pleased to hear the President speak those words. However, \nI do not believe the bill before us today is reflective of that \nsentiment. Let's acknowledge and continue to acknowledge that American \nfamilies are hurting and they need our help. We have entered the second \nyear of a recession. Record numbers of homeowners face foreclosure, our \nfinancial markets have nearly collapsed, the U.S. automobile \nmanufacturers are in serious trouble, and the national unemployment \nrate stands at 7.2 percent--the highest in 16 years--with over 1.9 \nmillion people having lost their jobs in the last 4 months of 2008. \nAdditionally, the number of Americans filing first-time unemployment \nclaims this month matches the highest level in 26 years. Housing starts \ndecreased 15.5 percent in December compared to the prior month. For \n2008, housing starts were at a new low, shattering the previous record \nof 1.014 million set in 1991.\n  The list goes on and on, and I don't have to tell any American of the \neconomic challenges we face and the real suffering that is going on \nthroughout America. In the last year alone, due to the mortgage crisis, \nthe Government has seized control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and we \nalready passed a massive $700 billion rescue of the financial markets. \nWe have debated giving the big three auto manufacturers tens of \nbillions in taxpayer money as a ``short-term infusion of cash,'' \nknowing they would be back for more.\n  Last week, the House approved its $819 billion stimulus package on a \nparty-line vote. The total cost of that legislation is almost as much \nas the annual discretionary budget for the entire Federal Government. \nWe need to stimulate the economy, but we need to do it in a smart, \nfiscally responsible manner that will not bankrupt future generations \nof Americans. It is more important now than ever before that Congress \nrestore fiscal discipline to Washington and get our financial house in \norder.\n  In a November 25, 2008, opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, \nJohn Taylor, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and a professor \nof economics at Stanford University, wrote:\n\n       The major part of the first stimulus package last year was \n     the $115 billion temporary rebate payment program targeted to \n     individuals and families that phased out as incomes rose. \n     Most of the rebate checks were mailed or directly deposited \n     during May, June, and July of 2008. The argument in favor of \n     these temporary rebate payments was that they would increase \n     consumption, stimulate aggregate demand, and thereby get the \n     economy growing again. What were the results? This chart \n     reveals the answer. The upper line shows disposable personal \n     income through September. Disposable personal income is what \n     households have left after paying taxes and receiving \n     transfers from the government. The big blip is due to the \n     rebate payments in May through July. The lower line shows \n     personal consumption expenditures by households. Observe that \n     consumption shows no noticeable increase at the time of the \n     rebate. Hence, by this simple measure, the rebate did little \n     or nothing to stimulate consumption, overall aggregate demand \n     or the economy. These results may seem surprising, but they \n     are not. They correspond closely to what basic economic \n     theory tells us. Temporary increases in income will not lead \n     to significant increases in consumption. However, if \n     increases are longer term, as in the case of a permanent tax \n     cut, then consumption is increased and by a significant \n     amount.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe full text of Mr. Taylor's op-ed.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From The Wall Street Journal, Nov. 25, 2008]\n\n              Why Permanent Tax Cuts Are the Best Stimulus\n\n                          (By John B. Taylor)\n\n       The incoming Obama administration and congressional \n     Democrats are now considering a second fiscal stimulus \n     package, estimated at more than $500 billion, to follow the \n     Economic Stimulus Act of 2008. As they do, much can be \n     learned by examining the first.\n       The major part of the first stimulus package was the $115 \n     billion, temporary rebate payment program targeted to \n     individuals and families that phased out as incomes rose. \n     Most of the rebate checks were mailed or directly deposited \n     during May, June and July.\n       The argument in favor of these temporary rebate payments \n     was that they would increase consumption, stimulate aggregate \n     demand, and thereby get the economy growing again. What were \n     the results? The chart nearby reveals the answer.\n       The upper line shows disposable personal income through \n     September. Disposable personal income is what households have \n     left after paying taxes and receiving transfers from the \n     government. The big blip is due to the rebate payments in May \n     through July.\n       The lower line shows personal consumption expenditures by \n     households. Observe that consumption shows no noticeable \n     increase at the time of the rebate. Hence, by this simple \n     measure, the rebate did little or nothing to stimulate \n     consumption, overall aggregate demand, or the economy.\n       These results may seem surprising, but they are not. They \n     correspond very closely to what basic economic theory tells \n     us. According to the permanent-income theory of Milton \n     Friedman, or the life-cycle theory of Franco Modigliani, \n     temporary increases in income will not lead to significant \n     increases in consumption. However, if increases are longer-\n     term, as in the case of permanent tax cut, then consumption \n     is increased, and by a significant amount.\n       After years of study and debate, theories based on the \n     permanent-income model led many economists to conclude that \n     discretionary fiscal policy actions, such as temporary \n     rebates, are not a good policy tool. Rather, fiscal policy \n     should focus on the ``automatic stabilizers'' (the tendency \n     for tax revenues to decline in a recession and transfer \n     payments such as unemployment compensation to increase in a \n     recession), which are built into the tax-and-transfer system, \n     and on more permanent fiscal changes that will positively \n     affect the long-term growth of the economy.\n       Why did that consensus seem to break down during the public \n     debates about the fiscal stimulus early this year? One reason \n     may have been the apparent success of the rebate payments in \n     2001. However, those rebate payments were the first \n     installment of more permanent, multiyear tax cuts passed that \n     same year. Hence, they were not temporary.\n       What are the implications for a second stimulus early next \n     year? The mantra often heard during debates about the first \n     stimulus was that it should be temporary, targeted and \n     timely. Clearly, that mantra must be replaced. In testimony \n     before the Senate Budget Committee on Nov. 19, I recommended \n     alternative principles: permanent, pervasive and predictable.\n       Permanent. The most obvious lesson learned from the first \n     stimulus is that temporary is not a principle to follow if \n     you want to get the economy moving again. Rather than one- or \n     two-year packages, we should be looking for permanent fiscal \n     changes that turn the economy around in a lasting way.\n       Pervasive. One argument in favor of ``targeting'' the first \n     stimulus package was that, by focusing on people who might \n     consume more, the impact would be larger. But the stimulus \n     was ineffective with such targeting. Moreover, targeting \n     implied that increased tax rates, as currently scheduled, \n     will not be a drag on the economy as long as increased \n     payments to the targeted groups are larger than the higher \n     taxes paid by others. But increasing tax rates on businesses \n     or on investments in the current weak economy would increase \n     unemployment and further weaken the economy. Better to seek \n     an across-the-board approach where both employers and \n     employees benefit.\n       Predictable. While timeliness is an admirable attribute, it \n     is only one property of good fiscal policy. More important is \n     that policy should be clear and understandable--that is, \n     predictable--so that individuals and firms know what to \n     expect.\n       Many complain that government interventions in the current \n     crisis have been too erratic. Economic policy--from monetary \n     policy to regulatory policy, international policy and fiscal \n     policy--works best if it is as predictable as possible.\n       Many good fiscal packages are consistent with these \n     principles. But what can Congress and the incoming Obama \n     administration do to give the economy a real boost on Jan. \n     20? Here are a few fairly bipartisan measures worth \n     considering:\n\n[[Page S1392]]\n\n       First, make a commitment, passed into law, to keep all \n     income-tax rates where they are now, effectively making \n     current tax rates permanent. This would be a significant \n     stimulus to the economy, because tax-rate increases are now \n     expected on a majority of small business income, capital \n     gains income, and dividend income.\n       Second, enact a worker's tax credit equal to 6.2% of wages \n     up to $8,000 as Mr. Obama proposed during the campaign--but \n     make it permanent rather than a one-time check.\n       Third, recognize explicitly that the ``automatic \n     stabilizers'' are likely to be as large as 2.5% of GDP this \n     fiscal year, that they will help stabilize the economy, and \n     that they should be viewed as part of the overall fiscal \n     package even if they do not require legislation.\n       Fourth, construct a government spending plan that meets \n     long-term objectives, puts the economy on a path to budget \n     balance, and is expedited to the degree possible without \n     causing waste and inefficiency.\n       Some who promoted the first stimulus package have reacted \n     to its failure by saying that we must now switch to large \n     increases in government spending to stimulate demand. But \n     government spending does not address the causes of the weak \n     economy, which has been pulled down by a housing slump, a \n     financial crisis and a bout of high energy prices, and where \n     expectations of future income and employment growth are low.\n       The theory that a short-run government spending stimulus \n     will jump-start the economy is based on old-fashioned, \n     largely static Keynesian theories. These approaches do not \n     adequately account for the complex dynamics of a modern \n     international economy, or for expectations of the future that \n     are now built into decisions in virtually every market.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Now, one of the unfortunate things, and this is beginning \nto be appreciated by the American people, is that Members of Congress \ncouldn't resist the temptation to load this bill with hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in unnecessary spending, that will not do anything \nto stimulate the economy. We all know some of these, but they bear \nrepeating, that have been included under the guise of stimulus: $400 \nmillion for STD prevention; $600 million for new cars for the Federal \nGovernment; $34 million to remodel the Commerce Department headquarters \nhere in our Nation's Capital; $25 million to rehabilitate ATV trails; \n$150 million for honeybee insurance; $75 million for smoking cessation; \nand $50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts.\n  There is no doubt all of those are worthy causes which probably \ndeserve our attention, our care and, sometimes, our dollars. But to \nportray them and others as a stimulus to create jobs and to have our \neconomy recover, I think flies in the face of reality.\n  In the Senate bill, we have $100 billion to assist States with \nagricultural losses; $300 million for diesel emission reduction grants; \n$150 million for facility improvements at the Smithsonian Museum; $198 \nmillion for school food service equipment; and $2.9 billion for the \nweatherization assistance program.\n  There is also $6 billion of wiring for broadband and wireless in \nrural areas. I have always been an advocate of that. But the fact is, \nanyone who is knowledgeable of the difficulties and challenges will \ntell you that it takes years to achieve that goal even if the funds are \navailable.\n  In order to comply with the Congressional Budget Resolution, the \ncommittee report contains a statement of how the emergency provisions \ncontained in the bill meet the criteria for emergency spending. The \nreport states, and I quote:\n\n       The bill contains emergency funding for fiscal year 2009 \n     for responses to the deteriorating economy, natural disasters \n     and for other needs. The funding recommended herein is \n     related to unanticipated needs and is for situations that are \n     sudden, urgent, and unforeseen, specifically the devastating \n     effects of the economic crisis, natural disasters and rising \n     unemployment.\n\n  Perhaps the authors of the bill can explain to me how $150 million \nfor honeybee insurance falls within the distinction as outlined in the \nlegislation. Someone needs to explain to me how giving tens of millions \nof dollars to the National Endowment of the Arts or the Smithsonian \nMuseum will reverse ``the devastating effects of the economic crisis.''\n  The problem is we are accumulating debt that we are laying upon \nfuture generations of Americans. We are going to have to pay this debt \nsometime. My great worry is that if we do not account for this debt in \nsome way, if we continue trillions of dollars of unnecessary and \nwasteful spending, then obviously we will find ourselves back in the \nsituation we were in the 1970s, when we had hyperinflation and had to \ndebase the currency.\n  I want to say a word for a minute about ``Buy American.'' The next \ntime I come to debate on the ``Buy American'' provisions, I intend to \nbring a picture of Mr. Smoot and Mr. Hawley, the two individuals who \nwere responsible, in the view of historians, for taking a country that \nwas in a serious recession into the depths of one of the great \ndepressions in the history of the United States.\n  Because as we enact protectionist measures, I was interested to hear \nmy friend from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, say it was not in \nviolation of any treaty. It is in violation of several treaties. It is \nin violation of what has been an important aspect of America's policy \nwhich has been free and open trade.\n  I guess the fundamental difference I have between the authors of the \n``Buy American'' provisions and myself is that I believe the most \nproductive, the most innovative, and the strongest and best workers in \nthe world reside in the United States of America, that the innovations \nand technology that have led the world have come from the United States \nof America, and that our products can compete anywhere in the world \nunder free and open trade conditions.\n  Now, there have been violations on the part of other countries. That \nis why we are members of the WTO. That is why there are provisions in \nthe North American Free Trade Agreement that should be vigorously \npursued when there are violations and protectionist activities on the \npart of any nation of which we are participants in trade agreements.\n  If there are specific violations, then those violations should be \naddressed. But I wanted to emphasize, if we pass these ``Buy American'' \nprovisions, you will find other nations retaliating and you will find \nus on a sure but unfortunate path to the exacerbation of our economic \ndifficulties. That is a matter of history. Consult any historian. I \nhope we will not keep these ``Buy American'' provisions in whatever \nlegislation we arrive at.\n  This bill contains protectionist ``Buy America'' provisions that will \nprove harmful to both the American worker and the world economy. The \nSenate version of the stimulus bill goes beyond the stark protectionism \nof its House counterpart in a way that risks serious damage to our \neconomy. The Senate bill requires that major projects funded in the \nbill favor American-made steel, iron, and manufacturing over goods \nproduced abroad. These anti-trade measures may sound welcome to \nAmericans who are hurting in this economy and faced with the specter of \nlayoffs. The United States, after all, produces the world's finest \nproducts. Yet shortsighted protectionist measures risk greatly \nexacerbating our current economic woes. Already, one economist at the \nPeterson Institute for International Economics has calculated that the \n``Buy American'' provisions in this bill will cost more jobs than it \nwill generate. Some of our largest trading partners, including Canada \nand the European Union, have warned that such a move could invite \nprotectionist retaliation, further harming our ability to generate jobs \nand economic growth.\n  We have seen this tendency before. In the 1930s, as depression swept \nthe globe, countries around the world enacted protectionist legislation \nin a counterproductive effort to preserve jobs at home, at the expense \nof those abroad. It was a fool's errand, and the result was the largest \nand most prolonged economic downturn of the 20th century. We know \nbetter now, and we must have the foresight and the courage to do what \nis right.\n  I am very concerned about the potential impact these ``Buy America'' \npolicies will have on bilateral trade relations with our allies. From a \nphilosophical point of view, I oppose this type of protectionist trade \npolicy, not only because I believe free trade to be an important means \nof improving relations among all nations, but it is essential to U.S. \neconomic growth. Moreover, from a practical standpoint, the added ``Buy \nAmerica'' restrictions in this stimulus bill could seriously impair our \nability to compete freely in the international markets and could also \nresult in loss of existing business from long-standing trading \npartners.\n\n[[Page S1393]]\n\n  Let me be clear. I am not against U.S. procurement of American \nproducts. The United States, without a doubt produces the very best \nproducts in the world, this certainly is the case with American-made \ndefense products. In fact, a Department of State study reported that \nU.S. defense companies sold more weapons and defense products and \nclaimed a larger share of the world market than was previously \nrealized. This study shows U.S. exports of defense products increased \nto nearly $49 billion in 2006, comprising nearly 70 percent of global \nexports. This number continues to rise steadily. Furthermore, I believe \nthat competition and open markets among our allies on a reciprocal \nbasis would provide the best equipment at the best prices for the \ntaxpayers and U.S. and allied militaries alike.\n  Congress can continue to protect U.S. industries from foreign \ncompetition for selfish, special interest reasons, or we can loosen \nthese restrictions to provide necessary funds to ensure our economy can \nreturn to the strength it once had. ``Buy America'' policy in defense \nspending is particularly harmful and costly. Every dollar we spend on \narchaic procurement policies, like ``Buy America,'' is a dollar we \ncannot spend on training our troops, keeping personnel quality of life \nat an appropriate level, maintaining force structure, replacing old and \nworn-out weapon systems, and advancing our military technologies. It is \nmy sincere hope that legislative provisions like ``Buy America'' in the \nstimulus bill are dropped and that Congress will end once and for all \nthe anticompetitive, antifree trade practices that encumber our \nGovernment, the military, and U.S. industry.\n  In addition to the ``Buy America'' language contained in both the \nHouse and Senate stimulus bills, other policy provisions have been \nincluded in this legislation. Many of these items are nothing more than \ntypical policy riders that will do nothing to stimulate the economy and \ncreate jobs. Most are partisan provisions that were added to this bill \nbecause it is considered to be ``must-pass'' legislation. They should \nnot be included in any type of stimulus legislation and should instead \ngo through the regular legislative process and subjected to necessary \ndebate. Some examples of these policy riders include requiring the \nTransportation Security Administration to buy 100,000 employee uniforms \nfrom U.S. textile plants, legislation to give Federal workers new \nwhistleblower protections, and legislative language favoring open \naccess, or net-neutrality, that telecoms have long opposed.\n  Additionally, both bills contain wasteful Davis-Bacon provisions that \nmandate artificially high wage rates, based on faulty data, for its \nFederal construction spending. These rates are determined by the \nSecretary of Labor to be the prevailing wages in the geographic \nlocality of the project for similar crafts and skills on comparable \nconstruction work. A report by the Department of Labor found that the \nwage surveys on which the prevailing wages are based are inaccurate. \nDOL's inspector general submitted a report to Congress that noted that \na contractor hired by DOL found ``one or more errors in nearly 100 \npercent of the wage reports we reviewed.'' The error rates were high \neven after a more than $20 million effort to fix the surveys. In \naddition to outright errors, the inspector general noted that DOL used \nfaulty methodology from unscientific surveys that led to bias, and even \nthe data it did collect was untimely and, therefore, suspect.\n  The Davis-Bacon Act is an outmoded, depression-era, inflationary \npolicy that, according to recent estimates, will inflate the \nconstruction costs of this bill by $17 billion. If we are trying to \ncreate new jobs then we should repeal Davis-Bacon, not encourage its \nexpansion in this bill. Davis-Bacon imposes heavy regulatory burdens \nand unnecessary costs on Government contractors--not to mention the \ntaxpayers who have to foot the bill for the inflated costs. \nFurthermore, Davis-Bacon makes it more difficult for entry level job \nseekers, the unemployed, and the unskilled to obtain work.\n  A recent study noted that ``contrary to its purpose, the Davis-Bacon \nAct distorts construction labor markets. Davis-Bacon wages bear little \nrelation to market wages, because the Government's prevailing wage \nestimates are wildly inaccurate. In some cities, Davis-Bacon rates are \nmuch higher than market wages. In Long Island, New York, for example, \nmarket rates for plumbers are $29.68 an hour. Davis-Bacon rates, \nhowever, are $44.75 an hour, 51 percent more than what the markets \ndemand. In other cities, Davis-Bacon wages are significantly below \nmarket rates. For instance, Davis-Bacon rates for carpenters and \nplumbers in Sarasota, FL, are $6.55 an hour, a figure below Florida's \nminimum wage of $7.21. Nationwide, Davis-Bacon rates average 22 percent \nabove market wages and inflate the cost of Federal construction by 10 \npercent.'' Mr. President, decent, livable wages are important for every \nAmerican--but imposing harmful, outdated Davis-Bacon requirements on \nFederal construction projects will do nothing more than bloat the cost \nof this bill, suppress new construction hires, and depress the economy.\n  I want to say a few words about the proposal that I and a group of \nother Senators have presented today and will be proposing as we go \nthrough this debate. Basically in the category of taxes, it would \neliminate the 3.1-percent payroll tax for all American employees, lower \nthe tax bracket from 10 percent to 5 percent, lower the 15-percent tax \nbracket to 10 percent, lower corporate tax brackets from 35 to 25, \nlower tax brackets to 25 from 35 to small businesses, and help provide \nfor accelerated depreciation for capital investment. The total cost of \nthat provision would be $275 billion.\n  It would also extend the unemployment insurance benefits, extend food \nstamps, unemployment insurance benefits would be made tax free, and \ntraining and employment services for dislocated workers would be \nprovided at the cost of $50 billion.\n  There would be housing provisions. Let me emphasize to my colleagues \nwhat we all know: It was the housing crisis that began this \nconflagration and it will be the stabilization of home values that ends \nit.\n  My friend from Nevada here and others have been working hard to try \nto address the housing crisis. In our respective States, obviously, the \nhousing crisis is of the utmost severity, as it is throughout the \ncountry. But in high-growth areas of the country such as ours, it is \neven more severe. We have seen even more dramatic reductions in home \nvalues.\n  So our primary goal, my friends, is that we must stabilize home \nvalues if we are going to reverse this deep and precipitous slide we \nare seeing and the difficulties we are experiencing in our economy.\n  Among other proposals, $11 billion would require the Federal \nGovernment to allocate funding to increase the fee that servicers \nreceive from continuing a mortgage and avoiding foreclosure from a one-\ntime fee of $1,000 up to $60 per month for the life of the loan.\n  Safe harbor provisions remove the legal constraints inhibiting \nmodifications; tax incentives for home purchases; the tax credit in the \namount of $15,000 or 10 percent of the purchase price, whichever is \nless, with the option to utilize all in 1 year, or spread out over 2 \nyears, and GSE and FHA conforming loan limits. This cost would be \naround $32 billion.\n  We should invest in our national infrastructure and defense. We \nshould spend $9 billion to improve, repair, and modernize Department of \nDefense facilitates, restore and modernize barracks, improve facilities \nand infrastructure directly supporting the readiness and training of \nthe Armed Forces, and invest in the energy efficiency of Department of \nDefense facilities. This activity would generate construction and \ncraftsmen jobs in the short term by addressing deteriorating conditions \nof existing facilities for projects that are ready to be carried out in \nthe next 9 months.\n  As to the resetting our combat forces, the Department of Defense will \nbe requesting emergency supplemental appropriations in the spring of \n2009 to support the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Inclusion of \nthis in the stimulus accelerates those requirements and will be used to \nplace new orders or to repair vehicles, equipment, material, ammunition \nrequired to fully equip our combat units, while generating jobs on \nassembly and manufacturing lines around the country.\n\n[[Page S1394]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to think about, if we are going to provide \nfunds, that our defense needs are great, of the equipment that has been \nworn out in Iraq and will again be required to be used in Afghanistan. \nObviously all of us who have visited our military installations know \nthere are facilities that need to be modernized, restored, and new \nconstruction. We propose $70 billion for road and bridge \ninfrastructure, road and bridges on Federal land, public transit and \nairport infrastructure and improvements, and $1 billion for a small \nbusiness loan program. The total estimated cost for investing in our \ninfrastructure: $88 billion.\n  Finally, we need to require these spending programs in the stimulus \nbill be sunset 3 years from enactment. If this spending is intended to \nrestore our economy and jump-start it, once the economy is jump-started \nand restored, then we should not have to continue this spending and \nincrease the size of our debt and lay it on future generations of \nAmericans.\n  This proposal states that after two consecutive quarters of economic \ngrowth greater than 2 percent of inflation-adjusted GDP, the following \ncontrol mechanisms will trigger to reduce the deficit and promote long-\nterm economic growth: All spending provisions in the economic stimulus \nlegislation where funds have not been spent or obligated will be \ncancelled and permanently rescinded. The budget baselines shall be \nadjusted downward to ensure that all spending in the stimulus, whether \nspent or cancelled, is treated as a one-time expenditure and not \nassumed to be repeated.\n  What a lot of Americans do not know is every time we add a spending \nprovision, that becomes part of the baseline, which assumes that that \nmoney will be spent over time. We cannot continue that indefinitely. We \npropose a 2-percent across-the-board reduction in spending, with the \ngoal of balancing the budget by 2015.\n  We should establish two separate entitlement commissions, one to make \nrecommendations on systems and the other Medicare-Medicaid. We all know \nthe elephant in the room is Social Security and Medicare, and the \nunfunded liabilities associated with it. We should also require \nrecipients to disclose costs for awarded projects, prohibit stimulus \nfunds from being used for lobbying activities, political contributions, \nholiday parties, unnecessary renovations, and questionable travel.\n  We should spend some more money on accountability, transparency, \noversight, and results. We should create a recovery and accountability \nand transparency board with a Web site, create a Congressional \noversight panel, establish a recovery and reinvestment oversight board \ncomposed of Federal agency heads, require review and audits by the \nComptroller General on the bill's effectiveness in achieving economic \nand workforce recovery goals, and establish a special inspector general \nmodeled after the oversight required for TARP. The total is $445 \nbillion. I think this is a balanced proposal and one that I hope \ndeserves the serious consideration of this body.\n  I want to say a word about TARP. The American people have been \ndissatisfied with the results, and Members of this body have been as \nwell. In the first round of $350 billion, it seemed that the priorities \nseemed to change literally on a daily or weekly basis.\n  It became unclear as to exactly what that $350 billion was going to \ndo, and, apparently, if you look at all of the statistics, it has not \nresulted in significant improvement.\n  Now, what would have happened without it will be a matter of \nconjecture and analysis by economists and historians. Now we are in the \nsecond round. Now we are told there may need to be more, another TARP, \nafter we pass this stimulus legislation and an omnibus appropriations \nbill.\n  When we start totaling that, we are talking about several trillion \ndollars, and we can't continue that without the American people \nexperiencing some tangible results. Most Members of this body are in \nagreement. We need to stimulate and jump-start the economy. Let's not \ndo it in such a way that our children and grandchildren pay for it in \nthe most painful and difficult manner. We owe that to them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to tell Senators what the lay \nof the land is and share my thoughts on how the afternoon will proceed. \nSenator Murray offered the first amendment. Then we turned to a Coburn \namendment regarding the manufacture of films. That is pending. Next we \nturned to an amendment by Senator Mikulski regarding autos. That also \nis pending. Next we expect another Republican amendment. We have \nactually been going back and forth with some of the bigger amendments. \nThen the Republican amendments have been coming in, alternating back \nand forth. Next we expect an amendment by Senators Boxer and Ensign \nregarding repatriation, then a Republican amendment, then an amendment \nby Senators Feingold and McCain regarding earmarks. We hope to have \nseveral votes on these amendments today and will consult with leaders \nas to timing.\n  Once again, I urge Senators to let the managers know your intentions \nbecause we want to give Senators notice of what subjects are coming. If \nwe don't have notice, it will delay us. Please give us as much notice \nas possible. There will likely be opportunity to vote on amendments, \nbut we just need to know what is in those amendments. I thank Senators \nfor their cooperation.\n  Just a word or two about the amendment offered by the Senator from \nOklahoma. His amendment strikes a provision of the bill relating to the \nfilm industry. I might say to all my colleagues as well as to my good \nfriend from Oklahoma, the provision he is referring to gives bonus \ndepreciation to the film industry. The film industry is like any other. \nI don't see why it should be separated.\n  More importantly, the legislation before this body a year ago \nproviding for bonus depreciation inadvertently, incorrectly omitted the \nfilm industry from all other industries. One might ask why that \nhappened. Basically, I will not get into the personal reasons why it \nhappened, but there was a certain House Member who personally decided \nhe had an issue with the film industry, so he took it out for no good \nreason.\n  What I am saying is that this is not putting a new industry back in \nthe bill that would be entitled to bonus depreciation. It corrects a \nmistake where the film industry was incorrectly taken out in the last \nbonus depreciation bill and was taken out for no good reason--taken out \nfor a very personal reason, if I may be totally candid. It seems to me \nwe should get back to a level playing field and treat all industries \nthe same, not bring a vendetta against one industry, as was the case a \nyear ago, but, rather, put this back in because it is only fair. That \nis an American industry too, and this bonus depreciation would apply \nonly to films produced in the United States. It seems eminently fair to \nput back in a portion of the bonus depreciation bill that was \nincorrectly taken out a year ago. That is what this is. This is not \nadding an earmark; it is putting back something that was wrongly taken \nout.\n  At this point, I will include for the Record a letter from the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget regarding the bill \nbefore us. Director Orszag lays out the urgency of passing this \nlegislation.\n  We are losing jobs fast. As somebody pointed out the other day, the \nnumber of jobs lost on that day was the exact same number of people who \nwere in the stadium watching the Super Bowl. That number of jobs was \nlost that day. That is that day. Then there is the next day and the \nnext day. We are losing jobs.\n  This legislation is sorely needed. Is it perfect? No. Is anything \naround here perfect? No. But it is probably pretty good. The \nalternative is much worse. If we don't pass it, clearly many. more jobs \nwill be lost. We will be in a much worse situation than we are today.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the Director's letter printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                 Washington, DC, February 3, 2009.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance, United States Senate, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Baucus: The economy faces its most serious \n     crisis since the Great\n\n[[Page S1395]]\n\n     Depression, and the economic recovery package being \n     considered on the floor of the Senate is an essential step in \n     putting the economy back on a path to growth.\n       Last week, we learned that gross domestic product shrank by \n     3.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008, the largest \n     decline in 26 years. According to the Bureau of Labor \n     Statistics, more jobs were lost last year than were lost in \n     any calendar year since 1945. If nothing is done, many \n     outside experts estimate that the unemployment rate could \n     reach double digits, and our economy would fall $1 trillion \n     short of its capacity each year--a shortfall that translates \n     into about $12,000 in lost income on average for a family of \n     four. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is a well-\n     crafted response to our economic difficulties since it will \n     both jumpstart the economy in the near term (and thereby help \n     to mitigate some of the job losses and income declines that \n     would otherwise occur) and make key investments that will \n     promote long-term growth.\n       As you consider the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act \n     this week, I wanted to lay out the principles that guide the \n     President as he considers the type of plan that the country \n     needs--principles that both the House legislation and the \n     legislation you are considering meet.\n       First, it is critical that we jumpstart job creation with a \n     direct fiscal boost that will help to lift the nation out of \n     this deep recession. The plan should bolster economic \n     activity sufficiently to save or create three to four million \n     jobs by the end of 2010. The plan you are considering is \n     estimated to meet this standard.\n       Critically important to jumpstarting the economy is \n     reviving the housing sector. That is why in the coming days, \n     the President and Secretary Geithner will be releasing a \n     comprehensive proposal to strengthen and reinvigorate this \n     part of the economy. Their plan will build on the $50 billion \n     to $100 billion commitment to the housing sector made by the \n     Director of the National Economic Council in connection with \n     the Senate's decision last month to permit additional TARP \n     funding. By boosting economic activity in the short-term, the \n     recovery package itself will have a significant and immediate \n     impact on the housing and construction sectors. In \n     addition, the recovery package also includes some \n     promising ideas to create incentives for individuals to \n     purchase homes which also will help the housing sector. \n     The Administration supports these provisions, while \n     believing that any major new housing measures should be \n     considered only after the release of the Administration's \n     comprehensive proposal.\n       Second, as the President has made clear, he is adamant that \n     all of the spending must be made with unprecedented levels of \n     transparency and accountability. He is deeply committed to \n     making sure that every American is able to know what is in \n     this plan, can be confident that it will accomplish the goals \n     we set forth, and has the ability to hold Congress and the \n     Administration accountable for their actions. The \n     Administration will post information online about how this \n     plan's money is being spent and where it's going. In \n     addition, he is insistent that the bill not include any \n     earmarks or special projects. While many such projects may be \n     worthy, this emergency legislation is not the proper vehicle \n     for those aspirations.\n       Third, we need to recognize that focusing only on the short \n     term is part of why the economy is in such dire straits \n     today. That is why as we address the pressing demands of \n     lifting the economy out of a recession, we also must look to \n     the future and begin the process of reinvesting in priorities \n     like clean energy, education, health care, and infrastructure \n     so that the United States can enhance its long-term growth \n     and thrive in the 21st Century.\n       This begins with putting the nation in position to lead in \n     the clean energy economy. The President wants to make \n     investments that will double our renewable energy generating \n     capacity, modernize and expand our nation's electrical grid, \n     and undertake the largest program to weatherize homes in \n     history.\n       On health care, the President believes that we need to move \n     immediately to lower costs and expand coverage. That would \n     entail not only protecting coverage for millions of Americans \n     during these difficult times, but also modernizing our health \n     care system for the future with a serious commitment to \n     health care information technology systems and prevention \n     efforts.\n       As the global economy becomes more competitive, the \n     President believes that investing in education is the best \n     way we can help our children succeed. He wants the recovery \n     package to renovate and modernize 10,000 schools so our \n     children have libraries and labs in which to learn; make \n     college more affordable through finding the shortfall in Pell \n     Grants and a new higher-education tax cut; and triple the \n     number of fellowships in science to spur the next generation \n     of innovation.\n       The President also believes that we need to rebuild and \n     retrofit America for the demands of the 21st Century. This \n     will entail repairing and modernizing roads and mass transit \n     options across the country as well as expanding broadband \n     access so that businesses all across our nation can compete \n     with firms from all over the world.\n       Finally, we need to recognize that this recovery and \n     reinvestment plan is an extraordinary response to an \n     extraordinary crisis. It should not be seen as an opportunity \n     to abandon the fiscal discipline that we owe each and every \n     taxpayer in spending their money--and that is critical to \n     keeping the United States strong in a global, interdependent \n     economy. Although it is not feasible to avoid any spillover \n     whatsoever of the recovery package on out-year spending, the \n     Administration believes that the package should minimize such \n     effects on out-year spending as much as possible. \n     Furthermore, the President is committed to paying for any \n     extension of the temporary tax cuts included in the recovery \n     plan that he would like to make permanent, and will detail \n     the manner of doing so in his budget submission.\n       Moving forward, we need to return to the fiscal \n     responsibility and pay-as-you-go budgeting that we had in the \n     1990's for all non-emergency measures. The President and his \n     economic team look forward to working with the Congress to \n     develop budget enforcement rules that are based on the tools \n     that helped create the surpluses of a decade ago. Putting the \n     country back on the path of fiscal responsibility will mean \n     tough choices and difficult trade-offs, but for the long-term \n     health of our economy, the President believes that they must \n     be made.\n       I look forward to working with you and your colleagues in \n     the coming days to craft a recovery package that embodies \n     these principles and achieves these goals.\n                                                  Peter R. Orszag,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, a couple of comments on the McCain \nproposal that several people are putting together. I have looked at it. \nI still need to study it a little more. But on the surface, it is a \nresponsible, balanced proposal. That group needs to be congratulated \nfor putting such a proposal together.\n  I rise because the most deliberative body in the world is facing a \nmoment of great challenge but also great possibility. We should all \nfeel the grave responsibility weighing on each of us as we debate this \nbill. If we pass legislation that truly stimulates the economy, it \ncould carry this Nation to new levels of growth and prosperity. \nUnfortunately, if we pass a bloated spending bill with little chance of \njump-starting the economy, we could delay this country's financial \nrecovery for many years to come.\n  While there isn't a crystal ball to show us what path will bring us \nto the ultimate goal, we are not without some guidance. Winston \nChurchill once said: Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to \nrepeat it. We have several examples from which to learn. We will heed \nthose lessons if we absolutely want to raise this Nation from the \neconomic quicksand that is swallowing it up more and more each day.\n  The Great Depression is a chapter of history that fewer and fewer \nAmericans can recall firsthand. Maybe that is why the circumstances are \nso widely misunderstood today. It has been said that today's economic \ncrisis is the result of a perfect storm. Well, the Great Depression was \nmany perfect storms.\n  Herbert Hoover, a Republican, did not sit on the side lines, as many \npeople believe, when Black Thursday and Black Tuesday struck in 1929. \nHe was actually a big government interventionist. Working with \nCongress, he raised taxes. He enacted protectionist laws by raising \nU.S. tariffs. Senator McCain referred to these as the Smoot-Hawley \nTariff Act. He pushed all levels of government to invest in \ninfrastructure and expand public works projects.\n  When Franklin Roosevelt took office in 1932, he created great \nmomentum by earning the confidence of the American people. But his New \nDeal sent this Nation into an even deeper economic depression. In the \nlate 1930s, there was a ``Depression within the Depression.'' The stock \nmarket did not return to 1929 levels for 25 years.\n  While World War II pulled us out of the Great Depression, there were \nstill tremendous sacrifices being made by all Americans. Some have \nargued that the spending of the New Deal was not aggressive enough. I \ncouldn't disagree more. On some levels, we are still paying for the \nprojects that began with the New Deal.\n  The single biggest failure of the response to the Great Depression is \nthat the private sector was not encouraged to grow this country out of \nits financial crisis. In fact, by injecting so much money into the \nGovernment programs, FDR created a competitor to the private sector. \nThis was a match between David, the private sector, and Goliath, the \nGovernment monster. This time, unfortunately, Goliath won. We know that \nthe policies of the New Deal\n\n[[Page S1396]]\n\nactually prolonged the Nation's financial hardships. After all, the \ndepression lasted 10 years. Do we want to be in this kind of an \neconomic recession for 10 years?\n  More recently, we have learned from Japan's failed efforts to spend \nits way out of a recession. Japan passed stimulus bills for 10 straight \nyears during the 1990s. They wasted money on unnecessary projects while \nletting insolvent banks be supported with Government money. Does that \nsound familiar? What did that get them? Unmanageable, debilitating \ndebt, and a decade of rising unemployment.\n  We cannot afford to ignore the lessons of history. The responsibility \nfacing us during this crisis cannot be overstated. We are bound by the \nConstitution that empowers us to collect taxes, borrow money, regulate \ncommerce, and provide for the general welfare. We, however, are also \nbound by the responsibility to future generations of Americans. To \nburden our children and grandchildren with the kind of debt we are \ntalking about today should give each of us reason to pause and consider \nthe ramifications.\n  There is no doubt that the crisis facing the financial markets, the \nhousing sector, and families will require extraordinary measures. There \nis perhaps no better illustration of the grave challenges facing the \nNation than that of the State of Nevada. At one time, people thought we \nwere recession proof. When Americans buckle down on spending, a \nvacation to Las Vegas is no longer in the cards. Jobs are lost, homes \nare foreclosed, and it becomes harder to ignore the half-finished \nconstruction projects across southern Nevada.\n  Here in the Senate, we are among the few Americans with at least some \nlevel of job security--that is, of course, until the next election. \nMost Americans are living day to day, waiting to hear what new massive \nlayoff will be announced and if it will hit them or someone in their \nfamily. It is a terrible feeling to have that much uncertainty in your \nlife.\n  The calls and e-mails I have received from constituents are \nheartbreaking. These are good citizens who have worked hard, saved \nwell, and contributed to their communities. They now find themselves in \na place of desperation.\n  Mrs. Louise Cutler has lived in Clark County, NV, for more than 17 \nyears. Her husband and two grown children who have degrees are \nunemployed. Louise lost her job with a mortgage company more than a \nyear ago. She is back at work now making about $20,000 less than \nbefore. She has student loans to pay, has lost $120,000 dollars in the \nvalue of her home, and she wants to know how we are going to help her.\n  My constituents--all of our constituents--are looking to us for \nleadership and solutions.\n  I believe we need to stimulate our economy immediately. Government \nhas a role to play here. The question is, How do we leverage our \nresources-paid for on the backs of struggling taxpayers--as efficiently \nas possible in order to stabilize our economy and grow it in the \nfuture?\n  I believe we need to start with the root of the problem. My training \nin veterinary medicine taught me that you don't use a Band-Aid to treat \na massive puncture wound. Ignoring that problem to treat superficial \ninjuries does not help the patient survive. The economy is very much \nour collective patient. It would ensure greater catastrophe to put a \nBand-Aid on an initial wound that started this downward spiral--and \nthat is the housing crisis. Unfortunately, the housing market is barely \naddressed in this so-called stimulus bill. Most Americans would say it \nis the first thing we need to heal. If we make mortgages more \nmanageable, people can stay in their homes and our economy can begin to \nrebuild.\n  One proposal I have--a guaranteed 4-percent, 30-year fixed rate \nmortgage for Americans would go a long way to ease pressure on family \nbudgets. On average, more than 40 million creditworthy homeowners would \nsave more than $400 per month. That makes a huge difference to most \nfamilies, and it would target the problem of oversupply in the housing \nmarket, something we cannot ignore. This is like a permanent tax cut \nwhich economists believe is the best stimulus for our economy, not just \na 1-year tax rebate.\n\n  Another proposal that goes a long way to fixing the housing situation \nis one from Senator Isakson. It expands the current homeowner tax \ncredit to $15,000 and covers all property and all home buyers, not just \nfirst-time home buyers. This would give a big boost to housing markets \nacross the country.\n  So what else works? Limited spending that makes our economy more \nefficient as well as tax relief that provides businesses and companies \nthe additional capital to retain and hire more employees. This will \nhelp to increase their output and compete into the future. That \nspending and tax relief needs to happen soon--not next year or two \nyears down the road. American families cannot wait that long.\n  I think we all must be prepared to make a sizable investment in order \nto ensure a swift and successful recovery. Unfortunately, the bill \nbefore us does not do that. Instead, it spends money on programs that \ncannot and will not aid that recovery. While Pell grants, Head Start, \nand the National Endowment for the Arts may be worthwhile projects in \ntheir own right, putting billions of dollars into them will not \nstimulate the economy. I have fought for Head Start for years, but I do \nnot think it should be considered immediate stimulus.\n  The bill before us simply does not qualify as an economic stimulus \nbill, and there is nothing immediate about it either. It is a laundry \nlist of spending priorities with a token of tax relief. We need a true \neconomic stimulus bill that efficiently spends money on projects that \nwill make our highways and infrastructure better equipped as a conduit \nfor business. We need meaningful tax relief that will spawn a new \ngeneration of growth and success in the private sector.\n  Instead, half of the so-called tax portion of this bill is just \ncreative spending dressed up as tax relief. It gives tax relief to \npeople who do not even pay income taxes. How are we relieving their tax \nburden if they do not have one?\n  In actuality, only $21 billion of this trillion-plus dollar spending \nbill goes to small businesses, the engine of our economy. That equals \nless than three percent of this monstrous bill. This is supposed to be \nan economic stimulus bill to create jobs and drive growth, but less \nthan three percent is dedicated to tax relief for small businesses \nwhich is where 80 percent of the jobs in the United States are created. \nHow do we expect to stimulate the economy that way? That goes to show \nyou how little input Republicans actually had in this process. I hope \nthat will change.\n  President Obama came to the Hill last week with a message of \nbipartisan cooperation. I have reached out to my Democratic colleagues \non several tax relief measures that they agree would give a much needed \nboost to our economy. I hope these proposals have the opportunity to be \nvoted on by all of my Senate colleagues so together we can witness an \neconomic revival.\n  The first is a plan that I am very familiar with. I worked with \nSenator Barbara Boxer to get it enacted into law several years ago. We \ncalled it the Invest in the USA Act, and it lived up to its name. It \nbrought $360 billion back into the United States in 2005 and helped to \nretain or create more than 2 million jobs. It also produced more than \n$34 billion in various tax revenues. History has proven that reducing \nthe tax rate U.S. businesses pay to return money they made overseas \nprovides a tremendous return. One great example comes from California-\nbased Oracle. They used repatriated earnings to defeat a German company \nin acquiring a U.S.-based retail software firm. This purchase allowed \nOracle to keep those jobs and intellectual property in the United \nStates. Oracle has since grown its facilities in Georgia and Minnesota \nby several hundred jobs.\n  Right now I am working with Senator Barbara Boxer to add an updated \nversion of this legislation to the stimulus package. Right now, the \nforeign subsidiaries of many U.S. companies are faring well overseas. \nCompetitive tax structures make it beneficial for those companies to \nkeep their money overseas. If they wanted to return the money to the \nUnited States, the companies would have to pay up to a 35-percent tax \nrate. That is not much of an incentive to bring income earned overseas \nback to the United States.\n  The proposal Senator Boxer and I have put forward gives businesses \nthe\n\n[[Page S1397]]\n\ntemporary relief they need. Instead of paying a 35-percent tax, they \nwill only pay a 5.25 percent tax if they bring the money back in the \nnext 12 months. These funds must be used for capital investment, job \ncreation and training, research and development, or U.S. debt \nreduction. Some economists predict that this time around, the \nlegislation would inject as much as $565 billion back into the United \nStates economy.\n  This legislation is critical in order to get this country going \nagain. It puts capital back into U.S. banks which can then loan that \nmoney to people and get the economy going again. Another proposal that \nI introduced--and I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee for \nworking with us on a compromise--deals with the cancellation of \nindebtedness. My proposal would allow businesses to buy back their debt \nin 2009 or 2010 without high tax consequences. It would help firms \ndeleverage and also give financial firms that hold debt more liquidity. \nHere is how my bill works. Under current law, if a company purchases \nits own debt at a discount, it is required to pay income tax on the \namount of the discount. If a business owes $1 million but negotiates a \ndiscounted amount to its lender--say $750,000 so that it does not \ndefault--it would have to pay taxes on the $250,000 difference.\n  Well, a lot of companies are strapped for cash and have a large \namount of debt. They cannot afford to pay taxes on the difference. \nInstead of paying that tax, we are going to delay that for 5 years. \nThey would then have an additional 5 years to be able to pay the taxes. \nThis is going to help small and large businesses across the United \nStates. I believe this proposal is going to help improve the debt \nsituation of many companies in the United States. I thank the chairman \nof the Finance Committee and Senator Conrad for working on this \nproposal.\n  So let me conclude. If we pass this $1.3 trillion spending bill, \nwhich is what it started at, we are going to have trillion-dollar debts \nover the next several years. This does not include another $500 billion \nin TARP funds that Secretary Geithner may be asking for.\n  We still have an omnibus spending bill to come before us. We still \nhave military supplemental bills. Unfortunately, they are not just \nmilitary bills. Everything else gets Christmas-treed on top of it. We \nare talking trillions and trillions of dollars.\n  I am looking at our Senate pages; the next generation to lead our \ncountry. Don't we care about them? Don't we have a moral responsibility \nnot to pass huge tax burdens on to them? Current calculations are, with \nthe debt we are running up, plus Medicare, Medicaid, and Social \nSecurity, they are going to have to pay close to a 90-percent tax rate \nif things are not changed. I do not think that is fair to them. Here we \njust pass debts on. I believe as a generation we are morally corrupt \nbecause we take whatever we want.\n  President Roosevelt talked about ``the forgotten man.'' What he was \ntalking about was this person who was forgotten during the depression. \nUnfortunately, we may be now dealing with a forgotten generation; a \ngeneration who does not have a voice in the Senate. We need to stand up \nand say, ``We cannot pass this kind of debt burden on to them.'' ``We \ncannot pass the kind of high taxes on to those who are going to be \nrequired to pay this debt.''\n  So, Mr. President, we need to act responsibly. We cannot put, as this \nbill does, $200 billion into new entitlement programs. We cannot raise \nthe baseline as this bill will end up doing. We know programs do not \nstop around here, so we need to act in a much more responsibly manner \nthan this bill does.\n  Yes, we want to act quickly, but there is a false deadline that has \nbeen put on this bill. There is still time. As we saw with TARP funds, \nwhen we do things too quickly around here, we make major mistakes. The \nfalse deadlines we put on this bill, I believe, are going to lead us \ndown the wrong road. So let's slow down. We do not get any trial runs \non this one. This bill is too big. Let's make sure we do this right. \nLet's join, not as Republicans and Democrats, but as Americans to get \nthis right.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER: The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 4:15 p.m. \ntoday, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Coburn amendment \nNo. 109; that prior to the vote in relation to the Coburn amendment, \nthere be 10 minutes equally divided and controlled between Senators \nCoburn and Baucus or their designees; provided further that the time \nuntil 4:05 p.m. be for debate with respect to the Mikulski amendment \nNo. 104, with the time equally divided and controlled in the usual \nform; that no amendments be in order to either amendment in this \nagreement; that at 4:15 p.m. the Senate proceed to vote as specified \nabove; that upon disposition of the Coburn amendment, and prior to the \nsecond vote, there be 2 minutes of debate, equally divided and \ncontrolled in the usual form; that upon the use of that time, the \nSenate proceed to vote in relation to the Mikulski amendment No. 104; \nwith the second vote 10 minutes in duration; and that the next \nDemocratic amendment be one offered by the Senator from California, \nMrs. Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am not going to speak about the \namendment I plan to offer in the next hour or so. But I really have to \nrespond to my friend, Senator Ensign. Ironically, he and I are offering \nan amendment together.\n  I have heard now several of my Republican friends come to the floor \nwith the same comments over and over and over again: Don't rush this \nbill. Well, if you came from my State--and I was a little shocked to \nhear Senator Ensign because his State is going through a terrible \ntime--where we have a 9.2-percent unemployment rate and jobs being lost \nevery minute, maybe you should look inside yourself and roll up your \nsleeves and get to work with us.\n  I find it extraordinary that after 8 long years of Republican rule \naround here, where we saw the debt go from $5 trillion to $10 trillion, \nand not a word from the other side about fiscal responsibility, with \ntax cut after tax cut to the wealthiest few, an unlimited checkbook for \nIraq--no problem then. We did not hear speeches about the grandchildren \nand the great-grandchildren. Oh, no. All of a sudden, when the middle \nclass is hurting, when the working poor are hurting, when people are \nlosing their homes--not the richest of the rich; they are fine; they do \nnot have mortgages--average families, suddenly my friends on the other \nside come out with their charts: Oh, my goodness, a trillion dollars of \nspending.\n  Well, we had a Presidential election about this issue, and I think it \nis safe to say the reason the results were as they were is because of \nthis economy. I do not think there is any pundit or even anyone in the \nSenate who would argue otherwise. Remember the turning point, when the \nRepublicans said: The fundamentals of our economy are strong? Well, \nmaybe they still feel that way. Why don't they come out and say that? \nThey do not want to say that because it is so obviously ridiculous when \nwe are losing 500,000 jobs a month. We have lost more jobs in the last \n2 months than there are people who live in the State of Delaware. This \nis where we are. So instead of working together, our friends on the \nother side come out, one after the other, with the same talking points: \nThe Democrats are irresponsible. Well, I ask: Who is irresponsible? \nPeople who want to work to ease the pain of what is happening in our \ncountry or people who brought us to this point, giving tax cuts to the \nmillionaires and the billionaires, and a war we never should have \nfought, and now they find their fiscal soul.\n\n  I am so disappointed. We have a President who has reached out to the \nother side, and all we get are speeches from talking points about why \nwe shouldn't act now. I will tell my colleagues, if this gets away from \nus, if we can't get the votes we need--we just need a couple of our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle--then this is going to be the \nparty of Herbert Hoover over there all over again, and people will come \nout in the streets, as they did during the Great Depression and said \nthings about Herbert Hoover that I can't repeat on this floor. People \nare hurting. They are two paychecks away from losing their homes. In \nsome communities in my State, one in four homes is underwater and is \nbeing foreclosed.\n  Now, is this bill perfect? Absolutely not. There are things in this \nbill I\n\n[[Page S1398]]\n\nwould vote to take out; there are a handful of things, a small \npercentage I would vote to take out. So if you want to work with us on \nthat, fine. But to come down to this floor and suggest that we are \nrushing through an emergency bill and that is wrong--it seems to me to \nbe coming from a list of talking points that don't mesh with reality. \nSo I hope we can change the tone of this debate.\n  The American people spoke out in November, and my friends on the \nother side are becoming the party of no: No, we can't do anything. No. \nAnd what do they come up with? Tax cuts for the wealthy again. That is \nwhat got us in this fiscal mess in the first place. We want to give tax \ncuts, as we do in this bill, to the middle class, to the working poor.\n  At this point, I would just say to my friends, look into your heart, \nlook into your soul, and look at reality.\n  I wish to say to my friend Senator Mikulski that I am proud to \nsupport her amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, a parliamentary inquiry before the \nSenator from Kansas speaks. Under the unanimous consent agreement, \nwhose time is now being used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Maryland is being \ncharged.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Did the Senator from California speak on my time as \nwell?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 5\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield the time to Senator Brownback to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the \nMikulski-Brownback amendment in the limited amount of time we have.\n  There has been a lot of criticism on the overall bill from my side of \nthe aisle. A lot of it is merited. I really do think this has been put \ntogether far too hurriedly, and it would be much better to follow the \nbusiness of having committee hearings. In the Appropriations Committee, \nwe had no hearings on this bill, and now we are moving forward with a \n$1 trillion bill. I don't think that makes much sense. I don't think it \nis wise. I don't think, looking at the economic problems we are looking \nat that could extend over a period of time, that it is wise to spend $1 \ntrillion without having really thought about it.\n  Be that as it may, the amendment I am talking about and supporting \nwith Senator Mikulski from Maryland is one of the sort of targeted \npieces of the legislation that I believe really could deliver lead on \nthe target, and that is why I am cosponsoring this amendment.\n  It would seem that one of the key things that has been emblematic of \nthis recession we are in is the lack of purchasing of durable goods; \ni.e., things such as cars have just fallen off precipitously, and \ntherefore the jobs supporting that industry have fallen off \nprecipitously. Here is the situation, what we are seeing.\n  This very simple amendment would make interest payments on car loans \nand sales excise taxes on cars tax deductible for new cars purchased \nthis year. So you make that interest payment tax deductible, the excise \ntaxes tax deductible, just this year. On an average car selling for \n$25,000, this provision would save the purchaser about $1,500. That is \nthe proverbial lead on the target, talking to the consumer and saying: \nIf you are in the market for a car, you ought to do it this year \nbecause you have a one-time benefit of $1,500, which is significant, \nwhich is going to help you. We think this is an amendment which will \nactually end up moving car sales, helping that industry, helping the \nautomobile manufacturers and the whole industry of dealerships move us \nforward.\n  This is the sort of spending we need to see taking place because the \nlack of economic activity is profound and widespread. We have seen it \nparticularly in the auto industry, and the auto industry is spread out \namongst a number of States. My State has a major GM plant and suppliers \nin it as well. They are not selling any cars. You can't operate a place \nvery long that way.\n  This is a very targeted, time-specific provision. The provisions we \nhave talked about need to be temporary, targeted, and really hit the \nmeasures, and this one does all of that.\n  I wish to also point out that in this amendment--I know some people \non the Finance Committee are looking at it and saying this is not \nsomething, perhaps, that we have supported or put forward. I would ask \npeople in this body to just look around at their own States and the car \nsales and the businesses they have and the auto plants they have and \nsee if this is something that can really help those auto plants move \nforward and get some sales.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of the time for my colleague who has put \nforward this amendment if she desires to speak any further for it while \nwe have that time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I was here when the Senator from \nCalifornia spoke. She didn't realize it was on my time, but the very \ngracious Senator from Mississippi has yielded me a few minutes of \nopposition time.\n  I think we all know the arguments, and I thank the Senator from \nKansas for arguing because it shows that this amendment is a bipartisan \namendment. What it does is actually create jobs or save jobs in the \nautomobile industry.\n  The amendment is simple and it is targeted and it is timely. My \namendment simply says if you buy a passenger car, minivan, or light \ntruck between November of last year and December 31 of 2009, you will \nget a tax deduction for your State sales or excise tax and the interest \non your loan. For the average consumer buying a vehicle of \napproximately $25,000, it would mean a $1,500 incentive.\n  Now, this is good for several reasons. First of all, No. 1, it really \nis prudent from a fiscal standpoint. The money does not leave the \nFederal checkbook or the Federal Treasury unless it goes to a person \nwho has actually bought a vehicle. So no money is spent or put into the \neconomy unless it is actually used in the economy to buy a car, \nminivan, or light truck.\n  It stimulates jobs because when you buy a car, it means, No. 1, \nsomebody had to make it; No. 2, somebody had to sell it, service it, \nand process the paperwork to do it, and there had to be suppliers to \nalso make sure that vehicle was fit for duty. We have in our automobile \nindustry 3 million people who are dependent on it up and down the \nchain, from manufacturing to sales to maintenance.\n  In my own home State, let's take the automobile dealer. There are \napproximately 700 dealers, and there are close to 3,000 dealers \nnationwide. Each dealer employs about 50 people, again, from the people \nwho sell them to the people who fix them. I have talked to people in my \nown State. The automobile dealers are, in some instances, the major \nemployer in rural parts of my State. If you talk to someone such as the \nauto mechanic, as I did in Bethesda, and other automobile mechanics, \nthey are proud of what they do. They fix those cars. They have them \nroad-ready. They see it as helping the environment, making sure people \nare safe in their vehicles and getting value for their dollar. We want \nthese small businesses to stay afloat.\n  That is why I think the Mikulski amendment is so specific. It only \napplies to the automobile industry.\n  No. 2, it is timely because it would immediately go into effect, and \nit is targeted and limited because it will only last until December 31, \n2009. If you really want to get America back on its wheels again and \nreally help America get rolling again, supporting the Mikulski \namendment will go a long way to do that.\n  Now, there are those who say: How much will this cost the Treasury? I \njust wish to bring to their attention that doing nothing will cost our \nTreasury: more expenditures on unemployment; the possibility that one \nof our manufacturers could go bankrupt and throw this into pension \nguarantee,\n\n[[Page S1399]]\n\nwhich would be a disaster; and in our local communities, the heartbreak \nthat would result from a shuttered dealership in a small town on the \nEastern Shore or in western Maryland would really be devastating. It \nwould hurt the consumer and hurt consumer confidence.\n  If you vote for the Mikulski amendment, supported by people on the \nother side of the aisle, I believe we can really get our economy going \nagain.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no time is yielded, the time will be equally charged to both \nsides.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Where are we?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The only time remaining on the Mikulski \namendment is under the control of the Republicans.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, might I ask the Senator from Mississippi \nfor 2 minutes?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if there is no one seeking recognition, I \nhave no objection to yielding back the time, but I wouldn't want to do \nit without consulting the distinguished Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I wish to speak for 2 minutes on the amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I deeply appreciate the Senator from \nMaryland offering an amendment. Just a couple of points. I am not going \nto make a big deal out of it. This amendment will cost about $11 \nbillion. It reminds me of several years ago when Congress eliminated \nthe interest deduction, consumer interest deduction. Why? Because there \nis so much consumer debt that is building up at such a rapid rate. The \ntotal consumer debt now is about $2.5 trillion. As a percentage of GDP, \nit is about 18 percent. There is a concern that this method, this way \nto help a specific industry is one which is going to add a lot of \nadditional consumer debt. It is also very costly debt at a time when \ndebt is becoming a problem in this country, public debt as well as \ncorporate debt, but also consumer debt.\n  There are also other provisions here which help the auto industry, \nwhich got about $13.4 billion in relief in the TARP legislation. \nThrough that, the 30-percent investment tax credit in this legislation \nwould help domestic auto companies in developing advanced technology. \nIn the TARP provisions, GM gets $9.4 billion and Chrysler gets about $4 \nbillion. Those are direct infusions into the industry. In addition, \nthere is $2 billion in grants for the manufacture of advanced batteries \nand components, and there are other provisions as well.\n  I am not in favor of the amendment. I think there are better ways to \nhelp the auto industry. This is not the best way, particularly given \nthe cost.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I rise not for purposes of debate but to add a \ncosponsor to my amendment. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Webb, \nthe Senator from Virginia, be listed as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak until \nSenator Coburn arrives. He is due to arrive in about a minute, at 4:05. \nWhen he arrives, I will turn it over to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is a letter from the Executive Office \nof the President, Peter Orszag, basically stating the economic need for \nthis legislation. I will read it in part:\n\n       Last week, we learned that domestic product shrank by 3.8 \n     percent in the fourth quarter of 2008, the largest decline in \n     26 years. . . . more jobs were lost last year than were lost \n     in any calendar year since 1945. . . . The American Recovery \n     and Reinvestment Act is a well-crafted response to our \n     economic difficulties.\n       . . . it is critical that we jumpstart job creation with a \n     direct fiscal boost that will help to lift the nation out of \n     this deep recession. The plan should bolster economic \n     activity sufficiently to save or create three to four million \n     jobs by the end of 2010. The plan you are considering is \n     estimated to meet this standard.\n\n  Mr. President, I will not ask unanimous consent to print the letter \nin the Record, because it has already been printed. I just wanted to \nread how many jobs were being lost.\n  Again, this is not the perfect solution. By definition, it is not. \nAll 535 Members of Congress have a different idea on how to do it, but \nthis is a good solution. The alternative is much worse. If this \nlegislation is not passed, more jobs, millions more, will be lost. \nCongress is going--the economy is going to be closer to the Great \nDepression of the 1930s. For that basic reason, let's get this \nlegislation passed at the appropriate time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that the time during the quorum \ncall be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 109\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wanted to respond to some comments by \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee. The explanation of why we have a \n$250 million earmark for the movie industry was that when we attempted \nto give them this earmark before, somebody took it out, and now we are \ngoing to put it back. The consequence, however, belies the fact that we \nare only doing this for 1 year. If it is something they deserve and it \nshould be equal, why wouldn't it be there every year?\n  The second point is that the movie industry gets to take advantage of \nevery depreciation out there that every other business has. There was \nsome debate in the House last year on whether they were truly \nmanufacturers. But they also now have $15 million for every movie in \ndirect writeoffs above their depreciation if they produce 75 percent of \nthose costs in this country. If they do it in a low employment area, \nthey get another $20 million. To say we are righting something that was \nwrong before doesn't fit with common sense. If we are righting it, \nlet's put it in forever--if that is what we are trying to do. But in \nthis bill we do it for 2009 only.\n  The second point I will make is that this bill is without any \nsacrifice. When President Obama was elected, one of the things he \ncampaigned on was an item-by-item look at the Federal budget, to get \nrid of programs that don't work, get rid of lower priority programs \nthat might work but are not efficient and are not a priority.\n  Nowhere in this bill is there an elimination of one Government \nprogram--not one. There is no line by line. There is no attempt to do \nwhat we are asking Americans to do every day. Here is\n\n[[Page S1400]]\n\nwhat we are asking them to do: We are in tough financial straits. Go \nthrough your budget, figure out what you cannot afford, and eliminate \nit.\n  We have not done that at all with this bill. There is no attempt to \nmake the Federal Government more efficient. This bill is filled with \nbloating bureaucracies, further lessening liberty and freedom by way of \nhaving bureaucracies decide what we will have to follow.\n  I am not against the movie industry. I love the movies they produce--\nthe vast majority; some I abhor. But I enjoy their entertainment and \nthe fact that they are profitable and viable. They have been very \nsuccessful this last year. They had the best January in their history. \nFor us to put a quarter of a billion dollars into an earmarked tax \nbenefit for the movie industry at a time when Americans are struggling \nbelies the honor and integrity of this institution.\n  With that, I retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, there have been several characterizations \nof this provision. It is not an earmark. It is treating all industries \nin America the same, giving bonus depreciation to all American \nindustries. It is treating them all the same.\n  A few years ago, this industry was taken out for inexplicable \nreasons. This bill puts them back in, in an attempt to treat all \nindustries the same. It makes no sense to take out one industry, when \nother industries get the benefit. It makes good sense to keep it in the \nbill so that all industries are treated the same.\n  The Senator said this is 1 year, or a short period of time. That is \ntrue for all industries in this bill. The bonus depreciation provision \nwe are talking about treats all industries equally, all for the same \nlength of time. He suggests that if we put it in, why isn't it \npermanent? He is probably right. A lot of it should be permanent, but \nwe have to pay for some of this. That is why it is not made permanent, \nas other provisions in the bill are not made permanent. So if all \nindustries are treated the same, the film industry is like the auto \nindustry and the steel industry, and other manufacturing industries; \nthey are all the same. That is why this provision is in here, to \ncorrect a measure taken out a while ago--wrongly--which singled out an \nindustry unfairly. This puts it back in so everybody is treated the \nsame.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator, if I am a manufacturer \nand I don't have $15 million that I can come up with in bonus \ndepreciation, do I still get to write off $15 million?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. There is in this legislation--first, this is treating all \nindustries the same. Some industries are in a loss position and some \nindustries are in a profit position. If a company is in a loss \nposition, there are other provisions in the Tax Code--which, again, all \nindustries should be treated the same. If you have a loss 1 year, you \ncan benefit from the provisions, with the loss carryback provisions, \nand the legislation has credits, carrybacks.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, let me reclaim my time. The fact is, this \nis a tremendous advantage to them compared to other businesses. They \nalready have a program from which they get $15 million. Then they can \nadd another $20 million. The average cost for a film is less than 100 \nmillion bucks. We are writing off $35 million out of the Tax Code \nimmediately before this provision even begins, and we are going to add \nanother quarter of a billion dollars this year for just 2009, which \nwould say we are going to treat them differently than we treat \neverybody else in this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 30 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, a very quick point. This section in the \nbill does provide a $15 million writeoff, but that is for small films. \nUnder the provisions of the bill, the bonus depreciation cannot be \ntaken up at the same time as the expensing provision. You get one or \nthe other.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to Coburn amendment No. 109. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate prior to the vote on the Mikulski amendment.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the time has now come to vote on the \nMikulski amendment that gives a tax break to people who go buy a car on \nwhich they can take a tax deduction on their interest and on their \nsales tax. It actually creates jobs by having people buy a car, sell a \ncar, service a car, and make a car.\n  Three million jobs are at stake in the automobile industry, and I \nurge the adoption of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Maryland always \nthinks things through very well, but I am going to rise in opposition. \nI don't do it easily. But this is a time when we are in a recession. I \nknow the motivation is to help us get out of a recession, but we have a \nmassive amount of increase in consumer debt, and this is going to just \nencourage more consumer debt.\n  We have other things in the Tax Code that help people who buy hybrid \ncars and electric cars, and we have incentives for the automobile \nindustry within TARP. So I have to oppose this, and in opposing it, I \nwill do it this way, by raising the point of order against the Mikulski \namendment pursuant to section 201(a) of Senate Concurrent Resolution 21 \nof the 110th Congress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I move to waive the applicable sections \nof the Budget Act, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n104.\n  The amendment (No. 104) was agreed to.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am not going to be laying down an amendment \nat this time but, rather, speaking generally about the legislation \nwhile another amendment is being prepared. I wanted to share some data \nthat we became aware of today, a new Gallup poll, which confirms what \nsome of us thought, which is the more the American people see about \nthis stimulus bill, the angrier they are getting and the more they \nbelieve it is both wasteful and ineffective. It is interesting that \nonly 38 percent of the American people support this bill as written, \nwhile 54 percent say it needs major changes or should be scrapped \nentirely. In other words, 54 percent of the American people are in \nagreement that this bill should not move forward as it is, that it \nneeds major changes. That is what Republicans are proposing with the \nbetter ideas that we want to present during this debate.\n  It is interesting as well that Independents, who were queried by even \ngreater numbers, believe the bill either needs major changes or should \nbe rejected outright. Fifty-six percent of Independents concur with \nthat. Most Americans said they think the stimulus package either will \nnot have any effect on their personal lives or will have a negative \neffect on their personal lives. A mere 12 percent said it would make \ntheir lives a lot better. That is the point that many of us have been \nmaking. People need something that will make their lives better. They \nare hurting all over this country. It is a shame, when we have an \nopportunity to do something about it, to waste a trillion dollars that \nwe do not have and that our children and grandchildren are going to \nhave to pay back for something that will not achieve its objectives.\n  What I would like to do is speak to some of the problems with the \nbill that we believe will not work, will not stimulate the economy, \nwill not create jobs, and some of the areas that are simply wasteful \nWashington spending.\n  We have heard of some of these items. Again, many of these items the \nbill spends money on have an argument for them. But it is our view they \nshould go to the Appropriations Committee, and they should present \nthese programs to compete with all of the other programs which may also \nhave degrees of worthiness. When the Appropriations Committee says: \nHere is the top line of the budget for each of our Government \ndepartments, then compete within that line for the program you want to \nspend your money on. If you are worthy enough, then you will get \nfunded. If you are not, you won't. This bill simply takes all comers \nand says: Let's put it in a so-called stimulus bill, whether it has any \nstimulative effect or not. I will give a couple examples.\n  More cars for government employees; this is another bailout for the \nauto industry. We are going to do trail maintenance for ATVs. Maybe \nthat is a good idea. But that should probably compete in the budget \nthat ordinarily it would be funded from. I know one of my colleagues is \nvery strongly committed to the idea that we should provide some funding \nfor Filipino veterans of World War II who assisted our troops. That may \nbe a very worthy objective, but nobody can argue it belongs in this \nbill. Those are folks in the Philippines. It is not going to create \nAmerican jobs or stimulate the American economy. We could go on and on \nwith other examples. The point is, this is more wasteful Washington \nspending.\n  American taxpayers are not against paying taxes, not against having \nthe Government spend money if necessary, but they don't want us to \nwaste the money. When we have a crisis on our hands, when they need \nhelp, to have us then just take the 8 years' worth of things we would \nlove to do and haven't been able to get approval for yet and tuck them \ninto this bill as spending and call it stimulus is bad policy.\n  Abraham Lincoln had a great saying: If you call a tail a leg, how \nmany legs does a dog have? Of course, the answer is four. Calling it a \nleg doesn't make it a leg. That is the point. Calling these things \nstimulus doesn't make them stimulus. They should not be in this bill.\n  There are other things that suggest the bill would not work. We have \nhad experience with this before. The centerpiece of the tax item in the \nbill is a tax rebate. Never mind that 26 percent of the people who \nreceive this tax rebate don't pay Federal income taxes. The problem is, \nthe same kind of tax rebate in the amount of $600 last year did very \nlittle to stimulate the economy, even though that is why it was done. \nAll economists agree that somewhere between 10 and 20 percent of the \nmoney got spent, and the rest of it was plowed into savings. The \nreality is, that is a good thing because Americans' personal budgets \nare overleveraged just as our businesses are. People have far too much \ndebt on their credit cards, for example. They need to be getting that \ndebt paid down and begin saving a little more. So it is no wonder they \nwould take these tax rebates and put them in the bank or pay off a \ncredit card rather than going out and spending. That is a good thing \nfor them personally, and it is what we have to have happen for the \nrecession to finally end.\n  But in terms of stimulating spending, it is not a good thing. It \nobviously does not stimulate spending. Martin Feldstein, who actually \ntestified before the Finance Committee in favor of the last stimulus, \nhas now written that, of course, the experts who predicted it would not \nwork were correct, it did not work. He is now very much of the view \nthat we should not repeat that mistake in trying to stimulate the \neconomy. The problem is, we are talking about well over $100 billion \nwhich, therefore, will not achieve the purpose of stimulation.\n  So these are why, when the American people see money being spent on \nthings that have no business in this bill--it is more wasteful \nWashington spending--when they see huge amounts of money going toward \nan effort to create jobs that would not do that, they scratch their \nheads and say: Why are these politicians in Washington wasting an \nopportunity to help us? Why don't they really get to something that \nwill help us?\n  There are things that can help. Republicans have some better ideas \nabout how to craft this legislation so it will actually achieve the \nobjective we want. The bottom line is, rather than spending $1.3 \ntrillion on this bill, we should\n\n[[Page S1402]]\n\nbe providing tax incentives that will create jobs. We should use the \nTax Code to encourage beneficial behavior to encourage people to work \nand save and invest and create jobs. That leads me to the next subject.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle like to say that a \nsignificant percentage, maybe 36 percent, of this bill is taxes. Again, \nwhat is tax relief? I don't think you can call tax relief rebates when \nthey are scored by the joint legislative committee as spending. So we \nhave a difference of opinion. Even if only a quarter of it is tax \npolicy, what kind of tax policy is that? Mr. President, 2.3 percent of \nthe amount of the total bill is spent on tax incentives for businesses \nso they can write off their equipment purchases and so on that might \nconceivably enable them to hire more people. That is inadequate. One of \nour better ideas is to enhance those current provisions, expand them so \nthat more businesses will be able to hire more people and produce more \nand thus help us to get out of the recession.\n\n  There are a variety of ideas that will be presented as amendments. \nOne of them is an idea that some of our House colleagues have: by \nsimply reducing by 7 percentage points the tax that small businesses \npay, we believe significant new jobs will be created because small \nbusinesses create the jobs. Big businesses are trying to hold their own \nright now, but they are losing jobs, and they have not been the job \ncreators. It is the small businesses that have historically created \njobs. We believe that reducing their tax liability just by this modest \n7 points--talking about businesses with 500 or fewer employees--you \nwill have thousands and thousands of employers who will be able to buy \nthe new equipment, be able to market their product or in some way be \nincented to hire additional people. That is how we create more jobs.\n  We think we ought to focus on where this problem started and where a \nsignificant part of the problem remains, and that is in housing. In \nfact, housing values are continuing to decline. We know the collapse in \nthe housing market is what started all of this. But there is nothing \nthat goes to the heart of that problem which remains.\n  In Arizona, we continue to see housing values decline. I talked to \nrealtors and others last weekend. In some cases, over 50 percent of \nwhat they are doing is foreclosures and short sales in anticipation of \nforeclosure. So the market is in very bad shape. One of the Republican \nideas--in fact, we have a couple of different approaches--is trying to \nprovide a floor so housing values don't decline any more, so that \npeople are incented to either refinance their existing mortgage or to \nbe able to afford a new mortgage, and at the same time that this would \nhelp individuals put more money in their pockets. Because of the \nsavings they would achieve with a lower interest rate mortgage over 30 \nyears, it would also help to clear up the problem we have all heard \nabout in the secondary market, the so-called toxic assets backed by \nmortgage-backed securities, the value of which nobody apparently can \nfigure out.\n  If most of the people would refinance their existing mortgages at a \nlower rate, say, 4.2 percent, all of the holders of those mortgages \nwould be paid off. They would all have cash. They could either reloan \nit or they could prop up their balance sheets. All of this would be \nvery helpful, and we would then know exactly what is left.\n  What is left are the toxic mortgages, and there are other programs \nthat will be dealing with that. I believe the President's Treasury \nSecretary, Secretary Geithner, is poised to talk about that next week. \nThere are other plans the FDIC and others have. Certainly, the TARP \nfunding that has been voted on is supposed to help go to those toxic \nassets, the people who are allegedly underwater; that is to say, the \nvalue of their home is less than the amount they owe on their mortgage.\n  It is really a two-part problem. The Republican ideas are designed to \nget at that problem, the problem that caused this whole collapse in the \nfirst place. Most experts believe it has to be solved before we can \ngenuinely begin to work our way out.\n  There is another problem with the bill; that is, there is bad policy \nin this bill. For example, on the infrastructure, we have Davis-Bacon \nrequirements. This adds to the cost of all of these projects. I \nremember a few years ago in the little town of Sierra Vista in \nsoutheast Arizona there was a facility to help women with dependent \nchildren or families that needed aid. If they had built the structure \nto do this, they couldn't afford it because of the additional cost that \nDavis-Bacon imposes on wages to construct a building. So they bought a \nmobile home instead, and because they were buying a mobile home, it \nwasn't a construction cost. They saved thousands of dollars on the \nfacility.\n  Was it best to have a mobile home for this facility? No, it wasn't. \nThey should have had an actual building. That is the problem with this \nparticular policy. I forget the amount of money that it cost, but it is \nsignificant.\n  On health policy, there is the comparative effectiveness research \nwhich, in an op-ed in the Washington Post last Friday, George Will \ncommented would dramatically advance Government control and rationing \nof health care. This is not good policy.\n  There is the neighborhood stabilization plan, $2.25 billion. This is \nthe same kind of funding that could go to entities like ACORN, which we \nstopped when we dealt with this last June in the housing legislation. \nBut it is tucked into this legislation, it is a lot of money, it is bad \npolicy, and it ought to be taken out.\n\n  The Washington Post, last Friday, editorialized about the education \nexpenditures here. They said: Ordinarily, we would support more money \nto support education, but this is a wasted opportunity to reform \neducation so that we can actually use this new money to better benefit. \nOtherwise, we are simply throwing more money at the problem. Part of \nthe quotation from the Washington post was we ``will be wasting more \nthan money.'' What they meant was the opportunity. There is an \nopportunity here to really do some good, and rather than just throw \nmore money at a problem, why don't we take advantage of the opportunity \nto really do something to reform it?\n  This gets me back to the point with regard to how these bills should \ncompete in the appropriations process. We have a process--it is well \nestablished in the House and in the Senate--to deal with competing \nappropriations. They go over these bills very carefully. Ordinarily, \nthey have to make some tough choices, to say: This program will go into \nthe bill, and this one, unfortunately, is going to have to wait for \nanother year or it is going to have to be reformed before we are going \nto spend the money. That regular-order process is what we should be \nusing in this case.\n  This bill creates something like 34 new Government programs. Now, \nthose two are the kinds of things that are scrubbed carefully in the \nregular appropriations process. Ronald Reagan once said: The closest \nthing to immortality in Washington is a new Government program. Once \ncreated, it is awfully hard to get rid of.\n  Of course, there is a lot more mandatory spending in the bill, \nspending that allegedly exists for only 2 years, but actually we know \nthere is no way after 2 years Congress is going to come back and cut. \nIn fact, going back to the so-called make work pay credit--this $500-\nper-taxpayer rebate--most of the experts agree this temporary tax \nrebate is not going to change behavior and stimulate spending.\n  So what is the answer? Well, of course--wink, wink, nod, nod--it is \nreally going to be permanent. Now, nobody wants to put that on paper \nbecause the score, the cost, would be astronomical. This body would be \nembarrassed to pass it, and it would not pass it. But once it is in \nthere for 2 years, do we think we are going to eliminate it? No. In \nfact, the authors of it justify it, saying: Well, it actually will work \nbecause it is not really going to be temporary. We are really going to \nmake it permanent. That is what we have to be very careful of in this \nlegislation--committing ourselves to hundreds of billions of new \nexpenditures, ostensibly temporary--some not even ostensibly temporary; \nthey are actually identified as mandatory spending for the next 10 \nyears--but many of them ostensibly temporary but will, in fact, be a \npermanent program.\n  One of the reasons I believe the program will not work is because \nless than half of all the discretionary funding is spent by the year \n2011. Now, I hope by\n\n[[Page S1403]]\n\nthe year 2011 this recession is over. But you cannot call it a stimulus \nwhen more than half of the discretionary spending does not even begin \nto be spent until the year 2011.\n  So another one of the Republican ideas, that of my colleague, John \nMcCain, is to say: Look, you have to spend this within this period of \ntime. If you do not, then that authority lapses, and we are not going \nto spend that money. I think that is a very sensible way to look at it.\n  Just one other comment on the tax title. We talk about the extension \nof these energy tax credits. Apparently, windmills did not get enough \nin the way of tax credits, so we are going to extend their tax credit \nfor another 3 years. You can argue whether that is good policy, but you \ncannot very well argue that extending it beyond 1 year is immediate \nspending. By definition, you are talking about the second and third \nyear.\n  On this point, Dr. Christina Romer, who is President Obama's head of \nthe Council of Economic Advisors, and, by the way, at last count, about \n320 other economists, including some Nobel laureates, has made the \npoint that tax cuts are far more effective in this environment than is \nadditional Government spending. To this, I just have to say, this \nappears to be a new concept here in trickle-down economics, where the \nGovernment will spend close to a trillion dollars--just get it out \nthere--and hopefully some of it will trickle down to regular people. \nThat is not the best way to help people who are hurting in this \neconomy.\n  So we have talked about things that will not work in the bill. We \nhave talked about excess spending in the bill. We have talked about \nthings that are not going to really stimulate the economy or create \nmore jobs. In fact, the cost of the jobs, if you just take the cost of \nthe bill and the number of jobs created, according to estimates of the \nsponsors of the bill, for each Government job created, it is $646,000. \nThat is a lot of money to create a job; in the private sector, \n$242,000. This is not an efficient, effective program, and I do not \nbelieve we can afford a $1.3 trillion mistake, especially since we are \nplaying with the money our children and grandchildren are going to have \nto pay back.\n  Let's eliminate the wasteful spending, and let's deal with the things \nthat have to be dealt with first, such as the housing crisis, and \ncreate tax policy that will make sense long into the future and will \nactually help businesses create more jobs to help the people of our \ncountry today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 101, as Modified, to Amendment No. 98\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 101 and send a \nmodification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], for himself \n     and Mr. Durbin, proposes an amendment numbered 101, as \n     modified, to amendment No. 98.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe modified amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide an additional $6,500,000,000 to the National \n             Institutes of Health for biomedical research)\n\n       On page 130, line 3, insert after the period the following: \n     ``The additional amount available for `Office of the \n     Director' in the previous sentence shall be increased by \n     $6,500,000,000: Provided, That a total of $7,850,000,000 \n     shall be transferred pursuant to such sentence: Provided \n     further, That any amounts in this sentence shall be \n     designated as an emergency requirement and necessary to meet \n     emergency needs pursuant to section 204(a) of S. Con. Res. 21 \n     (110th Congress) and section 301(b)(2) of S. Con. Res. 70 \n     (110th Congress), the concurrent resolutions on the budget \n     for fiscal years 2008 and 2009: Provided further, That the \n     amount under the heading `State Fiscal Stabilization Fund' \n     under the heading `DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION' in title XIV \n     shall be decreased by $6,500,000,000.''.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. The basic amendment calls for the addition of $6.5 \nbillion to the National Institutes of Health, and the modification \nprovides for an offset from the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund.\n  Before proceeding directly to the discussion on the amendment, a few \nobservations about the bill generally: I believe an economic stimulus \nis necessary. We have seen the unemployment rate rise to 7.2 percent \nlast month. Some 2.8 million people lost their jobs last year. Each day \nbrings new reports of additional people losing their jobs. We know the \nsafety net is failing. We know there is a need to liberalize bank \ncredit, the foreclosure rate is very high, and there is a need to \nprovide Government intervention to stop the foreclosures. In the midst \nof all of these issues, there is, admittedly, the need for a stimulus \npackage.\n  I am concerned about the House bill in a number of respects. I \nbelieve, for example, there is insufficient money in infrastructure. \nPennsylvania Governor Rendell has assured me that the spending on \nhighways, bridges, and roads could begin within a period of some 6 \nmonths.\n  There needs to be more on the tax cut side, in my opinion. There are \nmany programs in the stimulus package which are very good programs--\nprograms which I have fought for during my tenure as chairman or \nranking member of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nSubcommittee--but many of these belong, really, in the appropriations \nprocess as opposed to a stimulus.\n  It is my hope, as we work our way through the bill, that the bill \nwill be improved. I would like to see a bill emerge from the Senate \nthat would be really directed toward stimulus, a bill which I could \nenthusiastically support.\n  The amendment which is offered here today is for the National \nInstitutes of Health, which has been starved recently. During the \ndecade when I chaired the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education, with the support of the ranking member, \nSenator Harkin--who is now chairman, and I am ranking member; and when \nSenator Harkin and I shift chairmanship, it is a seamless transfer; we \nwork together on a partnership, bipartisan basis--together we took the \nlead in increasing NIH funding from $12 billion to $30 billion. Some \nyears, the increases were as high as $3 billion, $3.5 billion. Lately, \nwith the budget crunch, that has been impossible to maintain.\n  The cost-of-living adjustments have not been made, and there have \nbeen across-the-board cuts, so there has been an actual decline of some \n$5.2 billion of NIH funding in the last 7 years. This $10 billion \nallocation, if enacted, would correct that. It would give a boost and \nwould provide jobs, high-paying jobs, at a time when the passage of the \namendment would kill two birds with one stone. It would stimulate the \neconomy by producing good, high-paying jobs, and by reducing major \nillnesses, which I will specify in a few moments, it would cut the cost \nof health care. What better way to reduce health care costs than to \nprevent illness, prevent heart disease, reduce the time of Alzheimer's, \nand cut back on the incidence of cancer? The statistics show there \nwould be good-paying jobs created by this $10 billion. According to NIH \nActing Director Dr. Raynard Kington, the $10 billion would result in \nthe creation of some 70,000 jobs over the next 2 years. These funds \ncould go out in a range of 6 to 9 months, and certainly in less than a \nyear, so it has the impact of being very promptly disseminated.\n  The benefits are statistically demonstrable by the high costs \nassociated with diseases which these funds are designed to cure or to \nameliorate. For example, the annual cost associated with cardiovascular \ndisease amounts to $448.5 billion a year; cancer, $219 billion a year; \nAlzheimer's, $148 billion; and so it goes on down the line.\n  The recent statistics show significant improvements on these \nmaladies, I think attributable, fairly, to the advances by NIH \nresearch.\n  For example, between 1994 and the year 2004, the number of deaths \nfrom coronary heart disease declined by 18 percent and the stroke death \nrate fell by 24 percent. Were it not for groundbreaking research on the \ncauses and treatment of heart disease, supported in large part by NIH, \nheart attacks would most probably account for\n\n[[Page S1404]]\n\nan estimated 1.6 million deaths per year instead of the approximately \n440,000 deaths experienced last year in 2008.\n  The absolute number of cancer deaths in the United States has \ndeclined 3 years in a row despite the growth and aging of our \npopulation, which is a truly unprecedented event in medical history. \nThe 5-year survival rate for localized breast cancer has increased from \n80 percent in the 1950s to 98 percent today. That is a pretty \nencouraging figure for people who have breast cancer or are fearful of \ngetting breast cancer. For childhood cancers, the 5-year survival rate \nhas improved from less than 50 percent in 1970 to 80 percent today. The \n5-year survival rate for Hodgkin's lymphoma has increased from 40 \npercent in 1963 to more than 86 percent in the year 2003. For non-\nHodgkin's lymphoma, the survival rate has increased from 31 percent in \n1963 to 63.8 percent in 2003. Over the past 25 years, the 5-year \nsurvival rate for prostate cancer has increased from 69 percent to \nalmost 99 percent. Now, if you take anybody who is in the category of \nbreast cancer or prostate cancer or Hodgkins or non-Hodgkins, those \nsurvival figures are very encouraging. I didn't know--when I joined the \nAppropriations Committee and selected the Subcommittee on Labor, \nHealth, Human Services and Education and led the fight with Senator \nHarkin to increase NIH funding from $12 billion to $30 billion and to \nhave the National Cancer Institute funded by $5 billion--I didn't know \nI would one day be standing on the floor of the Senate citing \nstatistics which include me. When we talk about non-Hodgkins, that is \nArlen Specter. I was shocked in February of 2005 to find that I had \nnon-Hodgkins; tough chemotherapy, recovery, lost all my hair, got it \nall back, and fine. Then, last year, I had a recurrence; more \nchemotherapy, more rehabilitation, maintained my Senate duties, was on \nthe floor, presided over the confirmation hearings of two Supreme Court \nJustices in 2005, worked with Senator Harkin, right down the line. So \nthose are pretty important statistics if you are one of them--if you \nare one of them.\n\n  It is my opinion that it is scandalous in this country that we \nhaven't done more by way of combating these illnesses. I requested an \nestimate from the cancer community of what it would take to make a \nmajor attack to virtually cure cancer. We can't talk about curing \ncancer, but the kind of a major attack which would reduce cancer very \nmaterially. We got back a figure of $335 billion over 15 years. Well, \nthose are big numbers, but they would pay off in very substantial \nrewards when you consider the cost of cancer is over $200 billion a \nyear. The cost of heart disease is almost $450 billion a year. There \nare ways and economies within the Federal budget to deal with those \nissues.\n  Today we are talking about a much lesser figure. We are talking about \n$10 billion. That would be a downpayment and a sign of a serious effort \nto go after these maladies. When you have a stimulus package of $819 \nbillion in the House bill--it may go up higher than that--this is a \nrelatively small sum. When we structured the original bill at $3.5 \nbillion, we talked about what would be doable. We came up with $6.5 \nbillion. I am not sure that we didn't make a mistake, that we ought to \nbe looking for more of the $800 billion plus to deal with these \nmaladies, but at any rate, that is where we are.\n  Senator Harkin and I have a little difference of opinion on the \nfunding as to whether there ought to be an offset. My view is it is a \nminor difference of opinion, but one which we are going to present to \nthe body for a vote. In looking over the allocation of the entire \nbudget, I found there is $79 billion in what is called a State fiscal \nstabilization fund. Well, I think there are limits as to how we ought \nto go on stabilizing the States' fiscal policy, but at any rate, \nincluded in that amount is $24.7 billion to be used for a wide range of \npublic safety and other governmental services which may include \neducation or may not include education. All of these funds are proposed \nto go out under a population-based formula, but are in no way targeted \nto States with the biggest economic problems or greatest budget \nshortfalls.\n  It is unclear what stimulating effect this funding would have, and \nthe purposes of the funding are undefined. So when you have almost $25 \nbillion with the purposes of the funding undefined, it seems to me it \nis a much better use of that money, about a quarter of it, to fund the \n$6.5 billion which is the subject of the amendment which I have just \ndescribed.\n  Senator Harkin and I have discussed this in an amiable way, as we \nalways do. He is going to speak next and is going to propose a second-\ndegree amendment so that there not be the offset. I have already stated \nmy preference to have an offset because we are dealing with very \nserious deficit problems, and I thought that if it were possible to do \nthis funding with an offset which was reasonable, it would be \npreferable than adding to the deficit. But if Senator Harkin prevails \non his second-degree amendment and there is no offset, so be it, and we \nwill have reached the core principle of trying to get these funds into \nthe National Institutes of Health.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, first, let me thank my friend and my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, for his continued support \nof basic research, biomedical research in this country. Ever since I \nfirst got on this committee back in 1988, Senator Specter, of course, \nwas chair and I was ranking member, and later I became chair and he \nbecame ranking member, and then he became chair and I became ranking \nmember. It has passed back and forth a lot of times since 1988. But the \none person who has always been consistent in his support of biomedical \nresearch and support for the National Institutes of Health has been my \nfriend, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.\n  I support his amendment, I wish to say right off the bat. Everything \nthat is in it I support. We do have to bring NIH back up to its funding \nlevel. I say to my friend, one of my proudest achievements in the \nSenate was working with the Senator from Pennsylvania to double the \nfunding of NIH over a 5-year period. To show my colleagues how \nbipartisan it was, it started under a Democratic President and ended \nunder a Republican President. There was one change in there for a \ncouple years when I was chair and the Senator from Pennsylvania was \nranking member and then it went back and forth, but as the Senator \nsaid, that has always been kind of seamless in terms of passing the \ngavel back and forth. But doubling the funding for NIH over 5 years was \na Herculean task and the Senator from Pennsylvania was a leader in that \neffort. We worked hard on that, and we got it done. That was in 2003.\n  Now, since 2003, we are 10 percent lower now in real funding for NIH \nthan we were in 2003. I am sure my friend from Pennsylvania would agree \nthat we did not work hard on both sides of the aisle and with two \ndifferent administrations to get this done only to have it sort of sit \nthere static, and then come back 10 years later or something, and then \nhave to double it again. Our goal was to get NIH back up to a funding \nlevel so that the number of peer-reviewed grants that were funded would \nbe closer to the 1-in-3, 1-in-2, 1-in-3 area that it had been in the \nearlier days of NIH. By the time we got to the point where we started \nthe doubling--and that was in 1998, if I am not mistaken; it might have \nbeen 1999, 1998--we were down to where 1 in 10, 1 in 8 peer-reviewed \ngrants were being funded. Sad to say, we are right back almost to that \nsituation again. We are down to where maybe somewhere between 1 in 6 \nand 1 in 10 grants are being funded.\n  Now, what does that mean? That means researchers at NIH--let me back \nup here. That means that researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, \nat the University of Iowa, at the University of California, at \nuniversities in New York State, universities in Florida, universities \nin Illinois, universities in Wyoming, universities in Arizona, every \nState in the Nation gets funding through the NIH for research. These \nare universities, basically. So this funding goes all over the country.\n  So what does that mean, that we are now back at the level where 1 out \nof 6 to 1 out of 10 peer-reviewed grants are being funded? Well, what \nit means is that young researchers--and these are people who are at the \ntop of their class; these are the brightest of the bright;\n\n[[Page S1405]]\n\nthese are students who have gone through either medical school or \ngenetics or biomedicine or biology, a lot of different disciplines \ninvolved here, and they have some ideas they want to pursue, some basic \nresearch they want to pursue. They are in their twenties. They spent a \nlot of money going to college. They want to pursue a field of inquiry. \nNow they are told that the average age for getting their first grant is \n42 years of age.\n  Well, if you are a young person and you are just out of college, are \nyou going to wait around until you are 42? No. You are probably going \nto go to work for the private sector, private industry some place.\n  So what we are doing is we are losing a lot of bright young \nresearchers. When we doubled the funding for NIH, a lot of young \nresearchers started there, and they are there now, but we are losing a \nwhole other generation of these young researchers. So that is the \neffect of what has happened at NIH.\n  What it means also is that we are losing our preeminent role in the \nworld as the leader in biomedical research. We have to maintain it. We \nhave always been sort of--if you want to talk about a city on a hill, \nwhen it comes to biomedical research, we have always been that to the \nrest of the world. The rest of the world looks to NIH. Keep in mind it \nwas through the NIH that we mapped and sequenced the entire human \ngenome, mapped and sequenced the entire human gene. Guess what. It is \nout there for researchers all over the world. Any researcher anywhere \nin the world can tap into the database at NIH and find out all the \ninformation they want on the genetic structure and use that for their \nresearch. Guess what. It is free of charge. Free of charge. That was a \ngreat investment by the taxpayers of this country and already paying \nbig dividends.\n  So it pains me, I know as it pains my friend from Pennsylvania, to \nnow see NIH going back down again in terms of its support. As I said, \nright now, NIH funding has dropped more than 10 percent in real terms \nsince 2003. That was at the end of the doubling period.\n  Some people might say, Well, what does this have to do with stimulus? \nWell, this does stimulate the economy, both in the short term and in \nthe long term. As I have said many times about this stimulus bill, it \nis two things. One, it is to, yes, put people to work right away. That \nhas to do with a lot of the construction projects that are in here. But \nthere are a lot of other things in this bill that provide for a \nfoundation for solid recovery down the pike--2 years, 5 years, 10 years \nfrom now. Now, every time in the short term, when we think about NIH in \nthe short term, every time a researcher gets a grant, it supports an \naverage of seven jobs. Let me repeat that. Every time a researcher gets \na grant, on average, it supports seven jobs. So it is not just one \nresearcher in a lab by himself or herself; it is lab technicians, \npostoperative fellows, research assistants, and on and on. So there is \na great multiplier effect.\n  There is also a ripple effect from this research. Keep in mind this \nis basic research. These are asking the most fundamental of questions.\n  Well, maybe the grant has led to basic research that will lead to a \nnew compound that a pharmaceutical company wants to develop into a new \ndrug that helps save lives. Senator Specter talked about the research \nat NCI, National Cancer Institute, and the great strides they have \nmade. The Senator is living proof of that. We watched the Senator go \nthrough a long hard period, and it is wonderful to see him here as \nhealthy, vibrant, and determined as ever to make sure we fund NIH. He \nis living proof of the great strides we have made. So that has a ripple \neffect. If there is more money now in the economy, maybe an \nentrepreneur will use some breakthrough on research to form a spin-off \ncompany. That happens all the time, and that stimulates the economy.\n  As I said, this money goes to researchers all over the country, not \njust to Bethesda, MD, where the headquarters is. Very little of it goes \nthere. It goes to every State--to 90 percent of all congressional \ndistricts. So it helps the entire country.\n  Now, that is in the short term. There is a longer term benefit, which \nis improving people's health. After all, that is the purpose of this \nresearch in the first place. It is called the National Institutes of \nHealth, not the National Institutes of Biomedical Research. The goal is \nhealth. In the long term, it is going to be a healthier workforce, \nhealthier people, cutting down on health care costs, making people more \nproductive in their lives because of the research we do through NIH. We \nalways say ``at,'' but it is ``through'' NIH. If our workers are \nhealthier, they are going to be more productive.\n  Again, I support this amendment almost in its entirety--except for \nthe way we are going to fund it. My friend spoke about that, and I have \na small disagreement. The Senator's amendment would take the money as \nan offset out of what is called the State fiscal stabilization fund. \nHere is the problem as I see it.\n  The State fiscal stabilization fund provides critically needed \nfunding for education. Just this afternoon, I had the presidents of \nmost of the independent colleges in my State visiting me. A lot of this \nmoney will go to help them in their colleges. It will help our \ncommunity colleges. A lot of money will go to community colleges to \nhelp retrain workers for the future. Our pre-K through 12th grade money \ncomes from the stabilization fund. There is a lot of money in that \nstabilization fund that goes for public safety and other government \nservices. We don't need to be laying off teachers. We need to keep our \nteachers hired.\n  That is what this money would go for. So I don't think we ought to be \ncutting into that fund. I strongly support Senator Specter's \namendment--the main purpose of it--to increase funding for NIH. Again, \nI just have a slight difference on how it should be funded. Let's face \nit, this whole bill is emergency spending. We are up to about $900 \nbillion right now. As I have said before, a lot of economists, both \nliberal and conservative, have said we are not doing enough. We had \nMilton Friedman, President Reagan's economist, a very conservative \neconomist, who said we may not be doing enough; Alan Blinder, Mark \nZandi--a broad spectrum of economists are saying this is one time when \nwe should err on the upside not the downside.\n  If this whole bill is emergency spending, why, I ask, should the \nfunding for NIH not be the same? Why would we want to take it out of \neducation, take it out of public safety, out of other areas to pay for \nNIH. This whole bill is emergency spending. Quite frankly, I think it \nought to be. We are in an emergency. Things are going downhill very \nrapidly in this country--in my State, and I know in every other State. \nCompanies are shedding jobs every day--9,000 every day.\n  Since the whole bill is emergency spending, I think NIH ought to be \nright in there with everything else. It is that important. I think it \nought to be emergency funding, so I have a second degree that I will be \noffering to the amendment by the Senator from Pennsylvania that would \nbasically make the funding for the amendment the same as everything \nelse in this bill. I hope we will get support for that. Why \ndiscriminate against NIH? Don't do that. Put it in with everything \nelse.\n  With that I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague for \nhis kind remarks and comments and a reaffirmation of what I said about \nthe working relationship we had, the partnership, and the seamless \ntransfer of the gavel.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 178 to Amendment No. 101\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield, I thought the Senator's \namendment was not yet at the desk. I am informed it is.\n  I send my second-degree amendment to the desk and ask for its \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 178 to amendment No. 101.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, to continue with the two amendments, \nperhaps we can have side-by-side votes. Is that satisfactory to the \nSenator?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will check on that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, just a very brief comment about the \noffset. The State fiscal stabilization fund does have substantial \nfunding for education, as represented by the Senator from Iowa. But \nthere is a portion of it--$24.7 billion--which is to be used for a wide \nrange of governmental services, which may include education, or may \nnot. In that $24.7 billion, there is wide discretion given to the \nStates as to how they are going to handle it. Those funds go out under \na population-based formula, in no way targeted to States with the \nbiggest economic problems or the greatest budget shortfalls. The \npurposes of the funding are undefined, so there is a substantial amount \nof money which may not be used for what the Senator from Iowa has \ndescribed, or education.\n  As I see it, it is a question of whether we are going to add to the \ndeficit of $6.5 billion or whether we are going to establish a priority \nwhere the State has the discretion to use it with undefined purposes or \nuse it for the three alternatives you have, which are to use the $6.5 \nbillion for NIH, which we have described, or undefined purposes in the \nState fiscal stabilization fund, or add to the deficit. I think we \nought not to add to the deficit. I think it is preferable to use them \nfor NIH and not for the undefined purposes.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 178, as Modified\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my \namendment be modified with the changes I just sent to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 178), as modified, is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide an additional $6,500,000,000 to the National \n             Institutes of Health for biomedical research).\n\n       On page 130, line 3, insert after the period the following: \n     ``The additional amount available for `Office of the \n     Director' in the previous sentence shall be increased by \n     $6,500,000,000: Provided, That a total of $7,850,000,000 \n     shall be transferred pursuant to such sentence: Provided \n     further, That any amounts in this sentence shall be \n     designated as an emergency requirement and necessary to meet \n     emergency needs pursuant to section 204(a) of S.

Mr. President, this amendment is very simple and \nstraightforward but basic and important. This would strike multiple \ncats and dogs, all-over spending provisions in the bill to try to begin \nto establish some spending discipline and get back to what this bill is \nsupposed to be about: creating jobs, stimulating the economy, not just \nspending money and growing Government.\n  A lot of folks around the country have fundamental concerns about \nthis bill, and the concerns are this is a huge amount of money and \nthere is no real discipline and real focus in terms of spending that \nmoney. This amendment is one attempt to begin to correct that. It does \nnot do everything we need to do, but it begins to correct it.\n  Let's start with the size of this bill. This bill is enormous. It is \nalmost $1 trillion. As one of my colleagues has said, $1 trillion truly \nis a terrible thing to waste. We are in a crisis in terms of the \neconomy, in terms of the budget, and in terms of the growth of the \ndeficit and the debt, and we cannot waste $1 trillion.\n  This is so much money that if someone had begun spending $1 million a \nday--$1 million every day--when Christ was born, we would not yet be in \n2009 to the full cost of this bill. That is how big this bill is. That \nis how much money we are talking about.\n  Of course, the argument is we face very dire economic times, we face \na truly horrendous recession--and we do; I am not arguing against that \nfact--and that perhaps something that big and that dramatic is needed \nto help get us out of it. If that is true, let's look at what is in the \nbill and see exactly how focused it is on real job creation and real \neconomic development and real stimulus. By that test, this bill fails. \nThis bill is not focused. It is not focused on real job creation and \nreal stimulus. It covers the waterfront. It is all about a traditional \nWashington-big-Government-spending program after program, touching \nvirtually every part of the annual Federal budget rather than being \ndisciplined and focused on items that can create jobs and pump up the \neconomy immediately.\n  Why do I say that? Let's take some examples. Let's start with the \ntruly ridiculous examples and then move on to other items that might be \nworthwhile spending programs but should be debated as traditional \nspending programs, not as job creation, economic stimulus, because they \nare not.\n  The truly ridiculous: How about fish barriers, because in this bill \nis $20 million for the removal of small and medium-sized fish passage \nbarriers. I challenge anybody on this Senate floor to explain to us \nwhat this is. But certainly even if they can do that--and very few \ncould--they could not explain how that is related to job creation and \ngetting us out of this recession. We are not going to get out of this \nvery serious recession by removing small and medium-sized fish passage \nbarriers.\n  That is truly ridiculous, as it was ridiculous to have in this bill, \nuntil it was removed very recently, significant dollars for honeybee \ninsurance. Again, I challenge this entire body, any Member, to come and \nexplain what that provision was. But even if they could say what that \nprovision was, what it represented, there is no way they could argue \nthat is job creation, economic stimulus, getting us out of a very \nsevere recession.\n  Or what about the $400 million that was in the bill until recently \nfor the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases? We can all \nunderstand what that is, but we immediately know that is not job \ncreation, that is not economic development or stimulus; it is not \ngetting us out of this recession. Thankfully, that was taken out of the \nbill.\n  Let's move on. There are plenty of items that we can at least \nunderstand what they are, but they are not stimulus, they are not job \ncreation. They are typical, run-of-the-mill, Washington-big-Government \nspending. They are items you find in the annual budget, and almost \nevery major item you find in the annual budget is in this bill. It is \nlike creating a new budget year and sticking it in between 2009 and \n2010.\n  We are going to spend $1 billion in this bill on the census. Mind \nyou, we appropriated $210 million as part of our emergency \nappropriations bill last summer--$210 million--but this is a bottomless \npit. So in this bill, we are going to spend $1 billion more on the \nupcoming decennial census. We do censuses. They are important. We can \ndebate it another day, another time, another bill if spending $1 \nbillion, throwing that at the problem is going to solve the problem. \nBut it should be beyond debate that is it not job creation, that it is \nnot economic stimulus, that it is not getting us out of this recession. \nThat is run-of-the-mill, Washington-big-Government spending. Of course, \nthere is line after line of that. Almost every major item in any \nFederal budget is in this bill.\n  There are all sorts of categories of traditional Washington-big-\nGovernment spending. That is about building but not building highways \nor roads or bridges, not building jobs but building Government.\n  FBI construction, NIST construction--not many people know what NIST \nis. It is the National Institute of Standards and Technology. We are \ngoing to spend $357 million in this bill on construction at NIST.\n  Commerce headquarters: Construction for the Commerce headquarters is \nanother $34 million.\n  Department of Homeland Security consolidation: We are going to \nconsolidate and, in my mind, that means cut, save, and trim. But for \nsome reason that consolidation is going to cost $248 million in this \nbill.\n  USDA modernization: Again, we are building Government, we are growing \nGovernment $300 million.\n  We are going to build a State Department training facility, $75 \nmillion, and more State Department capital investment, another half a \nbillion dollars.\n  The DC sewer system: We are going to spend an extraordinary amount on \nthat system--$125 million, again in the home of the Federal Government. \nNowhere else are those dollars figured but in the home of the Federal \nGovernment. And on and on.\n  Again, we may be building. We seem to be building big Government and \nGovernment buildings in Washington, DC, not anything else.\n  There are all sorts of line items that, again, are Government \nWashington programs, traditional spending, not in any way focused on \njob creation, on real economic stimulus, on getting us out of this \nrecession.\n\n[[Page S1408]]\n\n  DOD hybrid vehicles, $100 million. NASA climate change research; \nneighborhood stabilization; the Historic Preservation Fund; comparative \nresearch; spending for the pandemic flu, $870 million; broadband and \nthe smart grid, and on and on.\n  Again, we can debate another time another bill whether these are \nreasonable spending items, but it is obviously beyond debate whether it \nis job creation, economic stimulus, getting us out of the recession. It \nis not that in any focused, disciplined way. It is just using this $1 \ntrillion opportunity to throw money at every cat-and-dog Government \nprogram to use the opportunity to plus up somebody's pet projects, to \nbuild what they have been waiting to build at the Commerce Department \nfor 10 years and have not gotten the money. Oh, this is a trillion-\ndollar opportunity; let's do it now. This bill is a laundry list of \nthose spending programs, of those big Government cats and dogs. No \ndiscipline, no focus, no demand that it be economic development, \neconomic stimulus, job creation.\n  In addition, there is another provision that will cost a lot of money \nand not produce any additional economic stimulus, and that is the \nDavis-Bacon language. The Davis-Bacon requirements in this bill, \nmandates, would require Federal construction contractors to pay their \nworkers a wage far above the market rate in most places, and that wage \nis basically the union wage which is above free market wages and rates \nin most parts of the country. That has been estimated to cost an \nadditional $17 billion.\n  Mind you, that is not a cost out of the Federal Government contained \nin this bill, but it is a true cost and it should be added to the \ncalculations of the cost of this bill. It is not included in the CBO \nscore, but it is an actual cost, a true cost that should be added--$17 \nbillion. It does not produce any additional project. It does not build \nanother bridge. It does not build another highway. It does not employ \nanybody else. It drives up the cost of those construction projects and \ngoes above the market rate in almost every labor market in the \ncountry. My amendment would also strike those provisions.\n\n  All told, Mr. President, my amendment would strike almost $35 billion \nof this miscellaneous, cats-and-dogs spending that covers a whole \nspectrum of traditional big government Washington programs. It would \nalso take out that Davis-Bacon language and thus save us another $17 \nbillion on top of the $35 billion, for a total savings of well over $50 \nbillion.\n  Now, we are faced, as I said, with almost a $1 trillion bill. If we \nstarted spending $1 million a day on the day Jesus Christ was born, we \nwould not yet be, at that spending rate today, in 2009, to the full \ncost of this bill. So $50 billion doesn't do the whole job, but it is a \nstart. And I think the American people are watching and waiting to see \nif we are even willing to start, if we are really going to go to the \ncore of this bill and change the core of this bill and say, no, we are \ngoing to maintain some discipline. We are not going to allow this to be \nanother spending Christmas tree on which everybody gets to hang their \nornament. This isn't just a laundry list of big government Washington \nspending programs. This is something much more disciplined, much more \nfocused.\n  That is what the American people are waiting to see, if we are going \nto do that. They know the bill before us, just as the House-passed \nbill, has no discipline. It is a laundry list. They are waiting to see \nif we are going to get serious on the floor of the Senate and \nfundamentally change that laundry list of government spending, the idea \nof spending everything across the spectrum in this bill.\n  Obviously, Mr. President, I hope we take that important first step by \nadopting this Vitter amendment. Let's begin to enforce some discipline \nin this process. Let's begin to shave and cut those miscellaneous \nspending items, some of which are outright ridiculous, others of which \nmay be good programs but aren't economic stimulus, aren't job creation, \nand aren't going to get us out of this recession in the next several \nmonths.\n  So with that, Mr. President, I urge all my colleagues, Republicans \nand Democrats, to join me in supporting this amendment and taking an \nimportant crucial first step--only a first step but a very important \nfirst step--to get back to what this bill was supposed to be about: \nreal economic stimulus, real job creation, with real focus and \ndiscipline, not just a laundry list of spending items.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Ensign. We\n\n[[Page S1409]]\n\nhave a number of cosponsors, so this is truly a bipartisan amendment, \nand I think it is worthy of everyone's consideration.\n  It is pretty simple what this amendment would accomplish. It provides \nan incentive for companies to bring back foreign earnings into the \nUnited States, and those foreign earnings must be invested in our U.S. \neconomic recovery.\n  Right now there is about $800 billion sitting offshore because \ncompanies do not want to bring it in because it would be taxed at a 35-\npercent rate. This means, first and foremost, if you think about it, \nthat our banks do not have any of these funds at a time when they are \ndesperate for capital. This means that at a time that we want to inject \ndollars into this economy, those dollars are sitting offshore.\n  Now, we tried this once before. You are going to hear Senator Levin \nand others attack us for that last attempt. So to preempt that attack--\nI will have more to say about it later--I wish to show you what \nactually occurred last time that we did this.\n  We saw in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, before we \npassed our repatriation, all of these dollars, almost more than $350 \nbillion, sitting offshore, not doing the American economy any good. \nWhen we passed this, those funds came back.\n  Now, what you are going to hear from some of my colleagues is that \nsome of the companies did not live up to the spirit of the amendment. \nThe spirit of the amendment was to bring the money home and invest it \nhere at home in job-producing activity.\n  It is true. That is why, in this amendment we are offering, we have \ntightened the strings of what the companies can do, and we have \nrequired an audit of each and every company that takes this particular \ntax break. We have said that you only can use these funds to create or \nretain jobs, to make capital improvements in your business, to buy \nother businesses that will otherwise fail, to invest in clean \ntechnology.\n  We do not allow these companies to use any of these funds for golden \nparachutes or high CEO pay. We do not allow these funds to be used for \ndividends. We do not allow these funds to be used to buy stocks. Now, I \ncan tell you a lot of the companies would like to see fewer strings. \nBut Senator Ensign and I have agreed, in order to pass this, we are \ngoing to put some tough strings on it. That is what we have done.\n  Now, I do not have to go through the litany of job losses we have \nseen in our great Nation. Last month, there were 500,000 jobs lost. \nLaura Tyson, former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under \nPresident Clinton, says:\n\n       In the current crisis, even credit-worthy and profitable \n     companies face liquidity and credit constraints.\n\n  And she said, in essence, that the repatriation policies provide a \nshort-run stimulus.\n  People, if you vote against this, know you are voting against a \nstimulus because those funds will be available to support the domestic \noperations of U.S. companies. If you do not want to listen to Laura \nTyson, listen to Robert Shapiro, chairman of Sonecon, former Under \nSecretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs under Bill Clinton. See what \nhe says:\n\n       $421 billion in foreign-sourced income currently held \n     abroad could be repatriated. We project that nearly $97 \n     billion of the $421 billion would go to retaining or creating \n     employment.\n\n  And he goes on to say:\n\n       Additional funds used for employment could save or create \n     an estimated 2.6 million jobs, including 2.1 million jobs in \n     manufacturing.\n\n  That is a Democratic economist. Now, last time, everyone said: Oh, \nnothing is going to come back in. No taxes will be paid to the \nGovernment. That was wrong. As a result of this repatriation in 2004, \n$18 billion in revenue was received by the U.S. Treasury, six times \nwhat some experts predicted.\n  Now, 62 percent of the funds were spent on worker hiring and \ntraining, R, and capital investments. You are going to hear horror \nstories, and I say to my cosponsor from Nevada, you are going to hear a \nlitany of horror stories.\n  Well, I am going to tell some of the good stories. Oracle, a \nCalifornia high-tech company, used the funds repatriated in 2004 to \noutbid foreign competitors to acquire two U.S. companies--one in \nCalifornia, the other in Minnesota, and to keep the companies and their \nintellectual property in the United States. Oracle has increased jobs \nat both firms.\n  Intel, another California company, used repatriated funds to help \nbuild new fabrication plants. Now, some of the things you are going to \nhear I do not like to hear. I do not like that some companies did not \nact in the spirit of the amendment. But the amendment was not tightly \ndrawn.\n  Let me say, loudly and clearly, if any company or any individual in \nthe United States of America does not live up to the law, they should \nbe gone after by the IRS and have to pay their back taxes. That is what \nis going to happen to companies that disobey this law. That is clear in \nour amendment.\n  I tell you what we do, we guarantee that there will be an audit of \nthese companies. Now, I would say to any of my colleagues who oppose \nit, show another case where we pass a tax break and we require every \ncompany that takes advantage of it to get audited. As a matter of fact, \nI think it is a fantastic precedent to set around here, so maybe \nChairman Levin does not have to hold hearings if the IRS did its job \nand go after the bad apples.\n  We address the issue of fungibility. We require that foreign funds \nmust be spent in addition to the current spending level, not to \ndisplace money. We require that. We assure transparency and \naccountability.\n  I am proud that Senators Ensign, Bayh, Specter and Inhofe and I have \ncome together across party lines. I am proud. This is a good amendment. \nI would ask my friends, where we have an opportunity such as this in \nthe current environment, to inject $300, $400, $500, $600, up to $800 \nbillion into this economy.\n  Now, people are going to say it costs money. Joint Tax says it is a \nfew billion dollars over the first couple of years. Let me say, only in \nthe Government would there be a cost of something that actually \nincreases revenue. Those revenues were not coming in. We have proven \nit. These revenues sat out there all these years until we passed the \nbill. Then they came home and they paid their taxes.\n  I believe it brought in 16 billion--between 16 and 18 billion came \ninto the Federal Government. So this amendment means job creation, it \nmeans funding for the banks that need capital injection. I am tired of \nvoting for public money to fund banks. I did it. It was tough. Taxpayer \nmoney. I wish to see some of this money that is sitting out there get \ninjected into the banks.\n  You are going to hear horror stories, you are going to hear populist \narguments. I would put my populism to the test. I do not stand here \nevery day and endorse tax breaks. I am very cautious. But common sense \nsays, you have hundreds of billions of dollars sitting offshore, we are \nnot being paid taxes on the money.\n  They will pay taxes on the money when it comes in. We have heavy \nstrings attached. We require an audit. We have transparency attached. \nWe have support from the National Taxpayers Union, from the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, we have support from industry. They very much \nwould like to bring this back but do not want to bring it back in a \ncircumstance where they are so heavily taxed.\n  So we have a choice: We can walk away from this amendment and we can \nlet $800 billion sit offshore or we can learn from our experience the \nlast time, where we did take in $18 billion into the Treasury.\n  But no question, we could have had some tighter strings. Senator \nEnsign, I have to thank him, because I am sure he had some other ideas \nfor some of the uses, and I prevailed upon him. I said: Let's allow for \na few uses.\n  I see that the Senator from New Hampshire is here. I wanted to close \nright now in this argument by telling you the uses that would be \nallowed because I think those are very important.\n  Here is the chart, folks. I ask Senator Shaheen to take a look at \nthis: These are the sole permitted uses of repatriated funds. I hope my \ncolleagues who stand and bash this tell me why these are not good.\n  Why is it not good to hire workers and train them? Why is it not good \nto do more research and development? Why is it not good to do capital \nimprovements which will put people to\n\n[[Page S1410]]\n\nwork? Why is it not good to acquire distressed businesses to avoid \nlayoffs, shutdowns or bankruptcy? Why is not good to allow these funds \nto be used for clean energy initiatives?\n\n  Now, I ask that rhetorically. Maybe the answer comes back, we do not \ntrust these companies. Well, let me tell you, we have added an audit. \nEvery company that does this has to be audited by the IRS. It is \nautomatic. So I am very pleased to present this admendment tonight. I \nam looking forward to hearing from Senator Ensign. I know we have a \ndebate for which we will stick around, but at this point I will yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to congratulate and \nthank my colleague from California, Senator Boxer. A few years ago, we \nworked on an amendment together. Not a lot of people knew about it. The \nfirst time it was voted on in the Finance Committee, most of the \nRepublicans in the Finance Committee voted against it. I remember \ntalking to Senator Nickles at the time. He was leading the charge with \nthe Republicans against the amendment, frankly, because a lot of people \ndid not understand it.\n  It does not sound right that someone who invested overseas can bring \nthe money back for less than what they pay in the United States. But \nthe problem is that companies, if they have to pay a 35-percent tax on \nthe money to bring it back, as Senator Boxer and I recognized it is \ncommon sense, they are not going to bring the money back.\n  The chart Senator Boxer had clearly showed that. Very small amounts \neach year of the profits that companies made overseas actually came \nback into the United States, until we passed what we called, at the \ntime, the Invest in the USA Act.\n  The outside economists got it. They understood it. They projected--\nAllen Sinai, who was the economist at the time, did the studies. He \npredicted between $300 and $400 billion would come back to the United \nStates and it would actually produce tax revenues, it would produce \njobs.\n  Guess what happened, $360 billion came back to the United States. The \nCongressional Budget Office, Joint Tax, they said only about $135 \nbillion would come back, and it would lose revenue to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Well, a minimum of $16 to $20 billion was paid in taxes on the money \nthat was repatriated, so it only increases revenues to the Federal \nGovernment. It did not hurt the deficit; it actually helped the \ndeficit. The economists have studied the indirect and the direct \nrevenue effects of the jobs that were saved and the jobs that were \ncreated. The estimates are closer to $34 billion of additional revenue, \ntax revenue to the Federal Government from the last repatriation.\n  So the Invest in the USA Act, which Senator Boxer and I worked on in \na bipartisan fashion, passed 75 to 25 in the Senate. It turned out to \nbe a great success. So we are trying to put a new version of this on \nthis bill. To our amazement, the outside economists again are \npredicting that $565 billion this time is going to come back to the \nUnited States.\n  There is about $800 billion sitting overseas. The companies are not \nbringing it back. It creates jobs overseas. That helps the banks that \nare overseas with their capital. They are not bringing it back because \nthey have to pay up to a 35-percent corporate tax rate.\n  We want to bring foreign earnings back one time. If they bring the \nmoney back in the next 12 months, we charge them a 5.25-percent tax. \nWell, is not 5.25 percent on $565 billion better than 35 percent of \nzero?\n  This is common sense. That is going to help the deficit. We have to \nget real about this and put some commonsense thinking into this.\n  I commend to my colleagues two studies: One is by Allen Sinai and the \nother by Robert Shapiro and Aparna Mathur. By the way, Robert Shapiro, \nformer Clinton adviser, liberal economist; Allen Sinai, by any stretch \nof the imagination, at best a moderate economist. These are not \nrightwing radical economists. These are not neoclassical economists who \nare talking about this.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have their conclusions printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nUsing What We Have To Stimulate the Economy: The Benefits of Temporary \n   Tax Relief for U.S. Corporations To Repatriate Profits Earned by \n                          Foreign Subsidiaries\n\n          (By Robert J. Shapiro and Aparna Mathur, Jan. 2009)\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       In this analysis, we have evaluated the economic effects of \n     the 2004 American Jobs Creation Act, which provided one-year \n     of favorable tax treatment for repatriated profits from \n     foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations. Using newly-\n     released data from the Internal Revenue Service on \n     repatriated earnings by industry under this program, we \n     examined the range of stimulus-related effects, including \n     significant positive effects on employment, domestic capital \n     spending and wages associated with the use of repatriated \n     profits for purposes assigned under the legislation, as well \n     as significant revenue gains for the federal government.\n       This report extends this analysis to estimate the effects \n     of a comparable one-year policy in 2009. We conclude that a \n     one-year policy of taxing repatriated foreign-source profits \n     at a 5.25 percent rate, as in 2004-2005, would have \n     substantial stimulative effects on the current recession and \n     expand capital flows in the currently-constrained financial \n     system. We estimate that such a policy would result in the \n     repatriation of nearly $421 billion in foreign-source income \n     held abroad, including nearly $340 billion repatriated by \n     U.S. manufacturers. Under the permitted purposes of the 2004 \n     Act, this policy in 2009 would result in an additional $97 \n     billion for job creation or retention, $101 billion for new \n     capital spending, and $52 billion to pay down domestic debt. \n     The additional funds used for employment could create or save \n     an estimated 2.6 million jobs, and the additional funds used \n     for capital investments could lead to long-term average wage \n     increases of nearly 1.3 percent. The policy could produce \n     more than $22 billion in direct corporate tax revenues and \n     another $22 billion in individual income tax revenues on wage \n     income stimulated by the job creation and job retention and \n     by the wage increases associated with the additional capital \n     spending. We further estimate that the policy could produce \n     or free up $52 billion used to reduce the domestic debt of \n     companies repatriating foreign-source income, providing an \n     infusion of new capital into the financial system equivalent \n     to 21 percent of the $250 billion provided in 2008 for bank \n     equity infusions under the current TARP program.\n       This analysis shows that a temporary policy of sharply \n     reducing the tax on profits held abroad by foreign \n     subsidiaries of U.S. companies can play a meaningful role in \n     stabilizing and restoring U.S. employment, capital spending \n     and wages in the current deep recession, and provide \n     additional liquidity to the U.S. financial system.\n                                  ____\n\n\nMacroeconomic Effects of Reducing the Effective Tax Rate on Repatriated \n  Foreign Subsidiary Earnings in a Credit- and Liquidity-Constrained \n                              Environment\n\n                            (By Allen Sinai)\n\n\n                        Concluding Perspectives\n\n       All-in-all, repatriation of foreign subsidiaries' funds via \n     a program similar to the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA) of \n     2004 that allows an 85% dividends-received-deduction and \n     provides a lift to the U.S. business sector and significantly \n     improves the financial position of nonfinancial corporations. \n     The program works through providing an exogenous lift in \n     business cash flow and then through the uses of the new cash \n     flows by increasing corporate condition through the uses of \n     new cash flows for capital spending, R, jobs, and \n     strengthening of corporate balance sheets. The overall \n     economy gains in growth, jobs, and the lower unemployment \n     rate as a result.\n       Increased liquidity, less need for credit, and much greater \n     cash flow to nonfinancial corporations stimulate business \n     capital spending and capital formation, R, and hiring to \n     raise the growth and levels of real economic activity. This \n     comes at the cost of only a slight increase for inflation. \n     The federal government budget deficit actually improves, \n     benefiting from the taxation of funds that would otherwise be \n     untaxed and left abroad and from increased tax receipts \n     because of a stronger economy.\n       Depending upon assumptions made with regard to repatriated \n     funds later in the period, there may be no cost to the \n     federal government, with net, ex-post new higher tax receipts \n     and a lower budget deficit than otherwise from the stronger \n     economy.\n       Essentially repeating the AJCA in the current context of a \n     credit- and liquidity-constrained environment appears to be a \n     ``win-win'' event for all, the exception being those \n     countries from which U.S. funds are repatriated. The other \n     cost, which is arguable, is the possibility of an incentive \n     to keep earnings abroad, awaiting another one-time tax break \n     for repatriation.\n       This cost would appear to be minimal compared with the \n     benefit of repatriation to the economy, businesses and in the \n     credit- and liquidity-constrained situation that currently \n     exists.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. What their studies are showing today, as they showed \nbefore we acted in 2004, is that money is going to come back. The \nTreasury actually\n\n[[Page S1411]]\n\nwill be helped. Jobs will be created in the United States. And a side \nbenefit is $565 billion comes into the banks in the United States to \nhelp capitalize the banks. What are we all talking about here? That our \nbanks don't have enough capital. This, without a cost to the taxpayer, \nbrings capital back.\n  But in the wisdom of Joint Tax, they actually say that this bill is \ngoing to cost money, that it is going to decrease revenues to the \nFederal Government, where all the evidence by outside economists as \nwell as all the evidence by history shows otherwise. Look at this. \nEvery year money being repatriated to the United States, pretty \nconsistent down here, below $50 billion was brought back in each year. \nGuess what. We passed the Invest in USA Act in 2004. Repatriation shot \nup to $360 billion. Look what happened the next year. It went right \nback down, and it has been down since.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I will.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have been advised by my staff that Joint Tax today told \nus that in the first 2 years we will get revenues of $5 billion. Then \nthey go off and speculate as to what is going to happen in 2017. So we \ncan tell our friends here, in the first 2 years, Joint Tax tells us we \nare going to gain $5 billion. Obviously, they are off on that. We got \n$16 billion the last time. But even they are saying in the early years \nwe gain revenue. I wanted to make sure my friend knew that.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I was aware of the new numbers coming out of Joint Tax. \nBut the outside economists say this will probably mean $45 billion in \ndirect revenues, not including revenues produced when you actually have \npeople in jobs and people paying taxes who are earning the money in \nthose jobs. We have some great examples of what businesses did with \nthat.\n  But let me quote Dr. Tyson, who was the chairman of President \nClinton's Council of Economic Advisers. She recently wrote a report \nthat said $565 billion would be repatriated. The money would be brought \nback to the United States. She believes it could raise $28 billion in \ninvestment in renewable energy projects alone, health care initiatives, \nand broadband deployment.\n  We have bipartisan economists saying this is going to work. The only \npeople who don't seem to think this is going to work are the people \nsomehow inside the walls here in Washington, DC who don't seem to get \nthat if you have to pay a 35-percent tax, it is better to keep the \nmoney overseas.\n  One of the great American companies is Microsoft. Do you know that \nMicrosoft has no exports from the United States. They have a lot of \nthem from Ireland. Guess why. Ireland has a 12.5-percent corporate tax \nrate. If they pay that and they want to bring the profit back to the \nUnited States, they have to pay a lot of money, up to a 35-percent tax \nrate. So guess what they do. They keep the money in Ireland. They \nproduce products in Ireland, and they export those products from \nIreland instead of bringing the money back to the United States and \ncreating jobs where they can have exports from the United States. From \na commonsense perspective, it makes no sense to me to oppose this piece \nof legislation that will help capitalize our banks. It will help \nimprove the capital structure of our businesses, because the money, as \nSenator Boxer so eloquently discussed, can only be used to hire and \ntrain workers. It can only be used for research and development, for \ncapital improvements, for acquisition of businesses that may be \ndistressed. That is certainly what Oracle did. Oracle bought two \ncompanies. They outbid a German company that was going to take 2,000 \njobs outside the United States. Oracle buys them, keeps them in the \nUnited States, and then over the next few years increases employment at \nboth places. Dell built a plant where they hired 1,800 workers. Those \nare good things to do with the money and more companies will do exactly \nthis.\n  We look forward to the debate. I think it makes common sense. I thank \nmy colleague from California, Senator Boxer, who has done great work \nthis time as she did last time. I appreciate working with her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this may sound like a good idea, but it \nisn't. There are a lot of reasons. First, it is a question of fairness, \nfairness to American companies that do their business in America \ncompared with American companies that do their business in America and \nmaybe significantly overseas. If you are an American company and you \nare doing business in America, let's say you are doing pretty well. You \npay the standard 35-percent corporate rate; that is, if you are an \nAmerican company. If you are an American company but you have \nsignificant overseas operations, subsidiaries and businesses in the \nCayman Islands and other offshore entities, under this bill you don't \npay that 35-percent rate that the American company pays that is doing \nbusiness. You pay a much lower rate under this bill and basically pay 5 \npercent. I think that is about it.\n  So on the first level, this is totally unfair. Here we are, an \nAmerican company doing business in America. We have to pay the full 35-\npercent corporate tax rate compared with companies that have \nsignificant revenues overseas. They bring it back to the United States, \nand they only pay 5 percent. These are companies that are taking \nadvantage of the current tax laws by bringing it home, especially \nbringing back home repatriated income.\n  Under our tax laws, income by an American company earned overseas, \nactive income, is not taxed unless it is brought home to the United \nStates. But when it is brought home, then it is taxed at the basic 35-\npercent rate. There are some who claim that that revenue overseas is \ntrapped. It is trapped overseas. Because they are bringing it back \nhome, where they have to pay our rate. That is a totally unfair \nmischaracterization. It is not trapped. It would be trapped if they had \nto pay a penalty to bring it back, say a 70-percent rate. They bring it \nback at the ordinary rate, the rate the other companies have to pay. So \nit is not trapped. It is just that companies want to take advantage of \nthis argument that they have to do it to create jobs.\n  Data shows that the last time we enacted something such as this, \nthere were virtually no new jobs created in the United States. Why is \nthat? Because companies use this money for other purposes. If there \nwere provisions in the law that they had to use to it create jobs--\nmoney is fungible. So they say: OK, we will use some of this to make \nour payroll. Then we will use the money to pay dividends, go pay \nstockholders, go do something else. It is so easy to get around the \nnominal putative provisions in this amendment.\n  I must say also this is expensive. This costs $30 billion over 10 \nyears for no good reason. Sure, if I am an American company with \nsignificant overseas operations and I parked a lot of my, say, patent \ndevelopment over in the Cayman Islands--and that is what they do, many \nof them, they develop a patent in the United States and park it over in \nthe Cayman Islands, enjoy a very low tax rate, and then send the \nrevenue generated by that patent back to the United States, that is \nwhat they want to do under this amendment--sure, I would like to do \nthat, if I were an American company. I don't want to pay taxes, \ncompared with the garden variety American company that does have to pay \ntaxes.\n  There are a lot of reasons why this is a bad idea. It will not create \nnew jobs. In fact, there is no job creation according to a study, which \nI can put in the Record, done on the last repatriation provision. We \nalso know from the IRS that most of the dividends in 2004 came from tax \nhavens such as Bermuda and the Cayman Islands and other low tax \njurisdictions such as Ireland and Switzerland. These companies took \nadvantage. It is not illegal, but they took advantage of the law by \nparking their operations over in those countries.\n  I do not think we should be rewarding bad conduct by enacting this \namendment. This is an enabling kind of amendment. It encourages and \nenables future conduct. Where companies would say they developed a U.S. \npatent, they would sell the patent, put the cash in an overseas \nsubsidiary in the Cayman Islands, and that sub then buys the patent and \nthe money is then repatriated back. It is very much at the expense of \ngood, solid American companies doing business in America.\n  This amendment will not encourage business to reinvest in America. \nThe\n\n[[Page S1412]]\n\nlast evidence shows it did not happen. Money is fungible. A lot of it \nwent to stocks and dividend payments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Before the distinguished chairman of the committee might \nleave the floor, he said some things that are not true, so I wish to \npoint out to him that I am holding in my hand a report done by Robert \nJ. Shapiro and Aparna Mathur. Robert Shapiro was a former Under \nSecretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs under Bill Clinton. He says \nthat almost 2 million jobs were created the last time we brought the \nmoney home.\n  Let's take a look at that chart again, because I think it is worth \nlooking at. He shows where they were created. Job creation or \nretention: 1.6 million manufacturing. They either retained it or \ncreated it. He goes through how many of them were food industry, paper, \nchemical.\n  I can tell you about Oracle, which was stated by my distinguished \ncosponsor, that Oracle went in and bought companies that were going \ndownhill and were going to be bought up by a foreign company and saved \nthose jobs. I can tell you, because we have the list of things that \nwere done. We will take a look at Cisco.\n  And then my friend, the chairman of the committee, talks about these \ncompanies as if they are some terrible people. Cisco Systems, we should \nbe proud of Cisco Systems. Intel, we should be proud of these \ncompanies. Cisco brought back $1.2 billion in 2004. They were right \nhere. And it was used to create 1,200 R engineering jobs in the \nUnited States. Cisco says they have added 8,500 jobs in the United \nStates, excluding employees added through acquisitions.\n  So my friends who are opposing this are going to stand up and throw \nout the horror stories and numbers. We have the studies. It doesn't \ntake a degree--although I have one--in economics to understand that if \nmoney is sitting offshore and it isn't coming in in 1997, 1998, 1999, \n2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and then in 2005, it jumps up and comes \nin, gives $18 billion to the Treasury, and according to Robert Shapiro \nand Laura Tyson, we see millions of jobs saved, then you can stand up \nand demagog this thing to death. I could do it. They are going to \ndemagog this to death. But I have the facts.\n  I also want to say that there were abuses the last time. The spirit \nof the law was not followed. The law was weak. That is why this is a \nvery strong amendment. We tie down what they can spend. They have to \nhave maintenance of effort. And any company that does this must be \naudited. It is in there. You show me another amendment that gives a tax \nbreak that does that kind of due diligence.\n  My friend can stand up there and say it didn't work the last time and \nit won't work this time. We have evidence to the contrary. We know what \nhappened. Even Joint Tax says in the first 2 years we are going to make \n$5 billion. The whole notion that these companies are going to bring \nthe money in out of the goodness of their hearts, I wish they would. \nBelieve me, I wish they would. So you will hear more of this attack, \nand I hope you will put it into perspective, because the facts are \notherwise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from \nMontana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will speak briefly. I know others want \nto speak. I asked the Congressional Research Service to investigate \nthis question, and I have a memorandum from them dated January of this \nyear. It is from Jane Gravelle, senior specialist in economic policy. \nJane Gravelle is a very respected analyst at the Congressional Research \nService. This is an independent study. She has no ax to grind except to \njust get the facts.\n  Let me briefly indicate some of the findings they have. I will read \nhere:\n\n       The following is a list of firms with repatriations and job \n     reductions--\n\n  Not job additions, ``job reductions''--\n\n     along with the news source, in order of the size of the \n     repatriations. The total in repatriations for these twelve \n     firms is $140 billion, or one third of the total \n     repatriations of $312 billion reported by the Internal \n     Revenue Service.\n\n  First:\n\n       Pfizer repatriated [in that period] $37 billion. According \n     to a New York Times Editorial . . . [and lots of other \n     sources] Pfizer planned to lay off--\n\n  ``Lay off,'' not add, ``lay off''--\n\n     10,000 employees.\n\n  I might say, according to Michelle Lederer, of Slate Magazine, in an \narticle entitled ``The $104 Billion Refund,'' dated April 13, 2008, \nPfizer had a 106,000 job loss in 2005.\n\n       Merck repatriated $15.9 billion and announced layoffs of \n     7,000 workers. . . .\n\n  Not additions--layoffs.\n\n       Hewlett-Packard repatriated $14.5 billion with a layoff of \n     14,500 jobs.\n       Procter and Gamble repatriated $10.7 billion . . . and cut \n     jobs by an unspecified amount. . . .\n\n  We do not know what that number is.\n\n       IBM repatriated $9.5 billion; it added only 400 jobs \n     worldwide out of 345,000 [jobs] but eliminated 5 million \n     square feet located in the United States. . . .\n       Pepsi Co. repatriated $7.5 billion and laid off 200 to 250 \n     Frito Lay workers. . . .\n\n  The list goes on in descending order. The other amounts are not as \ngreat.\n  So there is ample documentation that companies that have repatriated \ndid not add; they laid off. Why? It makes sense because the money that \ncomes back is fungible. They can use it for any purpose--any purpose--\nthey want. It is not going to create jobs. They would like to have it \ncome back and say it creates jobs, but it does not.\n  Now, my good friend from California said: Well, Joint Tax scores this \npositively in the first 2 years. That is right. But over 10 years, it \nis negative $30 billion, and a positive score does not mean jobs. A \npositive score just means there is more money for Uncle Sam because \nthey are paying a lower tax rate. But that begs the question: What are \nthey going to do with those dollars? I submit, based upon the evidence \nwe have from the Congressional Research Service, they do not use it for \nnew jobs. Past experience indicates, if anything, it is that these \ncompanies, in fact, took this money and cut jobs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, first of all, there is not fungibility \nthis time. Senator Boxer and I worked very closely to make sure there \nwere very tight uses of the money, and there is going to be IRS audits \nafterward to make sure they use the money exactly how the bill \nspecifies.\n  The other thing is the distinguished chairman of the Finance \nCommittee was trying to point out the companies repatriated money and \nthen laid off workers, and he was trying to point out that was somehow \na causative effect. It had nothing to do with it. Ford repatriated $1 \nbillion almost and laid off 30,000 to 40,000 employees. OK. Ford had a \nlot of other problems. These companies had a lot of other problems.\n  Hewlett-Packard had huge problems going on, and the repatriation made \nit a lot better, so they ended up in a short period of time laying off \nsome people, but in the long run they ended up increasing American \nemployment over the next several years because they were in a better \nfinancial position. That is the way our companies are today. You could \ntake a lot of other companies during that same period of time that did \nnot repatriate a dollar and laid off people. So what did repatriation \nhave to do with anything?\n  Now, the chairman of the Finance Committee brought up that it is a \nquestion of fairness, that U.S. companies doing business overseas would \nonly have to pay at a 5.25-percent tax rate on the money they made \noverseas, while companies in the United States pay a 35-percent \ncorporate tax rate. Well, I will join you right now in lowering the \ncorporate tax rate in the United States. I will join you hand in hand \nto lower it. By the way, if you lower it, you do not have to do the \nrepatriation amendment. As a matter of fact, they tell us that at \nsomewhere between a 20-percent and 25-percent corporate tax rate, you \ndo not have to do repatriation because then money can flow where money \nwould be used most efficiently, and a lot of this money would come back \non its own to the United States. The problem is, the way the tax \nstructure is set up today, it encourages companies in the United States \nthat have invested overseas to keep the money there because it is too \nprohibitive to bring the money back to the United States.\n\n[[Page S1413]]\n\n  So I ask the rhetorical question, once again: Is 5.25 percent of $560 \nbillion better than 35 percent of zero or 35 percent of a small number? \nThat is really what we are dealing with here. So whether it is CRS, \nwhether it is Joint Tax, they just do not seem to get it. The outside \neconomists get it. They understand it. That is why their studies show 2 \nmillion jobs will be created this time, maybe more than that. Actually, \nShapiro actually says it will be about 2.6 million jobs created or \nsaved with this amendment. So I think the facts are clearly on our side \non this issue. Whether it is a fairness issue or whatever, the bottom \nline is we want to help the United States of America.\n  The last point I will make is, if you did nothing with this money--\nabsolutely zero--if we required nothing except for the money to come \nback to the United States and come in to our banks, wouldn't that be a \ngood thing right now? Common sense: Our banks need capital. We need \nliquidity in the United States. Let's try to follow this simple \nformula: In order to have employees, you must first have employers. OK. \nAre you with me so far? In order to have employers, you have to have \ncapital.\n  Mr. President, $560 billion in capital leads to a lot of employees. \nThat is capitalism, folks. You need capital to have employees. It is a \nsimple formula. Let's get this right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have been listening to this debate and I \nam kind of, let's say, astounded by the arguments of the proponents \nthat somehow or other you can cite the Joint Tax Committee for how much \nmoney will come into the Treasury for the next 2 years and then trash \nthe Joint Tax Committee for everything else they say. They are not \noutside economists, we are told; they are inside economists. Yet the \nfacts that the Joint Tax Committee give us for the years 2009 and 2010 \nare cited as supporting the proponents' argument because it shows that \nmoney comes into the Treasury during those 2 years, but in order to \nsustain their position, they have to ignore all the rest of the Joint \nTax's position, which is that this costs almost $30 billion in 10 \nyears.\n  Is it just that the outside economists take over the Joint Tax for \nthe last 8 years? This argument about outside economists, inside \neconomists--there are economists who differ on things. We rely on Joint \nTax. These are independent, objective economists whom we have to rely \non, and do rely on, not just for some of the things they say, as some \nof the proponents want to have it, but for what they tell us about this \namendment.\n  This amendment will cost us over the first 5 years, $3 billion--that \nis Joint Tax--over the 10 years, $28.6 billion. That is a major loss to \nthe Treasury, and we cannot afford it. This is a tax gift to those \ncompanies that move operations overseas, and then produce overseas, and \nthen have no tax on their profits because those taxes are deferred \nuntil they bring those profits home. Our tax structure says when you \nbring them home, you should pay the same tax as your competitors pay in \nthe United States. The companies in the United States that do not move \noperations overseas, they pay up to a 35-percent tax.\n\n  By the way, the Senator from Nevada has an argument. The basic \nproblem is the size of the tax that we impose on corporations. That is \nthe fundamental issue. But what the proponents are doing is creating a \ncompetitive advantage for those companies that move operations overseas \nbecause they do not pay the 35-percent tax if they do not bring back \nthose profits.\n  Then, we were told 5 years ago: Let's just, one time--we were assured \njust once--let them bring back this money and only hit them for 5 \npercent. We were assured it would be a one-time-only deal. It would not \nbe repeated, to use the words of the conference report. Lo and behold, \nnow the proponents--the same proponents--want to repeat this. And what \nhas happened--and this is not just me saying this; this is the CRS \nsaying this--is the companies wait for this opportunity believing that \nonce again we are going to allow this kind of repatriation at a much \nlower rate. They hold money overseas, awaiting the time when they can \nbring it back at a 5-percent rate instead of paying the same tax rate \ntheir domestic competitors pay, which is up to 35 percent. So this ends \nup--with this kind of repatriation, when we repeat it this way--being \nan incentive to keep the profits overseas, waiting for the time when \nthey can be repatriated at the lower rate.\n  Now, I want to quote some other inside economists since the \ndistinction seems to be important to the proponents, and they are in \nthe CRS. What does the CRS say about the 2004 repatriation package that \nwas passed? The chairman of the Finance Committee has quoted the CRS \nfor some of the data, and I am not going to repeat that. It is pretty \npowerful as to the lack of impact in terms of jobs and in terms of \ninvestments from that repatriation. They are inside economists, yes, \nbut objective economists, independent economists not paid by anybody \nelse to make a study. You can get economists, I am sure, who are going \nto reach different conclusions on this issue. But these objective, \nindependent economists, whom we rely upon--frankly, I rely on much more \nthan outside economists who have all kinds of connections to all kinds \nof organizations, and no one knows exactly on whose payroll they are \nwhen they make studies--the Congressional Research Service, with \nindependent, objective economists, what does it say about that 2004 \nbill?\n  They say: Imperial evidence is unable to show a corresponding \nincrease in domestic investment or employment, that the repatriations \ndid not increase domestic investment or employment. That is what they \nsay. You cannot show any empirical evidence. Or put it this way--this \nis their conclusion, not mine--their conclusion: That empirical \nevidence does not show an increase in domestic investment or employment \nfrom what we did last time. Little evidence, they say, exists that new \ninvestment was spurred.\n  Some outside economists, Foley, Forbes, wrote the following: \nRepatriations--they are talking about in 2004--did not lead to an \nincrease in investment, employment, or R, even for the firms that \nlobbied for the tax holiday stating those intentions. Instead, a one-\ndollar increase in repatriations was associated with an increase of \napproximately one dollar in payouts to shareholders.\n  Those are outside economists, for what that distinction is \nworth. When companies move jobs offshore and they make profits \noverseas, they have a competitive advantage frequently because labor \nmight be cheaper, and that is something we should not encourage, that \nmovement of jobs. Our Tax Code should not give an incentive to the \nmovement of jobs overseas. It does right now because you defer the \nprofit you make overseas and don't pay tax on it. That is already an \nincentive in the Tax Code which, frankly, I don't like, and there may \nbe, hopefully, some effort to correct that with this administration and \nin this body. But at least when they bring back the profits, they ought \nto pay the same tax their competitors pay.\n\n  The argument is made that they are not going to bring back the \nprofits, that we lose money to the Treasury. They, the proponents, cite \na study--and I believe they are relying on a calculation from the Grant \nThornton firm, although I am not sure; that name has not been used \nhere. But I think this is the assessment that is being relied upon. \nHere is what Joint Tax said about that calculation:\n\n       It ignored the fact that a significant part of the $18 \n     billion in revenues that it attributed to that 2004 Act would \n     have been collected by Treasury in any event as dividends \n     were paid in the ordinary course of business over the 10-year \n     budget window. Thus, the calculation--\n\n  And this is Joint Tax speaking--\n\n     is not a revenue estimate at all.\n\n  When the Joint Committee on Taxation issued its revenue estimate in \n2004 on the impacts of the 2004 repatriation--a projection of how much \nadditional tax revenue would be generated or lost by that proposal--it \nprojected $2.8 billion in additional revenue would be generated the \nfirst year, but the Joint Committee estimated that for the 5-year \nbudget cycle, 2005 through 2009, the repatriation proposal would cost \nthe Treasury money--a loss of $2 billion, to be exact. The revenue \nestimate for the 10-year budget cycle of 2005 through 2014 was \nestimated by the\n\n[[Page S1414]]\n\nJoint Committee on Taxation to be a loss of $3.3 billion.\n  We have to rely on these independent experts. They may be in-house, \nthey may be ours, we appoint them, but we have to rely on them. This \ndistinction between inside and outside economists, it seems to me, if \nanything, should work to the advantage of the independent, objective, \ninside economists on whom we rely. These are nonpartisan experts we put \nin place to give us the very projections which we have in front of us \ntonight. Those projections are mighty clear. Those projections show, \nyes, year 1 and 2, there is going to be additional money coming into \nthe Treasury, but then we start losing money big time, and we cannot \nafford to do that.\n  Finally, a lot has been said here about the fact that there are going \nto be audits of this--and, indeed, the amendment does provide for \naudits--to try to determine whether the money which comes back into the \ntreasuries of these companies is spent for the purposes that are stated \nin the amendment. But what the amendment does not do is require that \nthose funds be spent. There is no time limit saying that the funds must \nbe spent in year 1 or year 2. What it does say is that if they are \nspent, an auditor is going to try to determine that they are spent for \nthe enumerated purposes. But what it doesn't do is provide the \nrequirement that those funds be spent in years 1 and 2, and that is the \npurpose of the stimulus package. The purpose of the stimulus package is \nto try to get money spent on job creation, and the amendment fails in \nthat very fundamental way. It does not require the funds that are \nbrought back to be spent for the identified purposes. It says if they \nare spent, it must be for those purposes, but it doesn't require that \nthey be spent in year 1 or year 2 or year 3 or year 4 or whenever. When \nthey are spent, they will be audited. That is an effort on the part of \nthe proponents to avoid the problems discovered the last time we did \nthis, but it doesn't address the fundamental purpose of a stimulus \npackage.\n  So it costs us money--that is Joint Tax. The last time we did this, \nwhich was supposed to be the last time we would do this, according to \nCRS, it did not stimulate the creation of jobs, and it fails to pass \nthe fundamental test that it is not required to be spent for the \nenumerated purposes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there has been a generous amount of \ndiscussion and debate. In fact, I was sitting listening to it and \ncurious that my friend from California described those who would speak \nin opposition as being engaged in demagoguery before she heard the \nopposition. So there is a clairvoyance here, I guess, before we have an \nopportunity to speak on these issues. I will not engage in demagoguery, \nbut I will not disappoint her in my opposition to this piece of \nlegislation.\n  Let me describe what this piece of legislation is. If you like the \nnotion that we want to encourage companies to move their jobs from our \ncountry to other countries, then this is the legislation for you. This \nis an acceleration of what we have done for far too long and what some \nof us have tried to correct for a long time. There is an unbelievably \npernicious provision in our tax laws that says: If you have two \nbusinesses right across the street from each other and one of them \ndecides they are going to fire all of their workers and move to China, \nand they both make the same product and sell the same product in the \nUnited States, the only thing that is different once they have moved \nthose jobs to China is the company that left our country and fired \ntheir workers ended up with a lower tax bill. What an unbelievable \nthing to have in the middle of our Tax Code. I intend to try to correct \nthat with another amendment, by the way. But this repatriation tax \nholiday amendment is kind of a cheerleader amendment for that \nproposition: Well, we like that; in fact, let's encourage more of it.\n  Let me straighten out a couple of things with facts. Everybody is \nentitled to their own opinion but not their own facts.\n  First of all, the corporate tax paid in this country is not 35 \npercent. That is a statutory rate. The effective tax rate paid by \ncorporations in America is around 17 percent, not 35 percent. So when \nwe talk about it, let's talk about what is real. All right. So big \ncorporations on average pay 17 percent. But what we have in this piece \nof legislation is to say those corporations that have, in many cases, \nmoved their plants overseas and made profits overseas with the full \nunderstanding in our tax laws that they will at some point repatriate \nthose profits and then pay the corporate tax rate on those profits in \nour country, this amendment says no, that is not going to be the case. \nWhat we are going to try to do is say: If you bring them back, you get \nto pay a 5.25-percent tax rate--not a tax rate that ordinary folks pay, \na tax rate that is almost one-half of the tax rate the lowest income \nfolks pay. That is pretty unreasonable, in my judgment. Now, let me \njust say that in the ranks of bad ideas, the pantheon of bad ideas, \nthis ranks way up there. It is tired, old, shopworn, and they try to \nslide it through here with a thick coat of legislative Vaseline, just \nsort of slip it all through here while we are debating how to promote \neconomic recovery in this country.\n  Let me just turn to a few facts, if I might. This is the New York \nTimes, Lynnley Browning talking about the one-time tax holiday--this \nisn't new; we have done this before--in 2004 that offered companies the \nchance to bring that money back at a reduced rate of 5.25 percent. Put \nanother way, the tax break gave each company claiming it an average of \n$370 million in tax deductions.\n  So we are probably not at odds that the proposition is to give very \nbig tax deductions to big companies. That is what this amendment is.\n  Now, the New York Times. The drugmakers were the biggest \nbeneficiaries of the amnesty program--this is the 2004 program--\nrepatriating about $100 billion in foreign profits and paying only \nminimal taxes. That is the purpose of this amendment. But the companies \ndid not create many jobs in return. Instead, since 2005, the American \ndrug industry has laid off tens of thousands of workers in this \ncountry.\n\n  I was part of that 2004 debate. I remember the claims that were made: \nDo this. Give a special deal to these companies. They will create jobs. \nWell, the biggest beneficiaries were the big drug companies. They \ndidn't create jobs; they cut jobs in our country. A success or failure? \nIt seems to me that is a failure, and now we have the same proposition \nback saying: Let's have another round of this.\n  Hewlett Packard: $14.5 billion in repatriated profits, 14,500 jobs \ncut. Colgate-Palmolive. Motorola. I could spend a lot of time, but I \ngot rid of most of those charts, so just to show an example.\n  This is an editorial by the Chattanooga Times: It shouldn't escape \nAmericans' attention--this is 2005--that U.S. companies have disclosed \nplans to repatriate some $206 billion in foreign profits--that is as a \nresult of the 2004 legislation--under a one-time tax break allowed by \nCongress on the grounds--you guessed it--that such a big break would \nignite a strong spurt in growth. The upshot, of course, is that no such \njob spurt appears to be materializing. Some have even announced plans \nto cut domestic operations and jobs.\n  Colgate-Palmolive repatriated $800 million in foreign profits and cut \n4,450 jobs and shut a third of its plants over the next 4 years. Even \nthe primary advocate--and I mention this because my colleague just \nmentioned Mr. Allen Sinai--even the primary advocate for the special \none-time break, economist Allen Sinai, is now soft-pedaling his \nreduction of 660,000 new jobs over 5 years. He now says the efficacy of \nthe tax break will be hard to prove.\n  Well, some other thoughts about this. Michael McIntyre, Wayne State \nUniversity: There is no evidence that the tax amnesty added a single \njob to the U.S. economy.\n  Michael wrote a piece about this in December of 2008.\n  Again, Michael McIntyre: Most of the repatriated money was used to \nbuy back corporate shares and for other expenditures favoring \nmanagement. Not exactly something that fits very well in an economic \nrecovery plan. One study found that repatriations did not\n\n[[Page S1415]]\n\nlead to an increase in investment, employment, or R Instead, a $1 \nincrease in repatriations was associated with an increase of \napproximately $1 in payouts for shareholders.\n  So much for new jobs.\n  Professors Clemons and Kinney, Texas A research study: On average, \nfirms appear to have responded to the opportunity to reap tax savings \nprovided by the act but did not use the funds to increase domestic \ninvestment.\n  Finally, Robert Willens, tax and accounting authority, New York Times \narticle: It was basically worked out to be one big giveaway. The law \nnever took into account the fact that money is fungible.\n  That is the most important point. Money is fungible. You can say it \nwill create jobs; it doesn't mean anything. It doesn't mean a whit.\n  So here we are in February of 2009, 5 years after the last time the \nproposal was made to give a very big tax break by saying to some \ncorporations: You know what, we have tax rates that we want you to pay, \nbut if you are big enough and if some of you move jobs overseas from \nour country, we will give you a 5.25-percent tax rate.\n  Now, this is the Bismarck, ND, phone directory. We are not a \nmetropolis and we don't have the largest city in the country, but I \ncould go through this phone directory and read some names. We have a \nlot of Olsens, by the way, and a lot of Schultzes because we are a lot \nof Scandinavians and Germans and so on. But I could go through all of \nthese names and ask the question: Do you think Mr. Copeler would like \nto pay 5.25 percent income tax? I think so. I hope so. How about Mr. \nClause? Would he be able to pay 5.25 percent? I am sure he would like \nit if we just cold-called him and said: What do you think about this? \nBut no person I am aware of will be invited by this Senate to say: We \nwould like to give you a 5.25-percent income tax rate--just the biggest \ncompanies in America, many of which move their jobs overseas, and we \nsay: We will give you a big fat reward. We will claim that you are \ngoing to create jobs, but we know better because the studies are clear.\n  As for the studies that have been done about the cost of this, we \ndon't have to debate that. This loses $29 billion in 10 years. There is \nno debate about that. We only have one entity that makes those \nestimates. This costs $29 billion in losses over 10 years.\n  But the major point--which I assume causes the gritting of teeth by \nthose who believe it is demagoguery--is we have been fighting for years \nto say to American employers: For God's sake, stay here in this \ncountry. Don't go in search of 30-cent labor in Shenzhen; keep your \njobs here. And many of them said: Tough luck. Take a hike. We are \nleaving. We are going to go produce Radio Flyer little red wagons in \nShenzhen, China. Yes, it was produced in Chicago for decades, years, \nbut tough luck, we are firing all of those folks and we are producing \nthe little red wagon in China.\n  We are doing the same thing with Huffy Bicycles and with Etch A \nSketch. I could talk about a hundred products that are all in China. We \ngave them all a tax break to leave. Isn't that something?\n  This now says to American companies that own the product that is now \ngoing to be produced in China: If you bring your money back here, we \nwill cut your tax rate by 85 percent.\n  There is an old country saying, ``There is no education in the second \nkick of a mule.'' We don't have to relearn what we knew in 2004. Some \nof us made the case in 2004 that this was an unbelievably bad idea, \nthat it rewards exactly the wrong thing. I am all for tax breaks. I \nwould like to see on this bill a 15-percent investment tax credit that \nhas an end date to it, which says if companies--small businesses and \nlarge businesses--make these investments now, before July 1 next year, \nthey will get that. I would like to see a big investment tax credit and \nrequire investments in the early period. I am all for big tax breaks \nfor consumers to buy cars and homes. I would like to see people start \nbuying homes and cars again. I think that would help the recovery. I am \nnot opposed to tax breaks. I want us to do things that provide \nincentives to keep jobs in this country, to create jobs, and we know--\nwe don't have to guess--this amendment does exactly the opposite. I \nhave heard numbers and studies discussed. This is not rocket science. \nWe have the definitive analysis of what happened in 2004. We have an \nestimate of what this will cost now.\n  We lost jobs in 2004 and forward, and this will cost us $29 billion \nin lost income now. It will say to any other company, if you ever think \nabout moving jobs overseas, understand there are enough people in \nCongress who in 2004 and 2009 will come up with another idea in 2014 \nand 2019 that will cut your tax rate to 5\\1/4\\ percent some day and you \nwill never have to pay your full measure of income tax on profits as an \nAmerican corporation. This rewards all of the wrong things.\n  I don't accuse my opponents of demagoging. I think they are wrong and \nthey are using bad facts. We disagree about that. I agree that there \nare very different opinions on this issue. One is wrong and one is \nright. Ours happens to be right. There is only one public interest \nhere. The public interest is demonstrable here, not even a close \nquestion. I hope if we are talking tonight, on a day when 20,000 \nAmericans lost their jobs--every day somebody comes home and says, \n``Honey, I lost my job''--when we are trying to create jobs and restore \njobs by creating an economic recovery package, we don't have people \ncoming to the well of the Senate and saying count me in for providing a \n85-percent tax cut to big companies that moved overseas, that we know \nwill not create jobs and we know will further deepen the Federal budget \ndeficit.\n  Mr. President, having given full measure and vent to my concern and \ninterest, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I love this debate and I love my colleague \nfrom North Dakota. I am going to start off by saying I have a 9.2-\npercent unemployment rate in my State. People are struggling and \nsuffering. That is why I support this amendment, which I was proud to \nwork on with Senator Ensign, Senator Bayh, and Senator Specter.\n  First, my friend has it wrong. He has it absolutely wrong. We are \nbringing money home to America. We are not sending money out. It is \nalready gone. Look what happened the last time we did this. The money \ncame home. Now, you can argue theoretically in any way you want, but we \nhave the proof. Here it is. We passed a law in 2004 and this money came \nhome. I say to my friend from Michigan, eloquent on the point of \ndefending the Joint Tax Committee--and I ask my friend from Nevada to \nback me up on this point. I say to my friend from Michigan, if I can \nget his attention, that we can worship at the altar of the Joint Tax \nCommittee. I don't. I don't because they were wrong. They were wrong. \nIt is not a theoretical argument. They were wrong.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. The opponents of this measure are saying the Joint Tax \nseems to be the experts we should trust. Is my friend from California \naware, I wonder, that in 2004 when we were doing this debate, the Joint \nTax Committee estimated this measure would decrease revenue by $3 \nbillion? But is my friend from California aware this actually produced \nto the Federal Government a net of $16 billion in tax revenue? We were \nnot hurting the Government revenue but helping it? I further ask, \nthrough the Chair, is my friend from California aware that the Joint \nTax Committee, last year, scored this same measure at $18 billion? This \nyear, they scored it $29 billion. Was last year's estimate right, or \nwas this year's right? They were so wrong in 2004 when, by the way, the \noutside economists were right. The inside economists were wrong. Was my \nfriend from California aware of those facts?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I was aware. The Senator is absolutely right. They said \nit would cost $3 billion from the Treasury and, in essence, $16 billion \nwas added to the Treasury, and even now they are saying over the first \n2 years there will be $5 billion added to the Treasury. My friends \ndon't talk about that; they talk about the long range.\n  I also say to my friends who oppose us so vociferously, on the other \nside of this, you will find very respected economists who believe that \nthe Boxer-Ensign-Bayh-Specter amendment\n\n[[Page S1416]]\n\nmakes sense. They are Alan Sinai--I don't know how my friend says he \nbacktracked. He said this in December. Maybe he backtracked in the last \n2 weeks. In December, he said that repatriation has spurred $280 \nbillion in capital investments over a 5-year period, increased R \ndevelopment by $7 billion a year for 5 years, increased Federal revenue \nby $82 billion, and will create or save up to 425,000 jobs by 2012.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator asked me about backtracking. He made the same \nprediction in 2004 and then backtracked. I predict he will do the same \nthing.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Joint Tax ought to backtrack. They were flat wrong. They \nsaid maybe $200 billion will come back, and $360 billion came back. \nThey said we would lose money. We wound up with $16 billion added to \nthe Treasury. So it is very easy to demagog. It is very easy. But my \nfriend has it wrong.\n  Then my friend says that effectively the corporate rate is only 17 \npercent. Well, if that is true, then this is less of a tax break than \nhe is making it out to be. You cannot have it both ways and say, look \nat this giant tax break and then say the effective rate is 17 percent. \nI suggest to my friend, as he went through the phone book in his State, \nthank goodness, because of the work of this Congress, people in the \n$40,000 to $50,000 range don't pay any taxes.\n  I will tell you something. I am rarely standing up here and saying a \ntax cut to the business community is stimulative. But this one is, \nbecause it was stimulative. We have it right here from Robert Shapiro, \nwho worked for Bill Clinton. He said that jobs saved or created were \n1.6 million from the last tax break. So my friends come here and quote \nJoint Tax as if we have to say they are right, when they were wrong--\njust wrong--wrong on estimating what would come back, wrong on \nestimating what would come into the Treasury. If you read these \neconomists, whom I have heard colleagues on this side quote \nconstantly--Laura Tyson, Alan Sinai, and Robert Shapiro--they are \nsaying how to stimulate the economy, and this is one way to do it. To \nstand up here and be against it is fine. I don't mind that one bit. But \nto stand up here and be against it because you were for the fact that \nthere are corporations that have earnings offshore, I abhor that, too. \nI want to bring them home. No matter what my colleagues say, guess \nwhat. This is a free marketplace, and they don't have to and they won't \nunless they have an incentive. That is a fact. We may wish it to be \nanother way.\n  Look at this chart. Year after year after year, very little came \nback. When we took action, all of this came back. The reports are in \nfrom these economists--and most happen to be Democrats--that it worked.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask my friend from California this \nquestion. It was brought up earlier that the money is going to come \nback anyway. The Senator from California has a chart in front of her. I \nask her if she could explain the chart and that the money wasn't coming \nback until we lowered the tax rate. And then it went right back up \nafter we lowered the tax rate.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend is so right to ask that. Sometimes debates are \ndifficult to follow. They are confusing and complicated. This is not \ncomplicated. We know the way the corporations were acting before, and \nwe know what happened when we took this chance. We got arguments from \npeople here that money won't come back and it will not be spent here. \nBy the way, this is a tight bill. My friend from Michigan argues that \nwe don't force the companies to spend the money. We don't force them to \nspend the money. I don't even think that is constitutional. But I have \nto tell you this: Even if the money sat in American banks, I say to my \nfriend from Nevada, who is my pal on this one, wouldn't that be in and \nof itself a reason to do this? We are breaking the backs of taxpayers \nto take $770 billion, I think it is, through TARP to capitalize our \nbanks. As my friend says, if they don't spend the money right away, \nthey let it sit in these banks that need this capital and, hopefully, \nthey will start lending, which we hope will happen so we can get back \nto an orderly market. It will make the banks healthier.\n  My view is that this year there is more of a reason to do it than \never before--the terrible recession. We have a tight bill that will \nonly allow this tax break to be utilized if the money is used to create \njobs, where they bring the money home. That is it. Otherwise, they \ncannot get the break. We have a forced audit in here, and I defy my \nfriends to find another piece of legislation that has such an audit--a \nforced audit.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to, yes.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. A big deal has been made of which economists we can \ntrust. I ask my friend from California, when Joint Tax scored this last \ntime, not only were they wrong on revenue estimates, but they estimated \nthat about $100 billion or so would come back to the United States. The \noutside economists estimated between $300 billion and $400 billion \nwould come back to the United States. According to CRS this time, \naccording to the study the chairman of the Finance Committee quoted, \n$360 billion came back and $312 billion was used according to the \nmeasures we put in the bill. Was she aware that the Joint Tax Committee \nwas that far off on their estimates, not only on revenues produced but \non how much money could come back?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, that is right. My understanding is they \nwere way off by more than $100 billion. So for us to say: Oh, my God, \ndon't vote for the Boxer-Ensign amendment because Joint Tax says A, B, \nand C, I say to my friend, Joint Tax has been so out to lunch on this. \nThey didn't even come close to what happened.\n  We can have lots of arguments, but I can tell you this: Nobody gains \nin America when that money sits offshore. They did not gain in 1997, \n1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004. We had Oracle buying companies \nthat were failing. We had Cisco Systems expanding. Yes, we know there \nwere job layoffs. Of course, we know that. If Pfizer has a problem--\nlet's just say they have a drug on the market that is causing a \nproblem, they are going to lay off people. They are going to have \nproblems.\n  We do not allow funds to be used for dividends. We do not allow funds \nto be used for any kind of golden parachutes or CEO pay. We do not \nallow buybacks of stock. We tighten it up very much.\n  I hope we can get to the 60 votes. I am very confident we will get a \nmajority. I hope we get to the 60 votes. It sends a good message. The \nmessage is we do not like money sitting offshore. We want to bring it \nhome and help the banks. We want to bring it home and help the workers. \nWe want to bring it home and invest it in America. That is why it is \ncalled repatriation. You can get up and you can make every argument in \nthe book, but when you do, I think you have to explain to people why \neconomists such as Laura Tyson, Allen Sinai, Robert Shapiro are very \nclear, why they say that Joint Tax was off, why they say that even the \nlast bill that was not as strong as this actually created and saved \njobs, and why they predict that if we do this, it will stimulate the \neconomy.\n  I know my friends would like to have a time agreement. I have no \nproblem with that whatsoever. If there is to be a time agreement, \nSenator Ensign and I are very happy to agree to it as long as we have \nfull measure to respond to speakers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nuntil 8:15 p.m. be for debate with respect to the Boxer-Ensign \namendment No. 112, with the time equally divided and controlled by \nSenators Boxer and Baucus or their designees, and that no amendment be \nin order to the amendment prior to a vote in relation to the amendment; \nfurther, that the Vitter amendment No. 179 not be divisible.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, I believe a point of order \nlies against this amendment. Does that preclude----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I might add, I ask unanimous consent that \nprovided further, at 8:15 p.m., the Senate proceed to vote in relation \nto the Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I don't understand what we \nare doing.\n\n[[Page S1417]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. We are going to vote at 8:15 p.m. and the time is equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would agree to that, happily, if we can have 1 minute \nprior to the vote to restate.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator controls time so she can get that 1 minute. \nThat is a gentleman's agreement, or gentlelady.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, part of this discussion has been what \nmessage does this amendment send. I will tell you what message it would \nsend to me if we adopt this amendment. It sends a message to all \ncorporations that do business overseas that they are never going to \nhave to pay the regular corporate tax in this country on any earnings \noverseas. They are going to have to pay those on earnings in this \ncountry. If they keep a plant here and keep hiring people here, they \nare going to have to pay the regular corporate tax rate. But if they \nmove those operations overseas, then they will be assured, with pretty \ngood certainty, that every 4 or 5 years, Congress is going to come \nalong and give them a 5.25-percent tax rate that they can bring those \nprofits back with. I think that is a terrible message for us to be \nsending to U.S. corporations.\n  Part of the discussion has also been that U.S. corporations have to \npay too much in taxes. I know Senator Dorgan said the effective tax \nrate, in his view, was 17 percent. I asked research to be done, and I \nwant to show this chart so people can know what it says. The source for \nthis information is the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment, OECD. What this shows is that the effective corporate tax \nrate in this country--this is on profits generated in this country--the \neffective corporate tax rate is 13.4 percent. The average OECD \ncorporate tax rate is 16.1 percent. We are way down on the list \ncompared to most other industrial countries we compete against as far \nas the level of corporate tax we impose.\n  This amendment would say that this 13.4 percent is too high. What we \nneed to do is say if you are going to generate your profits overseas, \nwe are going to give you a special deal. As an incentive to put more of \nyour operations overseas, we are going to give you a 5.25-percent tax \nrate on the profits you generate over there. To me that is just \ncontrary to exactly what we are trying to do with this underlying \nlegislation. The purpose of this legislation should be to stimulate job \ncreation in this country. This amendment, to my mind, has the opposite \neffect. It promotes and incentivizes companies to move their jobs \noverseas.\n  I strongly oppose the amendment. I hope my colleagues will vote \nagainst it. I am one of those who voted for it the first time we did it \nbecause I believed what was said at that time, which was it was a one-\ntime tax holiday. I did not realize that every 4 or 5 years we were \ngoing to be faced with another proposal to do the same thing.\n  If we want to redo the corporate tax rate, that is a good debate. We \nought to have that debate. We ought to have it in the Finance \nCommittee. But we should not be in a de facto way providing for a 5.25-\npercent corporate tax rate for anyone who is willing to earn their \nprofits overseas.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield to Senator Ensign for as much time as he may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I wish to make a couple points. Once \nagain, I wish to get back to some common sense. Is it better for the \nmoney to be overseas, or is it better for the money to be in the United \nStates? If it is overseas, it creates jobs. If it is in the United \nStates, it can create jobs in the United States. That is the bottom \nline.\n  On the chart my friend from California showed earlier, the money was \nnot coming back to the United States in any significant amounts until \nwe passed the 2004 ``Invest in the USA Act.'' And then the next year, \n$360 billion came back to the United States. After that, it went back \ndown as far as the money coming back into the United States.\n  By common sense, we have to know that the money is not going to come \nback to the United States. By doing this, we are not encouraging \ncompanies to go overseas. Quite frankly--and I said to my friend, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee--if he wants to lower the corporate \ntax rate, I would join him right now. As a matter of fact, I may be \noffering an amendment to do that because I believe that our corporate \ntax rate, being the second highest in the industrialized world, is too \nhigh, and it encourages other companies to go overseas. But we cannot \ndo that. We do not have enough bipartisan support to do that.\n  Here we have a bipartisan measure. Very few things happen on this \nbill in a bipartisan way. This is truly bipartisan. The four sponsors \nof this amendment--two Democrats, two Republicans--are working \ntogether. The last time this bill passed the Senate was a 75-to-25 \nbipartisan vote. That should show us right now a lot of people looked \nat this and said it was a good idea, and a lot of people are looking at \nthis again. It is a good idea because it makes common sense to bring \nmoney back into the United States to create jobs in the United States.\n  I will just say, if Joint Tax was wrong a few years ago, they are \nprobably wrong again. As a matter of fact, I cannot even believe the \nlast year they scored a repatriation bill with a larger scope at around \n$15.9 billion. This year they are scoring a more narrowly tailored \nversion at almost $29 billion. In one year, they are that far off, and \nthey were totally wrong back in 2004.\n  The outside economists are saying this is going to save or create \nover 2 million jobs. Isn't that what we are about, trying to create and \nsave jobs in this bill? This particular amendment, even if it did cost \nthe money Joint Tax is saying, creates more jobs for the dollar than \nanything else in this entire stimulus package.\n  We ought to adopt this amendment. It is common sense, and we ought to \nput common sense to work when we are trying to save the U.S economy.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Finance Committee chairman. Let \nme suggest to colleagues why this is not common sense, and I think \nexperience tells us it is not common sense on this bill at this time, \nwhere the purpose is to create jobs and to try to get the maximum \nreturn on our investment of the American taxpayers' dollar.\n  The fact is, I voted for this, too, back in 2004. This was the \nAmerica Jobs Creation Act of 2004. At the time, it was argued that this \nwas going to create jobs. I, personally, believe in macro tax policy. \nIf we were reforming tax policy, it might make sense to suggest that \nrepatriated profits ought to be taxed at a lower rate as part of a \nbroader tax reform and that policy of deferral ought to be revisited \nbut not as part of this legislation.\n  The reason for that is very simple. During the 1-year period during \nwhich U.S. multinational corporations were able to bring profits back \nat a lower rate, the result was simply not what was promised by the \nsupporters. Yes, it did result in a substantial increase in the \nrepatriation, but it did not increase domestic investment or \nemployment, and that is the measure by which we ought to be making a \njudgment.\n  The 2004 provision resulted in $312 billion being repatriated. In \nfact, one-third of all offshore earnings was repatriated. Ten firms \naccounted for about 42 percent of that repatriation.\n  The fact is that many of the firms that benefited from this during \nthat period of time laid off workers after they brought that money \nback. They passed on the benefits to their shareholders. Pfizer \nrepatriated approximately $37 billion and cut 3,500 jobs in 2005. \nAnother company that benefited cut 7,000 jobs.\n  So the bottom line is, common sense tells you, if you tried something \nonce\n\n[[Page S1418]]\n\nand it didn't work, don't repeat the same mistake.\n  Secondly, with respect to what the Senator from New Mexico said, \ndon't repeat a mistake so soon after you have already made it so that \nthe message to everybody is: Oh, you can go overseas, you can create \nany company you want and, eventually, Congress is going to fold and \nwind up giving you a much lower tax rate when you bring it home.\n  Moreover, the provisions in here that suggest there is some \nlimitation on how the money is going to be spent do not get the job \ndone. One of the limitations is that you put it into research and \ndevelopment. You have an existing research and development entity that \ndoesn't create a job, certainly not in the near term. You also can do \nacquisitions of a business entity for the purpose of retaining and \ncreating jobs. That could be just about anything. You can argue that is \nthe purpose, but it doesn't necessarily have the impact and there is \nabsolutely no enforcement mechanism and no way to measure it.\n  At a time when we are fighting over diminished resources and what we \nare going to do, it seems to me this provision is simply not going to \nguarantee us the kind of provision of jobs we need. Past history shows \nthat very few companies actually benefit.\n  I think having this tax holiday again so soon without broader tax \nreform is not the way we ought to be approaching this issue.\n  By almost every measurement, I suggest to my colleagues that common \nsense says this is not the time, this is not the piece of legislation, \nand this is not the plan to put people to work.\n  I yield back whatever time I have to the chairman.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, can you tell me how much time remains on \neach side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 10 minutes 6 \nseconds. The Senator from Montana has 5 minutes 34 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if you could tell me when I use 5 minutes, \nplease.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, people stand and argue against this \namendment, and they say things that are not factual. They have every \nright to say it. I protect and defend their right to say it, but they \nare not factual.\n  Now, Senator Kerry said there is no proof that any jobs were created. \nWell, Allen Sinai, Robert Schapiro, and Laura Tyson have all said jobs \nwere created and jobs will be created. Senator Kerry said, in his \nforceful argument against this amendment, that companies simply didn't \ndo anything, and now if they do R it will simply replace what R \nthey were going to do. We don't allow this to happen. It has to be new \nspending, maintenance of effort must continue.\n  I want to call to my colleagues' attention to the report that was \nissued by Robert Schapiro, Under Secretary of Commerce under Bill \nClinton, in which he points out that 1.6 million jobs were in fact \ncreated or retained, just in manufacturing; 102,000 jobs in wholesale \nand retail; in transportation he goes on and shows all the different \njobs that were created for a total of 2.1 million jobs. Now, does that \nmean every company added jobs? No, some didn't, but it has nothing to \ndo with this.\n  So the fact is, when my colleagues stand up and say, why are we doing \nthis when it was such an utter failure, well, take your argument to \nLaura Tyson, take your argument to Allen Sinai, take your argument to \nRobert Schapiro and show them where they are wrong.\n  Then we are told Joint Tax has to be paid attention to. They were \ndead wrong the last time. I mean, they said maybe we would have $100 \nbillion come in, maybe up to $200 billion. Well, $360 billion came in. \nThey were way off on the revenues. The revenues they said would come \nin--it was $16 billion that came into Treasury. They said it would cost \n$3 billion. So they were wrong. So how can we stand here and try to \ndefeat this measure?\n  Now, my friend from Massachusetts says this isn't the time or the \nplace or the bill and so forth. This is a moment we can respond to this \nrecession. We are going to do it in many other ways, and I will be \nsupporting things and opposing things, but let me just read to you from \nRobert Schapiro's report--remember, a Bill Clinton Commerce Under \nSecretary.\n\n       As President Obama and Congress expand the catalogue of \n     measures to help stabilize the financial system and address \n     the economic decline, a major untapped resource sits on the \n     balance sheets of the foreign subsidiaries of U.S. \n     multinational corporations. These subsidiaries hold up to $1 \n     trillion in past earnings because current U.S. law defers \n     U.S. corporate tax on those profits until they repatriate. If \n     those earnings were transferred to the parent companies in \n     the United States, they could find substantial new capital \n     investment and employment and provide additional liquidity to \n     the strapped U.S. financial system as companies reduce their \n     domestic debt. In principal, the earnings currently held \n     abroad would provide significant economic stimulus and \n     financial market liquidity if a change in government policy \n     could induce U.S. multinationals to promptly repatriate them \n     and use them for designated purposes.\n\n  So my friends stand here and make an argument about how horrible it \nis that these companies have money abroad, and I agree. I am upset \nabout it. I was upset in 1997 about it. I was upset in 1998 about it. I \nwas upset in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003. Finally, in 2004, \nSenator Ensign and I got together and we said: Let's see if we can get \nthat money home. So for my colleagues who are lamenting the fact that \nthis money is abroad, we say: Join with us; bring it home.\n  If you are saying the effective rate is 17 percent, if we can bring \nit in at 5.25 percent, that is less of a loss to the Treasury.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will take 1 more minute. Then I will retain.\n  So I love a debate, but I would like to debate on the facts. The \nfacts are that this is what happened until we had the tax holiday. Now \nthere is a new hue and cry: You did it in 2004; never do it again. \nWell, I think it is a good thing that Oracle bought up two or three \ncompanies that were going to go belly up and that were going to be \nbought out by a foreign competitor. I think that was good. I think it \nwas good that Cisco Systems added so many jobs--more than 1,000 new \njobs.\n  So when my friends stand and they lament the loss of jobs, I lament \nevery job loss in this country. And I say to Cisco Systems: Good for \nyou. You brought the money in and you did the right thing. Did every \ncompany do that? No. That is why we have tightened up this bill.\n  I thank the Chair, and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I don't know what people are to think when \nthey watch this or hear this debate--he said, she said, they said, we \nsaid. At the end, the question is, What is real? What are the facts? So \nlet me see if I can uncomplicate this.\n  This isn't like trying to connect two plates of spaghetti. This is a \nplace of public interest about what should we do to try to create jobs \nin this country. My colleagues say we are worried because there is so \nmuch foreign income overseas. That is not our worry. Our worry is that \nthey have decided to take hundreds and hundreds of billions of overseas \nincome that is required to pay an income tax when it comes back to this \ncountry and have said let's give those companies an 85-percent tax cut \nif they do what they had previously promised they were going to have to \ndo anyway, and that is repatriate this income. That is what we are \nconcerned about.\n  So let me see if I can put it in the frame of a company--Huffy \nbicycles. A lot of people worked at Huffy bicycles for a long time. \nThey made $11 an hour making Huffy bicycles, sold in Wal-Mart, Sears, \nand Kmart, capturing 20 percent of the American bicycle market. But \nthey all got fired. They all lost their job because that company moved \nto China in search of 30-cent labor in Shenzhen, China. The last day of \nwork at the Huffy plant in Ohio, the workers, as they left their jobs \nand pulled out of their parking space, left a pair of empty shoes where \ntheir car used to park. Their jobs were gone, but it was the only way \nthey could say to their employer, who moved their jobs to China: You \ncan ship our jobs overseas, but, by God, you are not going to fill our \nshoes. That was the plaintiff\n\n[[Page S1419]]\n\ncry of all the folks who lost their jobs who loved to make bicycles.\n  Guess what. Our Tax Code gives a tax break for shipping those jobs \noverseas. This amendment continues that very approach and says: By the \nway, if you ship your jobs overseas and then repatriate the income from \nwhat you have earned overseas, we will give you an 85-percent tax \nbreak.\n  I am telling you, it makes no sense. There is no evidence anywhere, \nno matter what charts you put up, that this created jobs in 2004. It \ndid not. It cost jobs. Allen Sinai, noted economist, yes, he made the \nsame claims then, and then backpedaled. He makes the same claims now. \nBut let's talk a year or so from now, and he will backpedal again.\n  The fact is, this is a giant tax break to some of the largest \ncompanies that cut their tax bill by 85 percent without any evidence \nthey will create jobs. In fact, exactly the opposite evidence exists \nbecause we have experienced it, and we lost jobs as a result. This also \nwill cost the American taxpayers $29 billion in lost tax revenue at a \ntime when we are up to our neck in debt.\n  So you know, let's think of what we are debating. We are debating an \neconomic recovery program. We are going to promote recovery by dragging \nout a shop-worn, tired old argument that the way to do that is to give \nan 85-percent tax cut to companies that have earned income overseas, \nmany of whom have fired their American workers and shipped the jobs \noverseas. I don't think that makes any sense at all.\n  In fact, if this happens--it happened 5 years ago--if it happens now \nand it happens 5 years from now, every company will understand, you can \nmove jobs overseas and you will never ever have to pay the corporate \ntax rate when you bring foreign earnings back. You will always have \nsomebody standing up to say we have a sweetheart deal for you.\n  Oh, it doesn't apply to the Joneses or the Olsens or the Larsons or \nthe Christiansens, it just applies to the big companies that decided to \npark that income overseas. I say this: How about a 5.25-percent income \ntax rate for every American, rather than just a few of the biggest \ncompanies? How about all of us get a chance to get some of this 5.25 \npercent income tax rate? I don't think that is being proposed. Let me \npropose that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 4 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 3 minutes 59 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We will call it 4, and I will take 2 and yield 2 to my \nfriend, and we will close.\n  First of all, this isn't a shop-worn argument. This is an argument \nthat is going to create jobs, if we win it. Who says it? Laura Tyson:\n\n       Repatriation policy provides a short-run stimulus and would \n     make funds available to support the domestic operations of \n     U.S. companies quickly.\n\n  Robert Schapiro, Under Secretary of Commerce under Bill Clinton:\n\n       The earnings currently held abroad would provide \n     significant economic stimulus and financial market liquidity \n     if a change in government policy could induce U.S. \n     multinationals to promptly repatriate them and use them for \n     certain purposes.\n\n  You know, here it is. If you want to get the break, these are the \nthings you have to do. You have to hire workers. You have to use it for \nresearch and development, for capital improvements. You have to acquire \ndistressed companies and clean energy investments.\n  Look, my friends. The world is the way the world is. I think Senator \nEnsign and I, Senator Bayh, and Senator Specter are realists. Yes, in \nmany ways I would like to think I am an idealist. I don't like the fact \nthat these companies are keeping their money abroad. But guess what. \nThey are not going to bring the money back because Byron Dorgan or \nBarbara Boxer comes on the floor of the Senate and says: Please be \ngood. Please be good. We need the capital in our banks. We need the \ncapital to create jobs.\n  We need to make it profitable for them, and that is what we are \ndoing. We did it before.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na chart that was done by Mr. Schapiro proving that 2.1 million jobs the \nlast time were either created or saved.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   TABLE 3: EMPLOYMENT EFFECTS OF REPATRIATED FUNDS UNDER THE 2004 ACT\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                      Average annual    Job creation or\n                                           wage            retention\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nManufacturing.....................            $34,241          1,694,372\n    Food Manufacturing............             26,497            153,100\n    Paper Manufacturing...........             39,215             36,284\n    Chemical Manufacturing........             42,626            648,585\n        Basic Chemical............             53,873             20,507\n        Pharmaceutical & Medicine.             46,383            489,820\n    Plastic & Rubber Products.....             30,683              5,969\n    Primary Metal.................             41,589              2,648\n    Fabricated Metal Product......             32,698             33,832\n    Machinery.....................             36,371             33,851\n    Computer & Electronic                      36,290            364,339\n     Equipment....................\n        Computer & Peripheral                  43,713            179,944\n         Equipment................\n        Semiconductor & Electronic             33,987             91,830\n         Component................\n    Electrical Equipment,                      31,564             29,880\n     Appliance & Component........\n    Transportation Equipment......             47,453             49,647\nWholesale and Retail Trade........             28,857            102,504\n    Wholesale trade, Durables.....             36,496             29,261\n    Wholesale trade, Nondurables..             30,775             29,226\n    Retail Trade..................             19,299             51,328\nTransportation & Warehousing......             31,971              6,605\nInformation.......................             40,417             75,130\n    Software Publishers...........             69,782             27,213\nFinance, Insurance, Real Estate,               29,620             92,524\n Rental & Leasing.................\n    Insurance & Related Activities             39,309             16,021\nProfessional, Scientific &                     31,073             20,281\n Technical Services...............\nManagement of Companies...........             42,785             37,758\nOther Services and Industries.....             22,679            115,747\n                                   -------------------------------------\n            Total.................            $32,705          2,144,921\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to my \ncolleague, Senator Ensign.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, how much time is on the opposition side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opposition has 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will take it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, there is a parade of repentant sinners \nhere. The Senator from New Mexico said he voted for it last time; it is \na bad idea, and he is going to vote against it this time. I think the \nSenator from Massachusetts said the same thing: He voted for it last \ntime, he learned it is a bad idea, it didn't work, and he is voting \nagainst it this time. I confess, Mr. President, I am in that same \nsituation. I voted for this last time, it is a bad idea, it didn't \nwork, and I am very much opposed to it this time.\n  Both the Senators from North Dakota and New Mexico have stated the \nfact that this amendment is going to encourage companies to go \noverseas. That is true. But the effect is even more pernicious than \nthat. This amendment encourages companies to go to low-tax jurisdiction \ncountries, such as the Cayman Islands and the Bahamas. Why? Because, \ncurrently, an American company that has operations overseas, say the \nU.K., it pays the U.K.\n\n[[Page S1420]]\n\ntax. It does not pay the American tax until it is brought back, with \nthe U.K. tax offsetting the American tax. That is standard law. Under \nthis amendment, because the income coming back will be at a very low \nrate--5 percent--there is no incentive for these companies to go to a \nhigher jurisdiction country because there is no need to offset. Rather, \nthere is an incentive to go to the lower jurisdiction country--a low-\ntax jurisdiction country--because the tax rate is so low, such as the \nCayman Islands or the Bahamas, and all that.\n  So not only does it encourage companies to go overseas, it encourages \nthem to go to low income tax countries such as the Cayman Islands and \nthe Bahamas. This is a bad amendment, and I urge its defeat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, first of all, to set the record straight, \nSenators Bingaman and Kerry both voted no the last time.\n  Several other things. The Senator from North Dakota said he would \nlike all Americans to pay a 5-percent income tax, such as in this bill. \nWell, that means that he would raise taxes on 40 million Americans who \npay no income tax today. Let's get the facts clear. Last time, $360 \nbillion came back into the country and created about 2 million jobs. \nThis time, more money is going to come back. Almost double, about $565 \nbillion the estimates are, is going to come back this time. We have to \nask ourselves this commonsense question.\n\n  The opponents would argue the money came back last time and no jobs \nwere created. From a commonsense perspective, if the companies did not \ndo anything that they said they were going to do last time, if money is \nin the United States--you need capital to create jobs. Right now we \nhave a banking system that does not have capital. Capital markets are \nshut down. Guess what? Jobs are not being created because there is no \ncapital to invest to create jobs.\n  If $360 billion came back last time and $565 billion is going to come \nback this time, doesn't anybody with any kind of common sense know jobs \nare going to be created with that? We have to get real. Put your \nthinking caps on. I don't care what Joint Tax says. I don't care what \nthe CRS says. Put your commonsense thinking cap on, and we are going to \nhave a good piece of legislation if we adopt this amendment.\n  I encourage all of us to vote in a bipartisan fashion for this \nbipartisan amendment. I yield the floor and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan wishes to enter \nsomething in the Record.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend to the attention of my colleagues \nthe Congressional Research Service report R40178, ``Tax Cuts on \nRepatriation Earnings as Economic Stimulus: An Economic Analysis,'' \nthat indicates what little evidence there was about new investments \nfrom the 2004 decision, which is available at www.crs.gov.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending \namendment violates the pay-as-you-go section of S. Con. Res. 21, the \nconcurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2008.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I move to waive the relevant section and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second on the motion to \nwaive?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire (Mr. Gregg).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the status of the pending amendments \noffered by the Senator from Iowa and myself is a procedural snarl. I \nwant to get the $6.5 billion appropriated for NIH.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, that was the last rollcall vote tonight. \nThere will be a number of amendments offered tonight. In fact, it is my \nunderstanding that Senator Feingold has an amendment he wants to offer \nregarding earmarks. The next Republican amendment will be an Isakson \namendment regarding housing.\n  Tomorrow, we are going to be in session at 10:30 with no morning \nbusiness. We will be in full operation. As some know, we have an \nappointment downtown. We will have the floor manned. There are a number \nof amendments already lined up to be offered tomorrow. We hope Senators \nwill come aboard.\n  We have had a very good day. There have been some very good debates \non various amendments. I hope tomorrow will be the same. We will work \ninto tomorrow night. We are going to work Thursday, and, with a little \nbit of luck, we might be able to finish this bill this week.\n  I know there is a lot to do, but I hope people will understand where \nthe votes are lined up. We have had a number of votes that have been \nnot dominated by Republicans or Democrats, a lot of mixture. We hope \nthat as the debate continues, people will only offer those amendments \nthey think will really help the bill and will help us work toward \nfinishing this legislation.\n  Remember, we have another big step. At this stage, unless something \ngoes untoward, Senator McConnell and I think this matter should move to \nconference. We have two choices that we have done before. The House can \nsend us a message, but that has created problems in the past. We hope \nwe do have a conference. At this stage, unless something goes awry, \nthat is what the Republican leader and I hope to do. We would appoint \nconferees when the bill is passed. We have to complete this \nlegislation, including the conference, before we leave here for the \nPresidents Day recess. The mere fact we have a conference doesn't mean \nit is finished like that. This will be a conference where Democrats and \nRepublicans will work toward what needs to be done.\n  I hope everyone will come tomorrow invigorated to proceed on this \nlegislation. This legislation is extremely important. People have \ndiffering views as to what should be in it and what should not. That is \nwhat is going on now, to try to make that determination. The only ones \nwho can decide that are us, the Senate. I would hope everyone would \nlook toward when they want to get out of here, having done a decent job \nin completing this most important legislation.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 106 to Amendment No. 98\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment for the purposes of calling up amendment No. 106.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Isakson], for himself, and \n     Mr. Lieberman, proposes an amendment numbered 106 to \n     amendment No. 98.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a \n         Federal income tax credit for certain home purchases)\n\n       Strike section 1006 of title I of Division B and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 1006.

Mr. President, one of the things the American people have \nnot heard about is everything that is in this bill. I want to spend \nsome time tonight outlining the situation we are in as a nation, the \nfact that we have never had a bill this large at any time, in any way, \nshape, or form.\n  I want to first start out by noting my experience as a physician. The \ngreatest mistake physicians make is when they don't listen to the \npatient. One of the things we know is, if we don't listen to patients \nwhen they are sick, we end up making a lot of mistakes. The other thing \nwe know as physicians is that if we treat just the symptoms of a \ndisease, what we oftentimes do is worsen the disease. I want to use an \nexample of pneumonia. I will relate to this example throughout the time \nI talk.\n  If you come to me as a physician and you have a cough, a pain in your \nchest, a fever, and you are ill, I can make your symptoms go away, but \nI won't cure the underlying pneumonia you have as a patient. I can give \nyou a cough medicine to suppress your cough. I can give you an \nantipyretic to control your temperature. I can give you, with that \ncough medicine, something to control the pain in your chest. I can do \nall those things. But if I fail to diagnose your real problem, which is \npneumonia, all I am doing is covering up the symptoms of the real \ndisease.\n  I would contend with my colleagues and the American public that the \nbill we have before us is a bill that covers up the symptoms of the \nreal disease. The real disease we have is the fact that housing and \nmortgages are in trouble. Everything we do that does not address that \ndisease first, that does not attempt to solve that problem, everything \nwe do that does not address the real disease we have is going to be \nwasted effort. It is not going to accomplish its purpose. As a matter \nof fact, there is not an economist out there right now who says if we \npass this bill without fixing the mortgage problem, without fixing the \nhousing problem--none of them agree that what we are going to do is \ngoing to have a significant impact. There is not one. You can't get one \nto come and testify unless you fix the real problem.\n  We as American citizens are on the hook for 31 million mortgages.\n  We have 31 million we now own--Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--so \nwhatever happens to those mortgages, the American people are going to \npay for them. If they are upside down and they get worse or if they go \nworse underwater, if they get foreclosed upon, the American taxpayers \nare going to have to pay for them. Now, who is that American taxpayer? \nIt is not us. We are going to be dead and gone when it comes time to \npay off the massive amounts of borrowing we are putting forward in this \nbill. That American taxpayer is our kids and our grandkids. So we dare \nnot make the mistake of treating just symptoms.\n  My contention is we are way too early with a stimulus bill. We can \nspend this $1.12 trillion by the time you add in the interest plus the \nsix point some billion dollars we just added on top of it without \npaying for it. We can pass this bill. But we run the risk of doing \nexactly what the Japanese did in the 1990s. They passed eight separate \nstimulus bills, none of which addressed the real underlying disease of \nthe Japanese economy. That is why it is called the ``lost decade'' in \nJapan. They now have a debt to GDP ratio of 150 percent of their GDP.\n  So what are we to do? Are we to continue down this path with a bill \nthat is going to spend over $1 trillion or should we be about fixing \nthe real disease, which is the housing and the mortgage problems this \ncountry faces?\n  Now, it is not easy to fix that. I know that. And I am not putting \nforward a definitive plan tonight to do that, although I think my side \nof the aisle is going to be offering one in the next few days that will \naddress the real disease: housing and mortgages in this country.\n  We got here--and it is important to remember how we got here, how we \ngot the ``pneumonia''--we got the ``pneumonia'' because we said we were \ngoing to socialize the risk on mortgages so people in this country \ncould buy a home who really could not afford a home, and we were going \nto put that risk on the rest of the American taxpayers.\n  Well, that bill has come home. That bill now--besides the cost of \nactually being responsible for the 31-some million failed mortgages, of \nwhich probably 30 or 40 percent we are going to end up owning as \nAmerican taxpayers; besides that cost, the cost in terms of lost jobs, \nthe cost in terms of true, real pain to American citizens who are \nhaving trouble feeding their families, paying their bills, the real \ncost of that is enormous on our society.\n  What I want the American people to know is we caused that. We did \nthat. We created Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and then we did not do the \nregulatory work we should have done. We encouraged them to be \nirresponsible. We encouraged them to have bonuses, by making more and \nmore and more of the loans and guaranteeing them and packaging them and \nselling them throughout the world. We did that. The\n\n[[Page S1424]]\n\nCongress did that. No President did that--not President Clinton, not \nPresident Bush, and not President Obama. We did it. So we ought to be \nabout fixing the real problem.\n  Until we fix this problem, we are going to stay in a recession. We \ncan pass a bill that spends $1.12 trillion, and we are still going to \nbe in a recession because what the economists tell us this year is that \nhome prices are going to decline another 11 to 12 percent, which is \ngoing to put millions more Americans and their mortgages in trouble. So \nwe can pass a bill that spends $1.12 trillion or we can say maybe we \nought to address the real problem.\n  It is not going to be long until the Obama administration comes to \nthis body and asks for $500 billion more to solve the problem with bank \nloans and mortgages. We ought to be doing that first. That is the real \ndisease. There is not anybody in this body who will deny that the real \ndisease is the housing and the mortgage failure in this country.\n  We are going to spend a week on this legislation. It is going to go \nto conference. It is going to come back. Most of the stuff we are able \nto take back is going to be added in conference because the power to do \nthat is there, and it is incumbent on the other side of the aisle that \nthey are going to take care of those who are on their team.\n  I want to make another point. In this bill we are talking about, we \nare making a fatal mistake. Let me tell you what that fatal mistake is. \nWe are transferring the irresponsibility we have had over the last 6 \nyears in this Congress--or last 8 years in this Congress--to the States \nbecause what we are telling them is: You do not have to be fiscally \nresponsible. You do not have to live within your means because Uncle \nSam is going to bail you out. That is what this bill says. We are going \nto bail them out.\n  So for the States, such as my State, that were smart enough and wise \nenough to create a rainy day fund and live within their means, we are \ngoing to ask all the taxpayers of all the States that have done that to \npay for the exorbitant spending and growth in Government in all the \nrest of the States.\n  What is that going to do in the future? What is the signal that sends \nto the rest of the States? Here is what the signal says. Do not worry \nabout it because if you get in trouble again, the Federal Government is \ngoing to bail you out.\n  Remember when New York City was going bankrupt? What did we do? Did \nwe just pay for everything? Did we just send Federal money? No. We \ncreated an environment where they made the changes. We helped them. And \nI am not opposed to helping the States make the changes to put them \nback on a fiscal course to live within their means.\n  The other thing that is bad about this bill is every American family \nout there today--I do not care what their income is--they are \nreassessing every day what they need to do in terms of how to get by in \nthe economic situation in which we find ourselves. They are making \ntough choices. There is not one tough choice in this bill. Let me \nexplain what I mean by that.\n  President Obama campaigned on the fact that we ought to live within \nour means; that every program ought to be reviewed; that those that are \nnot effective, those that have waste, those that have high fraud rates, \nthose that are low priority ought to be eliminated. There is not one \npenny of effort placed in this bill that will get rid of less important \nFederal programs today.\n  We know there is at least $300 billion a year that is inefficiently, \nerroneously, and fraudulently spent by the Federal Government. We ask \nour children and our grandchildren to choke down $1.1 trillion more of \ndebt when we have not done anything--not one thing--to lessen the \nwaste, fraud, and abuse, the inefficiency, and to make choices on what \nis more important. What we are saying is everything we are doing now is \nimportant, everything we are doing is efficient, everything is working \nfine, and, by the way, we are going to add another $1.1 trillion.\n  I have this chart to show how we got in trouble--because we were \nspending money we did not have on things we do not need. That is how we \ngot in trouble. This chart shows the deficits of the Federal Government \nfrom 2004, plus what CBO expects, without interest costs, by the way, \nas to what is going to happen to us.\n  We know, last year, under real accounting, accounting for the Social \nSecurity money we stole--and that is the only way you can say it; we \nstole about $160 billion out of the Social Security system--the real \ndeficit, last year, set a record we have never seen. It was $609 \nbillion. That is as of September 30. The estimate of CBO for this year \nis we are going to have--before we even talk about stimulus, before we \ndo anything on stimulus, and before we account for the interest costs \non stimulus--we are going to have a $1.2 trillion deficit.\n  Now, divide that out by 300 million Americans, and what you see is we \nare going to have a deficit of about $16,000 per family. For every \nfamily in this country, we are going to borrow $16,000 against their \nkids' future before we do this, before we even approach doing this. It \ndoes not get a lot better. Note these numbers: $1.4 trillion, if we add \nwhat the CBO expects to come out of this stimulus package, and only \none-fourth of it is going to get spent this year.\n  Now, what do we know about stimulus packages in the past? Here is \nwhat we know. Only two times in our history--only two times in our \nhistory--have we ever had a stimulus package that was effective. Two \ntimes. John Fitzgerald Kennedy created a stimulus package that was \neffective, and Ronald Reagan, in the early 1980s, created a stimulus \npackage that was effective. All of the others have been ineffective to \nfix what was ailing us.\n\n  If we do not fix the mortgage problem in this country, and housing, \nthis money will be to no avail other than to shackle our children and \nour grandchildren for years to come. What does that mean when I say \n``shackle''? It means stealing their future. Right now the average \nAmerican has a 30-percent higher standard of living than the average \nEuropean and the average Japanese. What we are about to do--and we have \nbeen doing--is to guarantee that 30-percent advantage in standard of \nliving is going to go away.\n  Other people say: Well, you have to fix the finance, you have to fix \nthe credit markets, you have to fix the liquidity markets. You cannot \nfix the credit markets, you cannot fix the liquidity problems we have \nby spending money. We have already spent $400 billion of the TARP \nmoney, and other than pulling us back from the precipice of an absolute \ncollapse of our financial markets, we still have the credit markets \ntied up and frozen in this country.\n  I want to give you an example. I have a farmer friend who has been \nbanking with a bank for 15 years. He has never missed a payment. He has \nbeen 100 percent on his payments every time. He has assets far in \nexcess of what his loans are--far in excess--15, 20 times what his \nloans are. He was told this last week by his bank: We don't want your \nbusiness anymore.\n  Now, this is a guy who is a premium credit risk. Why do they not want \nhis business? Because they want the money in the bank rather than to \nhave even a good loan outstanding.\n  Our credit problems are not getting better. They are getting worse. \nWe have not solved the problem by putting money on the equity side of \nthe balance sheets of the banks. The reason we have not solved the \nproblem is because we have not approached and fixed the real disease, \nwhich is the mortgage markets and the mortgages that are underwater and \nthe housing crisis in this country.\n  I want to spend a moment on another issue. A lot of the rhetoric we \nhave heard in the last 3 or 4 months in this country goes after markets \nand capitalism. Market forces and capitalism in this country created \nthe greatest country that has ever been or ever will be. When we hear \nmarket forces and capitalism criticized as the cause of all of our \nproblems, we need to do a gut check.\n  Market forces and capitalism didn't cause this problem. Congress \ncaused this problem, by our short-term thinking, by thinking, How do I \nlook good politically, how do I do something that isn't based on \nmarkets? That is what Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were all about. We \nwere actually giving loans to people who couldn't afford them. It \nwasn't market capitalism that got us in trouble, it was short-term, \npolitically expedient thinking that got us in trouble. So the next time \nyou hear\n\n[[Page S1425]]\n\nsomebody attacking the very thing that generated liberty, that very \nthing that generated freedom, the very thing that generated the \ngreatest standard of living in the world, you ought to ask the \nquestion: Is that true? Did market capitalism get us in this trouble?\n  What got us in this trouble was creating a socialized risk that \nabandoned the market principles and created a system of loans to people \nwho could not afford the loans.\n  One of the questions I think we ought to ask--at least the American \ntaxpayer ought to be asking every Member of Congress--is what guarantee \ndo you have that passing this $1.12 trillion spending bill is going to \nsolve the problem? You know what. There is not a guarantee out there. \nNo Member of Congress can tell them that. We are going to treat the \nsymptoms with this bill. We are going to solve some of the short-term \nproblems. We are going to create dependency from the States. We are \ngoing to outline and do things we have no business doing. We are going \nto expand Federal bureaucracies. We are going to raise the baseline to \n$300 billion that will never go away. That is what we are going to do \nwith this bill. We are going to emphasize and fund the most inefficient \nbureaucracies in the world, not on the basis of what is the best thing \nto do but because we will look good and we will help out somebody who \nneeds our help right now.\n  I am not opposed to us helping people who are unemployed. I am not \nopposed to giving extra food stamps to people who find themselves, \nthrough no fault of their own, in a predicament they can't change, but \nthat is not what this bill does. What this bill does is take a list of \npolicy options that have been on the table for years and funds them in \nenormous, extravagant amounts, that will have no impact--zero impact--\nin terms of getting us out of a recession, and will have a 100-percent \nimpact in guaranteeing we are going to lower the standard of living in \nthis country and we are going to steal opportunity from our children.\n  Let's look at where we are right now as a nation. At the end of this \nyear, we will have an $11.6 trillion debt, probably an $11.8 trillion \ndebt, very close to our total GDP. We have $95 billion in unfunded \nliabilities we are going to place on the backs of our children and our \ngrandchildren through Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare \nPart D--things we are going to give people that they have not paid for \nor we have stolen the money that was there to pay for them, and we are \ngoing to transfer that to our children.\n  Last year, we paid, as Americans, $230 billion in interest. Do you \nknow what it is going to be 2 years from now? It is going to be $450 \nbillion. How many people think the interest rates we are seeing today \nare going to be stable and the same 5 years from now? All of the \neconomists tell us they are not. As the world looks toward us and we \ncontinue to borrow--we have increased our debt by $5 trillion by the \ntime you take what the Federal Reserve has done and what the Treasury \nhas done--how many people think we are going to be able to borrow money \nfor 10 years for 2.6 percent? No economist thinks that. They know it is \ngoing to rise 2 or 3 percent. So we are going to go from about 16 \npercent of our budget for interest payments to about 40 percent of our \nbudget for interest payments. What are we going to do then? The very \nreal important things we need to do--not the superfluous stuff; the \nimportant things the Constitution says we should be doing--what are we \ngoing to do then? Are we going to borrow more?\n  What happens when we borrow more? What happens when we borrow more is \ninterest rates go up, inflation goes up, and we have one of two \nchoices: We can file bankruptcy as a nation or we can have \nhyperinflation and a marked devaluation of the value of the dollar. \nWhat does that mean? That means you won't be able to keep up with your \npayments, you won't be able to buy a home, the cost of any good that is \nimported in here will rise astronomically. This is Armageddon for us. \nWhile we are in this shape, how dare we think we can spend money we \ndon't have now on things we don't need now and get out of a problem \nthat was caused by the very same philosophy: It cannot happen and it \nwill not happen.\n  Let me outline what we have done so far in terms of this ``economic \ndownturn.'' Last April, we borrowed $160 billion from our grandkids and \nwe gave everybody a tax credit under $75,000 a year or $150,000 for \nfamilies. We didn't pay for a penny of it. We didn't get rid of one \nwasteful program. We didn't make one hard choice. What do the \neconomists tell us we did with that? What was the net effect? The net \neffect was that 12 percent of it had an effect. Twelve percent. Now, \ncrank that up to $1.1 trillion at 12 percent, which is what the \nestimate is of this bill in terms of what kind of effect it is going to \nhave. We are going to have about $120 billion that is going to have a \npositive effect, and then we are going to have another $850 billion or \n$860 billion that is going to have no effect whatsoever except to steal \nthe future from our kids and our grandkids.\n  We are going in exactly the wrong direction. We ought to be standing \non the principles that made this country great. There ought to be a \nreview of every program in the Federal Government that is not \neffective, that is not efficient, that is wasteful or fraudulent, and \nwe ought to get rid of it right now. We ought to say, Gone, to be able \nto pay for a real stimulus plan that might, in fact, have some impact.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't remind everybody that next week we are \ngoing to hear from the Obama administration wanting another $500 \nbillion. Outside of this, they are going to want another $500 billion \nto handle the banking system. Still not fixing the real disease--the \npneumonia--we are going to treat the fever or treat the cough, but we \nare not going to treat the real disease. Until we treat the real \ndisease, this is pure waste. It is worse than pure waste. It is morally \nreprehensible, because it steals the future of the next two \ngenerations.\n  I am going to wind up here and finish, but I wanted to spend some \ntime to make sure the American people know what is in this bill. I \nthink once they know what is in this bill, they are going to reject it \nout of hand. Let me read for my colleagues some of the things that are \nin this bill. The biggest earmark in history is in this bill. There is \n$2 billion in this bill to build a coal plant with zero emissions. That \nwould be great, maybe, if we had the technology, but the greatest \nbrains in the world sitting at MIT say we don't have the technology yet \nto do that. Why would we build a $2 billion powerplant we don't have \nthe technology for that we know will come back and ask for another $2 \nbillion and another $2 billion and another $2 billion when we could \nbuild a demonstration project that might cost $150 million or $200 \nmillion? There is nothing wrong with having coal-fired plants that \ndon't produce pollution; I am not against that. Even the Washington \nPost said the technology isn't there. It is a boondoggle. Why would we \ndo that?\n  We eliminated tonight a $246 million payback for the large movie \nstudios in Hollywood.\n  We are going to spend $88 million to study whether we ought to buy a \nnew ice breaker for the Coast Guard. You know what. The Coast Guard \nneeds a new ice breaker. Why do we need to spend $88 million? They have \ntwo ice breakers now that they could retrofit and fix and come up with \nequivalent to what they needed to and not spend the $1 billion they are \ngoing to come back and ask for, for another ice breaker, so why would \nwe spend $88 million doing that?\n  We are going to spend $448 million to build the Department of \nHomeland Security a new building. We have $1.3 trillion worth of empty \nbuildings right now, and because it has been blocked in Congress we \ncan't sell them, we can't raze them, we can't do anything, but we are \ngoing to spend money on a new building here in Washington. We are going \nto spend another $248 million for new furniture for that building; a \nquarter of a billion dollars for new furniture. What about the \nfurniture the Department of Homeland Security has now? These are tough \ntimes. Should we be buying new furniture? How about using what we have? \nThat is what a family would do. They would use what they have. They \nwouldn't go out and spend $248 million on furniture.\n\n  How about buying $600 million worth of hybrid vehicles? Do you know \nwhat I would say? Right now times are tough; I would rather Americans \nhave new cars than Federal employees have new cars. What is wrong with \nthe cars we have? Dumping $600 million worth\n\n[[Page S1426]]\n\nof used vehicles on the used vehicle market right now is one of the \nworst things we could do. Instead, we are going to spend $600 million \nbuying new cars for Federal employees.\n  There is $400 million in here to prevent STDs. I have a lot of \nexperience on that. I have delivered 4,000 babies. We don't need to \nspend $400 million on STDs. What we need to do is properly educate \nabout the infection rates and the effectiveness of methods of \nprevention. That doesn't take a penny more. You can write that on one \npiece of paper and teach every kid in this country, but we don't need \nto spend $400 million on it. It is not a priority.\n  How about $1.4 billion for rural waste disposal programs? That might \neven be somewhat stimulative. New sewers. That might create jobs.\n  How about $150 million for a Smithsonian museum? Tell me how that \nhelps get us out of a recession. Tell me how that is a priority. Would \nthe average American think that is a priority that we ought to be \nmortgaging our kids' future to spend another $150 million at the \nSmithsonian?\n  How about $1 billion for the 2010 census? So everybody knows, the \ncensus is so poorly managed that the census this year is going to cost \ntwice--in 2010 is going to cost twice what it cost 10 years ago, and we \nwasted $800 million on a contract because it was no-bid that didn't \nperform. Nobody got fired, no competitive bidding, and we blew $800 \nmillion.\n  We have $75 million for smoking cessation activities, which probably \nis a great idea, but we just passed a bill--the SCHIP bill--that we \nneed to get 21 million more Americans smoking to be able to pay for \nthat bill. That doesn't make sense.\n  How about $200 million for public computer centers at community \ncolleges? Since when is a community college in my State a recipient of \nFederal largesse? Is that our responsibility? I mean, did we talk with \nDell and Hewlett-Packard and say, How do we make you all do better? Is \nthere not a market force that could make that better? Will we actually \nbuy on a true competitive bid? No, because there is nothing that \nrequires competitive bidding in anything in this bill. There is nothing \nthat requires it. It is one of the things President Obama said he was \ngoing to mandate at the Federal Government, but there is no competitive \nbidding in this bill at all.\n  We have $10 million to inspect canals in urban areas. Well, that will \nput 10 or 15 people to work. Is that a priority for us right now?\n  There is $6 billion to turn Federal buildings into green buildings. \nThat is a priority, versus somebody getting a job outside of \nWashington, a job that actually produces something, that actually \nincreases wealth?\n  How about $500 million for State and local fire stations? Where do \nyou find in the Constitution us paying for local fire stations within \nour realm of prerogatives? None of it is competitively bid--not a grant \nprogram.\n  Next is $1.2 billion for youth activities. Who does that employ? What \ndoes that mean?\n  How about $88 million for renovating the public health service \nbuilding? You know, if we could sell half of the $1.3 trillion worth of \nproperties we have, we could take care of every Federal building \nrequirement and backlog we have.\n  Then there's $412 million for CDC buildings and property. We spent \nbillions on a new center and headquarters for CDC. Is that a priority? \nBuilding another Government building instead of--if we are going to \nspend $412 million on building buildings, let's build one that will \nproduce something, one that will give us something.\n  How about $850 million for that most ``efficient'' Amtrak that hasn't \nmade any money since 1976 and continues to have $2 billion or $3 \nbillion a year in subsidies?\n  Here is one of my favorites: $75 million to construct a new \n``security training'' facility for State Department security officers, \nand we have four other facilities already available to train them. But \nit is not theirs. They want theirs. By the way, it is going to be in \nWest Virginia. I wonder how that got there. So we are going to build a \nnew training facility that duplicates four others that we already have \nthat could easily do what we need to do. But because we have a stimulus \npackage, we are going to add in oink pork.\n  How about $200 million in funding for a lease--not buying, but a \nlease of alternative energy vehicles on military installations? We are \ngoing to bail out the States on Medicaid. Total all of the health \nprograms in this, and we are going to transfer $150 billion out of the \nprivate sector and we are going to move it to the Federal Government. \nYou talk about backdooring national health care. Henry Waxman has to be \nsmiling big today. He wants a single-payer Government-run health care \nsystem. We are going to move another $150 billion to the Federal \nGovernment from the private sector.\n  We are going to eliminate fees on loans from the Small Business \nAdministration. You know what that does? That pushes productive capital \nto unproductive projects. It is exactly the wrong thing to do.\n  Then there is $160 million to the Job Corps Program--but not for jobs \nand not to put more people in the Job Corps but to construct or repair \nbuildings.\n  We are going to spend $524 million for information technology \nupgrades that the Appropriations Committee claims will create 388 jobs. \nIf you do the math on that, that is $1.5 million a job. Don't you love \nthe efficiency of Washington thinking?\n  We are going to create $79 billion in additional money for the \nStates, a ``slush fund,'' to bail out States and provide millions of \ndollars for education costs. How many of you think that will ever go \naway? Once the State education programs get $79 billion over 2 years, \ndo you think that will ever go away? The cry and hue of taking our \nmoney away--even though it was a stimulus and supposed to be limited, \nit will never go away. So we will continue putting that forward until \nour kids have grandkids of their own.\n  There is about $47 billion for a variety of energy programs that are \nprimarily focused on renewable energy. I am fine with spending that. \nBut we ought to get something for it. There ought to be metrics. There \nare no metrics. It is pie in the sky, saying we will throw some money \nat it. Let me conclude by saying we are at a seminal moment in our \ncountry. We will either start living within the confines of realism and \nresponsibility or we will blow it and we will create the downfall of \nthe greatest Nation that ever lived. This bill is the start of that \ndownfall. To abandon a market-oriented society and transfer it to a \nSoviet-style, government-centered, bureaucratic-run and mandated \nprogram, that is the thing that will put the stake in the heart of \nfreedom in this country.\n  I hope the American people know what is in this bill. I am doing \neverything I can to make sure they know. But more important, I hope \nsomebody is listening who will treat the ``pneumonia'' we are faced \nwith today, which is the housing and mortgage markets. It doesn't \nmatter how much money we spend in this bill. It is doomed to failure \nunless we fix that problem first. Failing that, we will go down in \nhistory as the Congress that undermined the future and vitality of this \ncountry. Let it not be so.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of you and the staff. With \nthat, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this week, the Senate is considering \ncritical legislation to renew our economy and to renew America's \npromise of prosperity and security for all of its citizens. I have long \nheld the view that American innovation can and should play a vital role \nin revitalizing our economy and in improving our Nation's health care \nsystem. I commend the lead sponsors of this legislation for making sure \nthat the economic recovery package includes an investment in health \ninformation technology that also takes meaningful steps to protect the \nprivacy of American consumers.\n  The privacy protections for electronic health records in the economic \nrecovery package are essential to a successful national health IT \nsystem, and these safeguards should not be weakened. In America today, \nif you have a health record, you have a health privacy problem. The \nexplosion of electronic health records, digital databases, and the \nInternet is fueling a growing supply of and demand for Americans' \nhealth information. The ability to easily access this information \nelectronically--often by the click\n\n[[Page S1427]]\n\nof a mouse or a few keystrokes on a computer can be very useful in \nproviding more cost-effective health care. But the use of advancing \ntechnologies to access and share health information can also lead to a \nloss of personal privacy.\n  Without adequate safeguards to protect health privacy, many Americans \nwill simply not seek the medical treatment that they need for fear that \ntheir sensitive health information will be disclosed without their \nconsent. And those who do seek medical treatment assume the risk of \ndata security breaches and other privacy violations. Likewise, health \ncare providers who perceive the privacy risks associated with health IT \nsystems as inconsistent with their professional obligations will avoid \nparticipating in a national health IT system.\n  The economic recovery package takes several important steps to avoid \nthese pitfalls and to protect Americans' health information privacy. \nFirst, the provisions give each individual the right to access his or \nher own electronic health records and the right to timely notice of \ndata breaches involving their health information. The economic recovery \nbill also places critical restrictions on the sale of sensitive health \ndata and requires that the Department of Health and Human Services \neducates and conducts outreach to American consumers and businesses \nregarding their privacy rights and obligations. Lastly, the bill \nenhances the enforcement tools available to the States, as well as to \nFederal authorities, to deter lax health information privacy. These key \nprivacy safeguards must not be weakened as the Senate considers the \neconomic recovery bill.\n  Of course, more can--and should--be done in the weeks and months \nahead to further improve health information privacy, such as \nstrengthening the rights of consumers to control their own electronic \nhealth records. In Vermont, we have formed a public-private partnership \nthat is charged with developing Vermont's statewide electronic health \ninformation system, including a policy on privacy. I believe that in \norder for a national health IT system to succeed, we in Congress should \nfollow Vermont's good example and work together for the long term with \npublic and private stakeholders to ensure the privacy and security of \nelectronic health records.\n  As the Senate considers the economic recovery package, we face many \ndifficult challenges in our Nation. The challenge of finding the right \nbalance between privacy and efficiency for a national health IT system \nis just one, but it is an important test that we must meet head on. \nWithout meaningful privacy safeguards, our Nation's health IT system \nwill fail its citizens. In his inaugural address, President Obama \neloquently noted that in our new era of responsibility ``there is \nnothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character than \ngiving our all to a difficult task.'' The privacy safeguards in the \neconomic recovery package take an important step toward tackling the \ndifficult but essential task of ensuring meaningful health information \nprivacy for all Americans.\n  Again, I commend the lead sponsors of the economic recovery bill and \nPresident Obama for their commitment to include meaningful health \nprivacy protections in the bill. I also commend the many stakeholders, \nincluding the Center for Democracy & Technology, Consumers Unions, the \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, and Microsoft, that have advocated \ntirelessly for meaningful health IT privacy protections in this \nlegislation. I urge all Members to support the health IT privacy \nprotections in the bill, so that our national health care system will \nhave the support and confidence of the American people.\n  I ask to have a copy of a February 1, 2009, editorial from the New \nYork Times in support of funding protections for patients' privacy \nentitled, ``Your E-Health Records,'' printed in the Record following my \nfull statement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 1, 2009]\n\n                         Your E-Health Records\n\n       As part of the stimulus package, $20 billion will be pumped \n     into the health care system to accelerate the use of \n     electronic health records. The goal is both to improve the \n     quality and lower the costs of care by replacing cumbersome \n     paper records with electronic records that can be easily \n     stored and swiftly transmitted.\n       The idea is sound, but it also raises important questions \n     about how to ensure the privacy of patients. Fortunately, the \n     legislation would impose sensible privacy protections despite \n     attempts by business lobbyists to weaken the safeguards.\n       With paper records the opportunities for breaches are \n     limited to over-the-shoulder glimpses or the occasional lost \n     or stolen files. But when records are kept and transferred \n     electronically, the potential for abuse can become as vast as \n     the Internet.\n       Electronic health records that can be linked to individual \n     patients are already protected by laws that apply primarily \n     to hospitals, doctors, nursing homes, pharmacists, \n     laboratories and insurance plans. The stimulus bill that has \n     passed in the House, and a similar bill awaiting approval in \n     the Senate, would strengthen the privacy requirements and \n     apply them more directly to ``business associates'' of the \n     providers, like billing and collection services or pharmacy \n     benefit managers, that have access to sensitive data but are \n     not readily held accountable for any misuse.\n       The potential for harm was spelled out by the American \n     Civil Liberties Union in a recent letter to Congress. \n     Employers who obtain medical records inappropriately might \n     reject a job candidate who looks expensive to insure. Drug \n     companies with access to pharmaceutical records might try to \n     pressure patients to switch to their products. Data brokers \n     might buy medical and pharmaceutical records and sell them to \n     marketers. Unscrupulous employees with access to electronic \n     records might snoop on the health of their colleagues or \n     neighbors.\n       The bills pending in Congress would go a long way toward \n     preventing such abuses. They would outlaw the sale of any \n     personal health information without the patient's permission, \n     mandate audit trails to help detect inappropriate access, and \n     require that patients be notified whenever their records are \n     lost or used for an unauthorized purpose. They would also \n     beef up the penalties for noncompliance and allow state \n     attorneys general to help enforce the rules--a useful backup \n     in case the federal government falls down on the job. The \n     House version would also encourage the use of protective \n     technologies, like encryption, to protect personal medical \n     information that will be transmitted.\n       Health insurance plans and some disease management groups \n     are complaining that the new requirements would impose \n     administrative burdens that could actually impede the use of \n     electronic records and interfere with coordination of care. \n     They want to ease the marketing restrictions, notify patients \n     only if security breaches are harmful, and keep the attorneys \n     general out of the enforcement role.\n       It should be possible through implementing regulations to \n     fine-tune the privacy requirements so that they do not \n     disrupt patient care. Congress must make every effort to \n     ensure that patients' privacy is protected.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my colleague and friend Senator Coburn of \nOklahoma spoke at length about our Nation's deficit. I share his \nconcern about the impact of debt on future generations. It is an \ninteresting moment in time when many of my friends from that side of \nthe aisle are raising the issue of deficits and debt. We are in one of \nthe most serious economic crises of our time--maybe the most serious \nsince the Great Depression. This President, recently inaugurated, 2 \nweeks ago, inherited the worst economic situation since Franklin \nRoosevelt in the Great Depression in 1933. He inherited a debt that was \nunimaginable 8 years ago when the previous President began his \nadministration. When President Bush came to office, our national debt \nwas in the range of $5 trillion. When he left office, he doubled that \nnational debt to more than $10 trillion--in an 8-year period of time. \nThe accumulated debt of the United States of America,\n\n[[Page S1428]]\n\nfrom its inception to that moment, was $5 trillion; in 8 years \nPresident Bush doubled the national debt.\n  Many people believe it is going to continue to grow because of some \nof the decisions he made. One was to wage a war and not pay for it, \nadding almost $1 trillion to our national debt in the process. Many \nother decisions, such as cutting taxes at a time when our country \ncouldn't afford it, and it turned out to be foolhardy and with little \npositive impact on our economy, President Obama inherited that. Now he \nis faced with not only that debt, which my colleague from Oklahoma has \naptly described, but also an economic crisis that cannot be ignored.\n  We were told a week ago that the gross domestic product of the United \nStates of America had declined precipitously for the first time in 25 \nyears. It is an indication that our sense of economic decline has been \nborne out by the numbers and statistics. We see it in every State with \nincreased unemployment. So President Obama is faced with a terrible \nsituation: the largest deficit and debt in the history of the United \nStates, left by the previous President, and the worst economic crisis \nin 75 years.\n  Well, my colleague who spoke is a medical doctor. He knows the first \nthing you have to do in the most serious trauma cases is to try to \nstabilize the patient, and that is what President Obama is trying to \ndo, stabilize the economy. Every economist--virtually every one--\nliberal and conservative, agrees that you cannot stabilizes the economy \nby cutting spending. You have to do the opposite. You have to encourage \neconomic activity, economic growth, business, jobs. Those are the \nthings that have to be done, and the Government must spend money, even \nif it is in debt. Failing to do that will cause our economy to decline \neven further, and more suffering will be borne by the families and \nbusinesses across America.\n  So when the Senator from Oklahoma comes to the floor and says this is \nthe wrong time to spend money, I have to tell him that there is no \nrecourse but to try to get this economy moving forward by creating \ngood-paying jobs in America, investing in our future, making sure we \nare moving toward energy independence, trying to prepare our \neducational resources for the 21st century by modernizing labs and \nlibraries and classrooms, trying to bring the kind of changes to health \ncare where technology will make health care more affordable and safer \nfor patients across America. These are investments that will not only \nhelp us through the current recession but will pay off for decades to \ncome.\n  We are clearly spending this money in a deficit situation because we \nhave no choice. Across the Rotunda in the House of Representatives, \nwhen President Obama's recovery and reinvestment bill came forward, not \na single Republican Representative would vote for it. That is \nunfortunate. The President reached out to them personally and asked \nthem to join him in a bipartisan effort, both political parties \ncooperating and working together. Sadly, it didn't occur.\n  I hope that is not the case in the Senate. I trust that some \nRepublican Senators will come forward and realize that we are making a \ngood-faith effort to accommodate any reasonable change they want to \nmake to the program. If they want to reduce spending in some areas, we \nare open to it. If they have ideas that are better than ours, we are \nopen to them as well. I tried to make that clear. I think my colleagues \non this side and the White House have tried to make that clear.\n  At the end of the day, we are going to have to face reality. We will \nbe spending money now to try to stop this economic tailspin. Once we \nget the economy stabilized and start investing toward growth again so \npeople have peace of mind about their jobs and businesses, savings, and \nthe future, then we can address responsibly, as we must, the deficit \nand debt situation. I look forward to working with the Senator from \nOklahoma when that day arrives. Right now, we have to stabilize the \npatient.\n  I say to my friend, Dr. Coburn, join us in this important effort, and \nthen we can join hands together and try to find the way through the \nfiscal problems we are currently facing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/03/senate-section/article/S1428-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1428-S1429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SITUATION IN SRI LANKA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, The ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka that has \nwaxed and waned for decades costing the lives of tens of thousands of \npeople has exploded into a full scale war, and it is civilians who are \nbearing the brunt of the carnage.\n  The origins of the conflict arise from decades of the Sinhalese \nmajority's systematic discrimination against the Tamil minority and its \ndenial of the Tamils' meaningful participation in the political \nprocess. The Sri Lankan army is almost exclusively Sinhalese. \nSuccessive Sinhalese-dominated governments have failed to effectively \naddress these longstanding injustices.\n  Over the years, peaceful demonstrations by Tamils have been met with \nviolence by Sinhalese extremists, which has in turn fostered violent \nextremism on the Tamil side.\n  In recent weeks, as the Sri Lankan army has seized control of most of \nthe northern strongholds of the Tamil Tigers, or LTTE as they are \notherwise known, the situation has gone from dire to the verge of \ncatastrophe for the estimated 250,000 vulnerable civilians who are \ntrapped in a so-called ``safe zone.''\n  The LTTE has a history of suicide bombings and other indiscriminate \nattacks against civilians, using civilians as shields, and preventing \ncivilians under their control from escaping to government areas. \nSeveral hundred local staff of the United Nations and international \nhumanitarian organizations are reportedly trapped because the LTTE \nrefuses to allow them to leave. The LTTE has been designated a foreign \nterrorist organization by the United States.\n  For its part, the Sri Lankan army insists it is targeting the LTTE, \nnot civilians. But the army has also acted in ways that have blurred \nany meaningful distinction between itself and the LTTE. It has \nreportedly shelled areas populated by civilians, including hospitals, \ncausing hundreds of casualties, summarily executed suspected LTTE \nsympathizers, and detained those who have fled LTTE areas, including \nwomen and children, in militarized camps where they are exposed to \ngreat hardship and danger.\n  The United Nations says a compound sheltering U.N. national staff \ninside the safety zone was shelled on January 24 and 25, killing at \nleast 9 civilians and wounding more than 20. On January 26, another \nartillery attack reportedly narrowly missed UN local staff working in \nthe safety zone but caused dozens of civilian deaths. The International \nCommittee of the Red Cross has said that ``[h]undreds of patients need \nemergency treatment and evacuation to [a] hospital in the government-\ncontrolled area.''\n  In the past 2 days, another hospital was reportedly shelled multiple \ntimes, resulting in more civilian deaths and injuries.\n  Human Rights Watch reports that since last September, when the Sri \nLankan government ordered the withdrawal of most UN and nongovernmental \nhumanitarian organizations, as well as journalists, from the conflicted \narea, a grave humanitarian crisis has developed with acute shortages of \nfood, shelter, medicine, and other humanitarian supplies.\n  The Sri Lankan government has a duty to respect the rights and \nprotect the safety of all Sri Lankan citizens, whatever their ethnic \norigin or political views. Instead, the government has embarked on a \nstrategy to defeat the LTTE militarily and in doing so has shown \ndisregard for the laws of war. Rather than protecting the Tamil people, \nthe government has often contributed to their suffering. Its strategy \nhas been to cordon off the area and blame everything, including its own \nviolations, on the LTTE.\n  Since 1984, successive peace talks have failed, as both the LTTE and \nthe Sri Lankan government have reneged on their agreements, and the \ngovernment has failed to provide the vision and leadership necessary to \nbuild a multi-ethnic consensus. Both sides' extreme ethnic nationalist \nagendas have caused widespread human suffering. Both sides are \naccountable.\n  I have no sympathy for the LTTE, which has brought misery upon the \nTamil people it professes to represent. But while the LTTE has been \nseverely weakened, it is unlikely to disappear,\n\n[[Page S1429]]\n\nand the cycle of violence may continue.\n  It is imperative that the government and the LTTE agree to an \nimmediate cease-fire to avoid further loss of life, permit access to \nU.N. monitors and humanitarian organizations, and permit civilians to \nleave for areas of safety. The Obama administration, the British, \nIndian and other concerned governments, should be publicly urging the \nsame.\n  Over the longer term, if lasting peace is to come to Sri Lanka, the \ngovernment must effectively address, in negotiations which include all \nthe main Tamil and Muslim parties, the core issues that have fueled the \nconflict including laws and policies that unfairly discriminate against \nSri Lanka's minorities.\n  There is a related issue that needs to be mentioned, and that is the \nimprisonment for the past ten months of J.S. Tissainayagam, a \njournalist, and N. Jashiharan, a publisher, and his wife, V. Valamathy. \nThey were arrested for articles critical of the government, and are \nbeing held in violation of their right to freedom of expression. \nAnother of Sri Lankan's most respected journalists, Lasantha \nWickrematunga, was gunned down in broad daylight a few weeks ago. \nAccording to Navi Pillay, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, \n``[t]he killing of . . . Wickrematunge . . . was the latest blow to the \nfree expression of dissent in Sri Lanka. The searing article he wrote \nprophesying his own murder is an extraordinary indictment of a system \ncorrupted by more than two decades of bloody internal conflict.'' The \nHigh Commissioner noted that there have not been any prosecutions of \npolitical killings, disappearances and other violations committed in \nrecent years. That in itself speaks volumes about the Sri Lankan \ngovernment's credibility.\n  For many years, the United States and Sri Lanka have enjoyed good \nrelations. A close friend of mine, James Spain, was our Ambassador \nthere years ago. He often told me of his deep affection for the Sri \nLankan people, and of the country's extraordinary natural beauty.\n  When the tsunami crashed ashore in December 2004, a member of my \nstaff was on the island. The American people responded generously to \nhelp Sri Lanka rebuild.\n  It has therefore been difficult for me to watch the conflict \nintensify, the LTTE abuse civilians and fail to live up to its \ncommitments, and the government threaten to expel foreign diplomats, \naid agencies and journalists, and refuse appeals to permit independent \nobservers and aid workers access to areas where Tamil civilians are \ntrapped. And as reputable, courageous journalists have been arrested on \ntransparently political charges or assassinated.\n  The Sri Lanka government will one day want the respect and support of \nthe United States. The same can be said of the LTTE, if and when it \nrenounces violence and becomes a legitimate political party. How they \nrespond to today's humanitarian appeals will weigh heavily on how the \nUnited States responds when that day comes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/03/senate-section/article/S1429-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE IDAHO NATIONAL LAB\n\n  MR. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I wish to acknowledge a milestone of \nsingular significance for Idaho and for the Nation. This month marks \nthe 60th anniversary of the Idaho National Laboratory.\n  In February 1949, the Federal Government settled on a site in east \ncentral Idaho to host the National Reactor Testing Station--a place \nwhere scientists and engineers could come together to develop and test \nnew ways to put the power of the atom to productive use for society. In \nshort order, Experimental Breeder Reactor-I was designed, built and \noperating--producing the world's first usable amount of electricity \nfrom nuclear power and later, proving that reactors could produce, or \nbreed, more fuel than they consume.\n  Breakthrough after breakthrough followed in the ensuing years, \nincluding significant contributions to national security with the \ndevelopment of the nuclear propulsion systems for U.S. Navy submarines \nand aircraft carriers. The Idaho testing station was the genesis of \nAmerican civilian nuclear power, responsible for powering an American \ncity for the first time with nuclear-generated electricity, as well as \nthe design and construction of 52 pioneering nuclear reactors. The \nIdaho testing station was responsible for the development of world \nleading reactor safety codes and the operation of the Nation's premier \nmaterials testing device--the Advanced Test Reactor.\n  Building on its unsurpassed nuclear energy expertise and in \nrecognition of its broader capabilities and unique assets, our Idaho \n``testing station'' was formally designated a national laboratory in \n1974. And the pace of innovation has only accelerated since. The lab's \nresearchers have received dozens of R 100, Bright Light, Federal \nLaboratory Consortium and related awards for the development of \ntechnologies as diverse as concealed weapons detection systems and \nnovel electrolyte batteries. The lab's central location within the \nWestern Inland Energy Corridor--a band stretching from western Canada \ndown through our nation's Intermountain and Rocky Mountain West--place \nit in a remarkable position to identify, assess and integrate the \ncorridor's unmatched wind, biomass, hydropower, geothermal, \nconventional and unconventional fossil and uranium resources.\n  At 60, the Idaho National Lab's relevance to the Nation could not be \ngreater. Its mission to ``Ensure the nation's energy security with \nsafe, competitive, and sustainable energy systems and unique national \nand homeland security capabilities,'' represents a pledge to serve by \neach of the lab's nearly 4,000 employees, as well as the management \nteam and partners from institutions of higher education in Idaho and \nnationwide.\n  I congratulate the employees, management team and community partners \nof the Idaho National Lab on the occasion of its 60th anniversary and \nlook forward to many more years of success, built on this matchless \nlegacy of science and engineering innovation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/03/senate-section/article/S1429-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1429-S1431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       First of all I appreciate all your efforts in this manner \n     and hopefully some relief will become of them. Secondly this \n     letter may be a bit different than most of the others you \n     have received. I, like many others feel the burden of \n     increasing fuel prices and wonder ``why'' prices have risen \n     so much in the past few months. I also have deep concerns for \n     the dependence of foreign oil this country is a slave to. \n     However, we Americans are for the most part, myself included, \n     are selfish, wasteful and will not give up our conveniences. \n     Therefore I personally do not mind the higher price of fuel \n     (but hopefully the prices will drop) in the aspect that \n     hopefully it will encourage people to be a bit more \n     conservative. I am fortunate that my wife and I live less \n     than three miles from where we work (separate business) in \n     the past we both have driven our vehicles. My personal \n     vehicle is a Ford F250 that gets 10 mpg. I have been driving \n     for the convenience, but recently we have begun riding \n     together (we also have a Ford Escape at 25 mpg), walking that \n     takes about 45 minutes, riding bicycles at about 15 minutes \n     and I also have a motorcycle that gets 55 mpg that I have \n     dusted off and begun to ride. So it is not all bad. I also \n     realize most people are not that fortunate. The things that \n     bother me the most are that in the land of plenty, our auto \n     manufacturers are still producing vehicles that get under 15 \n     mpg; it is way past time for that to change. Domestic oil \n     production needs to be increased, but please do it sensibly. \n     Consider\n\n[[Page S1430]]\n\n     the environmental impact and make sure U.S. oil stays in the \n     U.S., and the fact that oil companies are reported to be \n     making record profits. Everyone is entitled to make a profit, \n     but profiteering is unacceptable.\n       Sorry for rambling on but as you hopefully can see, I feel \n     the higher fuel prices are an opportunity for the American \n     ingenuity to kick in with more fuel efficient vehicles, \n     commuter options i.e., walking, carpooling, alternate \n     transportation, and alternative fuels so we as Americans can \n     reduce our dependence on oil and still satisfy our selfish \n     lust for independence.\n     Greg Hosman, Bellevue.\n                                  ____\n\n       There are many folks on the edge of losing jobs simply \n     because they cannot afford the fuel to drive to work. Pairing \n     job opportunities and increasing availability of affordable \n     fuel makes sense. One tenth of one percent in a wilderness of \n     19 million acres is a smaller percentage per acre than a \n     person leaves on one camping trip. It is a small price to \n     pay. Please continue to support President Bush's desire to \n     restore reasonable economics to our country. Thanks for \n     standing up.\n     Delpha Bush, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am strongly opposed to lifting the ban on off-shore \n     drilling and strongly against drilling in our wild areas. I \n     am also against the use of food crops for ethanol or any \n     policy that reduces the availability of food to the world \n     poor. I am very supportive of alternative energy and \n     government funded research in these areas. I am strongly in \n     favor of increased mileage requirements on vehicles. If \n     Europe can get 50 miles to the gallon, we should be able \n     to do so also. Thank you for your interest in this area.\n     Laura and Bill Asbell, Post Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       I moved to Idaho to go camping fishing day trips etc. . . . \n     now because of the gas prices I stay in Nampa most of the \n     time. I have a family and I work hard . . . I want to enjoy \n     life in Idaho again. Please if you can do anything to help \n     get life back the way it was that would be great. Thanks \n     again.\n     Elbie Seibert, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       Everytime I pass the gas station the price rises. Granted \n     myself and my husband chose to have the vehicles that we \n     drive, he drives a Chevrolet Duramax and I drive a Chevrolet \n     Surburban, but these are the vehicles that accommodate our \n     lifestyle of kids, dogs and camping. But when I see the oil \n     companies making unheard-of profits in the first quarter of \n     2008 it infuriates me! I would not be as upset if the oil \n     companies would be upfront with the price increase if they \n     were only breaking even in their numbers. But making over a \n     thirty billion dollar profit in the first three months of \n     this year is just wrong. Family trips to Eastern Idaho to \n     visit family has been cut back from monthly visits to once \n     every couple of months. We are lucky that we are not in the \n     situation of having to choose groceries over gas but if the \n     cost of fuel keeps climbing we will also be in the same boat \n     as other lower income families. I have worked too hard to \n     have the lifestyle that my family has for it to be sucked \n     away by greedy executives!!! My husband, my stepfather and I \n     all serve in the Idaho Army National Guard and we have \n     soldiers that are having a hard time getting to their units \n     due to the cost of fuel. Something must be done and I would \n     not be taking ``no'' for an answer. $4.00 a gallon of fuel is \n     insane. Nothing has been changed to the fuel to have our \n     vehicles preform better and no one is getting a cost of \n     living increase for this.\n     Heather.\n                                  ____\n\n       I recently received an email from you requesting stories of \n     how the rising gas prices are effecting Idaho families. We \n     are a family of five trying to make ends meet on one income. \n     The gas prices have made this virtually impossible. We are \n     now looking at my husband either taking a second job or my \n     going to work part time to make ends meet. My husband's \n     commute to work is about 30 minutes and I drive the same \n     distance to take my children to activities four days per \n     week. We have a van and a truck and spend about $400 a month \n     on gas. Buying other vehicles is not an option because they \n     are paid for and we cannot afford a monthly car payment. \n     Moving closer to work is also not an option given the current \n     housing market. The other issue we have seen is the rising \n     cost of groceries as a direct result of the rise in gas \n     prices. It is getting harder to feed our family with the \n     rising cost of groceries and we are having to change the way \n     we eat as a result. We are now looking at cutting the extra-\n     curricular activities for our kids to save on gas.\n       We are very encouraged by your desire to persuade Congress \n     to start using the resources we have in our own country. It \n     is time for a change towards becoming more independent as a \n     country. We will continue to pray for success in your \n     efforts.\n     Michelle Esquivel, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       My 60-year-old daughter spent 23 years as an ``at will'' \n     employee and was fired for no reason. She was a Medical \n     Transcriptionist. After so many years the requirements \n     changed and when looking for a new position, found she was no \n     longer qualified. Longevity did not seem to matter. She drove \n     40 miles round trip from Caldwell at night to work in a small \n     hospital in Boise. This did not last very long as another \n     person got her job and worked at home, something that she \n     would have done had she been aware that her employer would \n     have agreed to it. Their sorry did not help. She then lived \n     off of her retirement at the same time supporting her \n     daughter and grandson. When she left her original job she \n     lost her insurance benefits and has not been able to afford \n     any. After her savings were exhausted she found a job \n     delivering the Statesman newspaper. She is required to \n     furnish her own car and gas. It so happens that her route is \n     rural and covers over 35 miles per night. I help out with the \n     gas as much as I can. As gas prices continue to rise she can \n     hardly afford to go to work and the wear and tear on her \n     car with all the stops and starts becomes another expense.\n       I am 86 years old. My family came to Boise in 1861. I am \n     signing my name to this message but request it never be used.\n     Unsigned.\n                                  ____\n\n       I want to encourage you to not support drilling in ANWR or \n     any currently protected Alaska lands. The high gas prices and \n     our dependence on foreign oil have been hard to stomach, but \n     I believe there are necessary lessons learned for the public. \n     We must decrease our insatiable thirst for natural resources \n     in this country. High gas and fuel prices have made people \n     think hard about changing their driving habits and some of \n     their domestic habits as well. Idaho Power has been \n     encouraging conservation for a few years now, much to their \n     merit, but I do not know how successful their campaign has \n     been. There have not been any great heating/cooling crises \n     yet such as brown or black outs to push people to change.\n       Personally, I carpool to work with my husband just about \n     every day, unless I am on call (I work in a hospital). Even \n     though I work eight hour days and my husband works nine hour \n     days, I either walk over to his office and wait for him to \n     finish, I bring my running gear and take a run while waiting \n     for him, or I find something else to keep me busy for that \n     extra hour. Sure it's a little inconvenient. I have animals \n     to feed, pastures, a yard, and a garden to water and tend to, \n     and the usual chores one has waiting for them at the end of a \n     work day. However, I believe this small sacrifice is one I \n     can shoulder. Additionally, this means that I only have to \n     fill my small truck once a month. On other days, I try to \n     ride my bike to the store, post office, etc., rather than \n     making an extra car trip. If I have errands to run in my car, \n     I will combine trips into one big loop, on one day, to \n     minimize the amount and time I need to be driving. As far as \n     our consumption of energy at home, we are fortunate enough to \n     have lots of shade trees, a well insulated house, blinds on \n     all of our windows, and an efficient attic fan to keep our \n     house relatively cool on hot days. Last summer during the \n     extensive heat wave we experienced here in SW Idaho I charted \n     the high temperature for the day and the time our AC came on \n     for about 6 weeks. We keep our thermostat set at 79 degrees \n     while we are at work and decrease it to 76 or 77 for the 6 pm \n     to 10 pm time period. We were able to keep our house cool \n     enough 99 percent of those over 100 degree days that the AC \n     didn't come on until after 6 pm and ran only one to two \n     cycles before we were able to open up our windows to cool to \n     outside temps, which by 10 pm were usually below 77 degrees. \n     Our energy bill remained low for the whole summer due to our \n     conservation methods. I am doing the same this summer.\n       I would like to add that, although I oppose drilling in our \n     last wilderness areas, I fully support conservation \n     incentives and ramping up research and support for \n     alternative energy sources, including nuclear. I hope the \n     proposed nuclear plant in Elmore County receives enough \n     positive support from the public to go ahead. Nuclear energy \n     technologies have advanced a lot since the 70's. I believe \n     with some education for the general public about its \n     increased safety nuclear energy can greatly reduce our \n     dependency on hydrocarbon sources of energy.\n     Angela Callahan, Eagle.\n                                  ____\n\n       Fortunately, we have 2 Toyotas that get good gas mileage \n     and last fall I was transferred to work at St. Als, which is \n     very close to my home. So gas expenses for me have not been \n     as much of an issue as for others. However, in my work at the \n     outpatient pharmacy we have many customers who come from \n     Nampa, Caldwell, even Mountain Home, and for them to make \n     that drive is quite a hardship. Usually, it is specifically \n     to come to the doctor and/or pharmacy only; if they were not \n     coming for that they would not be coming to Boise at all. We \n     have had some prescriptions transferred out to pharmacies in \n     those communities because people cannot afford to drive into \n     Boise. So, it is hurting our business.\n       I would like to see a better Treasure Valley-wide \n     transportation system to help people get to where they need \n     to go without having to spend a fortune. For some of these \n     people the choice is between medicine or food, and this is \n     not some exaggerated sob story. It is fact. I would also like \n     to see more being done to encourage and fund alternative \n     energy sources, more emphasis on hybrid cars, or even those \n     that run on no gasoline, but on something else that is less \n     expensive, less polluting, and easier to produce. The \n     initial cost of such a changeover would be enormous, but \n     the long term benefits would more than make up for this \n     total makeover of our energy sources.\n     Cheryl Essary, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       First, I express my appreciation for your willingness to be \n     in Washington to not only represent Idaho but to help ensure \n     that we\n\n[[Page S1431]]\n\n     have men of high moral integrity making decisions about the \n     future of our beloved United States of America.\n       With respect to high energy prices, I am very disappointed \n     that our Federal Congress has shamefully neglected their \n     responsibility to find a way to develop a national energy \n     policy before we arrived at this rather extreme condition. \n     Having worked as an oil and gas geologist in Houston, Texas \n     before returning to Idaho, I know that it has never been a \n     secret that our addiction to oil and natural gas was leading \n     us into trouble as the opportunities to explore for large \n     reserves continued to decline.\n       As a nation, we have been so negligent about seeing past \n     the next election that our policies do not seem capable of \n     meeting the challenges of a world that is now interdependent \n     in so many ways. It has been and still is ridiculous to \n     remove so many regions of offshore from oil and gas \n     exploration and development. ANWR, in my opinion should be \n     developed and if we are successful in finding additional \n     resources there, use that for strategic reserves because we \n     all understand that it is not likely to be significantly \n     large in and by itself. Why is it so hard to communicate to \n     those who are extreme (including John McCain) in their \n     environmentalist/preservationist theologies that oil \n     companies can explore and develop resources with such a small \n     footprint that the ecological impacts are essentially \n     negligible?\n       At the same time that I hear many in Congress calling for \n     the rights to explore in additional areas, I really have not \n     heard anything addressing the need to increase our refinery \n     capacity or to deal with the myriad of gasoline blends that \n     are required by EPA that reduce efficiencies in refining, nor \n     does there seem to be anything coming to rural America to \n     help with public transportation initiatives.\n       The Federal Government's overzealous effort to promote \n     biofuels at the expense of food production seems to have been \n     a huge mistake. Why was a similar effort of support not \n     provided for oil shale or coal gasification etc.? With new \n     EPA regulations governing carbon output it seems that we have \n     added so much uncertainty into the business side of \n     developing alternative resources that the risks may outweigh \n     the potential successes.\n       Also, information I have received from the American \n     Geologic Institute indicates that if the value of the dollar \n     had kept pace with the Euro and other world currencies, oil \n     prices would be in the $60 to $70 dollar range instead of the \n     >$130 level. It seems clear that we must find a way to stop \n     the declining value of the American dollar!\n       You have an incredibly difficult job ahead of you as you \n     try to find a path that will lead to lower energy costs and \n     improved economic prosperity for all of the citizens of our \n     country. Our prayers are with you.\n     Mark D.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize the University \nof Sioux Falls Cougars men's football team for winning the 2008 \nNational Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, NAIA, National \nChampionship and for finishing at the top of the NAIA Coaches' Top 25 \nPostseason Poll. This was USFs third consecutive trip to the National \nChampionship and second championship victory in that time.\n  The University of Sioux Falls men's football team has a long history \nof success, including 3 National Championships from 1996 to 2008 and 16 \nGreat Plains Athletic Conference titles. This season proved to be yet \nanother outstanding performance by the Cougars, as they finished with a \nperfect record of 14 to 0 and defeated Carroll College, 23 to 7, in the \nNAIA National Championship game. Their excellent performance throughout \nthe season was awarded by receiving all 18 possible first place votes \nin the NAIA Coaches' Top 25 Postseason Poll.\n  The 2008 Cougars were led to the championship thanks to the \ncombination of a powerful offense and a dominating defense. The Cougars \naveraged nearly 37 points per game while giving up only 6. The defense \nranked first in the Nation in numerous statistical categories, \nincluding scoring defense and total defense. The team effort displayed \neach week by this group of men is a tribute to the countless hours of \ntraining and preparation that preceded this great accomplishment.\n  Certainly this season would not have been possible without the \ncoaches and players themselves. The coaching staff, in alphabetical \norder, is as follows: Ross Cimpl, Al Christensen, Kalen DeBoer, Jeff \nFitzgerald, Ryan Grubb, Al Hansen, Eric Inama, Dan Moe, and Kurtiss \nRiggs.\n  The team, in alphabetical order, is as follows: Blake Andersen, \nBrandon Andersen, Alex Anderson, Drew Anderson, Eric Anderson, Anthony \nBaldassari, Jeremy Barnes, Bret Beachner, Travis Beaver, Nick \nBenedetto, Tony Benedetto, Dustin Bergmeier, Quintin Biermann, Brandon \nBoe, Lorenzo Brown, Tyson Brown, Doug Carlson, Jordan Carlson, Cody \nCavender, Erik Cimpl, Jacob Crowl, Kyle Cummings, Drew DeGroot, Josh \nDorr, Dane Driscoll, Trevor Engelson, Nathan Everett, Eric Fjeldheim, \nShawn Flanagan, Dylan Fritz, Stanley Green, Jake Hahne, Adam Halseth, \nMike Hartley, Brad Hartzler, Michael Hill, Trevor Holleman, Lavell \nJackson, Eric James, Maxon Keating, Taylor Klein, Brandon Koolstra, \nKyle Lancaster, Jade Larson, Scott LeBrun, Landon Leveranz, Matt \nLindgren, Marlon Lobban, Adam Lopez, Ryan Lowmiller, Mitch Lupkes, Brad \nMaag, Justin Meidinger, Joe Moen, Tyler Mousel, Tyler Newman, Eric \nPage, Mike Patterson, Tony Pedri, Casey Peters, Kristian Porter, Nick \nRamstad, Jim Rawhouser, Jared Redding, T.J. Ross, Jon Ryan, Spencer \nSailors, Sean Santiago, Mark Sayler, Mark Schaffer, Dan Schmeichel, \nShawn Schnabel, Andrew Schoenfelder, Ryan Schuler, Ismael Small, Eric \nSmith, Kyle Staudt, Dominic Studzinski, Rene Velasquez, Jared Vlotho, \nTim Voegeli, Demetrius Washington, Kyle Wasson, and T.J. Wendt.\n  While the Cougars' success was truly a team effort, I would like to \nrecognize the team's head coach Kalen DeBoer for being honored as the \n2008 American Football Coaches Association NAIA Coach of the Year. This \nis the second time that he has received this honor since taking the \nhelm for the Cougars in 2005. In only 4 years of Cougar leadership, \nCoach DeBoer has amassed a daunting record of 52 to 3. He has led the \nCougars to the NAIA Championship game three times. The Cougars' \ncontinued success is a testament to Coach DeBoer's ability to motivate \nhis players to perform and succeed at a high level of competition.\n  The coaching staff and student-athletes of the University of Sioux \nFalls men's football team should be very proud of all of their \naccomplishments this season. On behalf of the Sioux Falls community and \nthe State of South Dakota, I am pleased to say congratulations to the \nCougars on another remarkable season. You have made us all very \nproud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/03/senate-section/article/S1431-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1431-S1432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Kohl):\n       S. 364.

A bill to amend the Social Security Act to eliminate the 5-\nmonth waiting period for Social Security disability and the 24-month \nwaiting period for Medicare benefits in the cases of individuals with \ndisabling burn injuries; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, each year an estimated 500,000 people are \ntreated for burn injuries, with 40,000 requiring hospitalization. It is \ntime that we do more to aid those who suffer from disabling burns, \nwhich is why I am introducing the Social Security and Medicare Improved \nBurn Injury Treatment Access Act of 2009. I am pleased to join my \ncolleague from Massachusetts, Congressman Richard Neal, who introduced \nsimilar legislation in the House of Representatives.\n  This legislation provides a waiver of the 24-month waiting period now \nrequired before an uninsured individual becomes eligible for Medicare \ncoverage for disabling burn injuries. It also provides a waiver for the \nfive-month waiting period for Social Security disability benefits. This \nwill help provide greater assistance to those who suffer from burn \ninjuries and much needed support for the burn centers that treat them. \nBurn care is highly specialized and expensive. Since approximately 40 \npercent of burn victims are uninsured, this places a great financial \nstrain on burn centers, causing some of them to close.\n  At a time when we are asking burn centers to be prepared to deal with \ncatastrophic cases, and expand their capacity, we also must provide the \nsupport they need. Chemical fires, explosions, terrorist attacks, and \nmajor accidents are scenarios where burn centers play a critical role \nin public health. Over one-third of those hospitalized in New York \nfollowing the September 11 terrorist attacks had severe burn injuries.\n\n[[Page S1433]]\n\n  This legislation will provide immediate Medicare coverage for \nuninsured patients suffering serious, disabling burn injuries. It \nfollows an approach already taken with other conditions such as End \nStage Renal Disease, ESRD, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS or Lou \nGehrig's disease, both of which result in waivers of the 24-month \nwaiting period for Medicare eligibility.\n  This legislation has important cost containment measures. To prevent \nshifting the burden of care, no one with public or private insurance at \nthe time of their burn injury will be eligible for the 24-month waiver, \nand state public insurance programs will not be allowed to restrict \ncoverage for burn patients as a way to shift the responsibility to \nMedicare. Each individual's disability status is required to be \nreevaluated at least once every three years to ensure that those who \nhave made a full recovery are not allowed to stay on Medicare \nindefinitely.\n  We cannot allow our Nation's burn centers to continue closing due to \na lack of financial resources. They are a vital resource and through \nthem, we have the opportunity to give burn victims the best possible \nchance at recovery. I ask all my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Durbin, \n        and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 369. A bill to prohibit brand name drug companies from \ncompensating generic drug companies to delay the entry of a generic \ndrug into the market; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, with Senators \nGrassley, Feingold, Durbin and Brown, the Preserve Access to Affordable \nGenerics Act. Our legislation will prevent one of the most egregious \ntactics used to keep generic competitors off the market, leaving \nconsumers with unnecessarily high drug prices. The way it is done is \nsimple--a drug company that holds a patent on a brand-name drug pays a \ngeneric drug maker to not sell a competing product. The brand name \ncompany profits so much by delaying competition that it can easily \nafford to pay off the generic company. The only losers are the American \npeople, who continue to pay unnecessarily high drug prices for years to \ncome.\n  Our legislation is basically very simple it will make these anti-\ncompetitive, anti-consumer patent payoffs illegal. We will thereby end \na practice seriously impeding generic drug competition, competition \nthat could save consumers literally billions of dollars in health care \ncosts. When we first introduced this legislation to ban these pay-off \nsettlements in 2007, it had broad support from those concerned with \nrising health care costs, including the AARP. The New York Times \neditorialized in January 2007 in support of legislation to ban the pay-\noff settlements, pointing out that the settlements ``are a costly legal \nloophole that needs to be plugged by Congressional legislation.''\n  Despite the opposition of the Federal Trade Commission to these anti-\ncompetitive patent settlements, two 2005 appellate court decisions have \npermitted these backroom payoffs. And the effect of these court \ndecisions has been stark. In the two years after these two decisions, \nthe FTC has found, half of all patent settlements involved payments \nfrom the brand name from the generic manufacturer in return for an \nagreement by the generic to keep its drug off the market. In the year \nbefore these decisions, not a single patent settlement reported to the \nFTC contained such an agreement.\n  When brand name drugs lose their patent monopoly, this opens the door \nfor consumers, employers, third-party payers, and other purchasers to \nsave billions--30 percent to 80 percent on average--by using generic \nversions of these drugs. A recent study released by the Pharmaceutical \nCare Management Association showed that health plans and consumers \ncould save $26.4 billion over 5 years by using the generic versions of \n14 popular drugs that are scheduled to lose their patent protections \nbefore 2010.\n  The urgency of the need for this legislation was highlighted just \nyesterday, when the FTC filed an antitrust case challenging the latest \n``pay for delay'' settlement. The FTC's Complaint alleges that Solvay, \nthe brand name manufacturer of a hormone-boosting drug, entered into an \nagreement with two generic companies to delay the entry of their \ngeneric version of the drug for nine years. The FTC alleged that Solvay \nagreed in 2006 to share its profits with the generic competitors as \nlong as they did not launch their generic versions until 2015. If these \nallegations are true, this is exactly the anti-consumer, anti-\ncompetition agreement that would be rendered illegal by our bill.\n  We introduced this bill in the last Congress and it passed out of the \nJudiciary Committee without a dissenting vote. Nonetheless, we heard \nfrom some in the generic drug industry that on occasion these patent \nsettlements may not harm competition. That is why this year's version \nof the legislation includes a new provision not contained in the bill \nintroduced in the last Congress. This new provision would permit the \nFederal Trade Commission the guardians of competition in this industry \nto exempt from this amendment's ban certain agreements if the FTC \ndetermines such agreements would benefit consumers. This provision will \nensure that our amendment does not prevent any agreements which will \ntruly benefit consumers.\n  It is also important to note that--contrary to the arguments made by \nsome--our amendment will not ban all patent settlements. In fact, our \nbill will not ban any settlement which does not involve an exchange of \nmoney. This legislation will do nothing to prevent parties from \nsettling patent litigation with an agreement that a generic will delay \nentry for some period of time in return for ending its challenge to the \nvalidity of the patent. Only the egregious pay-off settlements in which \nthe brand name company also pays the generic company a sum of money to \ndo so will be banned.\n  In closing, we cannot profess to care about the high cost of \nprescription drugs while turning a blind eye to anticompetitive \nbackroom deals between brand and generic drug companies. It is time to \nstop these drug company pay-offs that only serve the companies involved \nand deny consumers to affordable generic drugs. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in this effort by supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 369\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Preserve Access to \n     Affordable Generics Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) prescription drugs make up 10 percent of the national \n     health care spending but for the past decade have been 1 of \n     the fastest growing segments of health care expenditures.\n       (2) 67 percent of all prescriptions dispensed in the United \n     States are generic drugs, yet they account for only 20 \n     percent of all expenditures;\n       (3) generic drugs, on average, cost 30 to 80 percent less \n     than their brand-name counterparts;\n       (4) consumers and the health care system would benefit from \n     free and open competition in the pharmaceutical market and \n     the removal of obstacles to the introduction of generic \n     drugs;\n       (5) full and free competition in the pharmaceutical \n     industry, and the full enforcement of antitrust law to \n     prevent anticompetitive practices in this industry, will lead \n     to lower prices, greater innovation, and inure to the general \n     benefit of consumers.\n       (6) the Federal Trade Commission has determined that some \n     brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers collude with generic \n     drug manufacturers to delay the marketing of competing, low-\n     cost, generic drugs;\n       (7) collusion by pharmaceutical manufacturers is contrary \n     to free competition, to the interests of consumers, and to \n     the principles underlying antitrust law;\n       (8) in 2005, 2 appellate court decisions reversed the \n     Federal Trade Commission's long-standing position, and upheld \n     settlements that include pay-offs by brand name \n     pharmaceutical manufacturers to generic manufacturers \n     designed to keep generic competition off the market;\n       (9) in the 6 months following the March 2005 court \n     decisions, the Federal Trade Commission found there were \n     three settlement agreements in which the generic received \n     compensation and agreed to a restriction on its ability to \n     market the product;\n\n[[Page S1434]]\n\n       (10) the FTC found that \\1/2\\ of the settlements made in \n     2006 and 2007 between brand name and generic companies, and \n     over \\2/3\\ of the settlements with generic companies with \n     exclusivity rights that blocked other generic drug \n     applicants, included a pay-off from the brand name \n     manufacturer in exchange for a promise from the generic \n     company to delay entry into the market; and\n       (11) settlements which include a payment from a brand name \n     manufacturer to a generic manufacturer to delay entry by \n     generic drugs are anti-competitive and contrary to the \n     interests of consumers.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to enhance competition in the pharmaceutical market by \n     prohibiting anticompetitive agreements and collusion between \n     brand name and generic drug manufacturers intended to keep \n     generic drugs off the market;\n       (2) to support the purpose and intent of antitrust law by \n     prohibiting anticompetitive agreements and collusion in the \n     pharmaceutical industry; and\n       (3) to clarify the law to prohibit payments from brand name \n     to generic drug manufacturers with the purpose to prevent or \n     delay the entry of competition from generic drugs.\n\n     SEC. 3. UNLAWFUL COMPENSATION FOR DELAY.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12 et seq.) is \n     amended by inserting after section 28 the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 29.

A bill to amend chapter 23 of title 5, United States Code, to \nclarify the disclosures of information protected from prohibited \npersonnel practices, require a statement in nondisclosure policies, \nforms, and agreements that such policies, forms, and agreements conform \nwith certain disclosure protections, provide certain authority for the \nSpecial Counsel, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I rise to reintroduce the \nWhistleblower Protection Enhancement Act. I am pleased that Senators \nCollins, Grassley, Levin, Lieberman, Voinovich, Leahy, Kennedy, Carper, \nPryor, and Mikulski have joined as cosponsors of this bill.\n  I have been a long-time proponent of strengthening the rights and \nprotections of federal whistleblowers. Last year, my bill, the Federal \nEmployee Protection of Disclosures Act, S. 274, passed the Senate by \nunanimous consent in December 2007. A similar House bill, the \nWhistleblower Protection Enhancement Act, also passed in March 2008. \nUnfortunately, we were not able to reconcile the two bills and enact \nwhistleblower protections before the 110th Congress adjourned.\n  The need for strengthened whistleblower protections is clear. In this \ntime of economic crisis, we cannot wait to act on measures to make sure \nthe government uses tax dollars efficiently and effectively. Indeed, \nPresident Obama emphasized the need for improved accountability in his \ninaugural address, stating:\n\n       Those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to \n     account--to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our \n     business in the light of day--because only then can we \n     restore the vital trust between a people and their \n     government.\n\n  This legislation will help us hold those who manage the public's \ndollars accountable by strengthening protections for Federal workers \nwho shed light on Government waste, fraud, and abuse. Our bill also \nwill contribute to public health and safety, civil rights and civil \nliberties, national security, and other valuable interests. Federal \nemployees often are in the best position to observe and disclose \nFederal Government wrongdoing that can affect every aspect of our \neconomy and our lives, and fewer employees will have the courage to \ndisclose wrongdoing without meaningful whistleblower protections.\n\n[[Page S1435]]\n\n  The Whistleblower Protection Act, WPA, was intended to shield Federal \nwhistleblowers from retaliation, but the Federal Circuit and the Merit \nSystems Protection Board repeatedly have issued decisions that \nmisconstrue the WPA and scale back its protections. Federal \nwhistleblowers have prevailed on the merits of their claims before the \nFederal Circuit Court of Appeals, which has sole jurisdiction over \nfederal employee whistleblower appeals, only three times in hundreds of \ncases since 1994. That is why further action is necessary.\n  I will highlight a few of the important provisions in this bill. Our \nbill would eliminate a number of restrictions that the Federal Circuit \nhas read into the law regarding when disclosures are covered by the \nWPA. In light of the Federal Circuit's restrictive reading of the WPA, \nit would establish a pilot program to allow whistleblower appeals to be \nfiled in the appropriate regional Federal Court of Appeals for five \nyears, and would require a Government Accountability Office review of \nthat change 40 months after enactment. This bill would bar agencies \nfrom enforcing a nondisclosure policy, revoking an employee's security \nclearance, or investigating an employee in retaliation for a protected \ndisclosure.\n  This bill also includes a few improvements in whistleblower \nprotection that were not in S. 274. It would expand the coverage of the \nWhistleblower Protection Act to include employees of the Transportation \nSecurity Administration. Additionally, it would make clear that \ndisclosures of censorship of scientific information that could lead to \ngross government waist or mismanagement, a substantial and specific \ndanger to public health or safety, or a violation of law are protected.\n  Congress has a duty to provide strong protections for Federal \nwhistleblowers. Only when Federal employees are confident that they \nwill not face retaliation will they feel comfortable coming forward to \ndisclose information that can be used to improve government operations, \nour national security, and the health of our citizens.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 372\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to include \nconstrictor snakes of the species Python genera as an injurious animal; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss exotic \npythons and the devastating impact they are having on wildlife in my \nhome state. To combat this deadly nonnative nuisance, I am also filing \na bill that will ban the interstate commerce and importation of these \nsnakes.\n  Pythons were first discovered in the Everglades in the mid-1990s, and \nnow have a rapidly-growing breeding population within the boundary of \nEverglades National Park. They impact almost seventy endangered species \nliving in the Everglades and threaten to upset the natural balance that \nwe are spending billions of dollars to restore. When I toured the \nEverglades with Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman Barbara \nBoxer, we witnessed firsthand the damage pythons are causing, and the \nefforts researchers are making to eradicate them from the wild.\n  These snakes were brought to Florida to be sold as pets, and were \nintroduced into the wild by owners who could no longer handle them. \nThey eat animals ranging from songbirds to white ibises, as well as \nendangered and threatened species such as the Key Largo woodrat. \nPythons can grow to be 23 feet long and weigh up to 200 pounds, and \nthere is currently no effective way of eradicating them in the wild.\n  They can consume animals many times their size, and recently, \nresearchers also found cougar parts in the stomachs of captured \npythons. This development could signal a new threat to the endangered \nFlorida panther, which we have been working so hard to save.\n  Python populations have also been discovered in Big Cypress National \nPreserve to the north, Miami's water management areas to the northeast, \nKey Largo to the southeast, and many state parks, municipalities, and \npublic and private lands in the region.\n  Because climate range projections from the U.S. Geological Survey \nshow that pythons may soon expand their range to include much of the \nsouthern third of the United States, getting their populations under \ncontrol is even more pressing.\n  In the last year, the State of Florida has taken some actions to \naddress the problems created by owners who release their pythons into \nthe wild, and I applaud these efforts. The State now requires owners of \nanimals they call ``Reptiles of Concern''--a category that includes two \nspecies besides pythons--not only to obtain permits for their animals, \nbut also to implant a tracking microchip in larger pythons.\n  I believe federal action is also needed. That is why today I am \nintroducing a bill that would amend the Lacey Act to ban the \nimportation and interstate commerce of the python. This step is needed \nto reduce the number of pythons released into the wild by pet owners \nwho don't understand the responsibility caring for a python entails. In \n2007, preeminent environmentalist and former assistant secretary of the \nInterior Nathaniel Reed wrote, ``The dramatic increase in the number of \nsnakes in the Park and Big Cypress call into question why it has taken \nso long for the Service to utilize its powers under the Lacey Act to \nprevent importation of the snake into an ecosystem where escapees and \nrejects have built a sustainable population.''\n  If we do not take action now, we will let python populations in \nFlorida continue to grow and further ravage the already-fragile \nEverglades, as well as risk letting them spread throughout the Southern \nportion of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 373\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. IMPORTATION OR SHIPMENT OF INJURIOUS SPECIES.\n\n       Section 42(a)(1) of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended in the first sentence by inserting ``; of the \n     constrictor snake of the species Python genera'' after \n     ``polymorpha''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/03/senate-section/article/S1438-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1438-S1439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 26--RECOGNIZING AND HONORING RALPH WILSON, JR.

Mr. President, since we have a moment, I will \ntell you about S. Con. Res. 4. Two years ago, an American went to Kish \nIsland, which is part of Iran. The Iranian island is in the Persian \nGulf and a visa is not required to get there. We have the records that \nBob Levinson, a retired FBI agent, checked out of his hotel, which \nsubsequently has been confirmed by the taxi driver who drove him to the \nairport and deposited him. At that point, Bob Levinson disappeared and \nhas left a wife and seven children. They happen to reside in the State \nof Florida. But it doesn't make any difference where the State is. We \nhave a number of Senators who have joined with me on this resolution to \nkeep up the pressure.\n  I want you to know that under the reasonable man test, all of the \nevidence we have suggests that Bob Levinson is in Iran and is being \nheld against his will. First, there was an Iranian press story about 6 \nweeks after Levinson's disappearance that indicated he would be \nreleased, that he was in custody. This report comes from PRESS TV, \nwhich is an Iranian Government press operation.\n  In addition, there was a fellow he met with on Kish Island named \nBelfield, who is a fugitive from American justice. Belfield now resides \nin Iran and has stated publicly that he met with Bob Levinson. The \nmeeting was suddenly interrupted by people who arrested Belfield. This \nfellow, Belfield, has said that Levinson is being held in Iran. We have \nalso had the statement by the President of Iran, Ahmadinejad, who says \nhe doesn't know anything about Levinson's location in Iran, but that \nthe Government of Iran would do everything to cooperate.\n  Thus far, in innumerable contacts from this Senator and Mrs. Levinson \nincluding during her visit a year ago to Tehran and to Kish Island, the \nGovernment of Iran has not been forthcoming or willing to cooperate.\n  The reasonable man test says he is held in Iran. I can tell you that \nthis Senator believes he is being held and he is being held in a secret \nprison. We do know that, from time to time, in several diplomatic \nsessions, whenever this has been brought up to an Iranian official, \nfirst, he says, ``We don't know anything about Levinson,'' and then \nthey immediately change the subject to talk about the Iranians who were \npicked up by the U.S. Government in Erbil, Iraq. Whether they are \nsuggesting an exchange, we simply don't know. But I can tell you that \nthe Government of the United States, now under the new administration, \nspecifically with the Secretary of State, who has been briefed on \ndetails in the Bob Levinson case, is pressing forward.\n  In conclusion, if there is a new chapter in the relationship between \nthe United States and Iran, what better way for that new chapter to \nopen than for Iran to make a humanitarian gesture by returning this \nfather, this husband, to his family, his wife and seven children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/03/senate-section/article/S1439-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1439-S1441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 106.
