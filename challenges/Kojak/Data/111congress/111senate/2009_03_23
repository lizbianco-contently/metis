Mr. President, this afternoon we are going to begin work on \nthe national service legislation. My message to the Senate today is \nthat we are going to finish this legislation this week. We have to. We \nmust start on the budget next week. This is bipartisan legislation. \nSenators Hatch, Kennedy, and others have worked very hard on this \nlegislation. There is no\n\n[[Page S3584]]\n\nreason we should not finish this very quickly. But we will see.\n  There has been a lot of work done to get us to this point. We are \ngoing to move forward. If it is necessary that we work on Friday and \nSaturday or even Sunday, it is important that we do that so we can \nstart the budget on Monday. Everybody should be warned about that as \nfar as weekend travel. It all depends on what the minority does \nregarding this bill. Again, everyone should know it is bipartisan, and \nwe need to complete it before we do the budget.\n  Last week I spoke to a group of young men and women from around the \ncountry who are being honored for their commitment to public service. \nIn recent years, vast numbers of young people have sought private \nsector fields such as finance and banking. There is nothing wrong with \ntheir trying to do well, but in this hour of economic crisis for our \ncountry, it was encouraging to meet with a group of young people who \nhave made the choice not to do well but to do good.\n  Americans may find themselves with less time and money to donate to \ntheir causes than in previous years, to charities, but we remain a \ngenerous country. It is fitting that the Congress now move to the \nconsideration of the Serve America Act, bipartisan legislation \ncosponsored by 35 Senators, championed by Senators Kennedy and Hatch \nand led this week by Senators Mikulski and Enzi.\n  The Serve America Act will provide better opportunities for Americans \nof all ages, from all regions and walks of life, to answer the call to \nservice.\n  This legislation builds on the success of the AmeriCorps program with \nthe goal of increasing the number of volunteers from 75,000 up to \n250,000.\n  This bill also creates several new volunteer corps with specific \nmissions in areas of national need: An education corps to help increase \nstudent achievement and graduation rates; a healthy future corps to \nimprove access to health care; a clean energy corps to encourage energy \nefficiency and conservation measures; a veterans corps to assist our \nNation's veterans; and an opportunity corps to assist the economically \ndisadvantaged.\n  The Serve America Act finally increases the education award for full-\ntime volunteers and links it to increases in the maximum Pell grants.\n  I urge my colleagues to honor the selfless commitment to a better \ncountry that Americans are making in their communities every day by \npassing this outstanding legislation.\n  Mr. President, we will also continue meeting to negotiate over \nPresident Obama's budget this week. The President's framework sets the \nright priorities for the country, and Chairman Conrad continues to work \nwith Democrats and Republicans to strengthen the budget.\n  We must remember that as deep as our immediate problems may be, the \nworst mistake we could make is to stop investing in the future. We need \na budget that lays the groundwork for an economy that doesn't just \nrecover in the short term but prospers in the long term.\n  That is why we must invest in education, health care, and renewable \nenergy. These are not optional projects worth saving for better times; \nwe are saving for better times. They are requirements for job creation \nand long-term economic recovery.\n  This budget must provide tax relief for working Americans who are \nstruggling under the weight of rising prices and decreasing household \nincomes.\n  As we work our way through the budget process, Democrats and \nRepublicans will not agree on everything. But I think we can all agree \nit is long past time that we get a budget that puts the American people \nfirst.\n  Finally, last week, I followed action from the House of \nRepresentatives by offering by unanimous consent legislation that would \nrecoup the outrageous bonuses paid by AIG to its executives. \nUnfortunately, despite joining Democrats and the American people in \ntheir calls for action, there was a Republican objection to my request.\n  Despite last week's Republican objection to passing the AIG bonus \nbill, we will continue to work to right this egregious misuse of \ntaxpayer dollars. Republicans have asked for more time to study the \nlegislation, and they are entitled to that. With Republican \ncooperation, we can quickly and responsibly return these funds to the \nAmerican people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/23/senate-section/article/S3584-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nPresident's budget outline.\n  For too long, Washington has promised way too much, without a plan to \npay for it. The result is that we face a financial crisis unlike any \nother generation.\n  The lesson is that we must not overpromise and, therefore, we must \nnot overspend. Americans are making very tough decisions in their daily \nlives that members of their Government still refuse to make.\n  Unfortunately, the President's budget outline is an example of this \ncontinued pattern. The President's budget fails to chart our country on \na path toward prosperity. It exercises far too little restraint and \ndoes not even attempt to tackle the massive fiscal imbalance facing \nfuture generations.\n  The budget we have before us, regretfully, is a spending frenzy, a \ntaxing spree, and a borrowing nightmare as big as any that our country \nhas ever seen. The President's first budget can, most definitely, be \ncharacterized as unprecedented and historic on many levels. However, a \nbudget that breaks the record for spending the most, taxing the most, \nand borrowing the most of any budget in history is not the kind of \nrecord the American people can afford to see broken.\n  Let's take a look at the massive tax increase. With a pricetag of \n$1.9 trillion, it winds up being the largest tax increase in history. \nIncredulously, though, not a single penny goes toward deficit \nreduction.\n  Now, one might ask, how is it possible that the budget contains the \nlargest tax increase in history, yet not one cent of that increased \nrevenue goes to pay off our Nation's obligations?\n  I will tell you why--because the budget gobbles up that tax revenue \nfor more spending. When that revenue isn't enough to fund all of the \nGovernment expansion, the President's budget just keeps on spending.\n  There is so much bloated spending that the CBO released an estimate \nFriday projecting a deficit of nearly $1 trillion every year for the \nnext 10 years. Our country is faced with an unprecedented deficit. So \ncan anyone answer whether it is sound fiscal policy to tax more just to \nspend more?\n  At a time when we must do something to pay off our debt and reduce \ndeficits, the budget simply ignores these problems. It taxes and it \nspends, inching this great Nation ever closer to bankruptcy.\n  One of the specific tax increases found in the President's budget is \na proposal to enact a cap-and-trade regime. Estimates predict that by \nenacting this policy, each household will see an increase of $3,100 a \nyear in higher energy costs. But not to worry, the President said he is \nusing the money raised from a cap-and-trade program to make the work \nopportunity tax credit permanent. That credit would provide families \nwith $800 more a year.\n  The math is straightforward. Let's do the math: a tax increase of \n$3,100 offset by $800. This is still a net tax increase of $2,300. Just \nthink, it would take a family of four who makes $50,000 a year 2\\1/2\\ \nweeks to earn enough to pay for the new tax. That same family with a \n$100,000 mortgage could make about 3 months of mortgage payments or buy \n8 months of groceries with that $2,300.\n  Beyond the consumer, the cap-and-trade program will have a \ndevastating impact on the farmers in my State. One study found that \nenacting cap and trade would raise the cost of producing an acre of \ncorn by anywhere from $40\n\n[[Page S3585]]\n\nto $80 per acre. Folks in Nebraska produce about 9 million acres of \ncorn each year. So we are looking at $3 billion to $7 billion more a \nyear in higher input costs for that producer. This would be \ndevastating.\n  The President's budget also contains harmful tax increases on small \nbusinesses--the job engine of our economy. According to the latest \nfigures, small businesses create over 74 percent of all new private \nsector jobs, employ over half the labor force, and contribute about \nhalf of the Nation's output. The last thing our country needs when \nunemployment is projected to be as high as 10 percent is a tax on the \nvery segment of our economy that creates the majority of the new jobs. \nIt goes against all logic to encourage output productivity and job \ncreation in one breath and then penalize that same success with tax \nincreases in the next.\n  The small businesses located in towns across Nebraska cannot afford \nanother penny in extra taxes. When I talk with folks back home, I hear \nhow they are juggling the electric bill, the health care costs, working \nto make payroll, while trying not to lay people off. Why would they \nbelieve that their Government wants them to succeed if Congress turns \naround and slaps a crippling tax increase on them during their most \ntrying time?\n  Beyond the staggering tax increases contained in the budget, the \nspending is also the most we have ever seen in history. The pricetag is \n$3.6 trillion for 2010. Let me repeat, $3.6 trillion. To further \nillustrate the massive spending and subsequent borrowing we would have \nto undertake, I have a chart regarding public debt that I wish to put \nup and share.\n  Last year, the debt held by the public as a percent of gross domestic \nproduct was about 40 percent. As my chart depicts, by 2019, this will \nrise to 82 percent. If you do the math, that is a 100-percent increase. \nLet's look at the pure dollar amount. The President's budget outline \nwould double the debt held by the public in 5 years and nearly triple \nit in 10. It goes from $5.8 trillion in 2009 to $17.3 trillion in 2019.\n  Let's imagine for a second if the average citizen behaved as \nGovernment is being suggested it should--to sign up for credit card \nafter credit card after credit card, max them all out without making a \nsingle payment on the principal, never once scaling back on their \nspending, and then send an IOU to the company saying: I will pay you \nsome day.\n  Even our creditors have come forward with doubts regarding our \nspending behavior. China within the last few weeks has expressed \nconcern. The chief China economist for JPMorgan, Frank Gong, put it \nthis way:\n\n       Inside China, there has been a lot of debate about whether \n     they should continue to buy treasuries.\n\n  China is already the No. 1 foreign holder of United States debt. If \nthey stop financing our spending, what then? Who will be Uncle Sam's \nbanker when the IOUs catch up with us?\n  I am extremely worried by the result this runaway spending will \ncreate--lower standard of living, inflation spiraling out of control, \nless economic opportunity for future generations. What if future \ngenerations do not have the ability to get a home loan for that first \nhouse or student loans to go to college? Isn't it our goal to provide a \nbetter life for our grandchildren and children?\n  In conclusion, let me say that none of us has a crystal ball. I \nrealize the President has a difficult job, but I do know that trying to \nlead the country out of this mess with bigger Government, runaway \nspending, massive debt, and tax increases is not the way to go. Future \ngenerations deserve better. Making tough decisions has to start \nsomewhere, and I am disappointed that this budget outline passes the \nbuck to another day.\n  I will wrap up with this. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues as we debate our Nation's budget next week. I sincerely hope \nthere is a genuine commitment to tackling some of the concerns that I \nhave outlined today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/23/senate-section/article/S3585-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3585-S3587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              AIG BONUSES\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly to the issue that has \nbeen very much on the minds of the American public over the last \nseveral days, and that is the bonuses paid to folks who work with AIG, \nthe insurance company that has been the recipient of taxpayer money \nunder the so-called TARP legislation.\n  A lot of times when Congress acts in haste, it makes mistakes, and \none of the concerns I have about the bill we will be taking up is the \nquestion of whether we have adequately thought through the exact remedy \nwe want to impose here in order to get the bonus money back. The House \nof Representatives acted very quickly and passed a very onerous tax \nbill that would claw this money back. The Senate has a bill that has \nbeen written by the chairman and ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee that would be even broader in the sense that it would both \ntax the company itself as well as the individuals who receive the \nbonuses. There are a lot of concerns that have been raised over the \nweekend about both of these approaches. I have urged a little bit of \ncaution here so we don't do the wrong thing again.\n  One of the reasons we are in the position we are in is because \nCongress acted in haste. In fact, when the bill was passed that allowed \nthese bonuses, I don't think very many--if any--of our colleagues knew \nit was in the legislation. After the fact, we learned that the \nauthorization for the bonuses was in the legislation. But when we act \nquickly and we don't really know what we are doing, we can make \nmistakes.\n  I have suggested there be a hearing in the Senate to answer a lot of \nthe questions the public has been asking. Now, the first question is, \nExactly who are these bonuses paid to and why? Is it necessary that \nthese people receive the bonuses in order for the Government to protect \nits interests in the company it now owns a substantial part of--AIG? \nHas some of the money been given back? Will more of the money be given \nback? Is it fair to impose a tax retroactively? In other words, after \npeople have earned the money based upon an expectation that the money \nwill be taxed at regular rates, is there now going to be an extra tax \nimposed on top of that simply because we don't like what was done? Will \nit withstand constitutional muster? And perhaps most importantly, how \nabout the Secretary of the Treasury engaging in the authority, which I \nunderstand he possesses under the stimulus bill that we passed earlier, \nto act in the public interest to claw that money back? In other words, \nis it even necessary for Congress to amend the IRS Code in order for \nthe Secretary of the Treasury to be able to get that money back?\n  Clearly, this could have all been avoided had the Government asked \nAIG to renegotiate the contracts when it gave AIG about $30 billion 3 \nweeks ago. The Government was in a position to say: One of the \nconditions for receiving this so-called TARP money is that you will \nrenegotiate the contracts that provide bonuses for your employees. We \ncould have done that at that time. But it wasn't done, so now we have \nto figure out the right way to deal with this.\n  The other reason I am urging caution was expressed by the President \nin a ``60 Minutes'' interview that was on television last night. Here \nis how he answered a question about the constitutionality of this \nproposed tax law. I am now quoting the President:\n\n       Well, I think that as a general proposition you don't want \n     to be passing laws that are just targeting a handful of \n     individuals. You want to pass laws that have some broad \n     applicability. And as a general proposition, I think you \n     certainly don't want to use the Tax Code to punish people.\n\n  I think the President is right about exactly what he said there, and \nthat is one of the reasons there is some doubt about whether this law's \nconstitutionality would be upheld and another reason I think we would \nbe wise to hold hearings. But there is yet another reason, and that has \nto do with whether the private businesses that have been helped by the \nso-called TARP legislation will want to continue to receive this money \nor continue to participate in the public-private partnerships that\n\n[[Page S3586]]\n\nhave been established by the Government if there is a possibility there \nis going to be retroactive punitive legislation imposed upon them or \ntheir employees.\n  So one of the things I would like to do is to make sure that in \nexpressing our outrage--and every one of us is outraged about this--we \ndo it in a way that is constructive and not destructive to the very \nprogram the President has created to try to help these struggling \ncompanies get back on their feet so that they can lend credit to \neverybody else who needs credit in our country.\n  There is a significant view that if the folks participating in this \nprogram come to believe that the Government--Congress--can at any time \ncome in and impose a new tax on them, they are going to want to get out \nof these programs rather than participate in them. In fact, there have \nbeen strongly expressed views that these banks will try to repay the \nTARP funds quickly--prematurely, in effect--in order to get out from \nunderneath the Government's potential further involvement in their \nbusinesses. Of course, by paying the money back, they reduce their \nability to loan money to the rest of us. Obviously, the whole point in \ngiving them the TARP funds in the first place was to give them more \nliquidity so that they would have the money to lend to businesses, to \nfamilies, and others throughout America.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks a couple of statements that make this point very \nclearly. One is an editorial that was in the Washington Post on Friday, \nMarch 20, and the other is a very interesting article by Ian Bremmer \nand Sean West that was printed in the Friday Wall Street Journal.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibits 1 and 2.)\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the ``Washington Gone Wild'' editorial in the \nWashington Post makes the argument I just made. They use the words \n``shortsighted,'' ``opportunistic,'' and ``irresponsible,'' and liken \nthis to the actions of a mob to get even with people rather than \nstopping to think about what it is going to do to the President's TARP \nprogram. And that is what I wish to talk about.\n  I voted for both the first and second TARP. There were only six \nRepublicans in the Senate who supported that second program, and I did \nit because I believed it was important for the President and the \nSecretary of the Treasury to have the necessary funding to help these \ninstitutions. We are going to destroy that program if the participants \nin the program come to believe that, out of spite, Congress, reacting \nto an angry electorate, will simply come down and pass new tax \nobligations on the employees of these companies in the future. They are \ngoing to be very weary of participating.\n  As the Washington Post editorial notes:\n\n       Elected officials have a responsibility to lead, not just \n     to pander; to weigh what makes sense for the country, not \n     just what feels good.\n\n  The point is, we now own a big share of this company and parts of \nsome of these other companies, and we want to do what is in their best \ninterest for our best interest and not simply punish them because we \nare angry that some folks got bonuses.\n  So I am going to urge my colleagues to take a deep breath here and \ntalk to the administration, to hold a hearing and answer the questions \nthat have been asked here and see whether there isn't a better way to \nachieve the same result. I just happen to believe that if the Secretary \nof the Treasury called these folks down to his office and said: You \nknow, for the good of the country, you ought to give half or two-thirds \nof whatever it is back, and if we can save your company, you will be \nable to make that money back in no time with a healthy company, and if \nwe don't, it is going to be bad for America--I would appeal to their \npatriotism. He could also talk to the executives at AIG and ask them to \nsit down with the same people to renegotiate the contracts. There are \nother ways, in other words, to accomplish the same result without doing \nviolence to our Tax Code, to the concept of contracts, and that do not \nraise the question about the constitutionality of this action.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to hold a hearing on the bill. Do \nnot bring this bill up before the Senate for a vote this week but \ndiscuss it with the administration and see if we can come up with a \nbetter solution and resolve this problem in a sensible way that will be \ngood for America.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 20, 2009]\n\n                          Washington Gone Wild\n\n       ``Shortsighted,'' ``opportunistic'' and ``irresponsible'' \n     aptly describe the actions of those who fueled the debacle on \n     Wall Street. They are also apt descriptors for lawmakers more \n     focused on currying favor with a public outraged at the \n     bonuses handed out by bailed-out companies than on fixing the \n     fundamental and still potentially disastrous cracks in the \n     financial system. By changing the terms of a deal months \n     after it was entered into, Congress will show the government \n     to be an unreliable partner, further draining confidence from \n     the financial system and endangering long-term recovery.\n       Yesterday, the House had the feel of a mob scene, with \n     lawmaker after furious lawmaker vying for floor time to rail \n     against the $165 million in taxpayer-funded bonuses lavished \n     on employees of American International Group's disgraced \n     Financial Products division. House members rushed through a \n     bill to impose an effective tax rate of 90 percent on bonuses \n     paid to AIG employees and employees of other firms that \n     accepted at least $5 billion from the Troubled Assets Relief \n     Program--though when then-Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson \n     Jr. pressed many of those firms to take the funds last fall, \n     government interference in their compensation systems was not \n     part of the deal. The legislation, approved by a vote of 328 \n     to 93, would affect employees who received bonuses on or \n     after Jan. 1 and whose household incomes exceed $250,000. \n     Late yesterday afternoon, lawmakers on the Senate Finance \n     Committee introduced their own, broader version of the bonus \n     clawback that would affect firms that accepted as little as \n     $100 million of government funds.\n       We understand that legislators are hearing from furious \n     constituents, and we understand why those voters are angry. \n     It is unquestionably galling that some of the employees who \n     crafted and pushed risky derivatives that wreaked financial \n     havoc worldwide should line their pockets with some of the \n     $173 billion in public funds meant to prop up the too-big-to-\n     fail insurance behemoth and its global business partners. The \n     bonus anger resonates, too, because of a larger sense many \n     voters have that the people who helped trigger this whole \n     economic mess are not the people paying the greatest price.\n       But elected officials have a responsibility to lead, not \n     just to pander; to weigh what makes sense for the country, \n     not just what feels good. The effective confiscation of \n     legally earned and contractually promised payments may well \n     be unconstitutional. It is almost certain to be unhelpful. \n     The bonuses paid at AIG represent less than one-tenth of 1 \n     percent of the bailout provided so far; recouping those funds \n     will have no discernible fiscal effect. But it will help \n     drive away the best talent at the firm, and despite all the \n     glib messages of ``good riddance,'' that is a strange action \n     for an owner--and the American public now owns AIG--to take. \n     But the real damage goes well beyond any effect on AIG. The \n     economy continues to suffer from a shortage of credit. The \n     government needs financial institutions--including relatively \n     healthy ones--to take public funds that will then be lent to \n     responsible businesses and consumers. The Obama \n     administration reportedly intends in the next week or two to \n     announce the details of a ``private-public partnership'' to \n     buy troubled assets from ailing banks. The participation of \n     private hedge funds, investment banks and other firms will be \n     key to the plan's success. But what executive in his right \n     mind will enter into a deal if he or she believes the rules \n     can be changed six months or one year down the road purely on \n     the basis of polls and politicians' fears?\n       Rather than bringing reason to the debate, President Obama \n     has stoked the anger, and last night, the White House \n     commented favorably on the House action. Perhaps Mr. Obama \n     believes that only by lining up with an angry public now can \n     he persuade it, and Congress, to approve the hundreds of \n     billions more he will need to right the credit system. But he \n     might have expressed his sympathy with public anger over \n     irresponsible behavior in the financial sector while also \n     steering the government in a more constructive direction. The \n     absence of backbone on either end of Pennsylvania Avenue this \n     week could carry a steep price.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 20, 2009]\n\n                       AIG and ``Political Risk''\n\n                     (By Ian Bremmer and Sean West)\n\n       After quietly tolerating $170 billion in bailout money for \n     AIG, why have the public, Congress and the administration \n     suddenly blown up about a tiny fraction of that amount that \n     is being paid out in retention payments and bonuses? After \n     all, the AIG bailout channels U.S. taxpayer dollars to \n     foreign banks and even potentially covers hedge-fund profits.\n       The reason is one of political expediency: The bonuses \n     represent greed in the face of dire circumstances, which \n     resonates with Joe the TARP-funder. The public now has an\n\n[[Page S3587]]\n\n     Enron-like target on which to unload its collective \n     frustration about the financial meltdown. While public \n     outrage is understandable, pandering to it jeopardizes the \n     administration's credentials in a sloppy attempt to score \n     populist points. This raises the political risk for all \n     investors in the U.S. (both domestic and foreign) \n     significantly.\n       The financial-sector rescue necessitates unpopular actions \n     that will only be politically worth it if the administration \n     actually solves the crisis. Until recently, the Obama \n     administration had taken pragmatic is slow actions that it \n     deemed necessary to fend off disaster, as opposed to pursuing \n     an ideological agenda in how it implements the bailout.\n       But this week, under pressure to show a strong hand and \n     positive results, the administration latched onto the AIG \n     bonus flap as an angle for curring populist favor. When it \n     became clear that the bonuses were going to be big news, \n     President Obama led the anti-AIG charge with instructions to \n     ``pursue every legal avenue'' to get the money back. Never \n     mind that the administration was responsible for the TARP \n     provision that (sensibly, from a legal standpoint) exempted \n     pre-existing legal agreements from the bill's limits on \n     compensation. Mr. Obama now says he'd like to create a new \n     ``resolution authority'' to deal with ``contracts that may be \n     inappropriate.'' Meanwhile, Congress seems poised to undo the \n     bonuses through special taxes--a move that in other \n     circumstances would clearly be labeled retroactive and \n     unfair.\n       It was not long ago that Mr. Obama assailed the Bush \n     administration for its dangerous expansion of executive power \n     during a complex crisis. The Obama administration's antics \n     around the AIG bonuses suggest a similar effort to use \n     political power to contort the law. But rather than doing so \n     for reasons of national security, this administration is \n     doing so to pander to an angry public. When the Obama \n     administration and Congress flex this kind of muscle, they \n     attach a new political-risk component to all contracts \n     negotiated in the shadow of the bailout.\n       That risk may scare potential investors away from bailout \n     recipients because they cannot trust our government's will in \n     the face of public outrage. It destroys our moral high ground \n     the next time Mr. Obama wants to criticize a foreign country \n     for ignoring the rule of law by nationalizing private assets \n     or repudiating international debt. It will certainly make Mr. \n     Obama's task much more difficult when he tries to sell the \n     public on his administration's ability to manage the rest of \n     the bailout, and when he tries to sell private firms on the \n     public-private partnership that will be needed to make the \n     recovery work.\n       The administration could have let Congress have its week of \n     grandstanding over bonuses, while issuing a public statement \n     acknowledging the bonuses as deplorable, but not important \n     enough to detract from the real work that lies ahead. The \n     tragedy here is the extraordinary amount of time that is \n     being wasted on this issue when the Treasury Department \n     remains understaffed, a detailed toxic-asset plan remains \n     perpetually forthcoming, and the economy continues to shed \n     jobs.\n       It's predictable that the administration and Congress would \n     rather abuse an easy target over something every voter can \n     get mad about than actually confront the hard issues of \n     managing the financial crisis, including progress on the \n     ``stress test'' of banks and the restoration of normal credit \n     operations, establishing genuine oversight of the use of \n     bailout funds, and coordinating international efforts on \n     global economic stimulus and changes to financial-industry \n     regulations. That type of governing is far more troublesome, \n     as it involves making difficult decisions on complex topics \n     and communicating unpopular news to constituents.\n       This is a hallmark moment for the administration. \n     Congressional anger over AIG's bonuses foreshadows the battle \n     looming if and when the administration asks for more \n     financial-sector rescue funds. The administration may rightly \n     sense that failing to join hands with Congress and the public \n     in outrage over the bonuses would complicate release of those \n     funds. But Mr. Obama does not need to show solidarity by \n     diminishing confidence in the rule of law. That bit of \n     populism will cost the president far more in future \n     credibility than he stands to gain in present popularity.\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, on July 4, 1861, President Lincoln \ncelebrated our Nation's 85th year of independence by declaring to \nCongress:\n\n       The principal aim of the U.S. Government should be to \n     elevate the condition of men--to lift artificial weights from \n     all shoulders--to clear the paths of laudable pursuit for \n     all--to afford all, an unfettered start, and a fair chance in \n     the race of life.\n\n  Just a few months prior to enunciating the aim of his Government, \nPresident Lincoln signed into Federal law the authorization to confer \ncollegiate degrees to the deaf and the hard of hearing in a campus in \nWashington, DC, not far from here. For the first time in our Nation's \nhistory, and still to this day, Gallaudet University is the only \nliberal arts university in the world dedicated to pursuit of access to \nhigher education for deaf and hard of hearing students.\n  Mr. President, 2009 marks the bicentennial, as we know, of President \nLincoln's birth. All around our Nation, parents and children, students \nand teachers are reconnecting the history of Lincoln's life to our \nworld today.\n  Mr. President, 2009 also marks the 145th anniversary of Gallaudet \nUniversity's charter, signed by Abraham Lincoln himself. As our country \nstruggles through economic calamity and armed conflict overseas, let us \nmark the significance of these events by honoring the principal aim \nthat President Lincoln and thousands of Gallaudet students have \nembarked upon: That every American has an unfettered start and fair \nchance at the American dream, that it be free of prejudice and \nignorance and, instead, full of opportunity and access.\n  Today, Gallaudet annually enrolls more than 1,600 undergraduate and \ngraduate students who take courses in more than 40 majors. Today, more \nthan 15,000 Gallaudet alumni are leaders in their fields and in their \ncommunities, sprinkled all over the United States of America.\n  Serving on the board of trustees of Gallaudet is one of the great \nhonors of my life. My mother, an English teacher, put such a premium on \neducation. Education has anchored my life as a child in Mansfield, OH, \nand now as a Senator representing Ohio in Washington. I am reminded \neach day of this country's rich history, the tapestry of America's \ndiversity--of our language, of our families, of our communities. The \ntapestry of America's diversity teaches us that wisdom and goodness \npersist in each of us, despite efforts to marginalize and discriminate \nby a few of us.\n  One hundred and forty years ago, the four members of Gallaudet's \nfirst graduating class--four people--received degrees signed by \nPresident Ulysses S. Grant. To this day, the tradition continues. Every \ngraduate of Gallaudet is conferred a degree signed by the sitting \nPresident of the United States. This simple act by a President--\nPresident Obama will continue that tradition this year--confers to the \nstudents the faith in this country's capacity to elevate the condition \nof each of us.\n  I congratulate the students and the faculty, the alumni and the \nsupporters of Gallaudet for teaching all of us the meaning of the \nvalues President Lincoln laid before us--that we educate ourselves as \npart of a community that, full of opportunity and free, as President \nLincoln said, free of artificial weight, we educate ourselves as part \nof a community that works toward the good of our society.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

Mr. President, today I am here to talk about health \ncare reform. I would mention, first, that I was just with Debbie \nWasserman Schultz, the Congresswoman who last year battled with breast \ncancer and today was there, healthy, to introduce a bill. I am proud to \nbe the Senate sponsor, to focus on increasing awareness among younger \nwomen about the risks of breast cancer.\n\n[[Page S3588]]\n\n  But we are here today to talk about something else and that is how to \nbring costs down in health care. As we look at how to expand health \ncare, as we look at how to improve the quality of health care, there \nmust be work done to contain the costs. I believe, based on what I have \nseen in my State, you can actually reduce costs and improve quality.\n  A few weeks ago, President Obama convened a health care summit to \nbring together industry leaders, providers, and advocacy groups to \ndiscuss our opportunity to move forward with serious health care \nreform. That reform should begin with the Medicare system. Medicare is \none of the most valued social welfare programs our country has produced \nin the last half century. Yet it is also a program in dire need of \nreform if it is to survive on sound financial footing and continue to \nprovide the fine medical care our seniors have come to expect from it.\n  Change is needed now. By 2011, the first baby boomers will enter the \nMedicare system and by 2016 the number of Medicare beneficiaries will \nincrease by almost 5 percent.\n  This past winter, I convened a health forum in Minnesota to discuss \nthe various challenges affecting the Medicare system. The message is \nclear: without action, costs will continue to rise and waste will \nproliferate.\n  Medicare is the single largest purchaser of health care and its \npolicies directly affect nearly every health care provider. Medicare's \npayment system, coding, quality reporting, and recordkeeping are the \nindustry standard. Spending for the Medicare Program is projected to \nincrease 114 percent in the next 10 years. Twenty percent of Medicare \nbeneficiaries suffer from one of five chronic diseases. Medicare spends \n66 percent of its annual budget to treat this group. Two-thirds of \nMedicare spending only helps one-fifth of Medicare beneficiaries. If we \nare going to sustain Medicare as a healthy, high-quality program \nAmericans deserve, we must do something to address these challenges. In \nshort, we need to reform Medicare so it addresses efficient, high-\nquality care.\n  As it happens, doctors and hospitals in many regions of the country, \nincluding my State of Minnesota, practice exactly this kind of high-\nquality, low-cost medicine and they should be rewarded for it. But \nMedicare does not reward them. Instead, it punishes them. In fact, at \nthe health summit last week, President Obama actually asked the \ngathered group, ``Why should we punish Minnesota because other States \nare less efficient?''\n  The problem is, despite periodic efforts at reform, Medicare pays for \nquantity, not quality. More tests and more surgeries mean more money, \neven if the extra tests and operations do nothing to improve a \npatient's condition. States that have historically delivered excessive \nprocedures are still rewarded for the wasteful practices of the past, \nwhile efficient States, such as Minnesota, are punished.\n  If you look at this chart, you will see that the areas in dark blue \nare the ones that receive the lion's share of Medicare payments. The \nlight blue area States, such as Minnesota, Montana, Iowa--I see Maine \nis looking good, as I see the Senator from Maine across the way--but a \nnumber of States, you can see, are in areas where Medicare spending is \nlow but quality of care is high. It is as if there were a huge \ntransfusion that basically takes taxpayer money from one region, one \narea of the country, and puts it in another.\n  It is not to say people are not sick in other parts of the country--\nthey do deserve that help--but looking at the limited resources, we \nhave to figure out what is working and how come areas of the country \nthat tend to have the lowest health care costs also have the highest \nquality health care?\n  It is not what you would think. You would think: Well, the highest \ncost must have the highest quality. That tends to happen sometimes, in \nclothing and other things. That is not what is going on in this country \nright now. Regions with more specialists and more hospital beds tend to \nprovide more services and get more of the money.\n  According to the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical \nPractice, high-cost regions in Medicare boast 32 percent more hospital \nbeds, 31 percent more doctors, and 66 percent more medical specialists. \nIn other words, supply is driving demand. The result is that Medicare \npays much more in some parts of the country than it does in others for \nmedical care that is no better.\n  Medicare's own report shows that quality of care is higher in many of \nthese low-cost States. In fact, Medicare spends more in places such as \nFlorida and New Jersey than it spends in States such as Minnesota and \nOregon. Let me give you one example:\n  In Miami, FL, Medicare spent roughly $15,000 per patient per year in \nthe year 2005. In Minneapolis, a Medicare patient received about $7,000 \nworth of care that year. To put it another way, Medicare will spend \n$50,000 more on a 65-year-old patient in Miami over the course of his \nor her lifetime than on a comparable patient in Minneapolis. Now, \n$50,000, that is a lot of money.\n  At $2.4 trillion per year, health care spending represents close to \n17 percent of the American economy, and it will exceed 20 percent by \n2018 if the current trends continue. If you look at this \ninternationally, you can see the United States spends far more than any \nother nation, without getting better care. We can and we must do \nbetter. A number of models are out there to provide direction for the \nfuture. The Mayo Clinic, based in my home State of Minnesota, is \nrenowned for the effective care it provides at a reasonable cost. Now, \nthink about this. There was a Dartmouth study that came out. It showed \nthis: If the rest of the hospitals in the country used the same kind of \nhigh quality, with very high quality efficiency ratings from families, \nand high efficiency care as the Mayo Clinic now does, in the last 4 \nyears of a patient's life, the country--the taxpayers of this country--\nwould save $50 billion over 5 years. That is $50 billion over 5 years \nby simply following the protocol of having a more organized, efficient \ndelivery system with one primary doctor, with experts who work \ntogether, without duplicate tests.\n  That is $50 billion every 4 years by following a set protocol with \nsome of the highest quality ratings in the country. The Congressional \nBudget Office has also studied the problem and found the potential for \nhuge savings. This chart reflects that Medicare spending would fall by \n29 percent if spending in medium- and high-spending regions were the \nsame as that in low-spending regions. That is the CBO.\n  So how do we change the Medicare system in a way that will reduce \nthese disparities and reward our doctors for doing what is right? Real \nreform will start when the system starts paying for quality. Here are \nthe three priorities I plan to start working on immediately. First, we \nneed to enhance Medicare incentives that reward quality care. For many \nillnesses and conditions, the medical profession has widely accepted \npractice guidelines that result in better health care outcomes, such as \nwhen to give aspirin to heart patients, and how often to perform cancer \nscreening, but they are not always followed. A recent RAND Corporation \nstudy found that adults received recommended care only 55 percent of \nthe time. Medicare needs to reward doctors and hospitals for doing the \nright thing and achieving improvement in care. These quality guidelines \ncan be the basis for Medicare payments to providers.\n  Second, we need to rethink the Medicare payment system. Right now, \nMedicare pays for tests, visits, and other procedures one by one, \ngiving providers an incentive to order more and more services. We need \nto have better coordination of care, and less incentive to bill \nMedicare purely by volume. Increasing the bundling of services in \nMedicare's payment system has the potential to deliver savings and \nstart rewarding value and not volume.\n  Third, we need to address the shortage of the number of primary care \nphysicians who are currently practicing across our country. Today, \neffective primary care is severely undervalued in our health care \nsystem. Yet, research suggests that improving access to primary care \nand reducing reliance on speciality care can improve the efficiency and \nthe quality of health care delivery. To accommodate the needs of an \naging population, we need to promote primary care and transition away \nfrom our specialty-intensive health care workforce.\n  The health care system we have now needs major improvement. That \nmeans\n\n[[Page S3589]]\n\ntransforming the system to pay doctors for the quality of care they \nprovide and to turn the current disconnected, reactive health care \nsystem into one that is integrated and concentrates on delivering the \nbest care for patients.\n  Again, I want to stress this, when we talk about saving costs, when \nwe look at these studies, those States that are most efficient, those \nareas that are more efficient, have high quality care.\n  I leave you with this figure: The Mayo Clinic, in the last 4 years of \na patient's life, if those protocols were followed across the country, \nwe would save $50 billion every 5 years in taxpayer money. That is an \nindependent study, $50 billion.\n  I know we can do better. At the same time as we reduce the cost, we \ncan improve the quality of care that our Nation's seniors deserve. \nWorking together, we can give them the system they deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan.)

Madam President, this next week we will be taking up the \nbudget for fiscal year 2010. Anyone who previously had not been \nconcerned about that debate and what it means for the country and its \nfuture probably should be concerned, based upon the most recent CBO \nreport that came out on Friday of last week. It was sobering. It \nreinforces the point that we have been making about the outline we have \nseen of the President's budget; that is, this budget spends too much, \ntaxes too much, and borrows too much.\n  We have spoken extensively about the new spending in the budget. We \nhave talked at great length as well about some of the new taxes in the \nbudget and how it will drive up taxes on small businesses, the largest \njob creator in the economy, the economic engine that creates two-thirds \nof the jobs in our economy.\n  We also want to talk about the fact that it borrows too much. The CBO \nreport punctuates that point. I couldn't have put it more clearly than \nwhat they came out with last week, which suggests the initial estimates \nabout the President's budget outline, which we received earlier, were \ndramatically understated and, in fact, it is going to add significantly \nmore to the deficit than what we initially anticipated. In fact, in \nfiscal year 2009, which is the year in which we find ourselves right \nnow, the CBO has revised its deficit estimate to where it is going to \ngo over $1.8 trillion for fiscal year 2009, which represents 13.1 \npercent--13.1 percent--of our gross domestic product, which dwarfs \nanything we have seen at any time in history.\n\n  So as we enter this debate next week, I think it really is important \nfor all of us in this Chamber to take a good look at this analysis and \nto try to digest it and, hopefully, for the American people to be able \nto take a good look at what these numbers mean as well. It is sometimes \ndifficult to even put it into terms people can understand. When I think \nabout $1 trillion, it is a staggering amount of money. We are throwing \naround numbers in trillions and trillions and trillions today in the \nabstract. When you try to put it in terms that everyday Americans can \nunderstand, it is almost daunting to try to accomplish that.\n  So when this new report came out, I think many of us found it even \nmore sobering than what we already knew was going to be a very \ndifficult economic and fiscal climate for the next several years. In \nfact, the President's budget outline that had been analyzed up to this \npoint suggested the debt was going to double in 5 years and triple in \n10 years. That is still the case.\n  If you can believe this, the publicly held debt, in 2019, is going to \nbe $17.3 trillion under the CBO's new estimate. It is about $5.8 \ntrillion today. It literally does, in a 5-year period, double the debt \nand in a 10-year period triples the debt. It takes the publicly held \ndebt, as a percentage of gross domestic product, from where it is \ntoday--a historical average of about, if you look back, 20, 30, 40 \npercent, but let's say today we are looking at 40 percent, and that is \na very high number relative to anything we have seen in history--it \ntakes it up to over 80 percent by the end of that period. So you are \nlooking at public debt and public deficits that are unparalleled and \nare unprecedented in American history. I think that is the whole point \nbehind the argument we have made throughout the last several weeks in \nthe lead-up to this budget discussion we are going to have next week: \nThis budget spends too much, taxes too much, and borrows too much.\n  The taxing component is something many of my colleagues have spoken \nto already. But if you look at, again, the overall tax increases--which \nmany are imposed. And they talk about that it just applies to high-\nincome taxpayers. But you are talking about small businesses, many of \nwhich file or organize as subchapter S's or LLCs. So the income they \nget from their small business flows to their individual income tax \nstatement, which means when these rates go up--and they are going to go \nup--the effective rates, to 40 and 42 percent, when today those same \nbusinesses would be paying 33 or 35 percent, they will be significant \nincreases in the tax burden we are imposing. That is not to mention the \nnew climate change initiative which is also contemplated in the \nPresident's budget, which imposes an entirely new energy tax on the \nAmerican people, on the American consumers, creating all kinds of new \ncosts for energy, whether it is electricity or fuels. There have been \nstudies that have been done, very credible studies by researchers at \nMIT, that have suggested it is going to cost the average family in this \ncountry over 3,000 additional dollars per year in energy costs by the \nyear 2015.\n  These are some pretty daunting numbers. But they come on the heels of \na stimulus bill that was passed a few weeks back that was about $800 \nbillion. When you add interest in it, it was about $1.2 trillion. That \nwas a huge amount of money. When we try to put that in perspective \nrelative to anytime in our Nation's history, it eclipsed anything we \nhad seen previously. Then we had the Omnibus appropriations bill, which \nincreased spending over the previous year by twice the rate of \ninflation--about 8.3 percent. Then you add the continuing resolution \nthat was passed last year, which funded Government programs last year \nthrough March 6 of this year because that was a stopgap appropriations \nmeasure that was put in place because the appropriations bills had not \nbeen passed last year. Then we had the stimulus bill, which was, as I \nsaid, with interest, $1 trillion. Then we had the Omnibus \nappropriations bill, and with that a twice-the-rate-of-inflation \nincrease. You add all those numbers together, and we have increased the \nsize of Government this year by 49 percent--49 percent--from fiscal \nyear 2008. I think that points to the fact, again, as to the amount of \nspending we are doing. It adds up because a lot of that, as I said \nbefore, is borrowed money, and it is contributing to these deficit \nnumbers the CBO had just released.\n  So it would be my hope--and I know others are on the floor who are \ngoing to speak to this issue a little bit more in detail. I know the \nBudget Committee has analyzed the new CBO report. We are awaiting the \nmarkup of the budget this week in the Senate. We suspect it is probably \ngoing to follow somewhat closely the President's outline, his proposal, \nalthough my guess is there will be some differences. But if you take \nthe overall trajectory it creates, it creates a trajectory over the \nnext 10 years that calls for an average deficit--this is the average \nover the 10-year period--of almost $1 trillion. It is $929 billion, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office. That is the average.\n  This year, it is $1.8 trillion. Next year, it is $1.4 trillion. It \ndrops down to $670 or $650 billion, I think, for 1 year. But then it \nstarts spiking and trending back up again, to where, over the course of \nthe 10-year window--the budget analysis and planning that is\n\n[[Page S3590]]\n\ndone here is done in a 10-year window. If you look at that 10-year \nwindow, the average deficit is $929 billion a year.\n  As I said, these are numbers that are staggering and unlike anything \nwe have ever seen. It is hard to put into perspective what we are \ntalking about relative to anytime in American history.\n  The other thing I will mention with regard to the stimulus bill as \nwell--because I think there was an assumption that all this borrowing \nand all this spending would somehow lead to job creation and hopefully \ngetting the economy expanding and growing again--what the CBO found in \ntheir analysis, again, was that in the long term the impact would be \nnegligible or negative from the spending that was created in the \nstimulus bill. So not only were we getting no additive benefit in terms \nof job creation from the stimulus spending--or in the long term, at \nleast--we are going to see negative, they think, or at least \nnegligible, zero, economic growth as a result of it. We are adding $1 \ntrillion to the amount we have borrowed from future generations, and we \nare asking our children and grandchildren to have to pay it back, not \nto mention what I am sure are going to be other types of economic \nconsequences associated with that: higher interest rates, higher \ninflation. There is already a lot of discussion about that as we \ncontinue to borrow more and more money, whether there will be people \nout there who will want to buy our debt.\n  I believe those are all legitimate concerns and questions we need to \nraise in this debate, coupled with the fact that there is nothing done \nin this budget that would in any way significantly reduce the long-term \ncosts associated with the entitlement programs and what is really \ndriving, in the outyears, these deficits: Social Security, Medicare, \nand Medicaid. There has been a lot of discussion in the new \nadministration about a willingness to sit down and talk about how to \nreform and make these programs strong and better and more efficient for \nthe future, but there is nothing in this budget that does that.\n  In fact, the only serious savings we can point to in the President's \nbudget that they try to achieve come out of defense, come out of the \nmilitary, come out of our national security, which I would argue: If we \ndo not get national security right, the rest is conversation. But they \nare assuming savings as a result of drawing down troops in Iraq and \nplaces such as that, which I think they are overstating what they are \ngoing to be able to achieve in savings.\n  I would argue some of the other assumptions in the President's \noutline are optimistic with regard to revenues--and I think the CBO \nstudy bears that out--to the point now that even the Washington Post, \nyesterday, came out with an editorial that I think illustrates exactly \nhow serious this fiscal situation is for our country, and drawing into \nquestion the fact that there is very little done in this budget that \naddresses those long-term fiscal problems I just mentioned in the \nentitlement programs.\n  There is nothing to reduce the cost of Government in the outyears, \nonly things that are going to pile on additional costs and add and \nmultiply over a long period of time. The incredible amount of borrowing \nwe are already doing is going to be multiplied many times over into the \nfuture.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the editorial from the \nWashington Post be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 22, 2009]\n\n                           Red Ink Red Alert\n\n\n         A congressional report should give the president pause\n\n       The new estimates by the Congressional Budget Office \n     showing a federal deficit of 13.1 percent of gross domestic \n     product for the current budget year, which began Oct. 1, are \n     neither surprising nor particularly alarming, though it's \n     larger than the 12.3 percent foreseen by the White House. \n     Both are stunning numbers--far and away the largest deficit \n     ratio since World War II. But spending rises in recessions \n     and tax revenue falls, and we're in a big recession. It would \n     be counterproductive to balance the budget in this historic \n     downturn. The huge deficit includes $700 billion for a \n     necessary rescue of the financial sector. Nor is it shocking \n     that the CBO forecasts a deficit of 9.6 percent of GDP in \n     fiscal 2010 if Congress enacts President Obama's $3.6 \n     trillion budget plan--a deficit also much larger than what \n     the president predicted. The difference largely reflects the \n     CBO's economic forecast, which is more up-to-date and, hence, \n     gloomier than the one Mr. Obama relied on.\n       What is scary, though, is the CBO's depiction of the \n     remaining years of the president's term, and the half-decade \n     after that--'if his budget is enacted. In none of those years \n     would the federal deficit fall below 4.1 percent of GDP--and \n     it would be stuck at 5.7 percent of GDP in 2019. This is in \n     stark contrast to the president's projection: that his plan \n     would get the deficit down to about 3 percent or so of GDP by \n     that time. It's true, as Peter R. Orszag, director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget, told us, that the CBO's \n     forecasts are subject to large margins of error, especially \n     in the out years. And Mr. Orszag is correct to point out \n     that, even under the CBO's scenario, the deficit as a share \n     of GDP would decline by half under Mr. Obama.\n       Still, it's less significant to meet that target than to \n     keep the deficits within sustainable bounds, and few experts \n     believe that years of deficits above 4 percent of GDP are \n     consistent with long-term economic vitality.\n       If the CBO's numbers are subject to revision on account of \n     changing circumstances, then so are the administration's; and \n     those were based on very rosy economic assumptions to begin \n     with. Very little of the claimed deficit reduction in the \n     Obama plan comes from policy changes; it results more or less \n     automatically from the assumed end of the recession, as well \n     as by claiming savings in reducing operations in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan from unrealistically high forecasts. Yet both the \n     White House and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the CBO \n     report is no reason to revise the president's ambitious tax \n     and spending blueprint.\n       Mr. Obama should treat the CBO report as an incentive to \n     fulfill his repeated promises, during and after the campaign, \n     to make hard choices on the budget. Until now he has offered \n     a host of new spending--on health care, middle-class tax \n     cuts, education and alternative energy--without calling for \n     much sacrifice from anyone except the top 5 percent of the \n     income scale. Though his emphasis on controlling health-care \n     costs is welcome, it's not a substitute for reforming the \n     entitlement programs that are the drivers of long-term fiscal \n     crisis, Medicare and Social Security. Yet the president has \n     offered no plan for either and no road map even for achieving \n     a plan. Several members of his own party in the Senate have \n     been expressing doubts about his strategy, and the CBO report \n     will lend credibility to their concerns. He should heed them.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. As to the stimulus bill, in and of itself, we are told, if \nthe spending that is included there is not terminated at the end of the \n2-year period--when we assume the short-term stimulus spending would \nterminate--if those programs are continued, the estimate of what they \nwould cost goes from about $1 trillion to over $3 trillion over that \n10-year period.\n  So there will be mountains and mountains and mountains of debt as far \nas the eye can see, complicated by an unwillingness by the new \nadministration to take on any of the serious decisions that have to be \nmade with regard to entitlement programs and mandatory spending in this \nbudget, with lots of new programs created, as I said, new energy taxes \nunder the guise of climate change, a new health care program that is \nestimated to cost around $600 billion but which many independent \nanalysts are now saying is going to cost up to $1.5 trillion.\n  These are all costs that are adding up and continuing to lead to more \nand more borrowing, higher and higher deficits, to the point that this \nyear 13.1 percent of GDP is the percentage and over $1.8 trillion is \nthe actual number of the deficit. And that goes on now for years and \nyears, and an average of $1 trillion a year just in deficits, to where \nthe public debt, at the end of that 10-year period, will be $17.3 \ntrillion. That is an incredible problem for our country and for future \ngenerations.\n  So it is high time we got it under control. It is why this budget is \nso wrong for America and for our future.\n  Madam President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank Senator Thune for his \nexcellent remarks. I will just say that sums it up pretty well. I would \nlike to go into a little more detail about the budget--just some of the \nmatters in it--so we confront honestly the situation with which we are \ndealing.\n\n[[Page S3591]]\n\n  This is the budget, which I hold up in my hand. This is the budget \nthe President sent up. It is from the Executive Office of the White \nHouse, Office of Management and Budget. The big print on it says, ``A \nNew Era of Responsibility.'' The small print says, ``Renewing America's \nPromise.'' Well, I am not sure what ``Renewing America's Promise'' \nmeans, I guess, but I am pretty sure that ``A New Era of \nResponsibility'' is not what this budget is. I would like to talk about \nit because it is breathtaking, really.\n  Now, some would think: Oh, here we go. This is just another political \ndustup, just another fight between the Republicans and Democrats, just \nanother partisan spasm. That is what it is all about. They talk about \nthese numbers, and I don't know what these numbers mean: a billion, a \ntrillion, a million. What does all that mean? Well, sometimes numbers \ndo mean something. Sometimes numbers are quite different from one \nanother. Sometimes situations have changed, and sometimes they have not \nchanged much. Sometimes the changes are dramatic, significant, \ndirectional in nature, historic in nature. That is what I think we are \ndealing with today.\n  I believe the discussion over this budget--I am a member of the \nBudget Committee--is historic. I believe the decisions we make around \nthis budget will affect the very nature of the economy, the nature of \nthe Government that we have, whether we will continue to have a \ngovernment of limited powers, and where we are heading. Are we moving \ntoward a ``Francification'' of America, a socialization of America? \nThat was a big issue in the campaign. It turned out to be where, in the \nlast few weeks, you remember Joe the Plumber and the quote ``We are \ngoing to spread the wealth around.'' People said: Oh, no, President \nObama does not really mean that. Yes, he is going to do some new things \nand make some changes, but he is not heading toward a European-type of \neconomy for America.\n  So let's talk about the budget. What does his budget say? What does \nit mean? A budget is a President's plan for the future. It tells where \nhe will get the money he wants to spend. It tells where he will spend \nit. It tells how much money he will spend and how much spending will \noccur, and will there be a surplus or will there be a deficit?\n  Now, some people think: Well, he can't help it. That is just the way \nthings are. These are things that a President does not have power over.\n  Not so. These represent Presidential priorities. Most States in this \ncountry have a balanced budget constitutional amendment. They have had \nshortages bigger than we are having, and those States are getting by. \nThey are having to make some reductions in their expenditures. I have \nhad a bunch of cities and counties in to visit with me the last 2 \nweeks, and all of them are making some kind of reduction in their \nspending. They are not disappearing from the face of the Earth.\n\n  So here we go. This is not a secret document, fundamentally. The \nnumbers I am talking about that he proposes as his budget for the \ncountry are here.\n  Normally, since I have been in the Senate--12 years--and on the \nBudget Committee most of that time, budgets pass on a party-line vote. \nThere have been some tough, close votes. I remember the budget that had \nthe tax cuts in it was a close vote. Several Democrats voted with the \nRepublicans, and it passed. But this budget is different because we \nhave a very large Democratic majority in the Senate. I think it is a \nthree-vote Democratic majority on the Budget Committee. Under our \nrules, a budget does not have to be subject to a 60-vote point of \norder, and it is not subject to filibuster or any kind of 60-vote \nthreshold; it passes on a simple majority. So the Democratic majority--\na very large majority now--has the power to pass this budget. That is \njust the way it is. They have the power. I hope, therefore, they will \nfeel the awesome responsibility they have in discussing this budget \nbecause it is so unusual, it is so large, and it is so game-changing, \nto a degree which I have never seen before, and I don't think any of us \nhave.\n  One of the things that disturbed me in this whole process is the \nspectacle of our Secretary of Treasury going to Europe to meet with \nEuropean leaders and chastising them--and they have had some pretty big \nstimulus packages--for not having bigger stimulus packages, not \nspending more money, and not going into more debt. This is so odd \nbecause we as Americans have normally been the ones who have criticized \nthe Europeans for their tax and spend and entitlement, socialistic \nwelfare system. So here we are doing that.\n  Prime Minister Merkel in Germany said it is extraordinarily dangerous \nthat transatlantic conflict is being fanned, and, ``I am grateful to \nthe American President that he has told me this is an artificial \ndebate,'' she told lawmakers on April 2 at the Group of 20 nations. She \nsaid:\n\n       The Group of 20 nations need to send ``a positive \n     psychological signal, not a competition over stimulus \n     packages that can't be implemented.''\n\n  The European Central Bank president, Mr. Trichet, said this:\n\n       If the additional deficits are costing you both a strong \n     increase of the cost of your own refinancing and a loss of \n     confidence of your people, you are not better off!\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       If your people have the sentiment that they will not be \n     better off in an endless spiraling of deficits, they will not \n     spend any money that you give them today!\n\n  So the Europeans are pushing back. They are warning us that we are \ngoing too far.\n  So let's look at some of the numbers to which Senator Thune made \nreference. The first is the title of the budget, the President's \nbudget, which came right out of this book--these numbers the President \nhas submitted to us--what he plans to occur in America over the next 10 \nyears under his budget.\n  In 2008, last September 30, we had a $455 billion deficit. Since \nWorld War II, that is the largest deficit the country has ever had--\n$455 billion. Do you know what it was the year before? It was $161 \nbillion. Why did it jump that much? Well, 150 billion of the dollars \nthat jumped was the checks that got sent out. President Bush sent out \nthe checks. He was going to stop the recession. He sent everybody a \ncheck last spring. It didn't work. I voted against it. It wasn't easy \nto vote against constituents getting a check, but I didn't think it \nworked then, and everybody agrees now that it didn't, but that helped \njump the deficit to this record amount--$455 billion.\n  What about this year? Including the stimulus package--or a part of it \nthat we just passed--and the $700 billion Wall Street bailout and the \nbailout of Fannie and Freddie, scored at about $200 billion according \nto CBO, it comes out this year, September 30, the deficit will be \n$1,752 billion, more than three times the highest deficit we have had \nsince the Republic--well, at least since World War II, when we were in \na life-and-death struggle with millions of people in arms all over the \nworld, turning out airplanes and ships by the thousands.\n  Is this just one time? Is it just a one-time expenditure? No, it is \nnot. In 2010, the President's own numbers show the deficit will be \n$1,171 billion, or about $1.2 trillion.\n  According to the numbers in the President's budget, which were \ngimmicked, in my view, we will already be under a recovery in 2010. We \nwill not be in negative growth; we will have I think 1.6 percent \neconomic growth, GDP growth. We are still going to have $1.2 trillion \nin deficits. It drops down to $912 billion, $581 billion, $533 billion, \nand then starts growing again, and in the 10th year of his budget, he \nis projecting a deficit of $712 billion.\n  Now, within those projections are some rosy scenarios, such as if the \neconomy is growing and unemployment is not too high, then you have more \nmoney to spend than if the economy is still slow-sinking and \nunemployment is high. So the budget assumes an unemployment rate of 8.1 \npercent, the highest--that is as high as it would ever get during this \nentire 10-year period. It assumes that next year or later this year, we \nwill have 8.1 percent unemployment. Well, we are at 8.1 percent \nunemployment now. That is the current figure. The blue chip group, the \ntop economists and the ones most people look at, project unemployment \nto be over 9 percent. CBO projects 9 percent will be the maximum \nunemployment rate. If it goes that high, then we are going to have \nbigger deficits. So there\n\n[[Page S3592]]\n\nare some other rosy scenarios in there that the objective economists do \nnot believe will occur.\n  When you score this budget without using those gimmicks or rosy \nscenarios, as the Congressional Budget Office is required to do--they \nare required to make an independent analysis of the President's budget, \nand they have done so.\n  Let me just say that we are proud of the independence of the \nCongressional Budget Office. They are a talented group. They work for \nus here. The new Director was chosen in a bipartisan way but clearly \nwith the final power in the hands of the substantial Democratic \nmajority in the Senate. They control the ultimate choice of the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  They come out not with a $712 billion deficit for that year--not $912 \nbillion but $1.2 trillion, $500 billion higher when they use numbers \nthey believe are fair and honest and accurate, coming out with $1.2 \ntrillion in deficit, not $700 billion in deficit. There will not be, in \nthis entire 10-year period, taking President Obama's own numbers, and \ncertainly not the Congressional Budget Office's numbers, a single year \nthat is close to as low as the $455 billion deficit of President Bush's \nlast year. Most of them are twice that or will average twice that.\n  So what I wish to say to my colleagues is that this is not \nsustainable.\n  The President had a great meeting with the Republicans one day at \nlunch in the room right over here. He was very personable, open, and \nresponded to any questions asked. I thought he was very sincere when he \nsaid: Look, we are going to have to spend a lot of money now, but when \nthis economy comes back we are all going to have to work together to \nreduce the systemic threat of out-of-control deficits. He said that \nmore than once. I thought he meant that. But when you propose a budget \nthat has deficits increasing every year over the next 5 years and \nreaching, in his own numbers, $712 billion in deficit--and according to \nCBO, $1.2 trillion--then I can't take that very seriously. There is not \none act in this budget plan of any significant evaluation of the out-\nof-control entitlement programs we have or how to bring those under \ncontrol.\n  So that is not politics; that is reality. It is not acceptable. We \nhave to say no to this budget. I know my Democratic colleagues are \nuneasy about those numbers. They tell me they are uneasy about them. \nThey want to support their President. They want to pass this budget. \nBut at some point, I think my colleagues are going to have to say no. I \nhope they will. Certainly, the Republicans can't say no; we don't have \nenough votes.\n  Now, Senator Thune made reference to this number.\n  Madam President, what is our timeframe?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning business expires at 4 o'clock p.m., in \nseveral minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I would just point out these numbers. \nThe public debt, which I think is probably the clearest definition of \nwhat our debt situation is--you can argue about that, but the public \ndebt, I believe, is correct--is now $5.8 trillion. In 5 years, it will \nbe $11.5 trillion, a doubling of the debt; and in 10 years, another 5 \nyears, it will be $15.3 trillion, tripling--that is the debt since the \nfounding of the Republic--$5 trillion right here. In 10 years, we are \ngoing to triple the total debt. That is not acceptable. And they are \nprojecting not a recession in the next 10 years after we get out of \nthis one, they are projecting growth, no wars, and it is still like \nthis. The truth is, those of us who observed budgeting before don't \nstay to the budget totals; we usually go over them through some sort of \ngimmick or maneuver.\n  How about another number that is disturbing to me--very disturbing. \nThe White House estimate on interest payments in the budget is $148 \nbillion for 2009. According to CBO, they estimate it higher at $170 \nbillion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have 2 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It shows the interest rate or payments on this tripling \ndebt reaching $694 billion, according to the White House's own \nestimate, in 2019, to the people who buy our debt--the largest foreign \nrecipient of which is China.\n  CBO says that is underestimated. They calculate it to be $806 \nbillion. The entire general fund of the State of Alabama, an average-\nsize State, is about $7 billion for the counties, schools, teachers, \nand roads. The highway budget for the entire United States of America \nis $40 billion a year, including interstate, all the money we send to \nthe States, and all of the pork money we put on top of it. This is $806 \nbillion in interest alone on a debt that we have run up in previous \nyears. That is why people are worried about it.\n  I will conclude with that and say, again, I know we all get caught up \nin politics, that is true. But this year, this budget is not a normal \nbudget. It is not a bigger budget or a lot bigger. It is a gargantuan \nbudget, the likes of which we have not seen before. It results in debt \nincreases that are not sustainable. It has no projection of any \ncontainment of spending. It does nothing to deal with the entitlement \ndifficulties that are driving much of the debt, and it cannot be passed \nin this fashion.\n  I urge my Democratic colleagues to say: No, Mr. President, you have \nto go back and look at this some more. We cannot pass this budget and \nnot just take a few hundred billion dollars off, or something like \nthat. We need to have a serious discussion of the financial condition \nof our country. I think the Republicans will be there trying to work \nwith you on it. But without some leadership from the other side, this \nbudget will go into effect.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/23/senate-section/article/S3592-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am proud today to bring the \nlegislation to the floor entitled Serve America Act. This bill is the \nresult of extensive bipartisan work by Senators Kennedy and Hatch who \nhave worked more than a year on this legislation but who have devoted \ntheir lives to this bill. I know in a short time I will be joined by \nthe distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, who was one of the \nprime sponsors of the bill. Senator Enzi of Wyoming, the ranking member \nof the Health, Education Committee, was also going to be here. He is in \na snowstorm in Wyoming. Senator Enzi will bring his remarks to the \nfloor tomorrow.\n  Let me just say that I want to, first of all, salute Senators Kennedy \nand Hatch for designing this legislation because it expands the \nopportunity to serve this country. At the same time, Senator Enzi and \nSenator Dodd worked assiduously to strengthen the bill.\n  Senator Enzi brought very key legislative analysis to the bill, and \nhis background as an accountant gave us\n\n[[Page S3593]]\n\nvery much needed reforms in the area of greater accountability and \nstewardship. I want to, on behalf of our side of the aisle, thank him \nfor his insight and know-how. We have adopted every single one of the \nEnzi stewardship recommendations.\n  Our colleague, Senator Dodd of Connecticut, himself a former Peace \nCorps volunteer, has also brought additional thinking to the bill to \nmake sure that volunteers are rewarded by making sure we could expand \nthe summer of service and the semester of service.\n  Madam President, I have been no stranger to this bill, and one of the \nthings I have done was be the appropriator for appropriations from the \ntime of its inception, from 1993 to 2004, when the VA-HUD and \nIndependent Agencies Committee was dissolved by Mr. Delay of Texas in \nthe House, and the Senate followed suit. That is a chatty way of saying \nthat Senator Kit Bond, who chaired that subcommittee as my ranking \nmember, was able to keep national service functioning and also very \nmuch needed reforms.\n  In 2004, Senators Harkin and Specter got the appropriations portfolio \nfor national service, and they have done an outstanding job. I say all \nthis to say that when we bring up this bill, it is not a Democratic \nbill; it is a bipartisan bill and an American bill. Ever since the \nframework for the underlying legislation was created more than a decade \nago, we have worked on both sides of the aisle, with Presidents of both \nparties, to give our young people an opportunity to serve.\n  This has been an outstanding effort. Today, the legislation I bring \nto the Senate floor on their behalf is the result of considerable \nexperience, lots of lessons learned, and also the recognition and \nknowledge that there is a new invigorated spirit in the United States \nof America. Some are calling it the ``Obama effect'' because there are \nso many people who want to give back to the United States of America, \nto use their own sweat equity to be involved in our communities to make \nthem a better place to be, for our schools to be able to be more \neffective, for there to be structured afterschool activities for \nchildren, and volunteer efforts to add to more housing for Habitat for \nHumanity--item after item, we could go on. There is this fantastic \nspirit, and we want to be able to make use of that energy, that \npassion, those good intentions, and be able to help them truly to serve \nAmerica.\n  Senator Kennedy and I have worked on this legislation for some time. \nWay back in 1990, Senator Kennedy and I introduced the National \nCommunity Service Act with then-Senator Nunn, and also with the help of \nSenator McCain, to establish a corporation for national and community \nservice, and also to create a demonstration project that would then \nbecome the AmeriCorps.\n  When President Bill Clinton came in, we worked to create the National \nCommunity Service Act. In 1993, we passed the AmeriCorps legislation. \nSince then, it has been a profound success. We took that landmark \nlegislation and, working with President Clinton, created a framework \nfor today's national service programs.\n  Let me be clear, Madam President. We were not in the business of \ncreating another new social program. What we were in the business of \nwas creating a new social invention. What do I mean by that? In our \ncountry, we are known for our technological prowess, the great \ntechnological inventions. From the rocket ship to the microchip, \nAmerica has been in the forefront of technology and science.\n  But also often overlooked, and sometimes undervalued, is our social \ninventions--those things that the genius of America invents to create \nan opportunity ladder for our country, to create empowerment \nopportunities for our constituents.\n  Let me give a couple of examples, and you can see the American \nphilosophy at work in AmeriCorps. In terms of our social inventions, \nwhat are some? Well, you know we are the country that invented night \nschool. At the turn of the old century, with so many immigrants coming \nfrom Europe, with Lady Liberty raising her hand saying: Give me your \ntired, your poor, your yearning to be free--and they also wanted to \nlearn to read English, write English, and learn citizenship. But they \nwere working night and day to be able to do that.\n  Out of the great settlement houses--primarily the great settlement \nhouses out of New York and Chicago--they said: If you work during the \nday, we are going to give you an opportunity to learn at night. Out of \nthat settlement house movement came a new social invention called night \nschool. It was never done anywhere else in the world. Look how night \nschool changed the face of America.\n  Then, while our GIs went overseas and then came back home, we had \nanother social invention that said: We want to thank you not only with \nwords but with deeds. So another empowerment legislation was called the \nGI bill, which created one great, gigantic opportunity ladder for \ngenerations of men who would have never had the opportunity for either \neducation or home ownership to be able to move ahead.\n  Along the way, they knew they could not go off to 4 years of college. \nThey were adults. They had seen war and they had liberated death camps. \nThey could not come back and go ``bula bula''; they had to go to work. \nSo we invented something else, too, called the junior college, or the \ncommunity college, which in and of itself was a social invention.\n  So you see, every generation comes up with a new idea to build and \nadd to that important opportunity ladder where you can do something for \nyourself and your country. But government is on your side.\n  What is it we wanted to do? A social invention for the nineties? What \ndid we face? We saw two things: No. 1, students had incredible debt--\nand they still do. Their first ``mortgage'' was not a home but what \nthey owed in terms of their college debt. Also, we saw a new trend \ncoming to America called the ``me'' generation. Articles and books were \nbeing written about it. There were those on both sides of the aisle who \nwanted to change the ``me'' generation to the ``we'' generation. We \nalso wanted to say: How can we help with student debt? That is when we \nthought about national community service, where you could give back to \nyour country, learn the habits of the heart that de Tocqueville talked \nabout--neighbor helping neighbor, the signature of America, from barn \nraising to Habitat for Humanity, and habits of the heart and Habitat \nfor Humanity.\n\n  We created national service as a form. We didn't want it to be \nservice only for idealistic, affluent kids who could afford to take 2 \nyears off to find themselves. We wanted them to find opportunity to be \nof service and also to make an important contribution.\n  That is how we created the original national service legislation. We \nwanted to strike a balance between precollege and postcollege to help \npay for college, get ready for college or to learn a trade. We also \nwanted to provide the opportunity for retired people to be of service \nand also, while being of service, to earn a modest voucher to pay down \nstudent debt.\n  We wanted to make sure we could do this in a way that was sensible, \naffordable, and also would involve the flexibility and creativity of \nthe local community.\n  We allow not only full-time volunteers but the opportunity for part-\ntime volunteers. Actually, the part-time volunteer was my idea. Putting \non my social work hat again, what I saw in our communities was not \neverybody can go away and not everybody wants to go away. It could be \nsomeone disabled, where their whole support system is in that \ncommunity. And although they have a physical challenge, they can still \ngive. How about that single mother who graduated from a community \ncollege and wants to reduce her debt as she is moving on with her \ncareer? This would give her a chance to do that.\n  There were important lessons learned, and for more than a decade we \nworked on it. But not all was rosy, not all was smooth. What we then \nsaw in 2003, when I was the ranking member on the appropriations \nsubcommittee funding national service, is they created a debacle. God, \ndid they get sloppy. One of their most colossal errors was that they \nenrolled over 20,000 volunteers and could not afford to pay for it. \nThat is how sloppy they were in their accounting.\n  I took to the floor and called them the ``Enron of nonprofits.'' I \ncalled for\n\n[[Page S3594]]\n\na new board, a new CEO, and new rules of engagement. President Bush \nresponded, and he gave us the right people to right the ship of \nnational service.\n  I must say, in those 6 years since then, they have worked to do so. \nThey have righted the ship, they have good financial accounting, and \npeople continue to volunteer.\n  But all that is history. What about the 21st century now? Wow, people \nwant to volunteer like never before. Do you know that last year 35,000 \ncollege seniors applied for Teach America? There were only 4,000 slots. \nThere were 35,000 young people who wanted to do it. The Peace Corps got \n13,000 applicants last year for 4,000 slots. People want to serve.\n  While we saw this new flourishment of desire and passion to serve, \nSenators Kennedy and Hatch put their abilities and key minds and \npassion for this issue together and have come up with the Kennedy-Hatch \nServe America Act. It is a great bill. Let me tell you about it.\n  First of all, it improves the number of national volunteers. Over a \n7-year period, it would take the volunteers from 75,000 slots to \n250,000 slots. But this bill is more about creating opportunities and \nfor people to serve. It is about meeting compelling human needs.\n  We are going to also expand this bill with lessons learned on \nfocusing some of our AmeriCorps activity into specialized corps. These \nare what we found: One, an education corps; another, a health futures \ncorps; another, a veterans corps; and another called opportunity corps. \nThese are not outside of AmeriCorps. They will be subsets because we \nfind this is where compelling human need is and at the same time offers \ngreat opportunity for volunteers to do it.\n  What does the education corps do? It improves student engagement. It \nworks with young people in schools in supplemental services, such as \ntutoring, field trips, and particularly in these structured school \nactivities. We have found that where they have focused on education, \nthey have improved student academic achievement and graduation rates.\n  Also, we have something called the clean energy service corps. This \nis going to work to weatherize more low-income households to be more \nenergy efficient.\n  We have a health futures corps that will work to increase access to \nhealth care among low-income and underserved populations but at the \nsame time work on health promotion and wellness, primarily in schools, \nto teach our young people the kind of cool, new, edgy ways of doing \nthose healthy habits that will change their lives for a lifetime.\n  We also are working on a veterans corps to help create housing units \nfor deployed soldiers and to help also with voluntarism to assist \nmilitary families when a military family is deployed.\n  I heard of a very innovative approach in Hawaii called Grannies for \nthe Troops. That is grandmothers in the area who want to volunteer to \nhelp women whose husbands are deployed with some time off for \nthemselves to go shopping, get other family business done, whatever. \nYou need a volunteer coordinator to make that happen. That is the kind \nof innovation we are going to have.\n  We also have in this program help for retirees. We keep all our \nsenior programs and we provide something called an encore fellowship \nfor an older generation to serve. We also provide the opportunity for \nprofessionals called volunteers for prosperity to serve overseas. Those \ntwo ideas from Senator Hatch were very helpful.\n  This bill takes AmeriCorps and focuses it in a way that we think \noffers greater efficiency and provides some other new opportunities to \nserve, such as the summer of service and the semester of service. It \nalso concentrates on improving the capacity of our nonprofit \norganizations in some other very innovative ways.\n  This is just a brief summary of the history that brought us to today \nand the framework that will take us to tomorrow.\n  In the last Congress, there was a lot of talk about bridges to \nnowhere. National Service is a bridge to somewhere. I wish to note in \nthe health corps programs, we already have one that will continue to \nfunction under this health umbrella in AmeriCorps. Not only do we help \npeople get connected to the services for which they are eligible, but \n85 percent of the young people who work in the National Community \nHealth Corps Program go on themselves to health care jobs. Some decide \non a career in medicine. Some think: Wow, although I already have my \ndegree, I think I will go into an accelerated program and go into \nnursing, where they have the accelerated program for people with \ndegrees. Others are looking at careers in public health or in x-ray \ntechnology. They get turned on.\n  For people who go into education, they say: You know, I was going to \ndo this for a stint. I want it to be my life's work. They then will go \ninto the field of education as teachers and getting extra degrees and \ndoing a good job. They are the reformers of the next generation. What \nwe do in national service serves the community immediately today, but \nthe impact on the volunteers continues for the rest of their lives.\n  I think this is a great social investment, and it is a public \ninvestment in our young people to help our communities that I think \nwill pay dividends long beyond anything we can imagine.\n  I hope this bill is adopted by late tomorrow. I hope we can keep \namendments to a minimum. I do believe we have had excellent help on \nboth sides of the aisle. We talk about changing direction in this \ncountry. I think people do want a new direction. They want to rekindle \nthe habits of the heart. There are a lot of people out there, as we \ntalked about bonuses, who might be talking about ``me,'' but there are \na lot of young people who want to be part of the ``we'' generation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring the quorum call be charged equally, and I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, last May, then-Senator Barack Obama gave \na commencement address at Wesleyan University. Senator Ted Kennedy of \nMassachusetts had been originally scheduled to speak to the graduates, \nbut Senator Kennedy had taken ill and Senator Obama spoke in his place.\n  In a tribute to Ted Kennedy's lifetime of service to America, Senator \nObama spoke to the graduates about the importance of national service. \nIt was a remarkable speech. In fact, what he told the graduates was his \nlife story, about how Barack Obama, after graduating from an Ivy League \ncollege, could have gone to law school or Wall Street with many of his \nclassmates. But, instead, he took a job as a community organizer on the \nsouth side of Chicago.\n  Many people know this story because they have heard Barack tell it. \nThey may have read about it when the President published his \nautobiography, ``Dreams From My Father,'' of how he ended up with a \nbroken down little car, taking a job that didn't pay very much as a \ncommunity organizer in a section of Chicago that had been wracked by \nthe closing of steel mills and all the unemployment and hardship that \nfollowed. It wasn't easy work for him. He went church to church trying \nto organize people in the neighborhoods. The pay wasn't very good, but \nhe knew he was making a difference. He made friends and connections. He \nlearned a lot about life, and he learned a lot about himself. He found \ndirection in his life from those moments that he spent volunteering and \ngiving back to his community.\n  President Obama--then Senator Obama--called on the graduates at\n\n[[Page S3595]]\n\nWesleyan to find their own direction through service to the country. \nHere is what he said:\n\n       There's no community service requirement in the real world; \n     no one forcing you to care. You can take your diploma, walk \n     off this stage, and chase only after the big house and the \n     nice suits and all the other things that our money culture \n     says you should buy. You can choose to narrow your concerns \n     and live your life in a way that tries to keep your story \n     separate from America's. But I hope you don't. Because \n     thinking only about yourself, fulfilling your immediate wants \n     and needs, betrays a poverty of ambition. Because it's only \n     when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself \n     that you realize your true potential and discover the role \n     you will play in writing the next great chapter in America's \n     story.\n\n  President Obama repeated this call to service throughout his campaign \nand now into his Presidency. He has called on all Americans to find a \nway to serve their neighbors and their community to make this Nation a \nbetter place.\n  Over the last few months, we have heard too many stories about the \nso-called successful people who have followed their ambitions, and \nsometimes their greed, and the economy and country have suffered. But \nthere are so many other stories to be told--community organizations \nacross this Nation that are reporting record numbers of volunteers \ncoming through their doors as we face this troubling economy. Many of \nthese new volunteers have recently lost their jobs, but they still want \nto answer the President's call and give back to their communities.\n  That is the spirit that truly makes America great. Even in the most \ntroubling times, Americans think of those who are suffering, those who \nhave lost their homes or can't put food on the table, and they want to \nhelp. There isn't a community in America where you can't find that \nspirit, and you can find it on the street corners, in church basements, \nin afternoon and weekend efforts of people just wanting to give a \nlittle bit back and to help those less fortunate.\n  In my State of Illinois, each year 2.7 million volunteers dedicate \nover 300 million hours of service. The estimated economic contribution \nof those hours is $5.9 billion annually. More than 66,000 of these \nvolunteers participate in national service programs through 144 \ndifferent projects. In Chicago, the City Year program is one of my \nfavorites. It places young volunteers to work full time in some of \nChicago's neediest schools. There they serve as tutors, mentors, and \nrole models for Chicago's students.\n\n  They usually call me in once a year to meet the new class--and I love \nthem. They are just so bristling with energy and determination and \ncommitment. Many of them are doing something in a communal sense that \nthey have never done in their lives. Some of them are in Chicago for \nthe first time, dazzled by the city but dazzled as well by the people \nthey are working with.\n  We know we need them. A student drops out of school every 26 seconds \nin this country. City Year volunteers are helping to keep Chicago \nstudents in school and on the road to success.\n  When asked to share the impact of the City Year corps members on \ntheir classroom, teachers recently said:\n\n       All of my students who are being tutored are more \n     interested in reading. They are more confident in themselves \n     as striving learners.\n\n  It works and it works in both directions. The students are better \noff; so are the volunteers.\n  This week we are considering a bill that will dramatically expand \nnational service programs, giving more Americans the chance to serve \ntheir country. I thank Senator Mikulski for leading us in this effort, \nbringing this to the floor. The original cosponsors of the bill, of \ncourse, were Senator Ted Kennedy and Senator Orrin Hatch. I joined a \nlong list of Democrats and Republicans as cosponsors as well. Both \nSenators Kennedy and Hatch have a long personal commitment to service, \nand this bill is a testament to their public legacy. Senator Mikulski \nis bringing this to the floor in Senator Kennedy's absence. I know she \nwill handle this bill well. She always does.\n  The Serve America Act will triple the number of national service \nparticipants to 250,000 participants within 8 years. Along with this \ndramatic expansion, the bill will also create new corps within \nAmeriCorps, focused on areas of national need that include education, \nthe environment, health care, economic opportunity, and helping our \nveterans.\n  We are expanding opportunities to serve for Americans in every stage \nin life. Middle and high school students will be encouraged to \nparticipate in service projects during the summer and after school. By \nserving their communities early in life, these students will be put on \na path to a lifetime habit of service.\n  For working Americans who cannot commit to full-time service, the \nbill provides funding to community organizations for recruiting and \nmanaging part-time volunteers; retirees will be given new opportunities \nto serve through the Senior Corps, as it exists, and through new \ninitiatives. The bill also increases the education award for the first \ntime since its creation. A lot of the people in the AmeriCorps \nprojects, for example, at the end of their service, earn credits they \ncan use to go on to pursue higher education.\n  The education award in this bill will be raised to the Pell grant \nlevel, which will make it easier for college students with significant \nstudent loan debt to consider national service--and the award will be \ntransferable, so that older volunteers can actually transfer the \neducation award to their children or grandchildren. What a great gift \nto give to your family.\n  There is a story Senator Kennedy often tells about national service. \nOn the fifth anniversary of the Peace Corps so many years ago, Ted \nKennedy asked a young volunteer why he decided to sign up, and the \nanswer was simple. He said: ``It was the first time someone asked me to \ndo something for my country.''\n  With the Serve America Act we are asking again. We are asking \nAmericans of all ages to give back to their communities and to America. \nEach American has the power to make a small difference in the success \nof a child or the health of the environment or the lives of hungry \nneighbors. All those small differences, repeated over and over, can add \nup to something truly powerful.\n  Passage of this bill is a priority of our new President and should be \na priority for every Member of the Senate. I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport this bill and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask consent the time remaining under the quorum call be \nequally divided between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I suggest absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, today the Senate begins consideration of \nthe Serve America Act, which is the title of what will be the Senate \nsubstitute for H.R. 1388. It is my hope this legislation will help \nstrengthen a culture of service, citizenship, and responsibility in \nAmerica, and I am proud to join a bipartisan group of Senators in \nsupport of this bill as it comes to the Senate floor.\n  I am sure it goes without saying that Senator Ted Kennedy's absence \nis deeply felt by all of us as we work on this particular piece of \nlegislation. I, personally, continue to pray for his full and speedy \nrecovery.\n  To begin, I would like to discuss the context in which this \nlegislation has moved forward to give us some perspective as to what is \nabout to happen. After months of discussion, negotiation, debate, and \nflatout argument, Senator Kennedy and I introduced the original version \nof the Serve America Act last September in the middle of what was often \na hotly contested campaign season. Despite the overly partisan \natmosphere at the time, a bipartisan group of Senators offered their\n\n[[Page S3596]]\n\nsupport for this bill. Even though the differences between the two \nPresidential candidates were played out on news shows every night, both \nof them were willing to put their debates aside and become original \ncosponsors. That pleased me.\n  I would like, once again, to thank Senator McCain for his continued \nsupport, not only for this particular piece of legislation but for \nvolunteer service in general. He has truly been a leader on this issue \nthroughout his life and has rightly won the admiration of those on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  In addition to the Kennedy-Hatch legislation, the Serve America Act, \nthe Senate bill also includes legislation that will reauthorize the \nCorporation of National and Community Service. The reauthorization \neffort has been led on the Republican side by the distinguished ranking \nmember of the HELP Committee, Senator Enzi, who has worked tirelessly \nwith both Senator Kennedy and Senator Mikulski to reach a bipartisan \naccord on these much-needed provisions.\n  In addition to Senators Kennedy and McCain, I have to extend my \nthanks, my deep-felt thanks to Senators Enzi and Mikulski for their \noutstanding work on the legislation before us today. Both of them are \noutstanding legislators. They are both beloved people in this body. I, \npersonally, feel that way toward each of them.\n  At the same time all this work has been going on in the Senate, we \nhave been working with both Democrats and Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives to ensure that both Chambers reach similar conclusions \nwith their national service legislation. This has all been accomplished \nduring a time when, for the most part, partisan hostilities have done \nanything but subside. Since the beginning of the new Congress, we have \nseen debates on legislation such as the SCHIP bill, the stimulus \npackage and the Omnibus appropriations bill that, in many ways, have \ndeepened the divisions between the two parties. Here in a few weeks, as \nwe begin debate on the budget, we are sure to see even greater clashes \nbetween the principled beliefs and ideologies between those on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  However, the bill we have before us today is the result of a \nbipartisan and bicameral effort. In our opinion, this is nothing short \nof remarkable, given the current political climate.\n  Once again, the Senate effort has been spearheaded by myself, Senator \nKennedy, Senator Enzi, and Senator Mikulski. I doubt any other piece of \nlegislation we consider this year will be the product of such a \ndiversity of views. Senator Mikulski has carried this matter on behalf \nof Senator Kennedy. I have nothing but tremendous respect for her.\n  I will not be foolish enough to claim the credit for all this good \nwill, but I am certainly grateful to be a beneficiary.\n  Service has been one of the golden threads of our Democracy, and the \nroots of our tradition run deep. Ronald Reagan put this powerful \ntradition of volunteer service in its appropriate context when he said, \nspeaking of the Mayflower Compact:\n\n       The single act--the voluntary binding together of free \n     people to live under the law--set the pattern for what was to \n     come.\n       A century and a half later, the descendants of those people \n     pledged their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor to \n     found this nation. Some forfeited their fortunes and their \n     lives; none sacrificed honor. Four score and seven years \n     later, Abraham Lincoln called upon the people of all America \n     to renew their dedication and their commitment to a \n     government of, for and by the people. Isn't it once again \n     time to renew our compact of freedom; to pledge to each other \n     all that is best in our lives; all that gives meaning to \n     them--for the sake of this, our beloved and blessed land?\n       Together, let us make this a new beginning. Let us make a \n     commitment to care for the needy; to teach our children the \n     values and the virtues handed down to us by our families; to \n     have the courage to defend those values and the willingness \n     to sacrifice for them.\n       Let us pledge to restore, in our time, the American spirit \n     of voluntary service, of cooperation, of private and \n     community initiative; a spirit that flows like a deep and \n     mighty river through the history of our nation.\n\n  President Reagan had a very good way of putting things.\n  President Reagan was not alone in his call for service. Presidents \ndown the generations, Republicans and Democrats alike--Teddy and \nFranklin Roosevelt; Eisenhower and Kennedy; Johnson and Nixon; Carter \nand George Herbert Walker Bush; and Clinton and George W. Bush--have \nall worked to awaken the national consciousness to their duties and \nresponsibilities as citizens, to light in every individual that spark \nof voluntary service, the seed of compassion that makes us serve causes \nlarger than ourselves.\n  They have done so particularly in times of crisis: during the Great \nDepression, during our world wars, and after 9/11. Times of trial have \nalways summoned the greatness of our people, and we are right now in a \ntime of challenge today.\n  Service can take many forms in a free country, and we all have \nchoices, not only as to whether we will serve but how we will serve. \nThere is no greater example of service than those who put on the \nmilitary uniform and go into battle for our country. Many men and women \nwho choose military service make the ultimate sacrifice. They put their \nlives on the line for our country. Millions have lost their lives so we \nmight be free.\n  There are more than 26 million Americans alive today who have served \nin our armed services. They epitomize American values, the values of \nduty, honor, and country. They also inspire new generations to ask what \nthey can do for their country.\n  Other Americans may decide to go into public or Government service. \nThis is a choice that is made by State and municipal workers, by \nteachers and police officers, and, yes, even by Senators and their \nstaffs--to serve the public interest through their public institutions. \nI have to admit, I left my own law practice, where we had just started \nit a few years before. I had left Pittsburgh, moved to Utah, formed a \nlaw firm. We were going like gangbusters. My partner is worth a lot of \nmoney today. I am not. But I made this choice to come and work for our \ncountry. It is made by all these good people, to serve the public \ninterests through our public institutions.\n  Service to country can take other forms. Many Americans want to serve \nfor a full year or part of a year of national service. Others may want \nto volunteer to serve in countries abroad for short-term or long-term \nassignments. We had two people come back last night from a mission over \nin Africa. He served his whole working life as a chaplain in the \nmilitary. She is a beautiful woman who has been married to him for all \nthese years. They, at their own expense, volunteered and went to Africa \nto work in Kenya and Nairobi with unfortunate people and to build \nesteem in the hearts of people over there.\n  They came back last night and spoke in our church. I was so proud of \nboth of them--terrific people.\n  Others may want to volunteer to serve in countries abroad for short-\nterm or long-term assignments. Still others, in fact the vast majority \nof Americans, will perform services as traditional episodic volunteers \nworking in schools, houses of worship, workplaces, nonprofit \ninstitutions, and neighborhoods.\n  America is a generous nation and Americans are compassionate people, \nand our volunteer spirit knows no bounds. In all these cases, \neverything is a choice. Service in our military is voluntary as is \nservice in our soup kitchens. Public service is not only a voluntary \nactivity, but for many of us subject to regular elections where the \ncitizens get to exercise their own choice of whether a particular \ncandidate for office will exercise the privilege of serving them.\n  Consistent with our All-Volunteer Army and volunteer opportunities \nand individuals' choice in communities, nothing in this legislation is \nmandatory. This bill simply provides more Americans more choices and \nopportunities to give back to their neighborhoods and their country all \nthrough the means which they freely choose.\n  With a backdrop of this rich history of citizen service in America, \nSenator Kennedy and I began discussions more than a year ago about what \nwe might do together to build on the tradition of service in America. I \nknow part of this is because both of us love his sister, Eunice Kennedy \nShriver. We have watched this woman year after year after year give \nservice to this country and to children all over the world; not just \nthrough the Special Olympics--but especially through the Special \nOlympics--but in so many other ways. I admire her about as much as any \nwoman\n\n[[Page S3597]]\n\nin our society today for what she has been able to do with her life. \nShe is a 90-pound dynamo who just keeps going. I think--well, I will \nnot say it because I know it can be embarrassing to her. But the fact \nis, she is a terrific human being.\n  I have chatted with all kinds of other people who are giving \ntremendous service to their fellow human beings, men and women, \nchildren, throughout our society. You know, Senator Kennedy and I and \nothers drew on ideas from Republicans such as my friend Senator John \nMcCain, who introduced his own bill almost a decade ago and, as I \nmentioned, endorsed the Serve America Act in the midst of his \nPresidential campaign.\n  We drew on ideas from Democrats, such as the godmother of national \nand community service, that is Senator Barbara Mikulski. We hear of \ngodfathers; she is the godmother, a great woman who has a great heart, \nand who worked as a social worker for many years, and for whom I have \ndeep affection, no question about it.\n  From the outset, Senator Kennedy and I talked about marrying two \nformerly competing visions of service: first, by supporting traditional \nvolunteering, in the tradition of President Reagan's Private Sector \nInitiative; George H. W. Bush's Points of Light; and George W. Bush's \nUSA Freedom Corps; and, second, by supporting full-time national and \ninternational service in the tradition of Presidents Kennedy, Nixon, \nfor senior service, Clinton and again George W. Bush for both domestic \nand international service.\n  We have the attention of our new President. He has talked to me about \nthis. I know he has talked to Senator Kennedy about this. He completely \nsupports this. He knows how important it is. I have respect for him for \njumping right in and helping us with this.\n  We decided we wanted to create more opportunities for Americans to \nserve over their lifetimes, so schoolchildren can learn the importance \nof giving back at a young age, for tapping into the talents of the \nlongest living, healthiest, best educated, and most highly skilled \ngenerations of older Americans in our history.\n  We wanted to tap the ingenuity of our people working through schools, \nfaith-based institutions, workplaces, and communities in America and \nacross the world to tackle challenges large and small.\n  So today I am very pleased to be here as this legislation makes it \nover what I hope will be the final few obstacles before becoming law. \nWith this bill, our efforts to expand service will begin early in our \nschools all across America, and where we can marry learning in \nclassrooms with service in our communities, for those who choose such \nservice learning.\n  We have a high school dropout epidemic in America, with almost one-\nthird of all students, and nearly 50 percent of African Americans, \nHispanic, and Native Americans, failing to graduate with their class. \nFor each of these kids a decision to drop out is a million dollar \nmistake, since they will earn that much less over a lifetime than their \ncollege graduate friends.\n  For our country, this is a multibillion dollar mistake in increased \nwelfare, prison, and health care costs, and lost revenues from the lack \nof productive workers. Service learning has been shown to keep students \nengaged in school, and to boost student academic achievement. So we \nwill offer competitive grants to local and State partnerships to carry \nout these efforts in our schools.\n  Again, all of this will be voluntary activity, and it holds the \npromise of keeping so many of our young people engaged in school. In \naddition to elementary and secondary schools, colleges and universities \ncan play a critical role in the culture of service, so we will \nauthorize the Corporation for National Community Service to recognize \nand provide additional funding to ``campuses of service'' that do an \noutstanding job in engaging their students in important community work.\n  The U.S. Census Bureau tells us that nearly 61 million Americans \nvolunteered through or for an organization last year. Most Americans \ndid so through religious organizations, followed by nonprofits, related \nto education and youth. While many charities believe volunteers are \nessential to meeting their missions, only a small percentage of them \nactually invest in recruiting, training, and utilizing volunteers to \nmeet those missions.\n  There are always waiting lists of volunteers who want to use their \ntime and talents, but too often they are turned away or they do not \ncome back after a bad experience. So we will invest in a new volunteer \ngeneration fund, which will include matching funds by the private \nsector to increase the capacity of organizations to use volunteers to \nmeet local needs, especially among the poor and disadvantaged.\n  America is known for its innovation in business and the power of its \nmarkets. This bill will fuel the spirit of entrepreneurship in \nAmerica's nonprofit sector by creating a social innovations fund to \nfoster and support the next generation of great ideas in the social \nmarketplace, such as Teach for America, City Year, Habitat for \nHumanity, and the U.S. Dream Academy, which are some of the many \ninnovative ideas of our day.\n  Having mentioned the U.S. Dream Academy, that was started by a \nwonderful African-American man named Wintley Phipps. Wintley is a \nSeventh Day Adventist minister. But he decided there were too many of \nour young African-American kids and others who were children of \nprisoners, children of people who had been sent to prison, and that a \nhigh percentage of them would wind up in prison themselves unless we \ndid something about it. So he has brought computers into the inner \ncities. He has brought wonderful teachers and others who could be \nmaking themselves wealthy outside of this program, who are teaching \nthese kids how to live in a modern world. He has had an amazing \ntransformational change in so many children.\n\n  These are the types of things we have to encourage. The idea behind \nservice clearly has always been about transforming the person who \nserves. I saw how it changed my own life when I served a 2-year mission \nfor my church in the Great Lakes mission. That was Ohio, Indiana, and \nMichigan. A lot of our young missionaries serve all over the world, \nsuch as the young couple I mentioned last night. They came back from \nKenya and Nairobi, where they served I think about a year and a half. \nTheir main job was humanitarian, to help people to be able to know \nthere is a better way; to find water for people, to help them with \nfood, to help them with so many of their problems, to help them to know \nthere is a future. They did that voluntarily, at their own expense. \nThink about it, at their own expense.\n  I did my voluntary 2-year service at my own expense. I actually \npresided over congregations, and I helped out thousands and thousands \nof people who had problems, and in the process, the one who was helped \nthe most was myself. It was a great blessing in my life. I would not \nchange it for being a Senator, as a matter of fact. It was 2 years out \nof my life, but the most important 2 years, outside of marriage to \nElaine and raising a family with 6 kids, now 23 grandchildren, and 3 \ngreat-grandchildren. That was an important time in my life. My folks \nwere poor. They were not wealthy. They helped me and assisted me on my \nmission. We paid for it all ourselves, and I gave 2 solid years every \nday, 18 hours a day. I was very dedicated.\n  But service is also about solving problems in our Nation, and \nbringing real hope and impact on the ground in our communities with \nreal accountability for results. Some people have written off this bill \nas promoting ``paid volunteerism.'' This mistaken view is as a result \nof a fundamental misunderstanding about these programs. National \nservice programs give Americans opportunities for us to serve for a \nfull year or more to tackle tough problems, and that they, in turn, can \nleverage Federal investment in them to mobilize more traditional \nvolunteers to help.\n  When you look at the numbers, you can see it is a very smart return \non investment. Let me illustrate how this works. Today about 75,000 \npeople participate in national Federal service programs every year. I \nam not counting the State programs at this point, although I know some \nof these work in the States as well. But on AmericaCorps and programs \nsuch as this, Peace Corps, et cetera, the currently existing programs, \nthere are about 75,000 volunteers who participate\n\n[[Page S3598]]\n\nin national service programs every year.\n  Now, as a result of their efforts, 2.2 million traditional persons \nevery year come out to work on the same projects without pay. That is \nnearly 30 volunteers who get nothing from Government, for every 1 \nparticipant in a national service program, who receive a below-poverty \nstipend and a small education award to defray the cost of higher \neducation.\n  Let's do the math. If we assume that as we expand national service, \nas this bill does, the same ratio of participants to leveraged \nvolunteers holds, we will eventually be seeing roughly 7.5 million new \nunpaid volunteers every year serving throughout our great Nation.\n  My gosh, that is something worthwhile doing. Personally, I think it \nwould be more than that. Because with the bill we are also improving \nthe efficiency and the accountability of these programs. Far from \npromoting paid volunteerism, this bill is all about encouraging \ntraditional volunteerism. We find that people, once they get into this, \nwill love it and want to continue.\n  We will be targeting national service opportunities to build upon \nthis multiplying effect in order to tap the power of our Nation's \ngreatest asset, our people, to take on some of these large challenges.\n  Now, some have argued that the priorities outlined in this bill are \nspecifically designed to advance the President's domestic agenda or his \npriorities with the recent stimulus bill. Well, quite honestly, these \npeople must ascribe to Senator Kennedy and me abilities that neither of \nus would claim to have, including psychic powers and precognition. It \nwas more than 2 years ago that I began a dialogue with former officials \nfrom the George Herbert Walker Bush and George W. Bush administrations \nand other leaders of the national and community service field regarding \nthis proposal.\n  At that time, we agreed we wanted to harness the power of our \ncitizens to solve urgent national problems. It was then, 2 years ago, \nthat we identified five specific areas in which citizens could make a \nsignificant difference in addressing needs. We looked at education, and \nparticularly the high school dropout crisis, in the aftermath of the \n2006 report, ``The Silent Epidemic.''\n  We identified clean energy, opportunity, health and disaster response \nas key areas in which citizens could make a significant difference and \nwe discussed specific indicators of progress that would bring new \naccountability for results.\n  These five areas were identified long before there was even \ndiscussion of an economic stimulus and well before the Presidential \ncampaign got in full swing. Since that time, we have added veterans \nassistance as a key area of national need for the bill. But that is \nhardly an issue on which President Obama has cornered the market. I \nhope this clarifies the record on this point.\n  Having said all that, I am pleased that President Obama sees the \nvalue of this bill and wants to support it and will support it and has \nsupported it. It has been a matter of great uplift to me.\n  So it is with these particular challenges in mind that we drafted the \nServe America Act. Gone are the days when national service participants \nwill be able to go about their work without direction or \naccountability. Under our bill, their efforts will be directed at these \nspecific areas of national need. In all of these efforts, State and \nlocal organizations will lead the way. Volunteers will be leveraged and \nurgent needs will be met not by distant Government bureaucracies or \nGovernment programs but by people working on the front lines of our \ncommunities and neighborhoods.\n  Americans can also spread American compassion around the world. There \nhave been good efforts over the last 7 years and good bills in the \nCongress to fulfill the promise of President Kennedy's Peace Corps and \nexpand its numbers. It has been a bipartisan effort. Two former \nRepublican Presidents, Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, grew the Peace \nCorps during their 8 years in office. As a complement to the growth in \nthe Peace Corps, the Serve America Act will authorize and fund \nVolunteers for Prosperity, which last year alone mobilized 43,000 \ndoctors, nurses, engineers, and other skilled Americans to meet urgent \nneeds abroad, such as HIV/AIDS and malaria, such as medical procedures \nto help children who have cleft palates or helping kids to see again.\n  I could go on and on about what is being done by volunteers all over \nthe world. This cost-effective program puts skilled Americans in the \nfield for flexible term assignments often ranging from a few months to \nmore than 1 year and at extremely low cost to the Federal Government.\n  President Kennedy said that his Peace Corps would be truly serious \nwhen 100,000 Americans were working abroad every year. Well, Volunteers \nfor Prosperity, working together with the Peace Corps, could help \nfulfill that dream and would show the world the compassion of our \npeople and lead to a more informed foreign policy.\n  Having mentioned the Peace Corps, why don't I mention Eunice \nShriver's great husband. Sargent Shriver, when he fought for the Peace \nCorps, it wasn't an easy job. By gosh, he had to take on his own \nadministration and everybody else. But he did. What a wonderful, \ndecent, honorable leader and human being that man really is. If you \nwant to read a great biography, read his, how ebullient he always was \nand how he kept being positive about life and what he was trying to do. \nI feel fortunate that I have become very good friends of the Shrivers \nand their children who now are giving volunteer service, and so many \nothers.\n  I don't mean to center on this one family because there are so many. \nIn our church alone, we have some 55,000 serving all over the world. \nThat is just missionaries. If we go beyond that to humanitarian \nservice, there are a lot of people serving in those areas. Almost every \nmajor national disaster in the world, the first two churches in there \nwith food, clothing, pharmaceuticals, et cetera, happen to be the \nMormon Church and the Catholic Church. They work together. We have \nworked together all these years to do this type of work.\n  Volunteers for Prosperity, working together with the Peace Corps, \ncould help fulfill the dreams of so many and would show the world the \ncompassion of our people, leading to a more informed foreign policy. In \nall cases, we must promote accountability for results and be mindful--\nvery mindful--of cost.\n  As investments are made in service efforts, programs that are \nachieving real results should continue, and those that are not working \nshould be defunded.\n  We also need to do a better job collecting data on the results of \nthese programs and our civic health as a nation. The Nation collects \ngood data about its economy, but it can do a better job collecting \ninformation about our country's civic health. This bill will address \nthose needs by establishing a civic health index, building on the good \nwork of the NationalConference on Citizenship and the Corporation for \nNational and Community Service, to collect regular data on \nvolunteering, charitable giving, and other indicators of our civic \nlife, so Americans can work to strengthen these platoons of civil \nsociety that have always been the backbone of our democracy. I truly \nthink that this data collected for this index will inform our \ndecisionmaking throughout the policy spectrum.\n  Those of us supporting this bill--Republicans and Democrats alike--\nbelieve an investment in the ingenuity and entrepreneurial spirit of \nour people is one of the best investments our country can make. At a \ntime wroth with economic uncertainty, we should be all too willing to \ntap the greatest resource at our nation's disposal--the American \npeople. Our citizens are the most generous, energetic, and innovative \npeople in the world. I believe this bill will inspire them to do much \nof the heavy lifting in their own communities. At a time when many \npeople would argue that what we need is more Federal Government \nbureaucrats going into neighborhoods to fix things up, this bill will \nhelp private groups and individuals to continue their good work and to \ninspire other people to join in their efforts.\n  The Serve America Act has strong bipartisan support because it \nadvances a good American idea that has echoed down the ages. You see, \nwhen Americans want to solve problems, they don't first look to \ngovernment or the State--they look to themselves and their communities. \nThe innovation and\n\n[[Page S3599]]\n\nenterprise of the American people will always have a comparative \nadvantage over big government solutions. I know this from my own \npersonal experience, serving as a Mormon missionary when I was only 20 \nyears old, 20 to 22. I am proud to be associated with this effort to \nremind Americans of their duties to their country, to provide them more \nopportunities to serve it, and to fulfill the promise of the American \nexperiment, which is truly based on their participation in making it \nall work. I have faith in the American people that they will make this \nwork, and we will all be very happy when they do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, let me begin by thanking the Senator from \nUtah, whose leadership on this effort has been absolutely spectacular \nand who obviously, from the words he just spoke, has a deeply personal \nand historical understanding of the importance of this kind of service. \nWe are all very grateful to him for his partnership with my colleague, \nSenator Kennedy, and for the leadership he has offered along the way. I \nwould concur with every word he has spoken about it, all of the good \nthings he said it would do. I couldn't agree more. It will do all those \nthings and more. This is one of the better moments and better bills for \nwhich we get an opportunity as Senators to vote.\n  May I also thank Senator Mikulski. She has been tenacious and \nunbelievably engaged and enthusiastic and wonderful in her commitment \nto help bring us to this moment. I know how much Senator Kennedy and \nSenator Hatch both value the contribution she has made. We all value \nit. We are grateful to her for stepping in. She has been a tiger. \nPerish the thought for anybody who has wanted to run counter to her \nintent to get this done.\n  I want to speak for a couple moments. I yield myself perhaps 5 \nminutes. I think we have about 7\\1/2\\ remaining.\n  This effort we will vote on is going to generate the largest \nexpansion in national service since President Kennedy inspired the \ncreation of VISTA and the Peace Corps. For many of us in public life \ntoday, that was the formative moment. That was the demarcation point \nthat excited many of us about public service and brought a lot of us \ninto this arena.\n  It is particularly fitting that this legislation comes at a time when \na new President is inspiring a whole new era of volunteerism, much as \nPresident Kennedy did nearly half a century ago. It is equally fitting \nand appropriate that this legislation bears the name of our friend and \nbeloved colleague, my senior Senator from Massachusetts, Ted Kennedy. \nAs President Obama observed in his first address to Congress, Senator \nKennedy is ``an American who has never stopped asking what he can do \nfor his country.'' It was under Senator Kennedy's leadership as \nchairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee \nthat this bill was crafted.\n  This is nothing new for Senator Kennedy. In 1990, Senator Kennedy \nworked with the first President Bush to pass the original National \nCommunity Service Act, the Thousand Points of Light Foundation. \nPresident Bush called that particular effort, helped by Senator \nKennedy, the hallmark of his Presidency. When President Clinton needed \na champion for the proposed Corporation for National Community Service, \nhe didn't have to look any further than Ted Kennedy.\n  As Senator Kennedy notes, ``Service is a bipartisan goal.'' Indeed, \nMembers of Congress from across the political spectrum have pledged \ntheir support for this measure, which is a clear indication that the \nethic of service is spawned not by faithfulness to party but by \ndevotion to country and community.\n  The Serve America Act is also the work of our colleague from Utah, \nSenator Orrin Hatch. Senator Hatch has on many occasions been Ted \nKennedy's partner in these kinds of bipartisan efforts. Senator Hatch \npoints out that volunteer service is the lifeblood of our Nation and \nthat it benefits the volunteer as much, if not more, than the country \nthe volunteer is serving. We just heard those words a moment ago from \nSenator Hatch when he talked about his own experience as a young \nperson, about the mission for faith that he called the greatest of his \nlife. Service is what has always made America, America.\n  Many times in 2004, when I was running for President, I talked about \nde Tocqueville's visit to our country and how he found something \nspecial here. He wrote about it. He wrote that ``America is great \nbecause Americans are good.'' What he meant by that was he had observed \nthis extraordinary spirit of voluntarism, a kind of patriotism that was \ndefined by Americans who would voluntarily give back to their community \nor help other people or do something openly on behalf of their country \nand that community. He clearly had not seen or witnessed that kind of \ngiving in his experience in Europe.\n  Just as it was in de Tocqueville's day, Americans in many ways, big \nand small, are looking for opportunities to do more for their country. \nLast year, 62 million Americans gave 8 billion hours of service to the \ncountry. Last month, AmeriCorps had tripled the number of applications \nover the same month as a year ago. I note that my own kids who \ngraduated recently from college commented to me how so many of their \nclassmates in college were all engaged in some kind of local activity, \nnot necessarily fighting on the national stage, but they were involved \nmentoring kids or helping in a homeless shelter. Indeed, many of our \ncolleges and universities across the country boast unbelievably high \npercentages of voluntarism.\n  They are sending us a signal, telling us why this is a good moment to \ncreate a new corps of 175,000 volunteers who are going to be organized \nand assist in their efforts to do the things we need to do in America. \nThat means that in addition to the other volunteer programs, we will \nhave as many as a quarter of a million Americans serving full time or \npart time working to meet some of our most pressing challenges: \nmodernizing schools, building homes, serving as mentors or tutors in \nschools, helping with the sick in hospitals and clinics. And with the \nServe America Act, it is going to be a lot easier for professionals and \nretirees, the baby boomers, the people who were first challenged by \nPresident Kennedy's call to service in 1961, it is going to be much \neasier for them to get involved once again.\n  So we face great challenges. We should have no illusion about the \nmagnitude of those challenges. But we also have extraordinary \nopportunities staring us in the face. With the Serve America Act, with \nmore Americans involved, with Americans pulling together, I am \nconfident that is going to be the definition of America's future, and \nit will be a definition we will all be proud of.\n\n  So I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this \nimportant piece of legislation. I pay tribute, again, to my colleague, \nTed Kennedy, and his partners in this effort, Senator Mikulski and \nSenator Hatch, who have brought us to this time. Thank you.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, we are only minutes away from voting \non the cloture motion to proceed to the bill. I really urge all of my \ncolleagues to vote yes on this motion so we can proceed to this \nexcellent, dynamic, bipartisan bill called the Serve America Act.\n  Madam President, in November, people voted for us to change the tone \nin this country and change the direction and to work on a bipartisan \nbasis to find that sensible center that Colin Powell has so often \ntalked about, to meet America's compelling needs and challenges.\n  Now, we are not going to turn the economy around quickly, and we are \nnot going to solve some of our great foreign policy challenges \nimmediately. But we can embark upon a major initiative to be able to \nmeet compelling human needs in our society.\n  We have a bipartisan effort, crafted by Senators Kennedy and Hatch, \nto do\n\n[[Page S3600]]\n\nexactly that. It is a bipartisan measure to strengthen service and \nvolunteer opportunities. It expands opportunities for individuals of \nall ages to serve. Its passage is important now, when so many \ncommunities are struggling with so many pressing problems and so many \npeople want to serve.\n  This act invites many more Americans to give a year of service to \nsolve specific challenges in the areas of education, healthy futures, \nclean energy, even helping our veterans. When they come back from \noverseas, they are going to have somebody to be with them to get \nconnected to the services and to help those military families while \nthey are serving abroad.\n  We can do this by passing this legislation. It expands the number of \nnational service corps participants to 250,000 a year. But we do that \nover a 7-year period. We will be able, through prudent pacing of both \nrecruitment and funding, to do it over a 7-year period.\n  It also increased the Eli Segal Education Award from $4,725 to \n$5,350, pegging it to Pell grants, helping those who want to serve be \nable to reduce their student debt or to get a voucher to be able to \npursue higher education.\n  It supports increased service opportunities for students, \nparticularly very young people in the Learn and Serve Program, and \nmiddle and high school students through a summer of service and a \nsemester of service.\n  It also recruits retirees. Many retirees are ready, able, and willing \nto be involved through Senior Corps programs--RSVP, Senior Companions, \nand Foster Grandparents.\n  We have a program called Encore Fellowships to help retirees \nparticipate in longer term public service. It also supports \ninternational service opportunities. Senator Hatch is too modest to \ntalk about his own fine hand in this bill, but he has offered an \nexcellent suggestion that has been incorporated. It strengthens the \ncurrent Volunteers for Prosperity Program, which enables people who are \nretired, who have skills in business, public works, engineering, et \ncetera, to provide short-term international service opportunities in \ndeveloping nations.\n  This is what America is all about. De Tocqueville, when he studied \nour Nation, said: What is unique about this new country called America? \nWell, he called it the ``habits of the heart,'' where neighbor helps \nneighbor, whether it was the barn raising of another era, to also \nbuilding Habitat for Humanity here.\n  We need to harvest all of that goodwill and good intention to help \nturn our country around. I believe the Serve America Act does this. We \nwill be debating this legislation further tomorrow. I encourage people \nto vote yes on the cloture motion to proceed. I encourage all who have \namendments to come forward tonight and tomorrow morning so we can move \nit and get the job done. That is what the people want us to do.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland. She has played such a pivotal role on this bill, she and \nSenator Enzi in particular. And, of course, Senator Kennedy and I both \nfeel very deeply toward her and Senator Enzi.\n  I also want to thank Pastor Rick Warren. A little over a year ago, he \ncame to see me in my office. He heard I was interested in doing a \nservice in America bill, and he came and went over it with me and was \nvery interested and has done a great deal to inspire a number of us on \nboth sides of the floor to be able to do some things in this area.\n  I also want to thank John McCain. I have mentioned President Obama \nand Senator McCain, both of whom are supporters of this bill. And you \ntalk about bipartisanship--I think it shows the great character of \nSenator McCain that he would come and support this type of legislation \nand, as he is want to do, in so many ways. I have such respect for him \nand for the President himself. He has been nothing but a great help to \nus in this matter.\n  Like I say, this is an opportunity for all of us to vote for a \nprogram that will get people involved from teenage years through senior \ncitizen years, the vast majority of whom will not be paid a dime, the \nvast majority of whom will be leveraged into working because they want \nto serve the communities. They want to serve these organizations. They \nwant to be part of doing good.\n  Like I say, with 75,000 for AmeriCorps, and some of the others we \nhave mentioned, we estimate there are 2.2 million people, extrapolated \nout, who basically are leveraged out, to where they want to get \ninvolved, and not one of them is paid for doing it.\n  If we figure it out mathematically, in just real terms, with this \nbill, calling for 175,000 new workers, at low pay, stipends for school, \nwe believe we will have upwards of 7 million-plus people who will be \ngiving voluntary service to their fellow human beings, fellow women and \nmen, in their communities and children in their communities. It will do \nso much good for our society.\n  Madam President, I have worked on a lot of legislation in my 33 years \nhere, a number of which happen to be landmark pieces of legislation. We \nshould pass this, and I hope we can with a large majority. Should we \npass this? I don't know anything that will do more good in a general \nway for our society than this particular bill.\n\n  I hope everybody will vote for cloture tonight. I also hope we can \npass this bill in a relatively short period of time, and I hope we can \nmake it truly bipartisan in every way. We have endeavored to do that. I \nthink we have done a good job on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Green Jobs\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in recent weeks and months, a new phrase \nhas been born that has gained in popularity and support. The new phrase \nthat is so in vogue in the Halls of Congress and at the other end of \nPennsylvania Avenue is ``green jobs.''\n  I have no fault with the term. Everyone wants to create green-collar \njobs. Green jobs are believed to be a critical component of getting us \nout of the economic doldrums in which we find ourselves. A new White \nHouse middle-class task force recently focused on the creation of green \njobs as a means of fueling our economy and creating jobs for the middle \nclass. Vice President Biden has defined a green job as one that \nprovides products and services that use renewable energy resources, \nreduces pollution, and conserves energy and natural resources.\n  I don't disagree that the creation of these types of jobs is a very \nworthy ambition. This newfound desire for so-called green jobs has led \nme to remind my colleagues of an existing industry that is making great \nstrides to reduce pollution, conserve natural resources, and contribute \nsignificantly to our economy.\n  The U.S. renewable fuels industry has been creating good paying jobs \nin rural America for years. It has been 30 years since a tax incentive \nfor ethanol was passed and 17 years since I fathered the wind energy \ntax credit. These alternative energies have been producing a renewable \nresource right here at home that is reducing our dependence on foreign \noil and fossil fuels, and it has contributed to a cleaner environment.\n  U.S. domestic renewable fuels have been doing all these things long \nbefore it was cool or in vogue. So don't be surprised that this is the \nnature of America's farmers, ranchers, and entrepreneurs. They do \nthings because of the intrinsic value to our country and to our \neconomy, whether it is a fad on the east coast or not.\n  I happen to think it is great that there is a newfound zeal for \ncreating renewable resources here at home. I have been supporting our \ndomestic renewable fuels industry for nearly 30 years as a means to \nreduce our dependence on volatile nations for our energy, mostly for \npetroleum. I have been promoting clean wind energy since I fathered the \nwind energy tax credit back in 1992. I am pleased to see the success \nand the support wind energy now receives because of my tax incentive.\n  I hope my colleagues who tout the benefits today of the so-called \ngreen jobs fully realize the contribution the domestic ethanol and \nbiodiesel industries have been making for years in this area. Farmers \nacross this country produced more than 9 billion gallons of homegrown \nrenewable fuels last year. Ethanol production displaced 321 million \nbarrels of oil last year. That is the equivalent of our imports from \nVenezuela for 10 months. The use of 9 billion gallons of ethanol saved \nAmerican consumers $32 billion last year.\n  Yet even with this success, our farmers and the biofuel industry have \nbeen under constant attack--at least constant attack over the last 2 \nyears. In a high-priced public relations smear campaign, the food \nmanufacturers and the Grocery Manufacturers Association have tried \ntirelessly to denigrate the efforts of our farmers. In a baseless \ncampaign, they tried to blame the ethanol industry for raising food \nprices, even though corn makes up about a nickel of the cost of a box \nof Corn Flakes. The grocery manufacturers thought they found a weak \nlink in the food chain that they could target and scapegoat as a \nculprit behind the rising cost of food. It was clearly proven that the \ncost of energy had a significantly greater impact on food prices than \ndid other commodity costs.\n\n  The fact is, the ones responsible for the high cost of food are the \ncompanies whose names stare back at us as we go through the grocery \nstores and supermarkets, and they have never hidden their motive during \nthis smear campaign. It was stated clearly at the time the smear \ncampaign was started that it was about ``protecting our bottom line.''\n  Consumers are still seeing the impact of that pocket lining by big \nfood companies while commodity prices have dropped by half since their \nhighs last summer. But food prices are still at record highs. Even the \nprice of oil has dropped more than $100 a barrel. Yet food companies \ncontinue to keep prices high.\n  You don't need to take my word for it because we have the grocery \nstore chains themselves fighting back now. SuperValu, Safeway, and \nWegmans are just a few chains that are speaking publicly against the \nprice increases pushed on them by Kellogg's, General Mills, Kraft, \nNestle, and others. An article in the Los Angeles Times as recently as \nMarch 2 stated:\n\n       Our large grocery companies operating in Southern \n     California have seen the wholesale price for a carton of \n     Kellogg's Corn Pops rise about 17 percent since June, despite \n     a 52 percent plunge in corn prices from their peak this \n     month.\n\n  The chief executive for Safeway was quoted as saying:\n\n       It is disingenuous to consumers that all commodity costs \n     are coming down, interest rates coming down, everything is \n     coming down, and the national brands are taking their prices \n     up.\n\n  The chief executive of SuperValu described the situation as a \n``battleground'' with manufacturers right now over prices.\n  I am pleased to see others in the food chain call on these food \nproducers to lower prices in light of the large drop in commodity \nprices, but this isn't the reason I came to speak today. I would like \nto take just a few more minutes to share with my colleagues another \nassault that is taking place on biofuels.\n  In the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act, Congress enacted \nand expanded a renewable fuels standard to greatly increase the \nproduction and use of biofuels. A component of that renewable fuels \nstandard was a requirement that various biofuels meet specified life \ncycle greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. The law specified that \nlife cycle greenhouse gas emissions are to include direct emissions and \nsignificantly indirect emissions from indirect land use changes. This \nmeans that the emissions from planting, growing, and harvesting the \nfeedstock to the production of biofuels must be included in the \ncalculation. It also means that the Environmental Protection Agency \nmust determine and must measure the greenhouse gas impacts if there is \na significant conversion of forest or prairie-to-tillable land because \nof our biofuel policies.\n  For the past few months, the Environmental Protection Agency has been \nworking on what we call a rulemaking--notice of proposed rulemaking--to \nimplement the updated renewable fuels standard. While it hasn't been \nfinalized or made public, there are great concerns about this rule \nwithin the biofuels industry surrounding the science behind indirect \nland use changes. And, of course, when you think of the Environmental \nProtection Agency, isn't science what EPA is all about?\n  President Obama, during his Presidential campaign and as President\n\n[[Page S3602]]\n\nnow, has stated that his administration will return to decisions and \nactions based on ``sound science.'' In January, he said:\n\n       Rigid ideology has overruled sound science. Special \n     interests have overshadowed common sense.\n\n  Well, I would encourage President Obama and his staff to take a close \nlook at what the EPA is doing in this rulemaking process called a \nnotice of proposed rulemaking on renewable fuels standards. There are a \ncouple of people in the EPA's Office of Air and Radiation who firmly \nbelieve--do you believe this?--they can quantify the indirect land use \nchanges that result from our biofuels policies. I am afraid that the \nbureaucrats at the Environmental Protection Agency are going down a \npath of blaming our biofuel producers for land use changes around the \nglobe, and specifically even outside of the United States.\n  The fact is, measuring indirect emissions of greenhouse gas reduction \nis far from a perfect science, and dozens of credible scientists agree. \nThere is a great deal of complexity and uncertainty surrounding this \nissue. One study last year claimed that biofuels, as a result of these \nindirect impacts, actually led to greater emissions and greenhouse gas \nemissions than did gasoline. This conclusion defies common sense. Under \ncareful scrutiny, credible scientists on the other side disproved these \nconclusions, and I want to quote some.\n  Dr. Wang of the Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory \nreplied to these assertions by stating:\n\n       There has also been no indication that the United States \n     corn ethanol production has so far caused indirect land use \n     changes in other countries, because U.S. corn exports have \n     been maintained at about 2 billion bushels a year, and \n     because U.S. distillers' grain exports have steadily \n     increased in the past 10 years.\n\n  May I add that really what EPA--through indirect land use--is talking \nabout here, in the most common denominator, is they figure that because \nIowa or Missouri or Minnesota or Illinois corn producers are growing \ncorn, and some of it is going into ethanol, that someplace down in \nBrazil, farmers are just sitting around trying to calculate and are \ngoing to plow up acre for acre the amount of land that is maybe being \nused for production of ethanol at this point. Well, I think the \npractical matter is that just isn't happening, and that is exactly what \nDr. Wang is saying here. And if that were the case, what can the \nfarmers of our country do about it? Are we going to be at the point \nwhere something that happens in some other country is going to affect \nour policy here in the United States as to what we can grow and what we \ncan use that crop for? I don't think that is a credible position to \ntake.\n  Now, I quoted one study, but there are a number of credible studies \nthat have demonstrated that our biofuel policies will have little, if \nany, impact on international land use. A recent study by Air \nImprovement Resource found that the production of 15 billion gallons of \ncorn ethanol by the year 2015 should not result in new forests or \ngrassland conversion in the United States or abroad. Let's look at the \nUniversity of Nebraska. A peer-review study conducted there and \npublished in the Yale Journal of Industrial Ecology found similar \nconclusions. They concluded that corn ethanol emits 51 percent less \ngreenhouse gases than gasoline. A third study, conducted by Global \nInsight, found that it is virtually impossible to accurately ascribe \ngreenhouse gas impacts on indirect land use changes to biofuels.\n  There are a number of assumptions that can affect the conclusion \nabout indirect land use changes. With any model, if you put garbage in, \nyou will get garbage out, and I want to make sure the EPA isn't putting \ngarbage in. I want to make sure they know yields per acre for corn have \ndoubled between 1970 and today. I want EPA to know that nitrogen \nfertilizer used per acre has been declining since 1985. The \nEnvironmental Protection Agency also needs to know that the ethanol \nindustry today is vastly more efficient than it was just a few years \nago. Ethanol producers use one-fifth less energy today than they did \njust 8 years ago. More fuel is being produced from the same amount or \neven less land.\n  The California Air Resource Board is also trying to grasp this issue. \nThey are developing a low carbon fuel standard which is penalizing \nbiofuels with an indirect land use change. On March 2, 2009, to \ncounteract this, 111 scientists sent a letter to California Governor \nSchwarzenegger on this very matter. The scientists are from leading \nresearch labs such as Sandia, Lawrence Berkeley, and the National \nAcademy of Sciences, as well as leading educational institutions, \nincluding MIT, UCLA, Michigan State, and Iowa State. Scientists \ncriticized the California Air Resource Board for proposing a regulation \nthat alleges an indirect price-induced land conversion effect around \nthe globe caused by a demand for agricultural production and biofuels.\n  In other words, they said in this official report what I just said: \nThere isn't some Brazilian farmer just sitting around nervously \nawaiting whether he can plow up another acre of grassland in Brazil \njust because some more ethanol is being used out of products we grow \nhere.\n  The letter of these 111 scientists sent to Governor Schwarzenegger \nstated:\n\n       The ability to predict this alleged effect depends on using \n     an economic model to predict worldwide carbon effects, and \n     the outcomes are unusually sensitive to the assumptions made \n     by the researchers conducting the model run. In addition, \n     this field of science is in its nascent stage, is \n     controversial in much of the scientific community, and is \n     only being enforced against biofuels.\n\n  The two primary conclusions of these scientists are that science \nsurrounding indirect land use changes is far too limited and uncertain \nfor regulatory enforcement. Second, indirect effects are often \nmisunderstood and should not be enforced selectively.\n\n  Several of us in the Senate are trying to get the Environmental \nProtection Agency to wake up and reconsider some of their thoughts. \nLast week I had the opportunity to join my Iowa colleague, Senator \nHarkin, as well as 10 other Senators, in appealing to EPA Administrator \nLisa Jackson to be cautious on this issue and as doctors would say \nabout medicine: First do no harm.\n  Because of the incomplete and limited science, we urge in our letter \nagainst any premature and, of course, inaccurate conclusions on \nindirect land use changes. Instead, the EPA should move forward by \nallowing for public review and refinement of the methodology that they \nhave developed. I am afraid the climate folks at EPA are heading in the \nwrong direction on this issue. I do not think they are bad people, but \nI am afraid they do not understand much about American agriculture. I \ndo not think they are aware of the significant crop yield improvements \nwe have seen in recent years or the great potential for the next 20 \nyears.\n  I will just give my own farming operation as an example. In 1959, \nwhen I started farming, we were raising, on average, about 60 bushels \nof corn per acre. It happened that the first year I farmed I produced \nconsiderably less than that amount, but eventually, within 15 years, \nthis farmer, as well as the Iowa average, had gone to about 90 bushels \nof corn per acre.\n  Last year, in my county, we raised 175 bushels of corn per acre. \nDuring that period of time, we went from tilling the field probably six \nor seven times over to produce a crop to now a point where we are only \ntilling the field once or twice before harvest. In each of these \nprocesses, we are producing more corn, we are producing it more \nefficiently, and at the same time we have an abundance.\n  When I started farming, farmers were producing about enough food for \n44 other people. A family farmer today produces enough food for 140 \nother people.\n  I think we have made great progress, but I am not sure EPA \nunderstands the efficiency of the American farmer today and for sure \nthey do not understand that people in Brazil are not just sitting \naround, seeing how they can take advantage of the fact that American \nfarmers might be producing some of their crop for sustainable energy \nproduction in this country as opposed to importing more oil.\n  I also do not think these people fully understand the benefits of \nvaluable ethanol byproducts, which further reduce the effective land \nused for fuel production.\n  Along this line, do they understand that when you take a bushel of \ncorn to make 3 gallons of ethanol that corn is\n\n[[Page S3603]]\n\nnot gone forever, that 18 pounds of the 56 pounds that is in a bushel \nof corn is left over for animal feed? So it is not all going to \nproduction of energy.\n  To me, it defies common sense that the EPA would publish a proposed \nrulemaking with harmful conclusions about biofuels based on incomplete \nscience and inaccurate assumptions and especially in light of President \nObama's commitment to use sound science in decisionmaking by the \nbureaucracy carrying out the laws we pass. The Environmental Protection \nAgency's action, if based on erroneous land-use assumptions, could \nhinder biofuel development and extend America's dependence upon dirtier \nfossil fuels from parts of the world that are not very stable.\n  Agricultural practices and land-use decisions in other countries are \nnot driven by U.S. biofuel policies. In other words, there is no \nBrazilian farmer sitting around in Brazil, waiting to see what Iowa \nfarmers are going to do with their corn--for food or export or for \nfuel. Even if they were, we have no accurate way to measure it \nscientifically and we need to ensure that in that measurement, biofuels \nget credit for these increased efficiencies of production--of the basic \ncommodity as well as the increase in efficiency producing the ethanol.\n  President Obama was, and as far as I know is still, a strong \nproponent of our domestic biofuels industry and he especially was \nduring his time in the Senate. I know he recognizes the benefit of \nproducing homegrown renewable fuels, and I doubt he would agree with \nthe conclusion that biofuels emit the same or more lifecycle greenhouse \ngas emissions as does gasoline.\n  I hope the EPA will reconsider its conclusions on this or not hastily \ndraw conclusions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/23/senate-section/article/S3603-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3603-S3604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, during the height of the Presidential \ncampaign, President Obama made a number of high profile statements and \npromises about what actions he would take once he was elected and sworn \nin. These promises outlined a number of important issues such as \nclosing the revolving door for lobbyists in the executive branch, \nending the use of no-bid contracts, and curbing the influence of \nspecial interests, to name just a few.\n  Over the years, I have been an outspoken supporter of legislation \nthat would make the Government more transparent and open. I have \nauthored and supported a number of bills that would open the Government \nup and make it more accountable to the citizens. In particular I have \nbeen strong advocate for whistleblowers. Most importantly, I have \nalways pushed the Government to be accountable by conducting vigorous \noversight of the Federal bureaucracy regardless of which party controls \nCongress or the White House. I have been an equal opportunity overseer \nand have given my Republican colleagues as many headaches as I have \ngiven Democrats.\n  Given my background on oversight, I was supportive of some of the \nstatements President Obama made as a candidate with respect to \ntransparency and openness in Government. A document on the Obama \ncampaign Web site titled, ``Restoring Trust in Government and Improving \nTransparency,'' outlined ethics and contracting reform, and included a \nstatement that:\n\n       Obama will sign legislation in the light of day without \n     attaching signing statements that undermine legislative \n     intent.\n\nCandidate Obama further discussed signing statements during a campaign \nspeech where he said that his administration was ``not going to use \nsigning statements as a way of doing an end run around Congress.'' A \nvideo of that speech is available online for all to see.\n  I was also encouraged by candidate Obama's promises to protect \nemployees in the Federal Government who blow the whistle on fraud, \nwaste, and abuse. In yet another campaign document, candidate Obama \nstated that he would ``strengthen whistleblower laws to protect Federal \nworkers who expose waste, fraud, and abuse of authority in \ngovernment.'' That statement was posted on the Change.gov Web site of \nthe Obama Transition Team for all to see. It was a welcome message to \nthe employees of the executive branch that risk their careers and stick \ntheir necks out to alert Congress, inspectors General, and the public \nabout fraud, waste, and abuse in Government agencies and programs.\n\n  These employees, also known as whistleblowers, often do nothing more \nthan ``commit truth,'' and for it they are shunned by their agencies, \ncoworkers, friends, and government. My colleagues have all heard me say \ntime and again that whistleblowers are as welcome as a skunk at a \nSunday picnic. These patriot individuals believe that Government can do \nbetter for its citizens. They risk everything to make sure that laws \nare faithfully executed as they were intended and let Congress know \nwhen something is not working and needs fixing. Some of the most \nimportant reforms to our laws have come from whistleblowers, be it \nreforming our national security and law enforcement coordination \nfollowing the tragic events of 9/11, or ensuring we have clean water to \ndrink.\n  Given Candidate Obama's promise to not use signing statements to \ncircumvent the legislative intent of Congress and his pledge to support \nwhistleblowers, I was shocked to read the signing statement he issued \non the Omnibus apprropriations bill that was signed into law on March \n11. Not only did President Obama's action run contrary to his promise \nnot to use signing statements to circumvent the intent of Congress, he \nalso appears to have broken his promise to strengthen whistleblower \nlaws by singling out an important whistleblower protection provision \nthat Congres has included in every appropriations bill for the last \ndecade.\n  Sections 714(1) and (2) of the omnibus bill contains an \nappropriations rider that states that no appropriation shall be \navailable to pay the salary of any officer or employee of the Federal \nGovernment:\n\n       Attempts or threatens to prohibit or prevent, any other \n     officer or employee of the Federal Government from having any \n     direct oral or written communication or contact with any \n     Member, committee, or subcommittee of the Congress.\n\nThis rider was first included in appropriations bills in 1997 and has \nbeen included in appropriations bills since. It is a strong signal to \nall agencies that efforts to block federal employees from coming to \nCongress won't be tolerated.\n  However, the applicability of this rider is now in question given the \nsigning statement issued by President Obama. His signing statement, in \npertinent part, stated that this provision does not:\n\n     detract from [his] authority to direct the heads of executive \n     departments to supervise, control, and correct employees' \n     communications with Congress.\n\n  This statement is shocking. It acknowledges that President Obama \nenvisions a scenario where he would order a Cabinet Secretary to \nsupervise, control, and correct statements made by employees to \nCongress.\n  Worse yet, the signing statement goes further to add that this \nauthority would be used when employee communications would be \n``unlawful or would reveal information that is properly privileged or \notherwise confidential.''\n  I want to emphasize that word ``confidential,'' because you will hear \nabout that in just a minute.\n  While other Presidents have objected to this appropriations rider in \nthe past, President Obama's signing statement is even more problematic \nthan those because it states that he has the authority to not only \nrestrict privileged material, but also ``confidential'' information.\n  By failing to define ``confidential,'' President Obama has given a \nblank check to executive branch agencies to block communications with \nCongress related to an undefined, broad category of information.\n  Understand, it is a constitutional power and responsibility of this \nCongress to oversee, as part of our checks and balances of our \nConstitution, the agencies of Government to make sure laws are \nfaithfully executed, as the Constitution requires, and as money is \nspent according to Congress.\n  Even the New York Times noted President Obama's signing statement \nincludes ``one somewhat unclear objection'' that ``could be read as \nbumping up against the rights of executive branch whistle-blowers.'' \nBecause, in our constitutional responsibility, we have to rely upon \npeople in the executive branch to tell us when the job isn't being done \naccording to the Constitution or according to law.\n  So I want to go further than what the New York Times said and say: It \ndoes\n\n[[Page S3604]]\n\nmore than bump up against the rights of whistleblowers. It, in fact, is \ngoing to be a chill. It will chill executive branch employees from \nsharing information with Congress in our congressional obligation of \noversight.\n  It could also be construed to be an attempt to limit Members of \nCongress from conducting this constitutional duty. I wrote to President \nObama last Friday raising my concerns with his signing statement, and, \nmost importantly, the chilling effect that it will have on \nwhistleblower communication with Congress.\n  Today, I have not received a response. However, I read in the New \nYork Times on March 16 that an unnamed administration official stated \nthat President Obama is ``committed to whistleblower protections,'' and \nthat the administration ``had no intention of going further than did \nPresidents Bill Clinton and George Bush in signing statements \nconcerning similar provisions.''\n  Then, what is that word ``confidential'' doing in there? However, \nthat same official did not provide any detail on that additional term \n``confidential.'' I would like President Obama to answer my letter soon \nand clarify exactly what he meant in this signing statement. Absent a \nmore detailed response from President Obama, I cannot see how his \nsigning statement can be reconciled with the pledges and promises made \nby Candidate Obama, nor can I reconcile the criticism issued by \nCandidate Obama about President Bush's use of signing statements with \nthe statements made by that unnamed administration source in the New \nYork Times.\n  The unnamed source said President Obama ``had no intention of going \nfurther than did President Clinton or George Bush in signing \nstatements.'' Candidate Obama stated he would not use signing \nstatements in a manner similar to President Bush to circumvent the will \nof Congress. Now a member of the administration is telling the New York \nTimes that President Obama means to do exactly the same thing as \nPresident Bush in issuing signing statements.\n  It seems to me, if this is the case, Candidate Obama would have a \nproblem with President Obama's use of signing statements to underline \nthe intent of this appropriations rider on whistleblowers.\n  Now, a number of my colleagues were quick to object to signing \nstatements issued by President Bush but somehow have so far remained \nsilent regarding President Obama's use of signing statements. Well, to \nthose who had concerns in the past, I encourage you to take a close \nlook at this signing statement and the potential harm it will cause for \nMembers of Congress doing our constitutional responsibility of \noversight to see that the laws are faithfully executed.\n  Those who may believe my acts are motivated by partisan politics, I \nwant you to look at my record and see that I have repeatedly objected \nto signing statements that hindered the rights of whistleblowers. Just \none example: I objected to a signing statement issued by President Bush \nback in 2002 that restricted the application of whistleblower \nprotection provisions included in Sarbanes-Oxley.\n  I also, as another example, objected when a signing statement was \nissued by President Bush impacting specific reforms contained in the \nInspector General Reform Act of 2008.\n  In closing, I call upon President Obama to revisit the March 11 \nsigning statement and implement sections 714(1) and (2) in a manner \nconsistent with the spirit and intent of this legislation.\n  As a former Senator, he must recognize the good that whistleblowers \ndo by speaking out and by shedding light on fraud, waste, and abuse in \nGovernment agencies and programs.\n  Candidate Obama supported whistleblowers, but based upon his recent \nsigning statements, these campaign promises now ring hollow. I hope I \nhave interpreted him wrongly and will give him an opportunity to set \nthe record right because I hope he comes out the same way he did in the \ncampaign: strictly in support of whistleblowers, who are an essential \nelement of the process of our checks and balances of government as \nCongress does its constitutional job of oversight.\n  We do not know where all of the skeletons are in the closet. We do \nnot know all of the abuses of law. We do not know of all of the \nfraudulent things that are going on in government. We need that \ninformation from whistleblowers, and the best evidence I can give you \nof that is the $22 billion that has been brought back into the Federal \nTreasury since I got the False Claims Act of 1986 passed.\n  Most of that information would not have been available without the \ninformation from whistleblowers.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/23/senate-section/article/S3604-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I express my strong support for \nthe bipartisan omnibus lands package, HR 146, which the Senate passed \noverwhelmingly in a floor vote. I thank Energy and Natural Resources \nChairman Bingaman and Ranking Member Murkowski for working across the \naisle to put together this major piece of natural resources \nlegislation. As many of our colleagues have noted, this legislation \nrepresents the largest public lands package in decades. Most \nimportantly, this lands package represents a major victory for the \npeople--and the lands--of Colorado.\n  There is much in this bill to highlight. All of the areas that are \nslated for protection under this legislation are deserving of such \ndesignation.\n  I have personally visited many of these places that we took action to \npreserve--places like Longs Peak, a mountain over 14,000 feet that \nlooms over the great plains above Denver; the dramatic red rock canyons \nwhere water plunges to the Gunnison River from the Dominguez Canyons; \nand trails that climb up the steep rocky slopes of Colorado's northern \nFront Range looking out over the expanse of prairie that reaches to the \neastern horizon.\n  These lands represent a variety of landscapes and natural attributes. \nThey typify the diversity of our Nation, and their dramatic \nenvironments inspire visitors and give them a sense that anything is \npossible.\n  The connection we have to our natural landscapes and other equally \nimportant provisions--such as providing a funding mechanism for a water \nconduit that will help provide clean water to help enhance the \nproductivity of farms and ranches along the lower Arkansas River--\nunderscore why this bill is so important and worthy of our support. The \nareas and vital resources that are protected in this bill will help \nensure a vibrant and healthy environment and thereby provide a solid \nfoundation for a healthy and vibrant economy. This bill is not just \nabout the special places it encompasses it is about us and our values. \nIt deserves our support.\n  Specifically for Coloradans, this package will help preserve and \nprotect majestic public landscapes in Colorado and help provide needed \nwater supplies to communities and farmers on Colorado's productive \nEastern Plains. These are issues on which I have worked for many years \nin the U.S. House of Representatives and now in the Senate. On behalf \nof the people of Colorado, I am proud that the following provisions \nwill likely become law in the coming days.\n  First, the bill includes the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act of 2009. \nThis legislation will help protect the water supply for the Arkansas \nRiver Valley's communities and productive agricultural lands by \nadvancing the construction of the long-planned Arkansas Valley Conduit. \nThe depressed economic status of southeastern Colorado made it a \ndifficult financial undertaking for the region, a challenge that \ncontinues\n\n[[Page S3605]]\n\ntoday. This bill will help see this facility become a reality and help \nthe farming and ranching communities in the valley continue to produce \nneeded food for the state and Nation.\n  Second, the Colorado Northern Front Range Study Act included in the \npackage will help Coloradans protect the scenic Front Range mountain \nbackdrop in the northern Denver-metro area and the region just west of \nRocky Flats.\n  Rising from the Great Plains, the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains \nprovides a scenic mountain backdrop to many communities in the Denver \nmetropolitan area and elsewhere in Colorado. This mountain backdrop, \nwhich includes much of the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest, is an \nimportant aesthetic and economic asset for adjoining communities. It is \nalso part of our unique culture, having beckoned settlers westward \nbefore exposing them to the harshness and humbling majesty of the Rocky \nMountain West that helped define the region. The pioneers' independent \nspirit and respect for nature still lives with us to this day.\n  Yet rapid population growth is increasing recreational use of the \nArapaho-Roosevelt National Forest and adding pressure to develop other \nlands within and adjacent to that national forest. The bill directs the \nU.S. Forest Service to study the ownership patterns of the lands \ncomprising the Front Range mountain backdrop and identify areas that \nare open and may be at risk of development. Additionally, it directs \nthe Forest Service to recommend to Congress how these lands might be \nprotected and how the Federal Government could help local communities \nand residents to achieve that goal.\n  Third, the bill includes the National Trails System Willing Seller \nAuthority Act. This act will change the current law prohibiting people \nwho own land associated with several units of the trail system from \nselling those lands to the Federal Government. Because of this act, \npeople who want to sell land for inclusion in certain units of the \nNational Trails System will be able to do so.\n  Our national trails are a national treasure, and I have enjoyed them \nfor my whole life. We should allow property owners to sell their land \nalong these trails to the Federal Government to be part of our public \nlands legacy. But we must make clear that these land sales are from \nwilling sellers.\n  Finally, this legislation includes the Rocky Mountain National Park \nWilderness and Indian Peaks Wilderness Expansion Act. This provision \nwill designate nearly 250,000 acres of Rocky Mountain National Park as \nwilderness. The provision will guarantee the backcountry of Rocky \nMountain National Park will be managed so that future generations will \nexperience the park as we know it today. The legislation will also \nallow the National Park Service to continue its important efforts to \nbattle the devastating bark beetle infestation and to engage in \nnecessary wildfire mitigation efforts and emergency response actions.\n  The wilderness designation in this bill will cover some 94 percent of \nthe park including Longs Peak and other major mountains along the Great \nContinental Divide, glacial cirques and snow fields, broad expanses of \nalpine tundra and wet meadows, old-growth forests, and hundreds of \nlakes and streams.\n  Examples of all the natural ecosystems that make up the splendor of \nRocky Mountain National Park are included in the wilderness that will \nbe designated by this bill. At the same time, the wilderness boundaries \nhave been drawn so as to allow continued access for the use of existing \nroadways, buildings and developed areas, and privately owned land.\n  In conclusion, the passage of this bill in the Senate and House will \nmark the culmination of many years of work by a number of Coloradans, \nand I look forward to it becoming law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/23/senate-section/article/S3605-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3605]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FALMOUTH VOLUNTEER WEEK\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this week marks the Celebrate Volunteers \nWeek at the Falmouth Volunteers in Public Schools Program, VIPS, in \nFalmouth, MA. I would like to take this opportunity to commend and \nthank those that participate in the VIPS Program which fosters \ninteraction between the citizens of Falmouth and their public schools. \nThrough this connection the schools are empowered to enrich their \ncurriculum and the community at large benefits from a greater \nparticipation in their children's future.\n  The volunteers in this nonprofit organization log about 40,000 hours \neach year in support of the students, faculty, administration, and the \ncommunity. This incredible effort is also supported by the business \ncommunity in Falmouth that not only invests in VIPS events but also \nsupports employee participation.\n  By comprehensively involving all facets of the Falmouth community \nVIPS enriches the lives of all involved. They provide mentoring and \ntutoring programs aimed at raising children's self esteem and teaching \nEnglish as a second language. They have made school to business \npartnerships that enhance the educational experience of students by \nsharing resources with local businesses and bringing in guest speakers. \nTheir innovative Cross Age Science Teaching Program matches junior high \nschool volunteers to help elementary school students learn about \nelectricity.\n  VIPS has grown from its inception in 1982, when they only had a \nhandful of volunteers, to a robust program with over 1,100 volunteers \nin all 7 schools in Falmouth. When we think about improving our \neducation system, what we need to remember is that community \ninvolvement can make a world of difference. When you get folks in the \ncommunity to volunteer and become a part of the educational process, \nthey become invested in the success of the students. That is what is \nhappening in Falmouth. I congratulate all of the people who have helped \nmake the Falmouth Volunteers in Public Service a success, and I commend \nthe work that they do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/23/senate-section/article/S3605-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3605]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, it is with deep sadness that I \ndiscuss one of the deadliest attacks against California law enforcement \nin my State's history--an attack that took the lives of four Oakland, \nCA, police officers, and has left our community reeling from the shock \nof this terrible and senseless loss.\n  Every day, our law enforcement officers selflessly and bravely put \ntheir lives on the line to protect our families and our communities. If \nanyone, anywhere, needed a reminder of that, this tragedy puts a \nspotlight on the risk our police officers face every day.\n  On Saturday, March 21, what should have been a routine midday traffic \nstop for Oakland PD officers Mark Dunakin and John Hege quickly turned \ninto a murder scene.\n  After fatally wounding both officers, the suspect fled the scene, \nleading to a frantic manhunt that involved more than 200 officers from \nOakland PD, Alameda County Sheriff's Office, BART Police and the \nCalifornia Highway Patrol. The suspect was quickly tracked down to an \napartment. But when the SWAT team entered the apartment, he fired a \nseries of shots from inside of a closet, fatally wounding officers \nDaniel\n\n[[Page S3606]]\n\nSakai and Ervin Romans, and injuring a third, before he was shot and \nkilled.\n  In the days and weeks ahead, we will have important debates about the \nproblems with our justice system that allowed a violent offender to be \non the streets in clear violation of his parole. And we will debate the \nissue of powerful weapons in the hands of dangerous criminals.\n  As these debates move forward, I will work to give our law \nenforcement officers more support and more resources to adequately \nprotect our communities and protect themselves.\n  Now I want to pay tribute to these four fallen officers.\n  Sergeant Mark Dunakin, age 40, was an 18-year veteran of Oakland PD. \nHe was no stranger to violent crime, having worked homicide cases in \nthe criminal investigation division. But he later transferred to the \nmotorcycle traffic division where his days focused on patrolling our \nstreets on his beloved Harley Davidson, cracking down on drunk drivers \nand trying to always enforce our State's seatbelt laws. Sergeant \nDunakin is survived by his wife Angela Schwab and their three children.\n  Officer John Hege, age 41, had been with the Oakland PD for 10 years \nand had only recently started his dream assignment of becoming part of \nthe motorcycle traffic division. Respected by his colleagues and well \nliked by his neighbors, Officer Hege was often known to lend a helping \nhand, and even found time to umpire high school baseball in his free \ntime. After being gunned down this weekend, Officer Hege was declared \nbrain dead. And true to the heroism he exhibited in his life, his \norgans are being donated to help save other lives. Officer Hege is \nsurvived by his father and his beloved dog.\n  Sergeant Ervin Romans, age 43, had been with the Oakland PD since \n1996. As a member of the elite SWAT team, Romans was in charge of \nentering the most dangerous situations to confront and arrest \nbarricaded suspects. Known as just ``Erv'' to his friends and \ncolleagues, he was among a group of officers awarded the department's \nprestigious Medal of Valor in 1999 for helping to evacuate residents \nduring a fire. His captain, Ed Tracey said he ``had an exterior image \nof being the tough, rugged guy, but everyone knows he has a soft \nheart.'' Sergeant Romans is survived by his three children.\n  Sergeant Daniel Sakai, age 35, had recently been named a leader of \nthe entry SWAT team, and was known to all as a rising star. Before \njoining the SWAT team, Sergeant Sakai worked in the K-9 division, \nresponding to calls with his dog, Doc. He studied forestry at UC \nBerkeley, where he was a member of the Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity. He \nalso worked as a community service officer at Berkeley, escorting \nstudents around campus at night. He is survived by his wife Jennifer, a \nUC Berkeley police officer, and their daughter.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with the families, friends, and \ncolleagues of these fallen officers in this tragic time.\n  We must come together to support those suffering, and in the coming \ndays we must come together, firmly resolved to end the violence that \nhas for too long eaten away at the fabric of our communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/23/senate-section/article/S3606-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3606-S3608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I certainly feel the impact of huge and unpredictable \n     increases in all the necessities: gas/fuel, household energy \n     costs, food, clothing, travel, etc. All of these have risen \n     rather dramatically, sort of like dominoes. I am spending a \n     lot more for a lot less. As I am deciding not to go do \n     something or go buy something, I think of all the merchants \n     and businesses that will, if they are not already, suffer \n     from this (all of us not going places, and buying so much \n     less). I have almost totally quit eating out. Movies are out \n     of the question. I have greatly cut down on my driving. I \n     will just not visit places that I do not absolutely have to \n     (and, truth be told, there are not really that many places \n     one absolutely has to go). I go to the closest grocery store, \n     as they are all expensive. I go to the closest gas station. \n     There is no public transportation between my place of work \n     and my home, which is a real hardship. In fact, our bus \n     service is not bad in Boise, but it is cumbersome and \n     limited. I find this to be a problem. I will not be doing the \n     traveling and vacationing this year that I usually do. I will \n     not be able to visit family members that do not live in \n     Boise. This is not good for business, or morale and attitude \n     (mine). Because I have much less disposable income now, my \n     charitable donations will be, and already are, less. It is so \n     expensive to drive to any of the organizations where I like \n     to help out (``volunteering'') that it has had to be cut out. \n     Driving to attend the civic and fun groups that I am a member \n     of and the activities that I like to participate in is now \n     too costly to continue attending. Shopping? Out of the \n     question, with the exceptions listed above. By the way, did \n     you know that the average fuel usage in Ford's (last, I \n     believe) cars--in his day--was 25 mpg. Do you know what it is \n     in this country today? 21 mpg. We all know that this is \n     ridiculous. Clearly, the only entity that benefits from this \n     is fuel companies, and automakers that have not had to retool \n     their factories for decades. And even with that ``savings'', \n     they're hurting, too, now.\n       My suggestions, wishes, and hopes?\n       More public transportation, more types of public \n     transportation, more coverage, more frequent times that \n     public transport goes by, at a minimal cost to riders. And we \n     could use the money that we would save on highways to fund \n     it! Trains are wonderful, both for passengers and goods.\n       Laws that insist that all parts of the automobile industry \n     quickly get cars ready for market that are lighter, safer, \n     and much more fuel efficient; that include speedily \n     implementing the roll-out of vehicles (all vehicles, \n     including commercial and military) that some of them are \n     already developing, that are outstanding in design and are \n     environmentally responsible. I should say, that are already \n     in development, although perhaps not by the mainstream auto \n     makers. The use of fossil fuels should be seriously lessened. \n     Oil and gas companies should pay their rightful taxes, and \n     should not be subsidized. New ``green'' fuel sources should \n     be subsidized at the rate that oil and gas companies \n     currently are, and should get breaks on their taxes for the \n     early years. These should include, but be not limited to: \n     wind, solar, geothermal; and research into new, unknown \n     possible energy sources (with low environmental impact) \n     should also be encouraged with subsidies and whatever helps, \n     within limits. And the whole ``alternate fuel'' scenario \n     should have some honesty, reality, and integrity infused into \n     it. Specifically: ethanol is in no way environmentally \n     responsible or viable. It is just a give-away for the \n     corporate farm industry. Nuclear fission energy should be \n     banned. There is no way to ensure safe use now, or of the \n     spent fuel in the future, and it misuses precious water \n     resources. I am okay with working towards trying to make \n     nuclear fusion work.\n       No new drilling--anywhere! Americans can come up with \n     better ideas--let us go back to that ``good old American \n     ingenuity and know-how.'' We used to be on the cutting edge \n     for creativity, inventiveness, and new ideas--and the \n     development of them. Let us ``Be The Best We Can Be.''\n       And, lastly, and strongly related to the energy problems we \n     are experiencing: land and soil should be nourished and \n     protected. It should be used in an honest and responsible \n     way. That means, for example, that corn should actually have \n     nutritional value, should have lowered sugar levels, not \n     continue to be genetically and artificially altered so as to \n     be useless for actually providing nutrition for people, \n     because it is nothing but sugar that makes the creation of \n     corn syrup, which is destroying the health of our kids, among \n     other unhealthy products, easy and cheap to produce for \n     greedy and/or corporate ``farmers.'' The land should be \n     cherished, not over-used, misused, and abused. It should be \n     mindfully used to produce food for people--good, nourishing, \n     healthy food to nourish healthy children, mothers, and all of \n     us.\n       The health, safety, and financial benefits of changing our \n     practices and policies are so extensive that it would take \n     too much space to enumerate here. We could be at the world \n     leaders of industry, development, inventiveness, and \n     productivity if we, as a country, were willing to look at \n     things in a fresh way, rather than stubbornly clutching at \n     ``doing things the same old way.''\n       We are supposed to be conservatives--let us actually \n     practice conserving.\n                                                            Susan.\n\n[[Page S3607]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n       Our family of 5 spends more than $500 a month now on \n     gasoline (for 3 vehicles--our 3 kids can all drive now), not \n     to mention the higher food prices that are a result of higher \n     fuel costs to truckers and the foolish ethanol policy of the \n     government. We are needing to work additional jobs just to \n     try to make basic ends meet and avoid going deep into debt. \n     If prices go up further, we will still be going into debt \n     just to cover the basics of food, clothing, transportation \n     and shelter.\n       We are an average family (financially we make about 60,000 \n     a year from 3 jobs between all of us, with 2 now in college--\n     1 just starting, but living at home), but face above average \n     costs when compared to the averages mentioned in the media \n     and by politicians. For example, Barack Obama makes light of \n     a temporary lifting of the gas tax, saying it would be 30 \n     cents a day. We would be at least twice that much, and many \n     truckers would save even more if diesel tax was lifted. And \n     we are an average family, so I do not believe his numbers for \n     a minute.\n       We cannot afford to buy an expensive high gas mileage small \n     car to offset the higher gas prices. We must continue to \n     nurse along our two more than 10-year old vehicles that get \n     19 miles per gallon. Most poor and lower-middle class are in \n     the same situation as us. The upper middle-class and wealthy \n     may be able to handle it to some better degree, although I am \n     not a participant in class envy and they should be considered \n     too. But it is interesting how the [liberals] claim to care \n     about the poor and middle class, yet their do-nothing policy \n     on energy contradicts their claims.\n       If they think taxing oil companies and redistributing the \n     tax to poor and middle class with rebate checks will solve \n     the problem, they are wrong. The tax will be passed on in \n     ever-higher gas prices and/or the oil companies could limit \n     production to stay just below the windfall tax threshold, \n     thus causing shortages and even higher prices. It did not \n     work when Jimmy Carter tried it, and tweaking it a little to \n     allow oil companies to trade the tax for alternative energy \n     production would likely not help much, in my opinion. We need \n     to get the price down, not give each person a small piece of \n     the large wealth redistribution that helps them for only a \n     few months.\n       The government needs to remove the restrictions and \n     regulations that hinder progress in tapping our domestic \n     energy sources of all types. Many claim that tapping into our \n     domestic oil and natural gas resources would not do any good \n     for many years. They are wrong. And even if they were right, \n     do you avoid planting a tree just because you will not get a \n     full crop of fruit or sufficient shade for several years? \n     This ``tree'' of increased domestic oil supply should have \n     been planted over 10 years ago.\n       But here is why they are wrong: if speculators are part of \n     the cause of increased oil prices whenever there is something \n     in the Mideast that brings concern about possible reduced \n     supply, then they would logically be part of the cause of \n     reduced oil prices if they received good news that our \n     government was finally serious about allowing increased \n     domestic supply. There would be an almost immediate drop in \n     oil prices which would soon show lower prices at the pump. On \n     top of that, the foreign nations that have control over us \n     now would not want to see us quit buying from them in the \n     future, so they would likely increase production to try to \n     get us to not increase our production. Increasing their \n     production would cause an additional price decrease within a \n     short amount of time.\n       Increasing our domestic drilling and exploration would \n     create additional jobs, as oil companies would hire people to \n     do the additional exploration and drilling. And additional \n     revenues would be created for the states that participated, \n     by leasing land, taxes paid through the additional \n     employment, etc. This would help our national economy as \n     well, as it became a positive ripple effect.\n       Increasing other types of energy sources, such as wind, \n     solar, coal, shale, nuclear, natural gas, etc. are all good. \n     Even ethanol is good where it can be produced regionally and \n     help regionally without being forced on us at a certain level \n     by the government, causing a shortage of corn and higher food \n     prices.\n       A final thought: we need fewer lawsuits by \n     environmentalists, which bog things down way too long. We \n     need to reform the laws to keep them from preventing us from \n     solving this problem. If the government okays further \n     drilling, etc, but allows the radical environmentalists to \n     bring up lawsuit after lawsuit, we'll still be in trouble. \n     Allow a basic environmental process to ensure we are doing \n     this in a reasonable manner, and then have them get out of \n     the way so we can start making use of our resources.\n       Thanks for allowing me to give my input.\n     David, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a 15-year Idaho resident, and I commute about 55 miles \n     a day to work. The cost of gasoline/diesel is having a \n     profound effect on the local economy-not to mention my own \n     finances. Idaho, and most other inland states, are feeling \n     the effects directly in higher prices across the board. I \n     know several small business owners, in different markets, who \n     have related to me the disastrous impact this is having on \n     them. I cannot stress enough that we need to increase the \n     supply side of this equation. But, of course, everyone in \n     Washington knows this and the situation is being exploited by \n     those on the left to increase dependence on government.\n       It is obvious to me that the liberals in Congress see high \n     fuel prices as vehicle to provide them greater control over \n     the lives of the citizens of the United States. The more low \n     income people have to spend on fuel, the more likely they are \n     to require government support in other areas of their lives. \n     This is intended to cement the liberal base as permanent \n     government serfs with no choice in for whom they vote. \n     Ultimately, this is an attack on our liberty from within \n     that, if left unchecked, will result in less freedom, and \n     more and bigger government.\n       There are a number of facets to this problem: environmental \n     regulation, government regulation, and political demagoguery \n     that is unparalleled in our history. The oil companies are \n     not the problem. Most people I know realize this and are fed \n     up with environmental bullshit reasons for not exploring for \n     more oil. The notion that there is a shortage of oil or, that \n     we are running out of oil, is simply not born out by the \n     facts. But facts do not matter when there is an agenda. As \n     Goebels said, the bigger the lie, the easier it is to sell.\n       I would love to discuss this at length with you, but I am \n     losing faith in the process. However, I appreciate that you \n     are fighting the good fight. Please keep it up.\n     Mike.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am not sure if I have any faith in our Congress changing \n     anything but I feel some satisfaction with at least voicing \n     my thoughts and if I may say so my feelings about these \n     soaring energy costs.\n       Yes, the soaring energy costs have had a huge impact on me. \n     I am a single women working as a Physical Therapist \n     Assistant. I live 30 miles from my place of employment. I own \n     horses so I own a pick-up truck. Up until recently I only \n     drove my truck. It was not great on fuel economy, but as a \n     person with only one income, a house payment, a vehicle \n     payment, plus other bills. It was not feasible to buy another \n     vehicle. As a single women that is not mechanically inclined \n     (nor do I have the time), I need vehicles that are safe and \n     reliable. Well, now, I have a small vehicle. So now I have \n     two vehicle payments, plus full coverage insurance on two \n     vehicles, plus a house payment, plus fuel, plus all the other \n     costs to get buy! Fuel for my truck, just to go back and \n     forth to work for one week was costing me between $80 & 100 \n     reg. gas, the ``cheap'' stuff! That is not counting doing \n     anything on the weekends, or any ``extra'' driving. That is \n     simply working 4-5 days a week. I usually work (4) 10s and \n     sometimes a few extra hours on day 5. So yes, now my grocery \n     bill has been reduced, my credit cards are being used more, \n     and it scares the hell out of me!\n       My home energy bill also nearly doubled. I have not doubled \n     my use. I am away from home most of the time. I rarely watch \n     television, except to turn the news on from 4:30 A.M. to 6 \n     A.M. when I am getting ready for work. I turn my computer on \n     for a few minutes several days a week. I go to bed early so \n     my lights are not even on much, yet my power bill doubled! \n     No, I do not use much air conditioning either! I have a small \n     house less than 1100 square feet. I have had it for sale for \n     over a year and I have not been able to sell it. I replaced \n     the roof last summer. The windows could stand to be replaced, \n     yet I cannot afford to replace those old aluminum windows \n     with vinyl.\n       Oh, I know most people would say to give up my animals and \n     move to town, but then what is all of this about? What pray \n     tell am I working for? My animals bring me joy and peace from \n     a crazy world. I have raised/owned Arabian horses since 1985, \n     and I have owned horses in general most of my 50 years. So \n     the thought of going to work just to pay taxes, lay on a \n     couch and watch TV after work and on weekends does not sound \n     like much of a life to me. So if we cannot have a few things \n     that bring us joy and comfort why are we working?\n       Yes, the out-of-control energy costs is slowly wiping all \n     of ``working'' people out. If everything is taken away and \n     all that is left is work, who wants to live that life? Think \n     about it! Better yet, maybe those [who enjoy privileges and \n     expensive lifestyles] should come live with us that really \n     have to work and live on a budget. Let us take away those \n     expense accounts and all the other freebies! Do you know how \n     many people think like me? There are a lot.\n       Thank you for giving me the time to get this off my chest.\n     Judy, Wendell.\n                                  ____\n\n       I do not wish to join the whining masses about how energy \n     prices have affected us all. Instead, I wish that Congress \n     would act to pass a national energy policy that would \n     encompass all areas of energy development. We did not win \n     World War II by building only ships or tanks or airplanes, \n     etc. We conquered the global threat at that time by building \n     all assets necessary to win and developed new technologies \n     for the future. The liberals' bumper sticker mantra that we \n     cannot drill our way out of this mess refuses to acknowledge \n     that the way out of this ``mess'' is to get out of our \n     ``boxes'' and look at the wider picture. Back in the 1970s, I \n     learned that C-ration California peanut butter burned right \n     out of the can whereas Georgia stuff would not. Why limit our \n     research to corn, chicken parts, et.al. as potential fuels? \n     We should not keep subsidizing our farmers to not plant if \n     corn and other foods/fuels are now in such demand. We \n     obviously need greater oil production and refining capacity \n     as a significant part of overcoming those\n\n[[Page S3608]]\n\n     forces in OPEC that continue to enslave us to their output. \n     We should work on developing Hydrogen fuel cell technology \n     and put real delivery ability on the ground because who is \n     going to buy a car he cannot refuel? We absolutely must \n     develop nuclear reactor improvements and capacity which is \n     being developed right now in Idaho. Limit individual \n     financial incentives for energy savings because their cost \n     savings should be incentive enough and any rewards beyond \n     that are too open to fraudulent claims and wasting taxpayer \n     money. Congress is too good at wasting our money already. \n     Buying ``conservation credits'' like Al Gore does for his \n     estate is a sham for the wealthy. It is akin to buying \n     indulgences centuries ago that was the final ``straw'' that \n     began Martin Luther's Reformation. The [conservatives] in \n     Congress lazily missed an opportunity to make a worthwhile \n     energy policy that ``thinks outside the box'' in the last \n     several years and, I fear, that if the [liberals] win control \n     of either house in November that we are doomed to suffer the \n     consequences laid out over a thousand years ago by a Greek \n     philosopher that all democracies are doomed to failure that \n     as the people vote more liberties and indulgences to \n     themselves their governments will be more unable to pay for \n     them and they will lapse into anarchy. I believe we are in \n     the third of his four stages right now.\n       I hope this has not been too boring or offensive. We, as a \n     nation, must act to avoid an energy demand catastrophe, and \n     our Congress is that body that our forefathers have ordained \n     as the ones to do that task. I appreciate your time if you \n     have really read this,\n     Bill, Idaho Falls.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/23/senate-section/article/S3608-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            TRIBUTE TO WOODFORD COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

CAINE\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wish today to honor \nChristopher G. Caine, who will be leaving International Business \nMachines, IBM, Corporation after 25 years.\n  For the past 13 years, Chris has served as IBM's vice president for \ngovernmental programs. At this position, Chris has had responsibility \nfor all global public policy issues that impact the IBM Corporation. He \nrepresented IBM at a number of policy and economic forums that \naddressed critical issues in the emerging global economy, including the \n2004 National Intelligence Council Conference convened by the Center \nfor Strategic and International Studies; the 2003 World Knowledge Forum \nin Seoul, Korea; the 2003 World Economic Forum; and events put on by \nthe Shanghai International Forum and the Congressional Black Caucus.\n  Before taking his current position, Chris served as IBM's director of \nHuman Resources and Environmental Policy, where he worked on a variety \nof domestic policy issues including health-care reform, labor, \npersonnel, health and safety, environment, and energy. Prior to that, \nhe worked in a variety of government relations capacities for IBM has \nwell as Coca Cola, the Eaton Corporation, and the Electronic Industries \nAssociation.\n  In addition to his professional success, Chris has taken the time to \nuse his skills and expertise for public service. He currently serves on \nthe State Department's Advisory Committees on International Economic \nPolicy and International Communication and Information Policy, where he \nshares his expertise on global economic issues with our country's top \nforeign policymakers. He was appointed by then-Governor Mark Warner to \nthe Virginia Information Technology Investment Board, which works to \nprovide the Commonwealth's government with information technology that \nwill improve efficiency, safeguard important information, and enable \nthe government to better serve the public. He also serves on the \nadvisory boards of the Global Strategy Institute, Ford's Theatre, the \nConstitution Project, and Brainfood.\n  Last year, Chris established the Caine's Scholar Award for Global \nLeadership, Business and Policy at Lafayette College, where he earned \nhis bachelor's degree. This award provides recipients, who are enrolled \nin Lafayette's policy studies program, a stipend for a summer \ninternship experience.

A bill to create a systemic risk monitor for the financial \nsystem of the United States, to oversee financial regulatory activities \nof the Federal Government, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, at the heart of the deep recession is a \ncrisis in our financial system that has choked off credit upon which \nthe health of our economy depends. With their jobs disappearing and \ntheir life savings evaporating, the American people rightly ask why the \nFederal Government failed to protect them from Wall Street's greed, \nunwise decisions, and manipulations that have caused so much harm.\n  As a former Maine financial regulator, I am convinced regulatory \nreform is essential to restoring public confidence in our financial \nmarkets. America's main street small businesses, homeowners, employees, \nsavers, and investors deserve the protection of a new regulatory system \nthat modernizes regulatory agencies, sets safety and soundness \nrequirements for financial institutions to prevent excessive risk-\ntaking, and improves oversight, accountability, and transparency.\n  To achieve those goals, I am introducing the Financial System \nStabilization and Reform Act of 2009. This legislation will \nfundamentally restructure our financial regulatory system. It will \nstrengthen oversight and accountability in our financial markets, and \nit would help rebuild the confidence of our citizens in our economy and \nhelp restore stability to our financial markets.\n  Mr. President, as financial institutions speculated in increasingly \nrisky products and practices, not one of the hundreds of Federal and \nState agencies involved in financial regulation was responsible for \ndetecting and assessing the risk to the system as a whole. The \nfinancial sector was gambling on the rise of the housing market, yet no \nsingle regulator could see that everyone, from mortgage brokers to \ncredit default swap traders, was betting on a bubble that was about to \nburst. Instead, each agency viewed its regulated market through a \nnarrow lens, missing the total risk that permeated our financial \nmarkets.\n  In order to prevent this problem from recurring, a single financial \nregulator must be tasked with understanding the full range of risks our \nfinancial system faces. This regulator also must have the authority to \ntake proactive steps to prevent or minimize systemic risk.\n  This is an urgent need. Unemployment reached 7.8 percent in my home \nState in January. Last month, the national unemployment rate hit 8.1 \npercent, the highest in 25 years. Earlier this month, the Federal \nReserve reported that the net worth of American households plummeted by \nmore than $11 trillion in 2008, a staggering drop of nearly 20 percent, \nthe most in 63 years. And, at the same time, court proceedings and \ncongressional hearings on the Bernie Madoff case revealed that this \nmultibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme of nonexistent transactions and \nfraudulent statements was perpetrated for\n\n[[Page S3612]]\n\nyears under the very noses of the Federal agencies that should have \nstopped it.\n  The American people need more than words of optimism or promises of a \nturnaround. With their jobs lost or in jeopardy, with their financial \nplans in ruin, and now with their hard-earned tax dollars on the line \nto clean up the mess, they need reforms. They need action.\n  The American people are angry, and rightfully so. They are angry \nbecause the current crisis was not created from their own bad \ninvestments or decisions, but by those on Wall Street who concocted \ncomplicated financial instruments that ended up backfiring. Investment \nfirms borrowed to the hilt when they did not have the resources to do \nso.\n  When the average American decides to purchase a security on credit, \nmargin requirements dictate that he or she put up at least 50 percent \nof its value in cash. But investment banks did not have to play by the \nsame rules when they bought for their own accounts. And they took \nadvantage of this system.\n  Indicative of the extent of the borrowing, Bear Stearns had a \nleverage ratio of 35 to 1, which means the firm borrowed $35 for every \ndollar of its own money. For example, suppose your net worth is a \ndollar and you combine that dollar with $35 in borrowed money to buy an \nasset worth $36. If the value of that asset declines by only $2, to \n$34, you are now bankrupt. This is exactly what happened to Bear \nStearns and other investment banks.\n  Since last spring, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, on which I serve as ranking member, has held a series of \nhearings on the roots of the present crisis. We began by looking at the \nderivatives and commodity markets and more recently looked at the steps \nthat can be taken to protect our Nation's financial system as a whole \nby creating a systemic-risk regulator. The many expert witnesses who \nhave appeared before us have described how our financial system was \ndestabilized by a combination of reckless lending, complex new \ninstruments, securitization of assets, poor disclosure and \nunderstanding of risks, excessive leverage, and inadequate regulation.\n  Our witnesses were in wide agreement that the mounting risk went \nvirtually undetected by the vast network of Federal and State \nregulatory agencies. As the Government Accountability Office put it in \na recent report to the committee, ``it has become apparent that the \nregulatory system is ill-suited to meet the nation's needs in the 21st \ncentury.'' To meet this challenge, Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke \nsaid recently:\n\n       We must have a strategy that regulates the financial system \n     as a whole, in a holistic way, not just its individual \n     components.\n\n  This statement confirms a view that I find inescapable, our current \nsystem suffers from regulatory gaps that pose enormous risks to our \nentire economy. The holistic approach recommended by Chairman Bernanke \nis the guiding principle of the comprehensive legislation I introduce \ntoday. Like legislation I introduced last fall, this bill would also \nregulate Wall Street investment banks for safety and soundness and \nclose the gap that has allowed credit default swaps and other financial \ninstruments to escape regulation by both Federal and State regulators.\n  To ensure a systemic approach to Federal financial regulation, this \nlegislation calls for the creation of an independent financial \nstability council to serve as a ``systemic-risk regulator.'' The \ncouncil would maintain comprehensive oversight of all potential risks \nto the financial system, and would have the power to act to prevent or \nmitigate those risks. The financial stability council would be composed \nof representatives from existing Federal agencies which now have the \nresponsibility to oversee segments of the financial system--the Federal \nReserve; the Treasury Department; the Securities and Exchange \nCommission; the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; the Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation; and the National Credit Union \nAdministration.\n  The council would be led by a chairman nominated by the President and \nconfirmed by the Senate, with the responsibility for the day-to-day \noperations of the council. The chairman would be required to appear \nbefore Congress twice a year to report on the state of the country's \nfinancial system, areas in which systemic risk are anticipated, and \nwhether any legislation is needed for the council to carry out its \nmission of preventing systemic risks.\n  Witnesses who have appeared before our committee have stressed the \nneed to ensure that the systemic-risk regulator has the responsibility \nand the authority to ensure that risks to our financial system are \nidentified and addressed. If it is not clear who has that \nresponsibility, then agencies will dig in their heels and resist \nchanges they do not agree with, and engage in finger-pointing when \nthings go bad. At the same time, other witnesses have stressed the \ndangers of consolidating too much power in the hands of a single \nregulator and the need to maintain the level of oversight Congress has \nhistorically exercised with respect to financial market regulation.\n  The financial stability council created by this legislation balances \nthese concerns. As Damon Silvers, the AFL-CIO representative on the \nTARP congressional oversight panel, testified before our committee \nearlier this month:\n\n       [T]he best approach is a body made up of the key \n     regulators. . . . It is unlikely a systemic risk regulator \n     would develop deep enough expertise on its own. . . . To be \n     effective it would need to cooperate. . . . with all the \n     routine regulators where the relevant expertise would be \n     resident. . . .\n\n  Former Senator John Sununu, another member of the congressional \noversight panel, recognized that ``systemic risk can materialize in a \nbroad range of areas within our financial system. . . . Thus, it is \nimpractical, and perhaps a dangerous concentration of power, to give \none single regulator the power to set or modify any and all standards \nrelating to such risk. Systemic risk oversight and management must be a \ncollaborative effort. . . .''\n  The financial stability council will be the primary entity \nresponsible for detecting systemic risk and implementing the steps \nnecessary to protect against that risk. The key to such a structure, I \nbelieve, is to ensure that the council is headed by a chairman \nconfirmed by the Senate and subject to oversight by Congress, who is \ndedicated entirely to the mission of the council, and who does not \ncarry a bias in favor of any particular agency on the council.\n  Some have suggested that the Federal Reserve play the role of \nsystemic-risk regulator. That is not what my bill contemplates. The \nchairman of the Federal Reserve will be a member of the council, and of \ncourse, the Nation's top banker will play a critical role in how the \ncouncil discharges its responsibilities. But in my view, the Federal \nReserve already has enough on its plate, and does not need additional, \nheavy responsibilities. I should add that nothing in my bill alters the \nFederal Reserve's role with respect to monetary policy in any way.\n  This bill, however, would apply safety and soundness regulation to \ninvestment bank holding companies by assigning the Federal Reserve this \nresponsibility. Although the five big firms have left the field, this \nis a necessary step. Any new investment bank would fall into the same \nregulatory void as its predecessors. The SEC would be able to regulate \nits broker-dealer operations, but no agency would have the explicit \nauthority to examine its operations for safety and soundness or for \nsystemic risk. The collapses at Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers \nillustrate the tremendous costs that can be inflicted if these \ninvestment banks are not regulated for safety and soundness. Under this \nlegislation, the council's role as the systemic-risk regulator will \nsupport the critical importance of the Federal Reserve's safety and \nsoundness duties.\n  Under my bill, whenever the financial stability council believes that \na risk to the financial system is present due to a lack of proper \nregulation, or by the appearance of new and unregulated financial \nproducts or services, it would have the power to propose changes to \nregulatory policy, using the statutory authority provided to our \nexisting Federal financial regulatory agencies.\n  The financial stability council will have the power to obtain \ninformation directly from any regulated provider of financial products \nand, in limited form, from State regulators regarding the solvency of \nState-regulated insurers.\n\n[[Page S3613]]\n\nThe council will also be able to propose regulations of financial \ninstruments which are designed to look like insurance products, but \nthat in reality are financial products which could present a systemic \nrisk. But--and I want to stress this point--my bill does not preempt \nState law governing traditional insurance products.\n  In keeping with the recommendations of the experts who testified \nbefore our committee, the bill provides the council with the power to \nadopt rules designed to address the ``too big to fail'' problem. How \noften we have heard that term lately. We hear financial experts and \nFederal officials telling us we have to continue to bail out large \ninstitutions like AIG because they are ``too big to fail.'' We need to \nremedy this problem so we don't find ourselves in the same situation a \ndecade from now. This bill provides the council with the power to adopt \nrules designed to discourage financial institutions from becoming ``too \nbig to fail'' or to regulate them appropriately if they become what we \ncall ``systemically important financial institutions.'' The need to \nregulate how these systemically important financial institutions, or \n``SIFIs,'' invest their own capital was not previously recognized. \nIndeed, the prevailing attitude was that if firms failed because of bad \ninvestments, possibly bringing some of their creditors down with them, \nthat was how the market was supposed to work. In true Darwinian \nfashion, eliminating firms with less investment acumen would only serve \nto strengthen American capitalism. We now know the fallacy of that \nreasoning, and it has been a very painful lesson, for it is not just \nthe large investment houses that are hurt, but average Americans from \nMaine to California also suffer.\n  Under this legislation the council would help make sure financial \ninstitutions do not become ``too big to fail'' by imposing different \ncapital requirements on them as they grow in size, raising their risk \npremiums, or requiring them to hold a larger percentage of their debt \nas long-term debt. The TARP congressional oversight panel adopted this \nposition, explaining:\n\n       We should not identify specific institutions in advance as \n     too big to fail, but rather have a regulatory framework in \n     which institutions have higher capital requirements and \n     pay more on insurance funds on a percentage basis than \n     smaller institutions which are less likely to be rescued \n     as being too systemic to fail.\n\n  I want to make clear, though, that the power this bill provides to \nthe council is not meant to restrict financial institutions from \ngrowing in size, but rather from becoming risks to the system as a \nwhole.\n  The bill also provides the council with authority to address so-\ncalled regulatory ``black holes,'' created by new and imaginative \nfinancial instruments that do not fall within the jurisdictional \nauthority of any Federal financial regulatory agency. Credit default \nswaps are a perfect example of this problem. Prior to 2000, credit \ndefault swaps existed in a regulatory limbo. Neither the SEC nor the \nCFTC were willing to exert authority over the credit default swap \nmarket. As a result, they fell through the jurisdictional cracks. \nCongress then compounded the problem by explicitly exempting credit \ndefault swaps from regulation under the Commodity Futures Modernization \nAct of 2000.\n  As was the case with AIG, serious problems can arise when a major \n``credit event'' suddenly reveals that massive claims for collateral \nposting or payment are converging on credit default swap parties who \ncannot meet their obligations. But because the market was bilateral and \nover-the-counter, it was often impossible for regulators--and even \nmarket participants--to know in advance how all the tangled webs of \ncontract commitments overlapped and affected any particular party. \nUnder the current system which lacks a systemic-risk regulator, \nregulators at times lack the authority to take action against excessive \ndebt, inadequate reserves, and other threats, even when they see them \noccurring.\n  This legislation specifically addresses the credit default swap \nproblem by repealing the exemption from regulation that Congress \ncreated for these instruments in 2000, and by setting up a government-\nregulated clearinghouse.\n  But beyond credit default swaps, risky new financial instruments \ncould still avoid the reach of our regulatory system. For that reason, \nmy legislation provides the council with the power to propose \nregulations and legislation governing the sale or marketing of any \nfinancial instrument which would fall into a ``black hole,'' and would \notherwise present a systemic risk to the financial systems of the \nUnited States if left unmonitored.\n  Professor Howell Jackson, the acting dean of Harvard Law School, \ndiscussed this ``black hole'' problem in his testimony to our committee \nearly this year. He stated that the underlying issue is that ``well-\nadvised financial services firms are capable of exploiting the \nlegalistic boundaries of jurisdictional authority that characterize our \nsystem of financial regulation. Without broad jurisdictional mandates, \nour financial regulators will remain at a serious disadvantage in \nsetting policy for new financial products and risks.''\n  Finally, my bill will merge the Office of Thrift Supervision, OTS, \ninto the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, OCC. Secretary \nPaulson recommended this merger in the plan he released last year, and \n2 years ago, John Dugan, the U.S. Comptroller, said that such a merger \nwould be ``appropriate and healthy.'' There are currently at least four \nagencies involved in bank regulation, including the FDIC, the Federal \nReserve, and the OCC and OTC. Consolidating and reducing the number of \nbanking regulators would improve the efficiency and effectiveness of \nthis system.\n  OTS is the best candidate for several reasons, including that many of \nits largest regulated entities, thrifts, have either collapsed or been \nacquired in the midst of the financial crisis--such as Washington \nMutual and Indy Mac. And in the last 4 months, the inspector general \nfor Treasury has raised serious questions about the objectivity and \neffectiveness of OTS's supervision of the largest thrifts.\n  Mr. President, the regulatory reforms in this legislation are \nabsolutely essential to restoring public confidence in our financial \nmarkets. We have relied too long on a patchwork of regulatory agencies \nthat is incapable of understanding or controlling risks to the system \nas a whole. The overarching purpose of this legislation is to ensure \nthat, as the financial-services industry becomes ever more global and \ncomplex, those in government, responsible for overseeing the system's \nstability, can see the whole picture. We are in this crisis precisely \nbecause firms, whether for good or bad, exploited legal boundaries, \nrisky financial instruments fell beyond the reach of regulators, and \ninstitutions doomed to fail grew too big to fail.\n  Honest savers, borrowers, investors, Main Street businesses, and \nresponsible financial institutions deserve a regulatory system suited \nto demands of modern times, where dangerous gaps are closed, and where \nrisky transactions are indentified and controlled before they pose a \nthreat to the markets as a whole. These reforms must be made to restore \nthe confidence necessary to stabilize our financial markets. That is \nwhat this legislation aims to do, and I urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 665. A bill to allow modified bloc voting by cooperative \nassociations of milk producers in connection with a referendum on \nFederal milk marketing order reform; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the first day of spring is appropriately \nalso National Agriculture Day and a time to recognize the important \ncontribution made by farmers, ranchers and the agriculture industry \nthat is largely responsible for putting food on the table and clothes \non our backs. Agriculture is critically important to both our Nation \nand Wisconsin. Over 22 million Americans and 420,000 Wisconsinites are \nemployed by farms or agriculture related businesses. Approximately a \nfifth of U.S. gross domestic product is linked to agriculture and \nWisconsin's farms and farm-related businesses create $51.5 billion in \neconomic activity each year.\n  Unfortunately, Agriculture Day this year comes at an unusually \nstressful time for the farm community. Even for an industry used to ups \nand downs from\n\n[[Page S3614]]\n\na variety of sources, the recent problems associated with the global \neconomic troubles are taxing farmers and agriculture in general more \nthan usual. Dairy farmers have been particularly hard hit recently, \nwith the price they receive for their milk having fallen by 50 percent \nor more since last year. While I was glad that the dairy safety net or \nMilk Income Loss Contract program was reauthorized and improved during \nthe farm bill, the dramatic drop in prices combined with relatively \nhigh input costs will mean that many dairy farmers are not coming close \nto covering their expenses even with the safety net.\n  Given these serious challenges facing dairy farmers, on January 30, \n2009, I sent a letter with Senator Kohl and 33 other Senators to U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, USDA, Secretary Tom Vilsack that calls on \nthe USDA to take a series of actions to protect the industry from \ninstability. This geographically diverse group of senators is asking \nthe USDA to more fully utilize existing programs like the Dairy Product \nPrice Support Program, DPPSP, and the Dairy Export Incentive Program, \nto reverse the outgoing administration's recent decision to halt \npurchases of value-added dairy products by the DPPSP, and to help more \nlow-income individuals, food banks and schools gain access to \nnutritious dairy products.\n  As Americans and businesses are feeling the impact of the current \neconomic troubles and sometimes falling behind on payments, farmers \nacross the country are increasingly facing the same prospect as well. \nThis is one reason I supported $193 million for Farm Service Agency \nfarm loans and loan restructuring as part of the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act, P.L. 111-5, also known as the stimulus bill--to \nensure that credit for farmers is available during these difficult \ntimes. Also along these lines, on March 5, 2009, I sent a letter with \nSenators Brown, Kohl, Gillibrand and 15 other Senators urging the Obama \nadministration to help reduce farm foreclosures related to the troubled \neconomy. The letter to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Treasury \nSecretary Tim Geithner called for additional requirements for banks and \nother financial institutions that have taken Federal bailout funds to \nwork with farmers to restructure farm loans to help keep them in their \nhomes and businesses. These conditions would mirror requirements that \nare already in place on farm loans supported by the USDA Farm Service \nAgency and the requirements being developed for home loans held by \nthese same lenders that have taken bailout funds. While I did not \nsupport the flawed bailout bill, I believe it is essential that bailout \nfunds be used as much as possible to help consumers, farmers, home-\nowners and others feeling the pain of the economic crisis we are in.\n  In addition to focusing resources to help farmers and others in \nagriculture ride out the current economic storm, it is still important \nto seek solutions to long term inequities in agriculture. I have been \nparticularly concerned about the increasing concentration in \nagriculture sectors and the potential for this market power to be used \nunduly against farmers and small independent businesses. During a \nSenate Judiciary Committee hearing on March 10, 2009, I discussed the \ngrave concerns of Wisconsin farmers about slumping dairy prices and the \nBush administration's failure to take action against anti-competitive \nbehavior in the agriculture industry. Under my questioning, Christine \nAnne Varney, the nominee to be Assistant Attorney General of the \nAntitrust Division in the Department of Justice, committed, if she is \nconfirmed, to make agriculture a priority of the Antitrust Division. \nShe indicated that she will examine questionable antitrust decisions of \nthe Bush administration and order a thorough review of slumping farm-\nlevel dairy prices, which do not appear to be reflected in retail \nprices paid by consumers.\n  Even with the troubles currently facing agriculture, farmers, and \nagriculture are resilient and entrepreneurial. I am certain that these \nindividuals and businesses will bounce back and continue to push for \nmore opportunities for farmers, agriculture and the rural communities \nthat depend on them. Wisconsin's diverse agricultural producers--from \nginseng growers to cheese makers to cranberry growers and everything in \nbetween--are rightly proud of their work and look for ways to \ndifferentiate themselves and add value whether it is through country-\nof-origin or other labeling, converting to organic production or other \nmeasures. During debate on the farm bill, I was glad to support federal \nprograms such as organic programs, Value-Added Producer Grants and the \nRural Microentrepreneur Assistance Program as ways that the federal \ngovernment can support important new opportunities for farmers to \nimprove their livelihood without drastically changing the size and \nmethods of their production.\n\n  Of more general importance to all rural residents is closing the \ndigital divide and providing affordable broadband Internet access to \nall Americans. I was glad the farm bill made improvements to the USDA \nbroadband programs and that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act \nfollowed this up with a commitment to spend $7.2 billion. On March, 9, \n2009, I cosigned a series of letters to the administrators of the \nFederal broadband programs highlighting the need to ensure that these \nfunds are targeted toward bringing broadband and the opportunities that \ncome with this connectivity to rural areas without service.\n  Finally, the first day of spring also seems like an opportune time to \nreintroduce some legislation related to agriculture. While I was able \nto include several of my proposals in the farm bill last year including \na tax provision to allow farmers to remain eligible for Social Security \nbenefits in lean years, country-of-origin labeling for ginseng, a new \nhigher profile office at USDA for small farms, and a provision similar \nto a bill I had with Senator Grassley to give farmers an option to opt \nout of mandatory binding arbitration in contracts, I have three bills \nto reintroduce: The Quality Cheese Act, The Democracy for Dairy Farmers \nAct and the Federal Milk Marketing Reform Act.\n  The import of milk protein concentrates and casein, which can \nsubstitute for domestic milk in many food products, continues to put \npressure on our farmers and can threaten the integrity of our dairy \nproducts. For example, concerns about the safety of imported dairy \nproducts such as the recent Chinese melamine adulteration have the \npotential to threaten consumer confidence even for U.S. dairy products. \nThe Quality Cheese Act will preserve the integrity of our natural \ncheeses by preventing milk protein concentrates and other imported milk \nsubstitutes from ever entering cheese vats.\n  Under the Federal Milk Marketing Order system, the deck has been \nstacked against Wisconsin's dairy farmers for some time. The legacy of \ntransportation costs being calculated for the base milk price based on \nthe distance from Eau Claire, WI, remains a problem to this day. This \nrule unfairly keeps Wisconsin's milk price disproportionately low, and \nbears no relation to the actual costs of transportation. While I hope \nthat the commission provided for by the farm bill can address this \nproblem also, my Federal Milk Market Reform Act would even the playing \nfield for Wisconsin's producers and remove this longstanding inequity.\n  If a dairy cooperative decides to vote on behalf of all of its \nmembers or ``bloc vote,'' individual members have no opportunity to \nvoice opinions separately. That seems unfair when you consider what \nsignificant issues may be at stake. The Democracy for Dairy Producers \nAct of 2007 is simple and fair. It provides that a cooperative cannot \ndeny any of its members a ballot to opt to vote separately from the \ncooperative. It also contains safeguards to make sure that farmers have \ninformation about each vote and is structured in such a way that it \nwill not slow down the process, and the implementation of any rule or \nregulation would proceed on schedule.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 668.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to clarify the \nconditions under which certain persons may be treated as adjudicated \nmentally incompetent for certain purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today to again introduce bipartisan \nlegislation that would end an arbitrary process through which our own \ngovernment takes away the 2nd Amendment rights of veterans.\n  I am pleased to be joined by three of my fellow Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee Members on this legislation--Senators Webb, Graham, and \nWicker--and 12 other members of the Senate, all as original cosponsors.\n  The legislation is nearly identical to the bill I introduced last \nCongress under the same title. Unfortunately, after it was approved as \nan amendment at a Committee markup and reported to the full Senate, no \nfurther action was taken. I am hopeful that things will be different \nthis Congress.\n  As most of my colleagues know, the Federal Gun Control Act prohibits \nthe sale of firearms to certain individuals, including convicted \nfelons, fugitives, drug users, illegal aliens, and individuals who have \nbeen ``adjudicated as a mental defective.''\n  The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act requires the government to \nmaintain a database on these individuals called the National Instant \nCriminal Background Check System, or ``NICS''. The Brady Law and the \nNICS database aim to prevent those who may pose a danger to society or \nthemselves from purchasing a firearm.\n  Gun shop owners reference the NICS to screen customers. Needless to \nsay, it is a serious matter to have one's name on the NICS. Every \nAmerican should expect a rigorous and fair process before their right \nto bear arms is taken away.\n  Unfortunately, when it comes to certain veterans, spouses, dependent \nchildren, and dependent parents, the process is neither rigorous nor \nfair.\n  Since 1999, VA has sent the names of 116,000 of its beneficiaries to \nthe FBI for inclusion on the NICS.\n  None of these names were sent to the FBI because they were determined \nto be a danger to themselves or others. They were listed in NICS \nbecause they could not manage their financial affairs. We should not \ntake away a Constitutional right because someone can't balance a \ncheckbook or pay their bills on time.\n  VA's review process for assigning a fiduciary is meant to determine \none's financial responsibility in managing VA-provided cash assistance \nsuch as disability compensation, pension, and other benefits.\n  For example, a veteran may be assigned a fiduciary if they have \ncredit problems.\n  VA focuses on whether or not benefits paid by VA will be spent in the \nmanner for which they were intended. Nothing involved with VA's \nappointment of a fiduciary even gets at the question of whether an \nindividual is a danger to themselves or others, or whether the person \nshould own a firearm.\n  Yet that is exactly what happens if VA appoints a fiduciary. Over \n116,000 individuals have been listed in NICS since 1999 because they \nwere appointed a fiduciary.\n  Again, this includes veterans, surviving spouses and, strangely \nenough, dependent children. That's right, a child entitled to receive \nsurvivor's compensation because their mother or father died as a result \nof service has their name sent to a government database filled with \ncriminals. Even worse, the child's name stays on this list permanently \nunless he or she petitions to have it taken off.\n  This makes no sense. States have age restrictions preventing kids \nfrom purchasing firearms. VA sending the names of innocent children to \nGovernment database of criminals just because their parent died as a \nresult of service to their country simply makes no sense, and it is \ndownright insulting.\n\n[[Page S3617]]\n\n  This process is not only arbitrary, it is unfair. Taking away a \nConstitutional right is a serious action and veterans should be \nafforded due process under the law. At the very least we should expect \nsuch decisions to be made by a competent judicial authority and not by \ncivilian government employees.\n  The current process is also a double standard. Only VA beneficiaries \nfall under these guidelines. The Social Security Administration assigns \nfiduciaries to help beneficiaries, yet it does not send their names to \nthe NICS.\n  Why are we singling out those who fought for this country and those \nwho sacrificed while their spouse or parent served?\n  My legislation would end this arbitrary and unfair practice that \nstrips the finest men and women of this country of their right to bear \narms. This legislation would require a judicial authority to determine \nthat an individual is a danger to themselves or others before their 2nd \nAmendment rights are taken away.\n  I am not here to ask that we put guns in the hands of dangerous \npeople. I am here to ask that we treat our veterans fairly and that we \ntake their rights seriously. Many of our veterans' organizations and \nother groups agree.\n  The Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act has the support of the The \nAmerican Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, \nAMVETS, the Military Order of the Purple Heart, the National Alliance \non Mental Illness, the National Rifle Association, and Gun Owners of \nAmerica.\n  No matter where my colleagues fall on the gun issue, I hope we can \nall agree that we need a process that is consistent and fair. Our \nveterans took an oath to uphold the Constitution. They deserve to enjoy \nthe rights they fought so hard to protect.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 669\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 81\n\n       Whereas the United Nations General Assembly, by resolution, \n     has designated March 22 of each year as ``World Water Day'';\n       Whereas a person needs 4 to 5 liters of water per day to \n     survive;\n       Whereas a person can live weeks without food, but only days \n     without water;\n       Whereas every 15 seconds a child dies from a water-borne \n     disease;\n       Whereas, for children under age 5, water-borne diseases are \n     the leading cause of death;\n       Whereas millions of women and children already spend \n     several hours a day collecting water from distant, often \n     polluted sources;\n       Whereas every dollar spent on water and sanitation saves an \n     average of $9 in costs averted and productivity gained;\n       Whereas, at any given time, \\1/2\\ of the hospital beds in \n     the world are occupied by patients suffering from a water-\n     borne disease;\n       Whereas 88 percent of all diseases are caused by unsafe \n     drinking water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene;\n       Whereas 1,100,000,000 (1 in 6) people lack access to an \n     improved water supply;\n       Whereas 2,600,000,000 people in the world lack access to \n     improved sanitation;\n       Whereas the 263 transboundary lake and river basins in the \n     world are part of the territory of 145 countries and cover \n     nearly \\1/2\\ of the land surface of the Earth;\n       Whereas climate change may cause more extreme floods and \n     droughts, increasing political tension and the potential for \n     clashes over transboundary fresh water resources;\n       Whereas the global celebration of World Water Day is an \n     initiative that grew out of the 1992 United Nations \n     Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro;\n       Whereas the participants in the 2002 World Summit on \n     Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, including the United \n     States, agreed to the Plan of Implementation which included \n     an agreement to work to reduce by \\1/2\\ from the baseline \n     year 1990 ``the proportion of people who are unable to reach \n     or to afford safe drinking water'', ``and the proportion of \n     people without access to basic sanitation'' by 2015; and\n       Whereas Congress passed and the President signed into law \n     the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005 (Public \n     Law 109-121), which was intended to ``elevate the role of \n     water and sanitation policy in the development of U.S. \n     foreign policy and improve the effectiveness of U.S. official \n     programs'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of World Water Day;\n       (2) urges an increased effort and the investment of greater \n     resources by the Department of State, the United States \n     Agency for International Development, and all relevant \n     Federal departments and agencies toward providing sustainable \n     and equitable access to safe drinking water and sanitation \n     for the poor and the very poor; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the week of World Water Day with appropriate activities that \n     promote awareness of the importance of--\n       (A) access to clean water; and\n       (B) cooperation between stakeholders in transboundary water \n     management.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nsupporting the ideals and goals of World Water Day. I am pleased to \nhave my colleague Senator John Kerry joining me as the cosponsor of \nthis resolution.\n  March 22 was established as World Water Day by the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly to promote awareness of the importance of access to \nclean water and improved sanitation. More than one billion people lack \naccess to an improved water supply and 2.6 billion people lack access \nto improved sanitation.\n  This year's theme, ``Shared Water--Shared Opportunities,'' highlights \nopportunities to build trust among countries as they manage their \ncommon water resources in ways that promote sustainable economic \ngrowth. In the U.S. half of the States border shared waters, and there \nare growing pressures on the environmental quality and use of these \nwaters.\n  To recognize World Water Day, activities are planned internationally \nand here in the U.S. Many cities are sponsoring World Water Day benefit \nwalks, runs and musical celebrations. I urge citizens to participate in \nthese activities and recognize this important day.\n  In 2000, the United Nations adopted a goal to reduce by half the \nproportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water \nand basic sanitation by 2015. We have made some progress toward that \ngoal, but more needs to be done. Each day millions of women and girls \nstill spend hours traveling miles to transport water to their homes. In \nmany cases, the source is polluted, leading to disease for them and \nother members of their families.\n  The Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005 provided for \nU.S. assistance in developing countries to provide equal and affordable \naccess to clean and safe water and sanitation. This access is important \nto U.S. foreign policy interests, and, more important, is a basic human \nright.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/23/senate-section/article/S3617-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3617-S3618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 82--RECOGNIZING THE 188TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n  INDEPENDENCE OF GREECE AND CELEBRATING GREEK AND AMERICAN DEMOCRACY\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \nCasey, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Cardin, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Bingaman, Mr.\n\n[[Page S3618]]\n\nWhitehouse, Mr. Reed, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Begich, Mr. \nMartinez, Mr. Levin, Mr. Chambliss, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \nFeingold, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Gregg, \nMr. Bennett, Mr. Carper, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Kohl, Mr. \nRisch, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Isakson, Mrs. Murray, Ms. \nMurkowski, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Nelson of Florida, and Mr. \nJohnson) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                               S. Res. 82\n\n       Whereas the ancient Greeks developed the concept of \n     democracy, in which the supreme power to govern was vested in \n     the people;\n       Whereas the Founding Fathers of the United States, many of \n     whom read Greek political philosophy in the original Greek, \n     drew heavily on the political experience and philosophy of \n     ancient Greece in forming our representative democracy;\n       Whereas Greek Commander in Chief Petros Mavromichalis, a \n     founder of the modern Greek state, said to the citizens of \n     the United States in 1821 that ``it is in your land that \n     liberty has fixed her abode and . . . in imitating you, we \n     shall imitate our ancestors and be thought worthy of them if \n     we succeed in resembling you'';\n       Whereas the Greek national anthem, the ``Hymn to Liberty'', \n     includes the words, ``Most heartily was gladdened George \n     Washington's brave land'';\n       Whereas the people of the United States generously offered \n     humanitarian assistance to the Greek people during their \n     struggle for independence;\n       Whereas Greece played a major role in the World War II \n     struggle to protect freedom and democracy through such \n     bravery as was shown in the historic Battle of Crete, which \n     provided the Axis land war with its first major setback, \n     setting off a chain of events that significantly affected the \n     outcome of World War II;\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of Greek civilians were \n     killed in Greece during World War II in defense of the values \n     of the Allies;\n       Whereas, throughout the 20th century, Greece was one of a \n     few countries that allied with the United States in every \n     major international conflict;\n       Whereas Greece is a strategic partner and ally of the \n     United States in bringing political stability and economic \n     development to the volatile Balkan region, having invested \n     more than $20,000,000,000 in the countries of the region, \n     thereby helping to create more than 200,000 new jobs, and \n     having contributed more than $750,000,000 in development aid \n     for the region;\n       Whereas Greece actively participates in peacekeeping and \n     peace-building operations conducted by international \n     organizations including the United Nations, the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization, the European Union, and the \n     Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe;\n       Whereas Greece received worldwide praise for its \n     extraordinary handling during the 2004 Olympic Games of more \n     than 14,000 athletes and more than 2,000,000 spectators and \n     journalists, a feat Greece handled efficiently, securely, and \n     with hospitality;\n       Whereas Greece, located in a region where Christianity \n     meets Islam and Judaism, maintains excellent relations with \n     Muslim nations and Israel;\n       Whereas the Government of Greece has taken important steps \n     in recent years in furthering cross-cultural understanding \n     and rapprochement with Turkey, as seen with the January 2008 \n     visit to Turkey by the Prime Minister of Greece, Kostas \n     Karamanlis, the first official visit by a Greek Prime \n     Minister in 49 years;\n       Whereas Greece and the United States are at the forefront \n     of the effort for freedom, democracy, peace, stability, and \n     human rights;\n       Whereas those and similar ideals have forged a close bond \n     between Greece and the United States;

Res. 82\n\n       Whereas the ancient Greeks developed the concept of \n     democracy, in which the supreme power to govern was vested in \n     the people;\n       Whereas the Founding Fathers of the United States, many of \n     whom read Greek political philosophy in the original Greek, \n     drew heavily on the political experience and philosophy of \n     ancient Greece in forming our representative democracy;\n       Whereas Greek Commander in Chief Petros Mavromichalis, a \n     founder of the modern Greek state, said to the citizens of \n     the United States in 1821 that ``it is in your land that \n     liberty has fixed her abode and . . . in imitating you, we \n     shall imitate our ancestors and be thought worthy of them if \n     we succeed in resembling you'';\n       Whereas the Greek national anthem, the ``Hymn to Liberty'', \n     includes the words, ``Most heartily was gladdened George \n     Washington's brave land'';\n       Whereas the people of the United States generously offered \n     humanitarian assistance to the Greek people during their \n     struggle for independence;\n       Whereas Greece played a major role in the World War II \n     struggle to protect freedom and democracy through such \n     bravery as was shown in the historic Battle of Crete, which \n     provided the Axis land war with its first major setback, \n     setting off a chain of events that significantly affected the \n     outcome of World War II;\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of Greek civilians were \n     killed in Greece during World War II in defense of the values \n     of the Allies;\n       Whereas, throughout the 20th century, Greece was one of a \n     few countries that allied with the United States in every \n     major international conflict;\n       Whereas Greece is a strategic partner and ally of the \n     United States in bringing political stability and economic \n     development to the volatile Balkan region, having invested \n     more than $20,000,000,000 in the countries of the region, \n     thereby helping to create more than 200,000 new jobs, and \n     having contributed more than $750,000,000 in development aid \n     for the region;\n       Whereas Greece actively participates in peacekeeping and \n     peace-building operations conducted by international \n     organizations including the United Nations, the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization, the European Union, and the \n     Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe;\n       Whereas Greece received worldwide praise for its \n     extraordinary handling during the 2004 Olympic Games of more \n     than 14,000 athletes and more than 2,000,000 spectators and \n     journalists, a feat Greece handled efficiently, securely, and \n     with hospitality;\n       Whereas Greece, located in a region where Christianity \n     meets Islam and Judaism, maintains excellent relations with \n     Muslim nations and Israel;\n       Whereas the Government of Greece has taken important steps \n     in recent years in furthering cross-cultural understanding \n     and rapprochement with Turkey, as seen with the January 2008 \n     visit to Turkey by the Prime Minister of Greece, Kostas \n     Karamanlis, the first official visit by a Greek Prime \n     Minister in 49 years;\n       Whereas Greece and the United States are at the forefront \n     of the effort for freedom, democracy, peace, stability, and \n     human rights;\n       Whereas those and similar ideals have forged a close bond \n     between Greece and the United States; and\n       Whereas it is proper and desirable for the United States to \n     celebrate March 25, 2009, Greek Independence Day, with the \n     Greek people and to reaffirm the democratic principles from \n     which these two great nations were born: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) extends warm congratulations and best wishes to the \n     people of Greece as they celebrate the 188th anniversary of \n     the independence of Greece;\n       (2) expresses support for the principles of democratic \n     governance to which the people of Greece are committed; and\n       (3) notes the important role that Greece has played in the \n     wider European region and in the community of nations since \n     gaining its independence 188 years ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/23/senate-section/article/S3619-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENTS\n\n  The PRESIDEING OFFICER.
