Res. 38\n\n       Whereas President Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, \n     1809, to modest means, in a 1-room log cabin in Kentucky;\n       Whereas Abraham Lincoln spent his childhood in Indiana, \n     and, despite having less than a year of formal schooling, \n     developed an avid love of reading and learning;\n       Whereas Abraham Lincoln arrived in Illinois at the age of \n     21;\n       Whereas, while living in Illinois, Abraham Lincoln met and \n     married his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, built a successful legal \n     practice, served in the State legislature of Illinois, was \n     elected to Congress, and participated in the famous \n     ``Lincoln-Douglas'' debates;\n\n[[Page S2170]]\n\n       Whereas Abraham Lincoln left Illinois 4 months after being \n     elected President of the United States in 1860;\n       Whereas Abraham Lincoln was the first member of the \n     Republican party elected President of the United States and \n     helped build the Republican party into a strong national \n     organization;\n       Whereas, after his election and the secession of the \n     southern States, Abraham Lincoln steered the United States \n     through the most profound moral and political crisis, and the \n     bloodiest war, in the history of the Nation;\n       Whereas, by helping to preserve the Union and by holding a \n     national election, as scheduled, during a civil war, Abraham \n     Lincoln reaffirmed the commitment of the people of the United \n     States to majority rule and democracy;\n       Whereas the Emancipation Proclamation signed by Abraham \n     Lincoln declared that slaves within the Confederacy would be \n     forever free and welcomed more than 200,000 African American \n     soldiers and sailors into the armed forces of the Union;\n       Whereas the Emancipation Proclamation signed by Abraham \n     Lincoln fundamentally transformed the Civil War from a battle \n     for political unity to a moral fight for freedom;\n       Whereas the faith Abraham Lincoln had in democracy was \n     strong, even after the bloodiest battle of the war at \n     Gettysburg;\n       Whereas the inspiring words spoken by Abraham Lincoln at \n     Gettysburg still resonate today: ``that these dead shall not \n     have died in vain; that this nation, under God, shall have a \n     new birth of freedom; and that government of the people, by \n     the people, for the people, shall not perish from the \n     earth'';\n       Whereas Abraham Lincoln was powerfully committed to unity, \n     turning rivals into allies within his own Cabinet and \n     welcoming the defeated Confederacy back into the Union with \n     characteristic generosity, ``with malice toward none; with \n     charity for all'';\n       Whereas Abraham Lincoln became the first President of the \n     United States to be assassinated, days after giving a speech \n     promoting voting rights for African Americans;\n       Whereas, through his opposition to slavery, Abraham Lincoln \n     set the United States on a path toward resolving the tension \n     between the ideals of ``liberty and justice for all'' \n     espoused by the Founders of the United States and the ignoble \n     practice of slavery, and redefined what it meant to be a \n     citizen of the United States;\n       Whereas, in his commitment to unity, Abraham Lincoln did \n     more than simply abolish slavery; he ensured that the promise \n     that ``all men are created equal'' was an inheritance to be \n     shared by all people of the United States;\n       Whereas the story of Abraham Lincoln and the example of his \n     life, including his inspiring rise from humble origins to the \n     highest office of the land and his decisive leadership \n     through the most harrowing time in the history of the United \n     States, continues to bring hope and inspiration to millions \n     in the United States and around the world, making him one of \n     the greatest Presidents and humanitarians in history; and\n       Whereas February 12, 2009, marks the bicentennial of the \n     birth of Abraham Lincoln: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates the bicentennial of the birth of President \n     Abraham Lincoln;\n       (2) recognizes and echoes the commitment of Abraham Lincoln \n     to what he called the ``unfinished work'' of unity and \n     harmony in the United States; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to recommit \n     to fulfilling the vision of Abraham Lincoln of equal rights \n     for all.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, we have not seen all the details of the \ndeal between House and Senate Democrats, but some of the early reports \nsuggest this bill has only gotten worse. The President has asked for 40 \npercent in tax cuts; this bill falls short of that. But Congressional \nDemocrats did make sure it contains billions in questionable, \nnonstimulative projects and the most highly touted tax cut in the \noriginal proposal now translates to $7.70 a week for middle-class \nworkers.\n  This bill was meant to be a stimulus that was timely, targeted, and \ntemporary. Unfortunately, it appears to be none of the above. Democrats \nin Congress have said this plan will help ensure long-term economic \ngrowth. Yet the CBO suggests that over the long term, this bill will \nresult in an economy that either declines or remains flat. The only \nthing we know for sure about this bill is it will lead to more debt for \nour children--and that is just the beginning. This week, Congressional \nDemocrats are handing the taxpayers a bill for $1.2 trillion. Soon they \nwill spend $400 billion to finish spending from last year. We are being \ntold to get ready for untold hundreds of billions for the financial \nindustry.\n  Since taking over Congress and the White House, Democrats have been \nmaking up for lost time with a Government spending spree on the \ntaxpayers' credit card. Even without this massive spending bill, the \ndeficit continues to grow. Yesterday, Treasury reported that the first \n4 months of the fiscal year, the deficit rose to $569 billion. That is \nnearly $500 billion more than the same period last year.\n  Let me repeat that. According to Treasury, we ran a deficit in the \nfirst quarter of this fiscal year that is nearly $500 billion more than \nthe same period last year. You do not have to be Suze Orman to know \nthis is not sustainable.\n  I know everyone involved believes their efforts will help strengthen \nthe economy and create jobs. No one should doubt that everyone is \ntrying to do the right thing. My concern is not with the motivation \nbehind these efforts but the wisdom of these efforts. Everyone wants to \nhelp Americans get back on their feet, but we need to do it smartly. In \nmy view and in the view of my Republican colleagues, this is not a \nsmart approach. The taxpayers of today and tomorrow will be left to \nclean up the mess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/12/senate-section/article/S2170-3", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LINCOLN BICENTENNIAL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the NAACP \non this, its 100th anniversary.\n  One hundred years ago, 60 men and women answered a call to promote \nsocial equality in this country. This effort brought together a diverse \ngroup of prominent Americans, including Kentucky native William English \nWalling, who signed a manifesto forming the NAACP. They chose February \n12 as their founding date to honor the birth of Abraham Lincoln.\n  Since then, the NAACP has recognized the contributions of Americans \nwho have made strides in eliminating prejudice.\n  This year, the NAACP will honor Kentucky native Muhammad Ali for a \nlifetime of contributions. When I was growing up in Louisville, I went \nto DuPont Manual High School. A young man who was then named Cassius \nClay was in the same grade at Central High School. He was the most well \nknown teenager in town by far. We all knew him as the local Golden \nGloves champ.\n  His spirit of hard work and efforts to improve his community are \nbeing rightly honored by the NAACP this year, and Kentucky is proud \nthat one of its own is being honored this week.\n  So to all at the NAACP, congratulations on this centennial. It is an \nopportunity to reflect on the efforts and accomplishments of those who \nworked so hard over the past century to advance your founding goals.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, before I make some remarks about the \nbicentennial of Abraham Lincoln's birth, I wish to respond to the \nRepublican leader's comments about the ongoing negotiations that have \nbeen inspired by\n\n[[Page S2171]]\n\nPresident Obama's request that we pass a stimulus package, a spending \nbill and tax cut package that will reinvigorate this economy and try to \nstop the loss of jobs in America.\n  It is troubling to hear the frequent criticism from the Republican \nside that this is going to add to our deficit. No one doubts that. We \nare talking about the need to spend money immediately to stop the \ndownward spiral of our economy. It will surely add to the deficit. But \ndoing nothing, taking the approach that has been espoused by many on \nthe other side of the aisle, will lead to even greater deficits and \nmore suffering.\n  What we are trying to do is to step in with this tourniquet and try \nto stop the bleeding in this economy so we can turn it around for the \nfamilies and businesses that are suffering today.\n  It troubles me, as I hear the Republican leader come and tell us of \ntheir concerns about deficits. I think, frankly, the air in the Senate \nChamber leads to political amnesia, because many of the critics of our \ncurrent efforts have forgotten that when President Bush came to office \n8 years ago, he inherited a surplus from the Clinton administration--a \nsurplus. We were giving longevity to the Social Security Program \nbecause we had a surplus in the Treasury. What happened to that \nsurplus? I will tell you what happened. President Bush, George W. Bush, \ninherited the debt of the United States, the accumulated debt of every \nPresident from George Washington to George W. Bush, which was $5 \ntrillion.\n  At the end of his 8 years we had more than doubled the national debt \nof America. His decisions to double that debt by a war he did not pay \nfor and tax cuts for wealthy people at a time when we should not have \nhad tax cuts were endorsed by that side of the aisle. They stood in \napproval of President Bush's policies that doubled the national debt \nfrom $5 trillion to $10 trillion.\n  President Obama, 3 weeks ago, inherited the worst economic crisis \nsince Franklin Roosevelt came to office in 1933 with the Great \nDepression. He is doing everything in his power to turn this around and \nhe knows we need to spend money into this economy to create and save 3 \nto 4 million jobs. The criticism from the other side of the aisle is it \nis going to add to the national debt. Where have these tears been for \nthe last 8 years when their President doubled the national debt?\n  I am also troubled by the fact that when this package came before the \nCongress, many Republican Senators who refused to vote for it added \ncosts to the package. A Senator from Iowa in the Finance Committee \nadded an amendment that cost $70 billion to the package and then said \nhe couldn't vote for the package because it costs too much. A Senator \nfrom Georgia added anywhere from $11 to $30 billion, depending on the \nbest estimate, to the cost of the package and then said he couldn't \nvote for the package because it costs too much.\n  I have to tell you, I do not believe that the message from the other \nside of the aisle is consistent.\n  Three Republican Senators have had the courage to step up and say we \nwill work with you, we will come together and try to solve this \nproblem. I salute them--Senators Snowe and Collins of Maine and Senator \nSpecter of Pennsylvania. But, they said, if you are going to do that we \nwant to reduce the cost of the package.\n  I did not happen to agree with that approach, but I am prepared to \ncompromise. I am prepared to work with them. It took $100 billion out \nof this package, this recovery and reinvestment package. Frankly, I do \nnot, as I said, agree with that--at a time we had to basically come \ntogether if we were going to have any agreement.\n  Now the Senate Republican leader comes to the floor and criticizes \nthe cuts in the package. Why did the amount of tax cuts for families go \nfrom $500 to $400? It was because the Republican Senators said we want \nto bring down the cost and that was one of the ways we did it. I can't \nfollow the logic, if there is any, on the other side of the aisle--\ncriticizing adding to the deficit after they doubled it over the last 8 \nyears, then criticizing cuts in the package, reducing its spending when \nin fact they say it costs too much, and offering amendments on that \nside of the aisle to add cost to the package and then arguing that it \nis too expensive. It is completely inconsistent. Their arguments are \ncompletely inconsistent and I think the American people know it.\n  They want Congress to come together and find solutions. They want \npartnership, not partisanship. They want us to stop squabbling and \nstart working together. That is what we are trying to do, even today. \nIt is hard. It is difficult. We are trying to find the votes to make \nthis happen. It is essential that we do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/12/senate-section/article/S2171-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2171-S2172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREADING THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS ON THE BICENTENNIAL OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S \n                                 BIRTH\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today marks the bicentennial of the birth \nof America's greatest President, Abraham Lincoln. This morning, as part \nof the nationwide celebration of this historic anniversary, the Abraham \nLincoln Presidential Library and Museum in my hometown of Springfield, \nIL, is sponsoring a simultaneous reading of the Gettysburg Address by \nschoolchildren from coast to coast. I remember as a schoolchild \nmemorizing the Gettysburg Address. I am happy to see that a new \ngeneration of American children is studying what many consider to be \nthe greatest speech in our Nation's history.\n  But we can all learn from Lincoln. We are never too old. So this \nmorning we in the Senate will also listen to the speech that many \nconsider the greatest summation in our Nation's history of the meaning \nand price of freedom.\n  After that, some of us will take the floor and share our thoughts on \nPresident Lincoln's immortal words and his powerful and enduring \nlegacy.\n  These are the words President Abraham Lincoln spoke on the blood-\ndrenched battlefield in Gettysburg, PA, on November 19, 1863:\n\n       Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, \n     on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and \n     dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\n       Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether \n     that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can \n     long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. \n     We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final \n     resting place for those who here gave their lives that that \n     nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that \n     we should do this.\n       But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate--we cannot \n     consecrate--we cannot hallow--this ground. The brave men, \n     living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far \n     above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little \n     note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never \n     forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, \n     to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who \n     fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for \n     us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before \n     us--that from these honored dead we take increased devotion \n     to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of \n     devotion--that we here highly resolve that these dead shall \n     not have died in vain--that this nation, under God, shall \n     have a new birth of freedom--and that government of the \n     people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from \n     the earth.\n\n  The Battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania was the largest battle ever \nfought on American soil. In the third summer of the Civil War, the Army \nof the Potomac met the Army of Northern Virginia at a crossroads near \nthe small market town of Gettysburg, PA. For 3 brutal days, from July 1 \nto July 3, more than 160,000 American solders clashed in what would \nprove to be a decisive Union victory and a turning point in the war.\n  When the cannons and guns fell silent on July 4, our Nation's \nbirthday, more than 51,000 Confederate and Union soldiers were wounded, \nmissing, or dead. And 4\\1/2\\ months later, when President Lincoln \ntraveled to Gettysburg to help dedicate America's first national \ncemetery, the battlefield was still covered with scars and signs of the \ncarnage.\n  One soldier recalled, `` . . . all about were traces of the fierce \nconflict. Rifle pits, cut and scarred trees, broken fences, pieces of \nartillery wagons and harness, scraps of blue and gray clothing, bent \ncanteens . . . ''\n  President Lincoln was not supposed to be the main speaker at this \ndedication. In fact, there was a 2-hour speech given by Edward Everett, \nwho was considered one of the great orators of his day. Abraham \nLincoln's remarks took 2 minutes. They were so brief that when he \nfinished, many in the crowd of\n\n[[Page S2172]]\n\n30,000 were not even sure he had spoken. Yet his words continue to \ninspire the world and the Nation today. In 272 words is what it took \nfor President Lincoln to explain to a war-weary nation why it must \ncontinue to fight. He called on the Nation to look up from the \ndevastation and division of the war to a higher purpose. He redefined \nthe meaning and the value of the continuing struggle: ``that these dead \nshall not have died in vain; that this nation shall have a new birth of \nfreedom.''\n  He said that the ceremony at Gettysburg was more than the \nconsecration of a cemetery; it represented an opportunity and an \nobligation for us, the living, to finish the work of those who had \nfallen there, to ensure that ``this government of the people, by the \npeople, and for the people shall not perish from the earth.''\n  It may have been the greatest speech in American history. Yet, after \nPresident Lincoln delivered it, there was only polite applause. On his \ntrip back to Washington, Lincoln expressed disappointment. He said of \nhis address, ``It was a flat failure. I am distressed about it. I ought \nto have prepared it with more care.''\n  The Chicago Times was even less charitable. They editorialized and \nsaid:\n\n       The cheek of every American must tingle with shame as he \n     reads the silly, flat and dishwatery utterances of the \n     president.\n\n  Edward Everett, the famed orator and former Governor of Massachusetts \nwho had been the main speaker at Gettysburg, was one of the first to \nrecognize the greatness of Lincoln's words. Within days, he wrote to \nthe President, ``I should be glad if I could flatter myself that I came \nas near to the central idea of the occasion, in two hours, as you did \nin two minutes.''\n  In June 1865, in his eulogy to the fallen President, the fiery \nabolitionist Senator Charles Sumner called the Gettysburg Address ``a \nmonumental act.'' He said President Lincoln had been mistaken when he \npredicted that ``the world will little note, nor long remember what we \nsay here.'' The truth, Senator Sumner said, is that ``[t]he world noted \nat once what he said, and will never cease to remember it. The battle \nitself was less important than the speech.''\n  President Lincoln did not live to see his legacy: a United States of \nAmerica that has endured, a nation so far removed from the hated \ninstitution of legalized human slavery that today President Lincoln's \nold office in the White House is occupied by our first African-American \nPresident.\n  As we commemorate today the 200th birthday of the man whose \nleadership saved our Union, saved our Nation and created a new birth of \nfreedom, let us pledge that we too will dedicate ourselves to \npreserving his legacy and continuing the still-unfinished work for \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/12/senate-section/article/S2172-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMMENDING THE GUEST CHAPLAIN\n\n  Mr. WEBB.

Mr. President, I wish to state my strong support of the \neconomic recovery plan because the American people and their \ncommunities need it to create jobs, to stabilize the economy, and to \nprotect those who have been most hurt by the current global economic \nand financial crises.\n  Many Americans, especially my fellow Vermonters who have watched this \nprocess, look at the resistance the economic recovery plan has met from \nmany on the other side of the aisle, and they are somewhat dispirited. \nThey remember how readily Congress rubberstamped hundreds of billions \nof dollars the previous administration earmarked for Iraq. Now they see \nhow difficult it has been to get bipartisan approval for investments \nhere at home that are desperately needed to jump start an economy that \nis in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the Great \nDepression.\n  I call on fellow Senators--who were willing and eager to vote for \nbillions of dollars to rebuild the infrastructure of Iraq, who were \nwilling to vote for billions of dollars to create jobs in Iraq, who \nwere willing to vote for billions of dollars to help law enforcement in \nIraq--to focus on the needs we have here at home. Let's spend some of \nthat money in America to repair our infrastructure, to create jobs in \nAmerica, and to help law enforcement in America.\n  No one disputes the clear fact that we are confronting the most \nsevere economic problem we have had in generations. The U.S. economy \nhas been in recession since December 2007. America's GDP declined 3.8 \npercent in the fourth quarter of 2008, the steepest drop since 1982. \nThe United States lost 2.6 million jobs last year, the most since 1945. \nLast week we learned the U.S. economy shed almost 600,000 jobs in \nJanuary, putting the unemployment rate at 7.6 percent.\n  In Vermont, not only has the amount of credit available to small \nbusinesses shrunk significantly, but our unemployment rate jumped to \n6.4 percent in December. That is the highest it has been in 15 years. \nVermont is not alone in this struggle. Workers, businesses, State and \nlocal governments all across the country face mounting debt, slumping \norders, and sagging budgets.\n  To respond to this extraordinary crisis, I agree with President Obama \nand the vast majority of Americans that we have to act quickly and \nresponsibly to pass an economic recovery and job creation plan as bold \nas the challenges we face. Americans want jobs. They want to work. They \nwant to support their families. We have to help create those jobs. If \nwe act now to strengthen our economy and invest in America's future, we \ncan create good-paying jobs, we can cut taxes for working families, and \nwe can make responsible investments in our future.\n  Our first priority should be to put America back to work. This \neconomic recovery plan will help create or save over three million \njobs, including an entire generation of green jobs that will make \npublic and private investments in renewable energy and make America \nmore energy efficient.\n  Investing in our country's infrastructure and education will do more \nthan create jobs today--it can put us on a long-term path toward \nprosperity. Rebuilding our roads and bridges, expanding broadband \naccess to rural communities; making our energy grid smart\n\n[[Page S2173]]\n\nand more efficient; creating state-of-the-art classrooms and labs and \nlibraries; and investing in job training that Americans will need to \nsucceed in the 21st century global economy will give us tangible assets \nwe can use for years to come to foster additional economic growth.\n  As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I would like to \nhighlight that the funding for State and local law enforcement in this \nrecovery package will not only help to address vital crime prevention \nneeds, but it will have an immediate and positive impact on the \neconomy, as police chiefs and experts from across the country told the \nJudiciary Committee in its first hearing this year. Hiring new police \nofficers will stimulate the economy and lead to safer communities and \nneighborhoods.\n  Nobody thinks this bill is perfect. We could write 100 different \nperfect bills based on our own analysis. But America is hurting, and \nAmericans urgently need our help. I believe this economic recovery \npackage will make a timely and constructive difference across the \ncountry by creating and saving jobs, making needed infrastructure \ninvestments, reducing the tax burden on struggling families, and \nrelieving the strain on State budget deficits.\n  Vermonters are watching and waiting. Working families across the \ncountry are watching and waiting. Time is running out. I will vote aye.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/12/senate-section/article/S2173-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2173-S2175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MILLARD FULLER\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to pay tribute \nto a great American who we lost earlier this month.\n  Millard Fuller, the founder and former president of Habitat for \nHumanity, was a personal friend to me and many Members of Congress. \nMany of us worked closely with Millard Fuller, particularly in the last \n15 years of his extraordinary leadership.\n  I wish to take a minute today to pay tribute to Millard and his \nfamily--his wife Linda, his son Christopher, his daughters Kim, Faith \nand Georgia and his nine grandchildren. He has left behind these loved \nones who will carry on his important work. Linda was a cofounder of \nHabitat for Humanity, and a driving force in the creation of this \norganization that has touched the lives of literally millions of people \naround the world.\n  When I think of where Millard Fuller died unexpectedly earlier this \nmonth, near the small town of Americus, GA, I cannot help but be \nreminded of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, one of the most \ninspiring documents ever written. This declaration reminds us that when \nwe speak about human rights, we must remember that the recognition of \nthese rights begins in small places close to home, places so small that \nthey can't necessarily be seen on maps. It is in these small places \nthat people long for dignity and respect.\n\n  Sometimes in the Senate, we get carried away with grand visions of \nuniversal rights and broad, sweeping policies to protect these rights. \nBut when you get right down to it, our visions are carried out in our \nown neighborhoods, in our own courthouses and in very small places like \nAmericus, GA.\n  By the age of 29, Millard Fuller had made his first million dollars. \nHe was a man with a great mind and extraordinary leadership abilities, \nwho could have made a great fortune for his wife, his children and \nhimself. But instead, with his wife's urging, Millard Fuller and Linda \ndecided to take the multiple talents God had given them and refocus \ntheir lives on Christian service. They set their hearts on making a \ndifference in the world, and the result was an organization that is one \nof the greatest nonprofits I have come to know.\n  In 1968, Millard Fuller and Linda began a Christian ministry on a \nfarm in southwest Georgia where they built decent housing for low-\nincome families using volunteer labor and donations. This concept was \nexpanded into what is now Habitat for Humanity International and the \nFuller Center for Housing. By 1981, Habitat had affiliates in 14 \nStates, and was carrying out its mission to build homes with volunteer \nlabor, ensuring that these homes were affordable to the poor and those \nof modest means.\n  Many Senators have commented privately and publicly about his \nextraordinary organization, and President Carter once remarked that \nMillard Fuller was one of the greatest talents he had ever known--\nserious words coming from a President. President Carter was a personal \nfriend of Millard Fuller, and in 1984, he became a Habitat volunteer, \ngiving his name and resources to Millard Fuller's organization. \nPresident and Mrs. Carter became the faces of Habitat for Humanity, and \nwould attract thousands of people to volunteer during the Jimmy Carter \nWork Project, an annual week-long effort to build Habitat homes all \nover the world. By 1992, Habitat had a presence in 92 nations.\n  I was very fortunate to have met Millard Fuller. He was an \ninspiration to me and, as I have said, to many Senators. Many of us \ncome into our young adulthood and say we want to make a difference in \nthe world, and we all try in our various ways. Many of us never quite \naccomplish that. But Millard Fuller did. He had an impact on the world, \nand the world will remember his life and his vision. The world will \nremember that in this great land of wealth and opportunity, Millard \nFuller thought it was shameful that people were living without decency \nand respect.\n  He said it is not what Jesus would want. It is not what the Bible \nteaches. It is not what those of the Christian faith believe. He built \nHabitat on a simple principle that the poor are not lazy, but very \nindustrious--that if the poor were given a chance, they could \naccomplish a great deal.\n  In order to occupy a Habitat house, the family who is going to live \nthere gets to build the home with their neighbors, with the kind of \nold-fashioned, rock-ribbed community values of pitching in, building a \nhome, and building upon that solid foundation.\n  Not only was it Millard Fuller's vision to give families a decent \nplace to live, he wanted to give them something to own. Owning a home \npaves the way for being able to finance against the equity in that home \nto build a business, to send children to college, and to establish a \nfuture.\n  I want people to know that paying tribute to Millard Fuller is about \nmore than just building homes. Millard Fuller's life was about building \nhope, building a future and literally changing the course of life--\ncreating an upward trajectory for people around the world.\n  I don't believe that Millard Fuller knew what an impact he had. I \nonly hope we will remember him often. And when we do, as leaders in the \nSenate and the House, as Governors, and in the White House, we will \nrecommit ourselves to realizing the simple principles that Millard \nFuller lived every day.\n  After Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the devastation that hit the \ngulf coast, Habitat was one of the first organizations on the ground. \nMillard and his wife Linda came to Louisiana and helped us to start \nbuilding on higher ground. They built not just in the New Orleans area \nand along the gulf coast of Mississippi, but also in Shreveport, LA, \nwhere they joined with a group of local leaders to start new \norganizations that built homes for people in northwest Louisiana.\n  I would like to read one personal testimony from Cherie Ashley, who \nis the executive director of Habitat for Humanity in Northwest \nLouisiana. She and her family were beneficiaries of this work. Cherie \nwas originally from New Orleans, but the flood waters of Katrina forced \nher out. She fled to Shreveport with her family. She said:\n\n       I was blessed with one of the first of the three homes that \n     was built in Allendale, in Northwest Louisiana. Mr. Fuller \n     was passionate about the work he did and he was passionate \n     about eliminating poverty across this nation. The Fuller \n     Center for Housing and Habitat for Humanity of Northwest \n     Louisiana have provided me and my children the opportunity to \n     regain stability and normalcy after such a life altering \n     event--Hurricane Katrina. I am not just the Executive \n     Director for Habitat for Humanity of Northwest Louisiana, \n     most importantly, I am a proud Habitat homeowner, and that's \n     what God--through Millard Fuller--did for me.\n\n  He most certainly was a man who lived up to God's calling. I believe \nwe would do ourselves well to remember him often, to thank Linda and \nhis family for the tremendous sacrifice they made, and to honor him by \ncontinuing his work.\n\n[[Page S2174]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that his obituaries from the New York Times \nand the Atlanta Journal-Constitution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Feb. 11, 2009]\n\n          Habitat Founder's Gone, But Work Can't Be Forgotten\n\n                          (By Lynda Spofford)\n\n       During a time of renewed optimism yet extreme economic \n     distress, our country is searching for heroes. I can't help \n     but feel we took a big step backward with the death of \n     Millard Fuller last week.\n       Like the country he loved, Millard Fuller was a man of \n     great contrasts. Someone once described him as part honey, \n     part jet fuel, and surely that was true.\n       Fuller was a highly educated son of the Deep South who made \n     his first million by the time he was 29. A practicing lawyer, \n     Fuller was troubled by racial and economic injustice and \n     worked to redress it, first by defending black citizens in \n     Sumter County, and later at Koinonia Farms--an interracial \n     community founded by Clarence Jordan for black people and \n     white people to live and work together in a spirit of \n     partnership. There, Habitat for Humanity was formed.\n       As the founder of Habitat, Fuller transformed the concept \n     of philanthropy, mobilizing armies of volunteers to shelter a \n     million people in need. For his vision, inspiration and \n     labor, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n       When his 30-year career as founder and president of Habitat \n     for Humanity ended, Fuller started a similar organization in \n     his own name.\n       In the four years it operated, the Fuller Center brought \n     thousands of families and communities together to build \n     decent, affordable homes in places as close as the hurricane-\n     ravaged U.S. Gulf coast to as far away as Romania, Nigeria \n     and Sri Lanka. Bringing inspiration to the inner city, Fuller \n     also set about renovating low-income homes in poor condition, \n     asking that the beneficiaries mail modest contributions on a \n     regular basis to keep the ``repair cycle'' going.\n       The Fuller Center model rested on the small community \n     efforts often deemed unworthy of the administrative hassle by \n     other, larger organizations. Yet it was precisely these \n     grass-roots programs that had the greatest appeal to Fuller.\n       In defiance of those who felt he was too slow to shed his \n     unapologetic Christian bent, Fuller called his new \n     organization a ``housing ministry.'' Ironically, as he held \n     tight to the Christian origins that were part of the founding \n     of the group, his organization embraced people of all \n     backgrounds around the world to achieve his goals--Muslims, \n     Hindus, Christians and Jews--a multi-faith appeal that is \n     increasingly popular today. Fuller knew what many evangelists \n     often forget: that decent shelter should be a matter of \n     conscience and action no matter who you worship or what \n     books you read.\n       For those who followed him, he was part deity, part rock \n     star. The people who gathered in churches and town meeting \n     halls to hear him speak understood his almost otherworld \n     appeal. I knew him more as a kindly grandfather and green-\n     shade fiduciary who took time to write personal responses to \n     every letter and e-mail he received. A woman from North \n     Dakota always asked Fuller to send a stamp along with his \n     reply so that she could write back. (He did.) Another \n     entrusted his stewardship to everything she owned of value--a \n     pencil, some loose change and her wedding ring--all crammed \n     into a padded envelope.\n       In the years he worked, he took a modest salary for \n     himself. In 2008, his annual salary was $21,000 a year (often \n     donating a portion back)--and he insisted on driving a 1992 \n     Ford Taurus with a torn roof liner. Yet he quietly paid for \n     college tuition for many bright young people who couldn't \n     afford it, including children he met when their families \n     received a new Habitat house. He did this quietly and without \n     fanfare.\n       As I read the news, I can't help but note the irony of the \n     hype and attention we bestow upon our celebrities and \n     athletic champions, society's heroes. I watch the television \n     at night to find that even reputable news organizations are \n     wasting time on Jessica Simpson's high-waisted jeans and \n     other trivial Hollywood gossip. I wonder how many other \n     Millard Fullers are working in the trenches we ignore while \n     glorifying others with far less notable accomplishments.\n       Last week, our country lost a true hero. There was no \n     halftime show, no parade, no costumed dancers. He was buried \n     in a plain wooden shipping crate and laid to rest in a pecan \n     orchard without a headstone.\n       I hope the world remembers.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 4, 2009]\n\n     Millard Fuller, 74, Who Founded Habitat for Humanity, Is Dead\n\n                          (By Douglas Martin)\n\n       Millard Fuller, who at 29 walked away from his life as a \n     successful businessman to devote himself to the poor, \n     eventually starting Habitat for Humanity International, which \n     spread what he called ``the theology of the hammer'' by \n     building more than 300,000 homes worldwide, died Tuesday near \n     Americus, Ga. He was 74.\n       His brother, Doyle, said Mr. Fuller became ill with a \n     severe headache and chest pains and was taken to a hospital \n     in Americus, his hometown. He died in an ambulance on the way \n     to a larger hospital in Albany, Ga. Doyle Fuller said the \n     cause had not been determined, but may have been an aneurysm.\n       Propelled by his strong Christian principles, Millard \n     Fuller used Habitat to develop a system of using donated \n     money and material, and voluntary labor, to build homes for \n     low-income families. The homes are sold without profit and \n     buyers pay no interest. Buyers are required to help build \n     their houses, contributing what Mr. Fuller called sweat \n     equity.\n       More than a million people live in the homes, which are in \n     more than 100 countries. There are 180 in New York \n     City, including some that former President Jimmy Carter, a \n     longtime Habitat supporter and volunteer, personally \n     helped construct. Mr. Carter said of him on Tuesday that \n     ``he was an inspiration to me, other members of our \n     family, and an untold number of volunteers who worked side \n     by side under his leadership.''\n       Former President Bill Clinton has also volunteered on \n     Habitat projects. When he presented Mr. Fuller the \n     Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1996, he said, ``I don't \n     think it's an exaggeration to say that Millard Fuller has \n     literally revolutionized the concept of philanthropy.''\n       Mr. Fuller said his inspiration came from the Bible, \n     starting with the injunction in Exodus 22:25 against charging \n     interest to the poor. He spoke of the ``economics of Jesus'' \n     and insisted that providing shelter to all was ``a matter of \n     conscience.'' Christianity Today in 1999 called him ``God's \n     contractor.''\n       His skills included fund-raising finesse, an exuberant \n     speaking style and a talent for making use of the news media. \n     In 1986, The Chicago Tribune quoted him asking a publicity \n     man about a woman in front of her ramshackle apartment, \n     ``Don't you think that'd make some great pictures to show her \n     in that rat-infested place?''\n       The article later said Mr. Fuller did not expect to house \n     the world. ``Instead,'' it said, ``he sees Habitat as a \n     hammer that can drive the image of a woman in a rat-infested \n     apartment as deep into the mind of America as the image of an \n     African child with a distended stomach.''\n       Mr. Fuller liked to tell and re-tell the stories of his \n     earliest houses. One man had moved from a leaky shack into a \n     new house.\n       ``When it rains, I love to sit by the window and see it \n     raining outside,'' one new homeowner said, ``and it ain't \n     raining on me!''\n       Another new resident saw his new home as a literal \n     resurrection. ``Being in this house is like we were dead and \n     buried, and got dug up!'' she said.\n       In 2005, a woman employed by Habitat accused Mr. Fuller of \n     verbally and physically harassing her, a widely publicized \n     charge that an investigation by the organization did not \n     prove. But he and a new generation of Habitat board members \n     were disagreeing on organizational and other issues, and he \n     and his wife agreed to resign.\n       Mr. Fuller started a new organization called the Fuller \n     Center for Housing. It is active in 24 states and 14 foreign \n     countries.\n       Millard Dean Fuller was born on Jan. 3, 1935, in Lanett, \n     Ala., then a small cotton-mill town. His mother died when he \n     was 3, and his father remarried. Millard's business career \n     began at 6 when his father gave him a pig. He fattened it up \n     and sold it for $11. Soon he was buying and selling more \n     pigs, then rabbits and chickens as well. He dabbled in \n     selling worms and minnows to fishermen.\n       When he was 10, his father acquired 400 acres of farmland, \n     and Mr. Fuller sold his small animals to raise cattle. He \n     remembered helping his father repair a tiny, ramshackle shack \n     that an elderly couple had inhabited on the property. He was \n     thrilled to see their joy when the work was complete.\n       Mr. Fuller went to Auburn University, running \n     unsuccessfully for student body president, and in 1956 was a \n     delegate to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. He \n     graduated from Auburn with a degree in economics in 1957 and \n     entered the University of Alabama School of Law.\n       He and Morris S. Dees Jr., another law student, decided to \n     go into business together while in the law school. They set a \n     goal: get rich.\n       They built a successful direct-mail operation, published \n     student directories and set up a service to send cakes to \n     students on their birthdays. They also bought dilapidated \n     real estate and refurbished it themselves. They graduated and \n     went into law practice together after Mr. Fuller briefly \n     served in the Army as a lieutenant.\n       As law partners, they continued to make money. Selling \n     65,000 locally produced tractor cushions to the \n     Future Farmers of America made $75,000. Producing \n     cookbooks for the Future Homemakers of America did even \n     better, and they became one of the nation's largest \n     cookbook publishers. By 1964, they were millionaires. Mr. \n     Dees went on to help found the Southern Poverty Law \n     Center.\n       Mr. Fuller's life changed completely after his wife, the \n     former Linda Caldwell, whom he had married in 1959, \n     threatened to leave him. She was frustrated that her busy \n     husband was almost never around, and she had had an affair, \n     their friend Bettie B. Youngs wrote in ``The House That Love \n     Built'' (2007), a joint biography. For the rest of his \n     career, he talked openly about repairing the marriage.\n       There was much soul-searching. Finally, the two agreed to \n     start their life anew on Christian principles. Eschewing \n     material\n\n[[Page S2175]]\n\n     things was the first step. Gone were the speedboat, the \n     lakeside cabin, the fancy cars.\n       The Fullers went to Koinonia Farm, a Christian community in \n     Georgia, where they planned their future with Clarence \n     Jordan, a Bible scholar and leader there. In 1968, they began \n     building houses for poor people nearby, then went to Zaire in \n     1973 to start a project that ultimately built 114 houses.\n       In 1976, a group met in a converted chicken barn at \n     Koinonia Farm and started Habitat for Humanity International. \n     Participants agreed the organization would work through local \n     chapters. They decided to accept government money only for \n     infrastructure improvements like streets and sidewalks.\n       Handwritten notes from the meeting stated the group's grand \n     ambition: to build housing for a million low-income people. \n     That goal was reached in August 2005, when home number \n     200,000 was built. Each home houses an average of five \n     people.\n       The farm announced plans for a simple public burial service \n     for Mr. Fuller on Wednesday.\n       Besides his brother, Doyle, of Montgomery, Ala., and his \n     wife, Mr. Fuller is survived by their son, Christopher, of \n     Macon, Ga.; their daughters, Kim Isakson of Argyle, Tex., \n     Faith Umstattd of Americus, and Georgia Luedi of \n     Jacksonville, Fla.; and nine grandchildren.\n       After Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the Fuller Center built \n     a house in Shreveport, La., for a mother and her daughters, \n     one named Genesis, the other Serenity. Mr. Fuller loved the \n     religious connotations he saw in their names.\n       ``What will little Genesis become?'' he asked at the time. \n     ``What will little Serenity become? We don't know, but we \n     know one thing: if we give them a good place to live, they've \n     got a better chance.''\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an American \npatriot, a man of the finest caliber, and a diplomat whose skills and \ndetermination have helped alter history's course for the better.\n  In a few days, Ambassador Ryan Crocker will depart his post as the \nchief American diplomat in Iraq. His departure will mark the close of a \nstoried career, one of nearly 40 years of distinguished service to our \ncountry. In dedicating his career to furthering America's interests and \nideals in the far reaches of the globe, and in coupling his dedication \nwith a tremendously adventurous spirit, Ryan Crocker has become known \ninformally as our own ``Lawrence of Arabia.''\n  As a young man in Walla Walla, WA, Ryan Crocker decided to depart not \nfor the beaches of southern California but, rather, abroad, hitchhiking \nfrom western Europe to Southeast Asia. By the time he graduated from \nWhitman College in 1971, Ambassador Crocker had already visited more of \nthe world than most Americans will throughout their lifetimes. His \nextensive travel and interest in global politics and culture led him to \njoin the Foreign Service in 1971.\n  Ambassador Crocker quickly developed a reputation for incredible \ndedication in the face of challenges. From his early days at the State \nDepartment, he was assigned to some of the most difficult posts in the \nForeign Service. He worked in Iran, Qatar, Egypt, and in Saddam \nHussein's Iraq. He was in the Embassy in Beirut in 1983, when a \nHezbollah suicide bomber killed 63 people. Thrown against the wall by \nthe blast, Ambassador Crocker immediately began helping others escape \nthe rubble.\n  He went on to serve as Ambassador to Lebanon, Kuwait, Syria, \nPakistan, and Iraq. During his time in Damascus, demonstrators \nassaulted his residence and, in 2002, he reopened the U.S. Embassy in \nKabul, which had been untouched by Americans since 1989. A newspaper \naccount illustrates the spirit that animates this selfless patriot:\n\n       He arrived to find a cobweb-strewn wreck full of 1989 \n     newspapers, broken Wang computers and maps of the old Soviet \n     Union. U.S. Marines outnumbered diplomats by 3 to 1, and all \n     100 Americans slept on cots and shared two working toilets. \n     Yet Crocker was upbeat. ``The men and women of this mission \n     are extremely proud to be a forward element,'' Crocker told \n     [Secretary of State] Powell at the time.\n\n  Throughout all these assignments, Ryan Crocker has approached his \nwork with resolve, tenacity, and a unique ability to see the broader \nstrategic issues in play. Had he never gone to lead the U.S. Embassy in \nIraq, the American people would owe him deep gratitude. Had he not \naccepted the challenge in Baghdad, he would have nevertheless won the \nsincere appreciation and admiration of all Senators. Yet it was in his \ndecision to become America's Ambassador to Iraq that Ryan Crocker has \nleft his true mark on history, and we are all the better off for it.\n  He was sworn in not here in Washington, as is customary, but in \nBaghdad, and in March 2007, as the surge of troops to Iraq was \ncommencing, GEN David Petraeus had taken over as commander, and our \nNation was making its greatest, and possibly final, push to avoid \ndisaster in Iraq. Let us remember that in 2007, as public support for \nthe war plummeted, we in Congress were engaged in a great debate about \nthe way forward in Iraq. Sectarian violence was spiraling out of \ncontrol, life had become a struggle for survival, and a full-scale \ncivil war seemed almost unavoidable. Al-Qaida in Iraq was on the \noffensive and entire Iraqi provinces were under the control of \nextremists. Noting that ``here in Iraq, America faces its most critical \nforeign policy challenge,'' Ambassador Crocker did not sugarcoat the \nsituation or present an overly rosy scenario. He never does. He \nstressed just how hard the path ahead would be but stressed also that \nit was not impossible. As he would later testify before the Armed \nServices Committee, ``hard does not mean hopeless.''\n\n  It was this combination--cold-eyed appraisal of the reality of Iraq \ncombined with hope that things could change for the better--that was so \nrefreshing every time I visited Baghdad. In a true partnership with \nGeneral Petraeus, Ambassador Crocker executed a civil military \ncounterinsurgency plan for Iraq that turned the tide of violence in a \ntimeframe and to a degree that surprised even the optimists. He ensured \nunprecedented cooperation between the military, the Embassy, and our \nallies. His decades of experience in the Middle East proved invaluable \nas he navigated an increasingly complex and contentious regional \ndynamic. His efforts, in coordination with the brave men and women of \nthe military and State Department, are the reason we find ourselves in \na situation many thought was not possible.\n  Ryan Crocker's determination to succeed in a situation where many \nwould have failed should inspire us all. Yet any who have followed the \ncareer of this skilled and extraordinary diplomat shouldn't be \nsurprised. His creative and pragmatic approach to diplomacy has earned \nrespect both at home and abroad. His list of awards and achievements is \nlong and distinguished, including the Presidential Meritorious Service \nAward, the State Department Distinguished Honor Award, the American \nForeign Service Association Rivkin Award, and most recently the \nPresidential Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian \ncommendation.\n  I am immensely grateful for the enormous contributions that \nAmbassador Crocker has made to the Department of State, to our Nation, \nand the people of Iraq. As he departs Baghdad, he will be sorely \nmissed. We wish Ambassador Crocker and his family all the best as he \nenters the next chapter of his life. He has earned the respect and \nadmiration of a grateful nation.\n  I have had the great honor for many years to travel the world and \nencounter many of our wonderful Foreign Service personnel and the men \nand women who serve in posts throughout the world. They serve with \ndedication and most of the time without the appreciation they deserve. \nI have been so impressed with the people who have dedicated their lives \nto serving this Nation all around the world, in many cases in the most \ndifficult of circumstances. I know of no one I have met in my life who \nepitomizes public service more than Ryan Crocker; a quiet demeanor, \nmodesty, and, frankly, a knowledge of the issues and the complexities \nwhich would take many hours to describe that prevail in the Middle \nEast.\n\n[[Page S2176]]\n\n  Ryan Crocker came at a seminal time to the Embassy in Baghdad, and in \npartnership with one of our great military leaders, General Petraeus--a \ntrue and equal partnership--those two individuals changed the course of \nhistory. Many in this body at that time had believed there was no hope \nfor Iraq and that the situation could not be salvaged. Because of Ryan \nCrocker, David Petraeus, and many others, with their leadership we have \njust witnessed an election taking place in Iraq that was virtually \nwithout incident.\n  Ambassador Crocker will be the first to tell us there is a long way \nto go in Iraq. There are many challenges ahead, but we do have an ally, \na democratic nation, and the hope of a society free of the oppression \nand repression that unfortunately has characterized the situation in \nIraq for centuries.\n  So, again, I know in the future young Americans who serve this \ncountry will continue to be inspired by the performance and the \ndedication of Ryan Crocker. We will miss him. We will miss him \nenormously, but I know he will continue to serve this country in any \nway possible for as long as he lives.

Mr. President, today marks the 200th anniversary of the \nbirth of one of this Nation's finest leaders. Abraham Lincoln was born \nin 1809 destined for greatness but with humble beginnings. It is \nremarkable and inspiring to study the life of Abraham Lincoln. Today is \na fitting time to reflect on some of the lessons we can continue to \nlearn from him, especially in light of the challenges we are facing \ntoday.\n  President Lincoln's rise to leadership was full of trials and \nsetbacks, most of which would have deterred a lesser man but not \nAbraham Lincoln. Throughout his lifetime, he was the picture of \nincomparable character, willing to put his ego aside for the greater \ngood, committed to freedom for the generations, and a true believer \nthat he was not superior to anyone.\n  These traits may seem like words that are easy to put together, but \nto live your life by them is truly exemplary. It is especially \nremarkable in the face of adversity. It is said that trials don't build \ncharacter, they simply reveal it. Well, President Lincoln served in the \nhighest office of our country at one of the most tumultuous times in \nour history. His character was revealed time and time again. Americans \nare still proud of his leadership and his vision.\n  During Lincoln's Presidency, our Nation faced the gravest of \nchallenges. We were at war amongst ourselves, and the consequences of \nour leadership would go down in history. Either America would cease to \nexist, or we would survive, heal, and one day be stronger than ever. \nAbraham Lincoln made it possible for us to be here today as the United \nStates of America.\n  Today, we face many overwhelming challenges. They are significant, \nbut they are not as dire as the Civil War. We can work together to get \nout of this economic downturn.\n  In 1862, Lincoln declared:\n\n       The bottom is out of the tub.\n\n  It sort of feels that way today. All you have to do is talk to people \nto realize the numbness that is permeating our country. Those who have \nlost jobs or homes are facing a painful reality. Most Americans are not \nsure what to do. If you are thinking about buying a home or a car, you \nthink many times about it because of the uncertainty of our economy \ntoday. We have to do something here that will boost the confidence of \nAmericans. They have to become consumers again if we want to get this \neconomy going. That means dealing with the underlying housing crisis \nthat set off the bottom falling out of this ``tub.''\n  The other issue we have to remember is that the money we spend today \nwill have to be paid for by our children and our grandchildren. So each \ndollar that goes into this stimulus bill needs to be spent efficiently, \nand it needs to be far reaching. Each dollar needs to go toward \ncreating jobs and stimulating growth. That way, we can recover from \nthis deepening recession and continue to grow.\n  Unfortunately, this so-called stimulus bill is not even close to \nideal legislation. It will bury us in debt, reduce our creditworthiness \nas a nation, and only minimally stimulate the economy. It just doesn't \nspeak to the opportunity Abraham Lincoln knew was possible in this \ncountry.\n  He once said:\n\n       There is no permanent class of hired laborers amongst us. \n     Twenty-five years ago, I was a hired laborer.\n\n  Americans have a unique gift in this country. That gift is \nopportunity--the opportunity to grow, change course, and improve one's \ncircumstances.\n  One of the great freedoms we have in America is the freedom to fail. \nAbraham Lincoln knew a lot about that freedom. He failed many times, \nbut he also knew about the gift of opportunity, and he took advantage \nof it. We have seen the resilience and ingenuity of the American people \nthroughout history. Our job is to do what we can to let that promise \ngrow and not get in the way.\n  I believe the stimulus bill we will vote on soon could have been \nvastly improved if it had been written from the beginning with \nRepublicans and Democrats as part of the process. That is a lesson we \nshould take from President Lincoln. The political process can be messy \nand petty. We should put our egos aside, as Lincoln did when he brought \nhis greatest rivals into his Cabinet. We should focus on the end goal \nbeing the good of our country, not groups to whom each of us is \nbeholden.\n  We should understand there are no guarantees when it comes to the \nfuture of our country. We always have to work to protect what has been \ndefended for more than 200 years. Lincoln reminded us that ``it is not \nmerely for today, but for all time to come that we should perpetuate \nfor our children's children this great and free government, which we \nhave enjoyed all of our lives.'' If we ignore the consequences of our \nactions today, then we take for granted what is to come for the future \nof our great country.\n  President Lincoln was a visionary. On this special day, we cannot \nlose sight of the tremendous lessons of his lifetime. It is never too \nlate for us to join together as Americans to create a better and a \nstronger future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, it is my great honor to stand here today \nand commemorate Abraham Lincoln on the bicentennial of his birth.\n  Abraham Lincoln's leadership during one of our darkest periods \nforever changed the face of our Nation. Because of his bold vision and \nundivided faith in the future of our great Nation, freedom and justice \nfor all was realized. Without doubt, as this resolution affirms, \nPresident Lincoln ``redefined what it means to be an American.'' Today, \nI wish to take a moment to recognize another part of his legacy.\n  In this resolution, it states that ``despite less than a year of \nformal schooling, he developed an avid love for reading and learning.'' \nLincoln's stepmother, Sarah Bush Johnston, encouraged Lincoln to read, \nwrite, and think freely, even as she and Lincoln's father could not \nafford to send him to school. And herein lies the brilliance of \nLincoln's rise.\n  From the backcountry in Illinois to the White House in Washington, \nDC, Abraham Lincoln rose to the highest office in the land by educating \nhimself. In his first political address in 1832, seeking a seat in the \nIllinois General Assembly, he said:\n\n       I desire to see the time when education . . . shall become \n     much more general than at present, and I should be gratified \n     to have it in my power to contribute something to its \n     advancement.\n\n  As President Lincoln showed us, education is the foundation of our \nfuture success. In this period of economic stress and uncertainty, we \ndraw on Lincoln's legacy and move forward because of his strength.\n\n[[Page S2177]]\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 200th \nanniversary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln. On February 12, 1809, our \n16th President was born to Thomas and Nancy Lincoln in Kentucky. \nPresident Lincoln spent the majority of his adult life in Illinois \nwhere he became a successful lawyer and politician. But in between \nthese periods, he lived with his family in the backwoods of Indiana, 20 \nmiles east of Evansville. In these famous salt lick hunting grounds \nnear the Ohio River, the young Abe Lincoln learned about farming, \nsuffered the death of his mother, and grew into a man. Although his \npotential as a leader would not be fully revealed until later in life, \nhis experiences in Indiana formed the basis of his self-taught genius \nand helped shape his belief system.\n  Abe Lincoln's family moved to Indiana in December 1816 when Abe was \n7, arriving shortly after Indiana entered the Union as the 19th State. \nIn Kentucky, the Lincolns had struggled with legal controversies \nrelated to the title to their land. They were attracted to Indiana, in \npart, because buying land from the Federal Government under the clear \nterms of the Northwest Ordinance would eliminate these troubles. Thomas \nLincoln acquired 160 acres of land near Little Pigeon Creek in what is \nnow Spencer County and set up a farm.\n  The family initially lived in a three-sided cabin, known as a half-\nfaced camp. Abraham, who was always tall for his age, helped his father \nwith farming chores. By age 9, he began to learn the detailed skill of \nwielding an ax, which later would be the basis for his backwoods ``rail \nsplitter'' campaign persona.\n  Soon after arriving in Indiana, tragedy struck the family when Nancy \nLincoln died of ``milk sickness'' on October 5, 1818. Thomas Lincoln \nmarried Sarah Bush Johnston on December 2, 1819. Sarah Johnston and her \nthree children from her previous marriage joined Abe and his older \nsister Sarah.\n  Being situated in a sparsely populated region of southern Indiana \nmade access to school difficult. The closest school was a great \ndistance over rough terrain from the Lincoln farm, and Abe's attendance \nwas sporadic, at best. In 1859 Lincoln wrote a letter to his friend \nJesse Fell describing his early life and education in Indiana:\n\n       We reached our new home about the time the State came into \n     the Union. It was a wild region, with many bears and other \n     wild animals still in the woods. There I grew up. There were \n     some schools, so called; but no qualification was ever \n     required of a teacher, beyond readin, writin, and cipherin' \n     to the Rule of Three. If a straggler supposed to understand \n     latin, happened to so-journ in the neighborhood, he was \n     looked upon as a wizzard. There was absolutely nothing to \n     excite ambition for education. Of course when I came of age I \n     did not know much. Still somehow, I could read, write, and \n     cipher to the Rule of Three; but that was all. I have not \n     been to school since. The little advance I now have upon this \n     store of education, I have picked up from time to time under \n     the pressure of necessity.[sic]\n\n  Thomas Lincoln, who had received no formal education himself, saw \nlittle value in Abe's schooling. But Abe's stepmother Sarah encouraged \nhim to read on his own. Abe immersed himself in the family Bible and \nborrowed books from neighbors. He read Parson Weems' ``Life of \nWashington'' at an early age, as well as such classics as Benjamin \nFranklin's ``Autobiography'' and Daniel Defoe's ``Robinson Crusoe.''\n  The first exposure that President Lincoln had to political argument \ncame at a country store owned by James Gentry, a local land owner and \nfriend of the Lincoln family. Abe worked in Gentry's store, soaking up \nconversation on politics and frontier life. As Lincoln grew, his \nhorizons expanded beyond Spencer County. In 1828, he worked on a \nflatboat carrying goods for Gentry all the way to New Orleans. On this \ntrip he encountered slavery for the first time.\n  The Lincolns moved to Illinois in 1830 where Abe went on to become a \nlawyer and State politician, Member of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, and finally President of the United States.\n  The strong feelings of pride that Hoosiers feel for President Lincoln \nare amplified by remembrances of the President around the State. For \nexample, the Indiana State Museum located in Indianapolis houses the \nlargest private collection of President Lincoln memorabilia in the \nworld. Included in this collection are signed copies of the \nEmancipation Proclamation and the 13th amendment, family photos, and \nmore than 20,000 other items. Additionally, the Lincoln Boyhood \nNational Memorial continues to fascinate visitors and preserve \nLincoln's Hoosier legacy.\n  Hoosiers are proud to celebrate President Lincoln's life and the 14 \nformative years he spent in Indiana. The ties of the Lincoln family in \nSpencer County will never be forgotten, and new generations of Hoosiers \nwill learn how Lincoln lifted himself up from humble circumstances to \nbecome a great President and a true American hero.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, today our Nation celebrates the \nbicentennial of Abraham Lincoln's birth, a man who became one of the \nfinest leaders America has ever known. Given his service to our Nation, \nit is fitting that we pause to acknowledge President Lincoln's lasting \ncontributions to our society.\n  President Lincoln was a writer, an attorney, and a statesman, but \nabove all else he was a strong advocate for the common man. This was \ndue in large part to the fact that he was a common man. He was born \ninto a family with modest means, became self-educated, and entered into \na life of public service at the age of 23.\n  During his Presidency, Lincoln once remarked, ``God must love the \ncommon man, he made so many of them.'' He gave a voice to the \ndisenfranchised, the destitute, and the dispirited, and even in the \nface of adversity, he stood strong in support of the notion that ``all \nmen are created equal.''\n  He also led with conviction during a turbulent time in our Nation's \nhistory. As President, Lincoln guided our divided Nation with moral \nclarity and persevered when the fabric of our democracy was tested. He \nhelped to heal our Nation after the Civil War and put America on a path \nto overcome the dark days of slavery.\n  Today, President Lincoln's virtue extends far beyond our borders. He \nhas inspired generations of individuals seeking to advance the cause of \nfreedom and liberty even when their voices have been silenced. These \nindividuals find inspiration in places like Havana, where a statue of \nLincoln still stands proudly along the Avenida de los Presidentes. I \njoin them in hoping for the day when Lincoln's dreams can be realized \nand the people of Cuba can taste the same fruits of liberty we as \nAmericans cherish.\n  On this day, we are reminded not only of Lincoln's contributions to \nour society, but also his vision, which continues to guide our Nation. \nMay his life continue to inspire us and his words always serve as a \nsource of hope. As he once wrote, ``The cause of liberty must not be \nsurrendered at the end of one, or even one hundred defeats.''

Mr. President, I will share a few remarks about the \nstimulus package that we understand is making its way here after going \nthrough conference. I believe there may be some opportunity to change \nwhat is in it. I hope so because one of the most disappointing aspects \nof the process we have been going through is that I was denied a vote \non an amendment that would simply say that every business that gets \ncontracts out of this job stimulus package will have to use the very \nsimple-to-operate E-verify system that over one hundred thousand \nAmerican corporations are using voluntarily.\n  With that system, you simply punch in the Social Security number of a \njob applicant in order to verify work eligibility. Employers run the \nsocial security number through the system and they receive information \nas to whether this individual has a legitimate Social\n\n[[Page S2178]]\n\nSecurity number. It accurately identifies quite a number of people \nillegally in the country who are passing themselves off as being legal. \nIn fact, we have had testimony over the years that there are quite a \nnumber of individuals who have used the same social security number; \npossibly thousands who have used the same Social Security number. Until \nthe E-Verify program, nobody checked.\n  This system has successfully been set up. President Bush was somewhat \nreluctant but moved forward with it, and the system is up and running. \nIt was supposed to be fully implemented for every business in America. \nIt is available to every business in America today on a voluntarily \nbasis. Last year, the Bush Administration issued Executive Order 12989, \nwhich would require all Federal Government contractors and \nsubcontractors to use E-Verify.\n  It is not an unusual idea. It is a popular idea in the House, the \nSenate and with the American people. Out of all the potential applicant \nqueries made, E-Verify only identifies about 3 percent a year who are \napparently not legally in the country and should not be getting a job. \nWe are passing a bill, a huge piece of legislation that, frankly, is \nless stimulative and less job creative than we would like it to be.\n  Gary Becker and one of his partners, a Nobel Prize economist, in the \nWall Street Journal yesterday wrote a big piece in which he questioned \nhow many jobs would actually be created and how stimulative this \npackage is. It has too much in it that is not stimulative. He said you \nwould normally hope to get 1.5 percent of GDP of stimulation for every \ndollar spent. In his opinion, because of the way it is written, it \nwould be less than 1 percent. Not good.\n  The idea was to create jobs, but not for people illegally in the \ncountry; for Americans, legal Americans. These include citizens, green \ncardholders and legal workers in America. They should all be eligible \nfor jobs created under this bill, but not illegally here should not.\n  The House unanimously accepted 2 E-Verify amendments. The House \npassed legislation by Congressman Calvert of California that said the \nE-verify system, which will expire this spring, will be extended for 4 \nyears. In addition to being accepted in their stimulus bill, that \nlanguage passed the House 407 to 2 last July. Unfortunately, the \nDemocrat majority blocked the Senate from voting on it in the last \nCongress.\n  Congressman Kingston offered an amendment that every contractor who \ngets money under the stimulus bill should use E-verify to try to ensure \nthe people who are hired, those who get jobs, are lawful Americans.\n  How much simpler can it be than that? How much more common sense can \nwe have in a bill than that? That was accepted as part of the final \npackage. When the vote was held in the House, I guess all but 11 \nDemocrats voted for both of those provisions.\n  They are kind of proud of themselves. They are telling their \nconstituents: I voted to make sure, as best we could--it is not a \nperfect system--but as best we could, that contractors would use E-\nverify and prohibit some of the people who should not be getting jobs \nfrom doing so.\n  Then when I offered an identical amendment in the Senate, it was \nnever allowed to be brought up for a vote. I have been through this \nprocess for some time. I have seen how things work. I am beginning to \nsee what might be afoot. I know that the majority leader, Senator Reid, \nwhom I respect so much, who has such a difficult job--I don't see how \nanybody can handle it--but he has to make decisions. He has made one \nwith which I don't agree.\n  Somewhere along the way, the leadership decided they would not allow \nthe Senate to vote on this amendment, although they claimed everybody \ngets votes on their amendments. They would not allow a vote on it.\n  Why was this significant? My amendment, supported by Senator Ben \nNelson, one of the people who helped arrange this final settlement, a \nDemocratic Senator, an experienced Governor--was the same as the \nlanguage included in the House version of this bill. Under our rules, \nif the Senate passes legislation that has the same language as the \nHouse, it should remain in the final bill. It should not be taken out. \nIf it was validated by both Houses of Congress, it should not be \naltered by the conferees. But if one body does not have the language in \ntheir version of the bill, then the conferees have a choice. They can \neither take the House language that had the E-verify provisions in it, \nor they could take the Senate language that did not.\n  Let me tell you why I was pretty worried about it. Under this \nmaneuver, this is what happened. The House Members all get to claim \nthey voted for it, and the Senate Members never have to say they voted \nagainst it. If anybody complains about it not being in the bill, any \nMember of the Senate can say: I would have voted for it; I just didn't \nget the vote. That works a lot of times, and it is not good because I \ntruly believe that if this amendment had been voted on in the Senate, \nit would have received very large bipartisan support.\n  I don't think there is any doubt in my mind that many Senators would \ntake the position that E-verify, an essential system for creating a \nlawful system of immigration, should be extended. I think very few \nSenators would take the position that somebody getting money under this \njobs package, this stimulus package paid for by the American taxpayers, \nshouldn't have to hire those who are not lawfully in the country.\n  I am disappointed. I think the American people should be \ndisappointed.\n  I want to go back a little bit further and discuss it some more \nbecause I firmly believe that one reason the American people distrust \nCongress and that we have such a low approval rating is this very kind \nof manipulation and chicanery.\n  Back when the effort was made to move the comprehensive immigration \nbill in the Judiciary Committee, it would have given, I think it is \nfair to say, amnesty to those here illegally, while only promising a \nlot of enforcement measures in the future. During markup in the \nJudiciary Committee, I offered several amendments to tighten up \nenforcement. I was a little bit surprised because amendments I had \noffered before were accepted, amendments to extend the fence, to add to \nthe number of investigators, and to add necessary detention space so \npeople could be deported if they were apprehended.\n  Two years ago, we were apprehending 1.1 million people a year \nattempting to enter the country illegally. We arrested that many people \nat the border and we had a lot of things we needed to do.\n  It finally dawned on me what was happening. This is what happened in \n1986. Why did the 1986 amnesty bill ultimately fail? The amnesty bill \nin 1986 gave legal status and a path to citizenship for millions--it \nturned out to be more than estimated--but it promised enforcement. What \nI want you to know is the amnesty provisions become law at once. But \nthe enforcement was merely a promise. Unless the money for enforcement \nis actually appropriated by the appropriators, no additional Border \nPatrol agents get added, no fence and barriers get built, no detention \nspaces get added, no systems, such as E-verify, get set up. That is why \nit failed before, and I saw that we were heading down the same path \nagain in 2006 and 2007.\n  Those of us who questioned the legislation and demanded that we have \nconfidence in the enforcement provisions did not receive those \nassurances. And that is why the American people made their voice heard \nand the bill ended up going down in flames with an overwhelming vote \nagainst it. This was a far different outcome than people had been \nprojecting even a few months before.\n  I remember how we handled the amendment I offered on defensive \nbarriers at the border. It was obvious that at the California border, \nbarriers were working. We wanted to extend that barrier. I introduced \nan amendment to authorize the construction of barriers of various \nkinds--some vehicles, some fixed--and it would pass with 86 votes. But \nwhen the appropriations bills came back, where we actually disburse the \nmoney to fund these programs, the money for the barriers was not \nincluded. So we began to have a serious discussion on the floor of the \nSenate about that kind of duplicity, I felt, where we would vote \noverwhelmingly to take an action and then when came time to put up the \nmoney to make it happen, we would vote it down, and everybody would \nsay: I voted to build a\n\n[[Page S2179]]\n\nfence. It is not my fault. It just didn't happen.\n  I want to say, this is what is happening with these E-Verify \nprovisions. The American people need to know it. This was a very \nreasonable and restrained provision. It is common sense, if there is \nany such thing as common sense associated with the way this stimulus \nbill was handled. It tries to help Americans get jobs. Unemployment is \nup to 7.6 percent now. Unfortunately, I think it may go up more. Why in \nthe world would we not take this reasonable, simple step to try to \nensure that the $800 billion we are spending goes to American citizens \nor those lawfully in our country? It does not create police. It does \nnot create enforcement. It does not create a bureaucracy. It simply \nextends the already successful program and says every employer ought to \nuse this simple E-verify system, a 2-minute computer check to find out \nif the person is likely to be illegal or legal.\n  I could not imagine why we would not do that, but now I understand. I \nsaw one publication, an inside trade publication that said the chicken \nprocessors and the Chamber of Commerce, big business Chamber of \nCommerce, had written the leaders and asked them not to pass my \namendment. They didn't write to me. They didn't write to other Members. \nSomebody is talking in secret. Somewhere, somehow this plan was \ndeveloped to keep this provision from becoming part of this law. And it \nis not right. I protested. Three or four times I came to this floor, \nand I asked that this language either be put in the bill or that, at \nthe very least, the Senate be allowed to vote on it. I expressed my \nconcern that this very thing was happening. But the leadership in the \nSenate has the power to pick and choose the amendments they allow to be \nvoted on, and they didn't want this one to be voted on. They didn't \nwant it because they didn't want the language in the bill, I conclude. \nWhat else could I conclude because if we had had a vote, it would have \npassed, I am convinced.\n\n  Senator Ben Nelson and I supported it. We had a whole lot of Members \non the Democratic side who did not go for this last comprehensive \nimmigration bill. This is just a tiny step compared to that historic \nvote. I believe virtually all of our Members would have believed this \nwas a reasonable amendment, and, overwhelmingly, I am confident a \nstrong majority would have voted for it and it would have been in the \nbill.\n  So that is the kind of thing we are doing. If people are unhappy with \ntheir Congress and the process we have ongoing, then they need to do \nlike they did back during the immigration debate and send letters and \nmake phone calls. That apparently made a tremendous difference then.\n  You may ask: Well, why did the conference not include the House-\npassed language; isn't there a process? Well, the Senate conference was \nvery small, and the Senate conferees were a majority of Democrats \nselected by the majority leader. In the House they have a majority \nappointed by the Speaker. That means basically the Speaker and the \nmajority leader control what comes out of the conference. They pick the \npeople who run it and vote on it and they get to decide. So somewhere \nalong the way the Speaker and the majority leader agreed to take this \nlanguage out. It should not have happened. It should have been in this \nbill, and I am very sorry it was not.\n  Mr. President, I will just say that will be one of the reasons I will \noppose this bill. I am very disappointed we didn't have the free \nability this great Senate is so famous for to have a vote on a clearly \nrelevant, germane amendment. It was already in the House bill. That \nguarantees it to be a germane amendment. It would be germane under any \ncircumstances, I believe. I am deeply disappointed we didn't have a \nright to vote on that.\n  I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, to follow up on my earlier remarks about \nE-Verify, I would note it is ironic that it appears the final version \nof this legislation will result in a huge expansion of Government, but \nit also could result in termination of a key program, and that is the \nE-Verify Program. It has been proven to be successful. People like it--\non a bipartisan basis they like it--and it will terminate this spring \nif we don't do something about it.\n  According to both Robert Rector at the Heritage Foundation, and \nSteven Camarota from the Center for Immigration Studies--Mr. Rector was \nthe architect of welfare reform and one of the best minds in the \ncountry on these issues--this legislation we are talking about passing \ntoday or tomorrow could result in several hundred thousand jobs being \ngiven to illegal immigrants--several hundred thousand.\n  The version of the stimulus bill that passed the Senate contained \n$104 billion in construction spending, including highways, schools, and \npublic housing. Only about $30 billion is for highways--a little over 3 \npercent of the bill's value, just for perspective--but it would total \nabout $104 billion for infrastructure and construction. Government \nestimates suggest this spending could create about 2 million new \nconstruction jobs.\n  Consistent with other research, the Center for Immigration Studies \nhas previously estimated that 15 percent of construction workers are \nillegal immigrants, which means about 300,000 of the construction jobs \ncreated by the Senate stimulus plan could go to those who are not \nlawfully in the country.\n  The E-Verify--formerly called the Basic Pilot/Employment Eligibility \nVerification Program--is an online system operated jointly by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration. \nParticipating employers can check the work status of new hires online \nby comparing information from the employee's submitted I-9 form against \nthe Social Security and Department of Homeland Security databases. More \nthan 107,000 employers voluntarily are using that system today, and \nhappily so.\n  E-Verify is free--it doesn't cost the employer anything--it is \nvoluntary, and the best means available for determining employment \neligibility for new hires and the validity of their Social Security \nnumber. According to the Department of Homeland Security, 96.1 percent \nof employees are cleared automatically, and growth continues at a rate \nof 2,000 additional businesses using the system each week.\n  Now, this 96 percent, I know, is for all employees and all companies, \nand I am sure there might be a higher number with construction workers. \nAs of February 2, 2009, there have been over 2.5 million inquiries \nthrough the system. In 2008, there were more than 6.6 million inquiries \nrun. The number is really going up.\n  An employer who verifies work authorization under the E-Verify system \nhas an advantage. That employer has created a rebuttable presumption \nthat they have taken reasonable steps to make sure they are not filling \ntheir employment rolls with illegals. If the investigators come out and \nfind someone who is illegal, they can say: Well, I ran the number on \nyour system, and if it had been bad, I wouldn't have hired them and I \ncan show you where that cleared your system. So it protects the \nemployer from any false charges.\n  So Senator Ben Nelson and I wrote a letter to Senators Reid and \nMcConnell asking that this legislation include provisions to require E-\nVerify for the jobs created under this proposal.\n  As an aside, there is another problem, and we might as well talk \nabout it. I was very worried and concerned because, on January 28 of \nthis year, President Obama pushed back the implementation of Executive \nOrder No. 12989, executed by President Bush, which would require all \nFederal contractors and subcontractors to use E-Verify. In other words, \nthose who are doing work now on military bases and roads and other \nthings would be required to use a successful system that has long been \nplanned and being phased in. Now, the implementation date has been \npushed back to May 21.\n  So are we now seeing some sort of serious movement to undermine one \nof the most effective, least intrusive systems we have ever developed, \nthe cornerstone of Homeland Security's enforcement efforts? I don't \nknow. When\n\n[[Page S2180]]\n\nyou add that decision to what has happened on the floor of the Senate, \nmy concerns are increasing.\n  Recently, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the \nunemployment rate in January had gotten to 7.6 percent, including \n598,000 jobs lost in January. This is the highest unemployment rate in \n17 years. We know and expect it will go higher--hopefully, not a whole \nlot higher, but certainly those trends are not good.\n  Immigration by illegal immigrants and other poorly educated aliens \nhas a serious and depressing effect on the standard of living of low-\nskilled, hard-working Americans, and I will tell you that is a fact. \nThe United States Commission on Immigration Reform, chaired by the late \ncivil rights pioneer, Barbara Jordan, found that immigration of \nunskilled immigrants comes at a cost to unskilled U.S. workers. I don't \nthink there is any doubt about that.\n  The Center for Immigration Studies has estimated that such \nimmigration has reduced the wage of the average native-born worker in a \nlow-skilled occupation by 12 percent or $2,000 a year. It may not \nimpact people in universities and Senators, but hard-working Americans \nare having to compete against persons who are willing to work for so \nmuch less and who often are being taken advantage of.\n  I just give this aside: I talked to the CEO of a company--a family \ncompany. They do right-of-way clearing and other type work of that kind \nfor utilities in States and counties. He said they have had good \nemployees. They have hired them for many years. They pay retirement and \nhealth care benefits and competitive wages. All of a sudden, just a few \nyears ago, they started losing bid after bid after bid. They could not \nunderstand how the competitor could bid so low. They began to look into \nit, and it appears, quite clear to him, the reason a company from Texas \nwas able to outbid him was because they were paying their employees \nmuch less, and he believes many of them were illegally in the country. \nNow, how did that help his employees? He may be forced to go out of \nbusiness simply because he was obeying the law.\n  In addition, a Harvard economist, Professor George Borjas, who has \nwritten a book on this subject--himself a Cuban refugee; at a young age \nhe came from Cuba--has estimated that immigration in recent decades has \nreduced the wages of native-born workers without a high school degree \nby 8.2 percent.\n  Doris Meissner, former head of INS--the immigration service--under \nPresident Clinton, wrote this in February of this year:\n\n       Mandatory employer verification must be at the center of \n     legislation to combat illegal immigration. The E-Verify \n     system provides a valuable tool for employers who are trying \n     to comply with the law. E-Verify also provides an opportunity \n     to determine the best electronic means to implement \n     verification requirements. The administration should support \n     reauthorization of E-Verify and expand the program.\n\n  That is Doris Meissner, who is certainly a moderate on immigration \nissues. She served under President Clinton and said just recently this \nis a key thing for us to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair, and I would suggest finally that \nthese are very important issues for American citizens. We need to speak \nout clearly on them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, we are in a period of morning business, \nup to 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/12/senate-section/article/S2180-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2180-S2182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       STIMULUS CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the conference report \nto the so-called stimulus bill. While we have not seen the actual bill, \nthe outlines of the final agreement are available, and not much has \nchanged from the bill since it passed the Senate earlier this week. The \nbill will still cost more than $1 trillion over the next 10 years after \ninterest on the borrowed money necessary to finance the bill is added. \nThis is $1 trillion added to our national debt and $1 trillion we have \nto take away from our American workers in the future to pay off that \ndebt. That is why the bill also raises the limit on the national debt \nto over $12 trillion. That is almost a $2 trillion increase in the \nnational debt.\n  But $1 trillion of new debt is not the whole story. Many of the tax \nand spending provisions in this bill last only a few months or years. \nThe President and many in Congress have promised to extend those \nprovisions or even make them permanent. Obviously, that means the cost \nof the bill as written does not show the true cost of the changes it \nputs in place. In fact, in a letter sent yesterday, the Congressional \nBudget Office said that when you add in the cost of extending the \nprograms the President has promised to extend, the total cost of the \nbill over the next 10 years is actually $2\\1/2\\ trillion. Add the \ninterest on that $2\\1/2\\ trillion of new debt, and the bill will cost \nthe taxpayer $3.3 trillion over the next 10 years. That is $3.3 \ntrillion we will have to tax our children, my grandchildren and your \ngrandchildren, and our neighbors.\n  It is true the conference report is a bit smaller than the House-\npassed bill, so those numbers will have to be figured again when the \nfinal language is available, but they are close enough to understand \nthe massive size of this debt spending bill.\n  If all this new debt spending would actually fix the economy and \ncreate jobs, it might be worth it. But that is not what is going to \nhappen. Even the Congressional Budget Office agrees with that. In \nanother letter they sent yesterday, they said the bill will reduce--you \nheard me right--reduce GDP over the long term. They also estimated it \nwill lower wages over the long term because Government spending now \nwill take money away from productive use by the private sector later.\n  We cannot spend our way out of this crisis. The solution to the \ncrisis that was created by too much debt is not more debt, and America \ncannot afford to waste several trillion dollars. If we really want to \nstimulate the economy, we need to focus our attention on tax cuts for \nindividuals, investments, and businesses. We need to enact legislation \nthat will have a direct and immediate impact. We need a bill that will \ncreate more jobs through targeted tax relief, not a bill that will \nspend money on programs that offer no immediate or long-term return to \nthe American taxpayer. We could have done that on this bill, but the \nmajority refused to work with the minority to craft a truly bipartisan \nbill. In all of Congress, there were only 3 members of the minority who \nsupported this flawed spending bill, and 3 out of 218 does not make \nthis a bipartisan bill.\n  I hope the actual bill is made available with time for Senators and \nthe American public to examine it before we vote. I cannot support the \nconference report that has been described by the House and Senate \nleadership, and I hope we can do better the next time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the two letters from the Congressional \nBudget Office that I mentioned earlier be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 11, 2009.\n     Hon. Paul Ryan,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman, as you requested, the Congressional \n     Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation have \n     estimated the impact of permanently extending more than 20 of \n     the provisions contained in H.R. 1, the American Recovery and \n     Reinvestment Act of 2009, as passed by the House of \n     Representatives. As specified in H.R. 1 as passed, those \n     provisions would either explicitly expire or would specify \n     appropriations only for a limited number of years (usually \n     2009 and 2010).\n       CBO estimates that H.R. 1, as passed by the House of \n     Representatives, would increase budget deficits by about $820 \n     billion over the 2009-2019 period; we estimate that \n     permanently extending the programs you identified would \n     increase the cumulative deficit over that period by another \n     $1.7 trillion (see attached table).\n       As you requested, the Congressional Budget Office has also \n     estimated the costs of debt service that would result from \n     enacting the bill with these extensions. Such costs are not \n     included in CBO's cost estimates for individual pieces of \n     legislation and are not counted for Congressional \n     scorekeeping purposes for such legislation. If the specified \n     provisions of H.R. 1 are continued, under\n\n[[Page S2181]]\n\n     CBO's current economic assumptions and assuming that none of \n     the direct budgetary effects of the legislation are offset by \n     future legislation, CBO estimates that enacting the bill \n     would increase the government's interest costs by a total of \n     about $745 billion over the 2009-2019 period.\n       I hope this information is helpful to you. If you would \n     like further details about this estimate, the CBO staff \n     contacts are Christi Hawley Anthony and Barry Blom.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Douglas W.

Judd Gregg,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: At your request, the Congressional Budget \n     Office (CBO) has prepared a year-by-year analysis of the \n     economic effects of pending stimulus legislation. This \n     analysis is based on an average of the effects of two \n     versions of H.R. 1--as passed by the House and as passed by \n     the Senate. (The economic effects of those two bills are \n     broadly similar.)\n\n\n                           Short-Run Effects\n\n       The macroeconomic impacts of any economic stimulus program \n     are very uncertain. Economic theories differ in their \n     predictions about the effectiveness of stimulus. Furthermore, \n     large fiscal stimulus is rarely attempted, so it is difficult \n     to distinguish among alternative estimates of how large the \n     macroeconomic effects would be. For those reasons, some \n     economists remain skeptical that there would be any \n     significant effects, while others expect very large ones.\n       CBO has developed a range of estimates of the effects of \n     stimulus legislation on gross\n\n[[Page S2182]]\n\n     domestic product (GDP) and employment that encompasses a \n     majority of economists' views. By CBO's estimation, in the \n     short run the stimulus legislation would raise GDP and \n     increase employment by adding to aggregate demand and thereby \n     boosting the utilization of labor and capital that would \n     otherwise be unused because the economy is in recession. Most \n     of the budgetary effects of the legislation would occur over \n     the next few years, and as those effects diminished the \n     short-run impact on the economy would fade.\n\n\n                            Long-Run Effects\n\n       In the long run, the economy produces close to its \n     potential output on average, and that potential level is \n     determined by the stock of productive capital, the supply of \n     labor, and productivity. Short-run stimulative policies can \n     affect long-run output by influencing those three factors, \n     although such effects would generally be smaller than the \n     short-run impact of those policies on demand.\n       In contrast to its positive near-term macroeconomic \n     effects, the legislation would reduce output slightly in the \n     long run, CBO estimates, as would other similar proposals. \n     The principal channel for this effect is that the legislation \n     would result in an increase in government debt. To the extent \n     that people hold their wealth as government bonds rather than \n     in a form that can be used to finance private investment, the \n     increased debt would tend to reduce the stock of productive \n     private capital. In economic parlance, the debt would ``crowd \n     out'' private investment. (Crowding out is unlikely to occur \n     in the short run under current conditions, because most firms \n     are lowering investment in response to reduced demand, which \n     stimulus can offset in part.) CBO's basic assumption is that, \n     in the long run, each dollar of additional debt crowds out \n     about a third of a dollar's worth of private domestic capital \n     (with the remainder of the rise in debt offset by increases \n     in private saving and inflows of foreign capital). Because of \n     uncertainty about the degree of crowding out, however, CBO \n     has incorporated both more and less crowding out into its \n     range of estimates of the long-run effects of the stimulus \n     legislation.\n       The crowding-out effect would be offset somewhat by other \n     factors. Some of the legislation's provisions, such as \n     funding for improvements to roads and highways, might add to \n     the economy's potential output in much the same way that \n     private capital investment does. Other provisions, such as \n     funding for grants to increase access to college education, \n     could raise long-term productivity by enhancing people's \n     skills. And some provisions would create incentives for \n     increased private investment. According to CBO's estimates, \n     provisions that could add to long-term output account for \n     between one-fifth and one-quarter of the legislation's \n     budgetary cost.\n       The effect of individual provisions could vary greatly. For \n     example, increased spending for basic research and education \n     might affect output only after a number of years, but once \n     those investments began to boost GDP, they might pay off over \n     more years than would the average investment in physical \n     capital (in economic terms, they have a low rate of \n     depreciation). Therefore, in any one year, their contribution \n     to output might be less than that of the average private \n     investment, even if their overall contribution to \n     productivity over their lifetime was just as high. Moreover, \n     although some carefully chosen government investments might \n     be as productive as private investment, other government \n     projects would probably fall well short of that benchmark, \n     particularly in an environment in which rapid spending is a \n     significant goal. The response of state and local governments \n     that received federal stimulus grants would also affect their \n     long-run impact; those governments might apply some of that \n     money to investments they would have carried out anyway, thus \n     lowering the long-run economic return on those grants. In \n     order to encompass a wide range of potential effects, CBO \n     used two assumptions in developing its estimates: first, that \n     all of the relevant investments together would, on average, \n     add as much to output as would a comparable amount of private \n     investment, and second, that they would, on average, not add \n     to output at all.\n       In principle, the legislation's long-run impact on output \n     also would depend on whether it permanently changed \n     incentives to work or save. However, according to CBO's \n     estimates, the legislation would not have any significant \n     permanent effects on those incentives.\n\n\n                  Net Effects on Output and Employment\n\n       Taking all of the short- and long-run effects into account, \n     CBO estimates that the legislation implies an increase in GDP \n     relative to the agency's baseline forecast of between 1.4 \n     percent and 3.8 percent by the fourth quarter of 2009, \n     between 1.1 percent and 3.3 percent by the fourth quarter of \n     2010, between 0.4 percent and 1.3 percent by the fourth \n     quarter of 2011, and declining amounts in later years (see \n     Table 1). Beyond 2014, the legislation is estimated to reduce \n     GDP by between zero and 0.2 percent. This long-run effect is \n     slightly smaller than CBO estimated in its preliminary \n     analysis of the Senate stimulus legislation last week due to \n     refinements in our methodology.\n       Correspondingly, the legislation would increase employment \n     by 0.8 million to 2.3 million by the fourth quarter of 2009, \n     by 1.2 million to 3.6 million by the fourth quarter of 2010, \n     by 0.6 million to 1.9 million by the fourth quarter of 2011, \n     and by declining numbers in later years. The effect on \n     employment is never estimated to be negative, despite lower \n     GDP in later years, because CBO expects that the U.S. labor \n     market will be at nearly full employment in the long run. The \n     reduction in GDP is therefore estimated to be reflected in \n     lower wages rather than lower employment, as workers will be \n     less productive because the capital stock is smaller.\n       I hope this information is helpful to you.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the economic \nrecovery package on which we will soon vote. We are in the midst of the \nmost severe recession since the Great Depression. Families and small \nbusinesses across this country and in my home State of New Hampshire \nare hurting. As a former Governor and small business owner, I know it \nis business and not government that creates jobs and drives new ideas \nand innovation. But I believe government has a vital role to play in \nhelping business create jobs, especially in these very difficult \neconomic times.\n  These are very difficult economic times. New Hampshire is a small \nState. We have just over 1.3 million people. Yet, in December alone, \nnearly 73,000 weekly claims were filed for unemployment compensation. \nAs you can see on this chart, that is more than double the number of \nunemployment claims of a year ago and almost triple what the \nunemployment claims were 2 years ago. Nationally, we lost almost \n600,000\n\n[[Page S2183]]\n\njobs in January alone. We are shedding jobs at an alarmingly fast rate \nin New Hampshire and across this country. That is why it is critical \nthat we pass a robust economic recovery package and that we do it \nimmediately.\n  The economic recovery bill we are going to vote on is not perfect. I \nwould have preferred more investment for roads and bridges, for water \ntreatment plants, for K-12 and higher education buildings. Over the \npast year in New Hampshire, we lost almost 10 percent of our \nconstruction jobs, and investing in infrastructure creates good-paying \nconstruction jobs now, with the money earned by these workers \ngenerating a multiplier effect of economic activity so that it \nstrengthens our economy, not just now but in the future. If it were up \nto me alone, we would be investing more heavily in infrastructure. But, \nas President Obama said the other day, we cannot let the perfect be the \nenemy of the good.\n  This economic recovery bill is good. For example, with this bill, \nover $132 million in highway funding will come to New Hampshire for \nroad and bridge construction. Monday, I toured the construction site \nfor a long planned access road to our major airport in New Hampshire, \nthe Manchester-Boston Regional Airport. The highway funding in this \neconomic recovery package will expedite the completion of that access \nroad to our major airport in Manchester. It will create 1,000 \nconstruction jobs, and it will unleash the full potential of the \nManchester Airport.\n  Almost $60 million will come to New Hampshire for water and \nwastewater treatment plants. That will create good construction jobs. \nIt will enable cities and towns to move forward with long overdue \nprojects.\n  The economic recovery package will also help small businesses obtain \nthe financing they need to retain and create good jobs. This is \ncritically important in New Hampshire, where 94 percent of our \nbusinesses have fewer than 100 employees, yet they employ half of the \nState's workforce.\n  The credit crunch has hit small businesses particularly hard. By \ntemporarily waiving the Small Business Administration fees and \nincreasing the loan guarantee cap, this economic recovery package is \nestimated to stimulate up to $20 billion in small business loans.\n  We may need to do more in the coming months to help small businesses \naccess the working capital they need to survive during the recession. \nToo many small businesses today are relying on credit cards and they \nare paying exorbitant interest rates to obtain working capital. As a \nmember of the Small Business Committee, I will be vigilant at \nmonitoring whether the actions we are taking now in this economic \npackage are sufficient to provide small businesses with access to \nfinancing.\n  This economic package will also put us on the path to energy \nindependence by doubling our renewable energy-generating capacity over \nthe next 3 years. By passing this legislation, we will make it possible \nfor great projects across the country to get up and running.\n  I had the opportunity to talk to some people behind one of those \nprojects in our capital city of Concord, NH. A company called Concord \nSteam has a fully permitted 20-megawatt biomass plant that is ready to \ngo right now. Their challenge is getting the financing they need. If \nthey are able to go forward, this combined heat and power plant will be \nbuilt on a restored brownfields site. It will employ over 100 \nconstruction workers for the next year and a half, and it will create \n25 permanent jobs at the plant. Because its fuel will be New Hampshire \nforest waste, this renewable powerplant will also create about 100 jobs \nin the timber industry. This project will benefit every single American \nbecause the steam heat and power that it produces will displace 12 \nmillion gallons of foreign oil each year.\n  We need to pass this economic recovery package, not only because it \nwill put people back to work and lay a foundation for long-term \neconomic growth but also because we need to restore confidence in our \neconomy. The American people have always risen to meet every challenge. \nThey need to see their Government is ready to meet this economic \nchallenge as well.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this economic recovery \npackage and doing it as soon as possible.\n  I suggest the absence a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/12/senate-section/article/S2183-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2183-S2184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             200TH ANNIVERSARY OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN'S BIRTH\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today, as we all know, if we read the \npapers, we celebrated the 200th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's birth. \nOur Nation's 16th President is remembered and celebrated, of course, \nfor his many accomplishments that shaped our Nation.\n  Most of us recall hearing about the Lincoln-Douglas debates in 1858, \na series of debates between the two Senate candidates over the issues \nof slavery, and how that led to the 1860 Presidential election.\n  President Lincoln is celebrated for signing the Emancipation \nProclamation, the beginning of the end to slavery. All of us remember \nlearning in grade school, some of us failing to perhaps memorize it, \nbut learning of the Gettysburg Address, the prophetic words to a nation \nin turmoil that a ``government of the people, by the people, and for \nthe people, shall not perish from the earth.''\n  One of the great places to go in Washington, DC, on a hot summer \nnight is to sit on the marble floor at the Lincoln Memorial and read \nthe Gettysburg Address on one side, then turn around and walk over and \nread perhaps Lincoln's greatest speech, in my opinion, the second \ninaugural address: With charity for all, with malice toward none, and \nall that he said in the second inaugural.\n  We often remember elements of his legacy but sometimes forget the \nworld view that drove his actions. Lincoln's fight for social and \neconomic justice changed the face of our Nation forever. His fight for \neconomic justice, his fight to ensure that work is rewarded and that \nwealth accrues to those who produce it, has also changed the face of \nour Nation.\n  He forged a path toward prosperity, shared rather than hoarded, a \npath toward economic opportunity, rather than economic stratification.\n  President Lincoln knew then what so many of us are reminded of today. \nThat is one reason we celebrate him the way we do, not just his 200th \nbirthday but what he stood for, and especially in light of today's \neconomy. He knew that a nation with the economic priorities skewed \ntoward the wealthiest citizens is a nation with a fragile foundation.\n  One of my favorite Lincoln quotes:\n\n       It has so happened in all ages of the world, that some have \n     laboured and others have, without labour, enjoyed a huge \n     proportion of the fruits. This is wrong, and should not \n     continue.\n\n  President Lincoln could stand before this Chamber and deliver those \nsame words and find equal resonance within the these walls and in the \nhomes of middle-class families in the Presiding Officer's State of \nColorado, and my home State of Ohio.\n  President Lincoln's commitment to economic opportunity for America's \nworkers was a tenet of what he stood for from his early days in the \nState legislature, in Springfield, IL, all the way to his final days in \nthe White House.\n  Those efforts were amplified through the fight against slavery, the \nhallmark of his legacy, which was founded on a fight for economic \nopportunity, opportunity for all.\n  President Lincoln saw the fight for our Nation's workers, all \nworkers, as a moral, a political, and an economic issue, one that put \nthe Nation on a new path to prosperity and opportunity. Lincoln, in \neffect, fought for what we would today call the American dream. \nAmericans who work hard, play by the rules, should get the opportunity \nand will get ahead.\n  While he may have not have said it in so many words, he may have not \nhave used the term American dream, he may not have mentioned the \nframework ``work hard and play by the rules,'' he was laying the \ngroundwork for the creation of our Nation's middle class.\n  He applied his philosophy that ``labor is the true standard of \nvalue'' and that\n\n[[Page S2184]]\n\nworkers should be justly rewarded for their labor. President Lincoln \nsaw Government as a catalyst that could propel the son of a farmer or a \ntradesman to a better life, to greater economic stability. He believed \nthat Government investment in public works projects created jobs for \nmillions of Americans, and history has shown him right--projects such \nas the transcontinental railroad, the Morrill Act to create land grants \nfor colleges, and the building of canals through much of what was then \nthe United States.\n  It was the same philosophy championed by Franklin Delano Roosevelt \nsome 70 years later on behalf of a nation in turmoil. Once again, the \neconomic might of our Government was harnessed to promote public works \nprojects, to create jobs, and to create economic prosperity.\n  President Roosevelt's New Deal projects led to the construction of \nelectricity-generating dams--I know what it did in the Presiding \nOfficer's part of the country--in schools, in hospitals, in highways \nand bridges.\n  The WPA, the Works Progress Administration, was responsible for \nputting millions of Americans back to work to support their families, \nback on the path to the American dream. Our Nation once again faces \nchronically uncertain economic times. During the last 8 years, the \nwealthiest 1 percent of our Nation got wealthier and wealthier. Most of \nthe rest of America saw their wages stagnate. Yet the 1 percent got the \nhugest tax breaks. Middle-class families, the backbone of our Nation, \nsaw their income stagnate, their jobs disappear, their health care \ncosts rise, and sometimes their health care itself evaporate, their \nenergy costs rise, their homes go into foreclosure, their retirement \nsecurity vanish.\n  Productivity rose and real wages declined. You would think in the \nhistory of this country, in the postwar years especially, when \nproductivity went up, when workers were more productive, their wages \nkept up. During the Bush administration, that was truncated, where \nprosperity continued to go up, but wages flattened and the workers \nsimply did not share in the wealth they created.\n  That would so violate the spirit of Abraham Lincoln and so run \ncounter to what he said about labor and about workers. Let me read that \nline again: It has so happened in all ages of the world, that some have \nlaboured and others have, without labour, enjoyed a huge proportion of \nthe fruits. This is wrong, and should not continue.\n  Our Government's priorities in the last few years were focused on \nenabling the wealthiest Americans to accrue more wealth, not focused on \nensuring that hard work would enable middle-class families to thrive. \nLincoln knew better. Roosevelt knew better. And we know better. That is \nwhy what we are doing this week is so important. We are walking away \nfrom priorities that undervalue Main Street, Lima, OH, Main Street, \nAkron, OH, Main Street, Mansfield, OH, and overvalue Wall Street. We \nare walking away from priorities that undervalue Main Street and \novervalue Wall Street.\n  We are focusing on making sure that there are jobs to be had, and \nthat Americans who work hard and play by the rules are rewarded for \ndoing those jobs and renewing American prosperity by rebuilding its \ninfrastructure, an infrastructure that has been starved by a war in \nIraq, and starved by tax cuts going overwhelmingly to the wealthy. We \nare investing in public works projects because we know that the path \ncarved out by President Lincoln, expanded by President Roosevelt, and \nnow the one we follow along with President Obama, is the right path for \njob creation. It is the right path for our Nation's economy and our \nNation's workers. It is the right path to the American dream.\n  Abraham Lincoln, first and foremost, believed in American workers. He \nbelieved in American businesses. He believed in America itself. This \neconomic recovery package is an investment in our great country, it is \na fitting way to mark President Lincoln's birthday. I think he would \nhave been proud.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to lead a \ncolloquy among my colleagues for up to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/12/senate-section/article/S2184-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2184-S2209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            STIMULUS PACKAGE\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the stimulus bill is the subject of \ndiscussion. There are some things we know about it and some we don't. \nWe know, for example, it is a massive amount of money, almost $800 \nbillion. These are numbers we throw around. But according to the \nPolitico newspaper last month, this is more than we spent on Iraq, more \nthan we spent on Afghanistan, more than we spent going to the Moon in \ntoday's dollars, and more than the Federal Government spent in the \nentire New Deal in today's dollars. It's a massive amount of money. It \nis not like some of the money we were authorizing to be spent in \nOctober and November, when we were giving the Department of the \nTreasury, in effect, a line of credit to help financial institutions \nbegin to lend again so people could get auto loans. This is money we \nare spending. It goes out the door. We have to pay it back. It adds to \nthe national debt. It took from the founding of our country all the way \nto the late 1970s to accumulate a national debt as large as the amount \nof money we are spending in this bill. We have been moving rapidly on \nthis legislation. It is not only spending. The amount of money spent \nfor education is such that it may be the largest Federal education bill \nwe have ever passed in terms of dollars. The amount of money spent for \nenergy is enough that it will be one of the largest Energy bills. The \namount of money spent for Medicaid in the House and Senate bills, \nnearly $90 billion over 2 years to the States, may completely distort \nthe discussion we are about to have on national health care policy. \nThese are all topics that normally we would take weeks to consider.\n  For example, if we are going to add $40 billion to a Department of \nEducation that only spends $68 billion today, we would ask the \nquestion: $40 billion for more of the same, or do we have some better \nideas about how we might reward outstanding teachers or give teachers \nmore discretion or parents more choices of schools?\n  I ask the assistant Republican leader from Arizona, this is one of \nthe most important, massive bills. Republicans want a stimulus package. \nWe have made clear we think we ought to start by fixing housing first, \nletting people keep more of their own money, and confining the spending \nto only those projects that create jobs.\n  I ask the Senator from Arizona, where are we? Has he had an \nopportunity to read the legislation to know how much is being spent, \nhow much is actually targeted for jobs, and how temporary that \ntargeting might be?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we do not know yet. I received an e-mail that \nsaid the Speaker of the House would be holding a press conference \nsometime in about an hour. I assume that, therefore, by then they will \nactually have produced the bill, that there will actually be a bill she \ncan then share with her colleagues in the House and then would come \nover here and we could begin to read as well.\n  The answer to the first question is, despite all the discussion, we \ndon't know yet exactly what is in it, how much it is, and what the \nlong-term consequences will be. We do know from news media that certain \nthings in the bill that passed the Senate have been changed. We are \nalso told the basic amount is somewhere in the neighborhood of $20 or \n$30 billion less than the House-passed bill. If that is true, we can \nmake some rough guesses. I will be happy to share what the \nCongressional Budget Office says about those guesses about future \namounts of money.\n  If I may indulge by setting one bit of background first, when the \nCongressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan staff for the Congress, \ndevelops their cost estimates, they base it on what the language of the \nbill is and how the bill needs to work in the future. They always \nprovide us with a 10-year cost. That is particularly important because\n\n[[Page S2185]]\n\nwe hear about the cost of the bill, and we assume that is all there is. \nThe truth is, there is a lot of cost that isn't calculated into the \nbill. When we hear about a bill that is $790 billion or $820 billion, \nthat is not the true cost.\n  I will give an example. One of the programs in the bill expands \nMedicaid. It is called the FMAP increase in Medicaid. That went through \nthe Finance Committee. For about 25 years, they calculate the cost of \nexpanding the eligibility for Medicaid. Then they simply assume, \nbecause the cost was getting to be too big, that it stops at that \npoint. For the rest of the 5 years for the 10-year total, in effect, \nthe program goes away. Everybody knows the program is not going away. \nOne program that is not going away is Medicaid. The eligible people on \nMedicaid are not going to suddenly be wiped off the program. Obviously, \nCongress will continue the program. What CBO had to do is calculate not \nonly the first-year cost or the 5-year cost but what will it cost over \n10 years. They have done the same thing with Head Start, Early Head \nStart, title I education--incidentally, there is something about all \nthese programs; they do not in any way create jobs or stimulate \neconomic growth, as they are social programs deemed to be a good thing \nbut having nothing to do with stimulus--the LIHEAP program, the \nNational Institutes of Health, COBRA insurance coverage, Medicaid, and \nother programs.\n  What CBO did was to take the House bill and calculate the true cost \nover the 10-year period. When one does that, it jumps from $820 billion \nto over $2.5 trillion. Then add in the interest payments on that amount \nwhich are about $744 billion. The total deficit impact, then, over the \n10-year period would be $3.27 trillion. Assume that the bill might be \nslightly less expensive than what CBO is estimating, it is still, \nobviously, going to be in the neighborhood of $3 trillion over 10 \nyears.\n  It is important to look at expenses over an extended period because, \nas the Senator noted, this is borrowed money. This is not money we have \ntoday. We are borrowing it. Therefore, the long-term consequences of \nthat borrowing are important. What the CBO also said was that by the \n10th year, we are actually going to be creating negative economic \ngrowth. The GDP will grow by between .1 and .3 of a percent less in the \nyear 2019 than it would if we hadn't even passed this bill.\n  I compare it to kids eating sugar. They get a sugar high. They have \nall kinds of energy for a while. But when they crash, we have seen what \nthat can be. While some of this might be stimulative early on, once the \nsugar high is gone, we are going to be left with the longer term \nconsequences. Over this 10-year period the CBO has to calculate, we are \ntalking about getting into negative economic growth, over $3 trillion \nin cost.\n  The question is, At that point, what is that going to do to our \neconomy? I don't think anybody can say it is good news. But it is the \nkind of thing we have been talking about, to think about the long-term \nconsequences of what we are doing. If one is gambling with a couple \nhundred million, that is one thing. Start gambling with $3 trillion, \none better be right. I don't think anybody can say, with any degree of \ncertainty, that what is in this legislation we can doggone guarantee is \ngoing to work and be worth the expenditure.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. As I listen to the Senator, what occurs to me is, we \nhave some laws about truth in labeling, truth in packaging. This bill \nwouldn't meet any definition I have ever seen. The whole argument for \nthis legislation is, we are in an economic downturn. We Republicans \nknow that. Americans are hurting. We feel that too. So we thought, what \ncan we do to help make a difference? The thought was, fix housing \nfirst. We suggested lower interest rate mortgages. We suggested, with \nthe leadership of Senator Isakson, a $15,000 tax credit for home buyers \nfor the next 2 years to create more demand to stabilize home values. \nThose ideas would have been actually stimulative. But most of the \nlegislation the Senator from Arizona talks about is very different. \nMedicaid would come up in the regular appropriations process.\n  As I am thinking about it, what has the Senator heard about one of \nthe aspects of this bill that would be actually stimulative, the one I \nmentioned, Senator Isakson's proposal for a tax credit of $15,000 for \nhome buyers, so that if they bought a home, they would get $15,000 off \ntheir taxes, cash in their pocket, as a way of stimulating the market? \nIs that in the compromise legislation?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, obviously, we don't \nknow because we haven't read it. But what my staff believes, from \ncontact they have had with other staff, is that in order to make room \nfor a bunch of other spending, that incentive program has been slashed. \nThe amount of money has at least been cut in half. The people eligible \nto take advantage of it have been narrowed to first-time home buyers. \nThere would be an income cap. I think now that CBO would score that \nsomewhere in the neighborhood of about $2 billion, meaning that the \nimpact of it on the economy could not be particularly significant.\n  May I mention one other thing, because it reminded me of another idea \nthat we had. We had a lot of good ideas because we wanted to make sure \nthis would work. We mentioned, several of us, the fact that 80 percent \nof the jobs are created by small business. So we looked in the bill to \nsee where the relief would be targeted to small businesses to encourage \nthem to hire more folks. When we finally found what was in there, it \namounted to .8 of 1 percent of all of tax provisions in here that could \nbe utilized by small business, hiring 80 percent of the jobs. Only .8 \nof 1 percent of the bill is dedicated to those kind of businesses as \ntax relief.\n  So when we talk about targeted, well, our idea of targeting relief \nobviously does not comport with the authors of the bill, and that is \nanother one of the real questions and concerns we have about this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, if I could ask the Senator from Arizona \none more question.\n  Over the last couple days, we have heard testimony from the Secretary \nof Treasury about the importance of moving now to help strengthen \nfinancial institutions so they can lend money, so people can buy cars, \nbuy homes, send their kids to college. We have heard about the \nimportance of the housing plan that is coming. We have heard numbers of \n$1 trillion, $2.5 trillion. We have had testimony from experts outside \nthe administration who have estimated that the so-called bad bank \noption for taking toxic assets out of banks might need $2 trillion and \nthat we ought to capitalize that bank at several hundred billion \ndollars.\n  I ask the Senator, is it possible, if we spend the whole piggy bank \non this so-called stimulus package, we will not have the dollars left \nto get the economy moving again by fixing housing and strengthening our \nfinancial institutions?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Tennessee, a friend \nof mine has a saying that probably applies here: You broke the code. \nThat is one of the big problems. We know we are going to need a massive \namount of money to deal with the housing problem and to deal with the \ncredit problem so when you go to the bank, they will have money to lend \nto you.\n  Because this so-called stimulus bill is taking so much borrowed \nmoney--well over a trillion dollars just in the first 2 years; $3 \ntrillion over 10 years--there is a real question about how much money \nwe can afford to spend on these other things that, as you note, are \nabsolutely critical. There will come a point in time when the people \nwho buy U.S. debt--primarily foreign governments and foreign entities \nnow--are going to believe we are so heavily in debt they are not going \nto trust our debt or be willing to give us as good a rate on that debt, \nthe result of which there will come a tipping point when we cannot \nafford to borrow anymore. By, in effect, wasting a lot of it on this \nstimulus bill, I think the Senator's question is exactly on point: Will \nwe have what is necessary when the real time comes?\n  If I could finish with an analogy. Some of my friends on the other \nside have said: Well, when the house is on fire, you just go put it \nout. You don't worry about how much water it takes or whatever. Well, \nthat is fine, unless the fire is going to spread to the second house \nand the third house and the fourth house. You better not waste all your \nwater on the first house. That is the essence of the question from the\n\n[[Page S2186]]\n\nSenator from Tennessee, and I think it is a very good point. I thank \nhim.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Or to put it another way: Don't dump the water out on \nthe street and fertilize the field if you need to throw it on the \nhouse.\n  Mr. KYL. Right.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. We have a limited amount of water, a limited amount of \nmoney. I note the Senator from Arizona as well as I both voted to give \nPresident Obama the money he needed to work on housing and to work on \nfinancial institutions, and we may have to do it again. So it is not \njust a matter of saying no to proposals; it is a matter of being \ngreatly disappointed this legislation is not targeted, is not \ntemporary.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is in the Chamber. He has been an \noutstanding spokesman on the importance of the stimulus legislation, \nhow to fashion that. I ask the Senator from Wyoming, as he looks at \nthis legislation--and I know we have not yet seen the entire \ncompromise--but how satisfied is he the legislation focuses on the \nproblem that will actually create new jobs for Americans in a short \nperiod of time?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Well, Mr. President, that is my biggest concern. I make \na point of getting home to Wyoming every weekend. I have been to \nWyoming just last weekend and the weekend before that and the weekend \nbefore that and this is what the people of Wyoming want to know. Is \nthis money going to be well spent? Are they going to get value for \ntheir taxpayer dollars?\n  Similar to the other Members of this body, I have not yet seen a copy \nof the final proposal. But I think the answer, from what I see of the \nlittle snippets, is the value is not there for taxpayers. In today's \nInvestor's Business Daily there is a front-page story, and the headline \nis ``Stimulus Bill Funds Programs Deemed `Ineffective' by OMB''--the \nOffice of Management and Budget. Stimulus bill funds programs deemed \nineffective.\n  Well, if they are going to be ineffective at stimulating the economy, \nmy question is: Why are they in a stimulus bill? The people at home get \nit right. This past Saturday I was at a Boys & Girls Clubs function. We \nhad 700 people trying to help our Positive Place For Kids in the \ncommunity, and many of them talked to me about this and said: We want \nto help. We want a program that will succeed. We need a program that \nwill help our Nation and will help our economy. But they say, every \ndollar you put into this that is not really targeted and timely--and \nthen, of course, temporary--every dollar that is spent that is not \nstimulating the economy is an extra dollar we or our kids or our \ngrandkids are going to owe to people from around the world--owe to the \nChinese, owe to others--and that is not the way to have a strong \neconomy for our Nation.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wonder if I might ask the Senator, he \nhas been especially effective as a spokesman for the importance of \nfixing housing first. Many of us, especially on this side, believe \nhousing got us into this mess and helping housing restart will get us \nout of the mess. Can you explain why there seems to be, in a nearly $1 \ntrillion bill, so little focus on housing?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Well, I think they did not focus where they should have \nput the focus, which is where we got into the problem in the first \nplace and that was housing. I believe this body said unanimously we \nneed to fix housing first, and we put in a significant amount of money: \na $15,000 tax credit, tax relief for people who buy a house, to get the \neconomy moving in the area that got us into the problem in the first \nplace. Then--while we have not seen the bill yet--that has been \nstripped away, I understand, in this new compromise between the House \nand the Senate, and they have taken billions out of it, to a very small \nnumber, where it is $8,000 for certain, limited numbers of first-time \nhome buyers.\n  So there is a significant decrease in dealing with housing. But there \nis money in for all sorts of other things that will not effectively \nhelp our economy, and that is what I have trouble with. I am looking \nfor something I can support, can vote for. President Clinton's economic \nadviser, Alice Rivlin, said there should be something much smaller, \nsomething that is targeted at the problem. Because, to me, this seems \nrushed. We are making rushed judgments on energy, education, health \ncare that, to me, do not belong in a stimulus package. We should be \nfocused on what got us into the problem in the first place. That, to \nme, is housing.\n  So we can go on about other problems I see with this legislation. \nPeople all say to me: Hey, how are you going to judge success? I say: \nWell, the American people are going to judge success. They will be the \nones to decide whether this will be a successful program. If people \nbelieve things are working and the Government is working for them, then \nterrific. But if the people of America feel the burden of this whole \npackage--the burden is on them with inflation, with increased taxes, \nwith less buying power, with more Government rules--well, then, the \npeople of America will judge this to not be a successful package.\n  But whether it is throwing water on a fire or breaking the piggy \nbank, the people of Wyoming think of this as we are using so much \nmoney, we are shooting all our bullets at once, and we are not going to \nhave any ammunition left over if we have to come after this again.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for \nhis leadership, especially as a spokesman on the importance of fixing \nhousing first, which we believe the American people have gotten that \nmessage, but apparently the majority writing this bill has not gotten \nthat message.\n  The Senator from South Dakota has arrived. He is vice chairman of the \nRepublican conference, one of the leaders, too, in this debate. I have \nheard him speak about the importance of this legislation for stimulus \nbeing temporary and targeted. Actually, to give credit where credit is \ndue, I believe we borrowed that phrase from the Speaker of the House, \nwho said last year that stimulus packages, programs to create jobs for \nthe American people, should meet the test of temporary, timely, and \ntargeted.\n  I ask the Senator from South Dakota, specifically in light of the \nMcCain amendment, which was offered--which you may want to describe--\nwhether he looks at this compromise which is coming our way as \ntemporary, timely, and targeted on the problem of creating jobs for \nAmericans?\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Tennessee \nyielding and the comments of my colleague from Wyoming in focusing this \ndebate where it should be, on things that are actually stimulus, that \nactually do create jobs in the economy, that actually do stimulate the \neconomy and create growth and economic opportunity for more Americans.\n  I would say to my colleague from Tennessee that there are lots of \nthings about this bill that do not meet that criteria, that do not meet \nthat definition. You used the phrase ``timely, targeted, and \ntemporary.'' I would argue that much of the substance of this bill is \nmuch different than that. In fact, it is slow, it is unfocused, and it \nis unending.\n  Again, we do not know exactly what is in it, unfortunately, because \nwe have yet to see the bill. All we know is it is going to be somewhere \nin the neighborhood of $800 billion in face amount. When you add in the \ninterest to that--some $350 billion--you are talking about almost $1.2 \ntrillion in obligations we are handing off to future generations.\n  I think whenever you talk about that, you need to make sure you are \nunderstanding what you are getting for that amount of investment and \nwhat that means to future generations. For example, a lot of people do \nnot realize or think about the debt we have today. The gross Federal \ndebt is $10.7 trillion. Now, that means that every man, woman, and \nchild in the United States owes approximately $35,000. That is their \npersonal part of the Federal debt. CBO projects the fiscal year 2009 \ndeficit to be $1.2 trillion before--before--any additional stimulus \nmeasures are considered. So when you start adding that in, the deficit \nas a percentage of our gross domestic product will be 10 percent, which \nis the highest level--the last time we saw that kind of a deficit-to-\nGDP ratio was back in 1945 when it was 8 percent. That is the amount of \ndebt we are talking about.\n  I heard my colleague from Tennessee say before that this generation \nof\n\n[[Page S2187]]\n\nAmericans will be the first generation of Americans who will not have \nthe same standard of living as their parents. If you think about what \nwe are doing, we are making matters much worse. We have a lot of young \npeople out there who do not have a voice in this debate. I would \ncharacterize them as the ``silent generation'' who are not going to be \nheard. Somebody needs to be their voice in this debate too. Somebody \nneeds to bring some rhyme or reason to what is happening here and hope \nwe can get something reasonable passed through the Senate that is \nfocused on job creation, that is temporary, that is targeted, that is \ntimely--all the things we have talked about should be but this bill is \nnot.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, if I could ask the Senator from South \nDakota: As I recall, Senator McCain offered one amendment which almost \nall of us voted for, which was very targeted and cost about $400 \nbillion, but he also offered another amendment which would have \nguaranteed that whatever was passed actually be temporary.\n  Mr. THUNE. Yes, that is correct. We had an opportunity to vote on a \nnumber of alternatives. The McCain alternative, which you and I both \nsupported, was one that, in my judgment, made a lot of sense because it \ngot you about twice the effectiveness, twice the job creation, at half \nthe cost.\n  It was focused, as you mentioned earlier, and as our colleague from \nWyoming mentioned, on the central issue of housing, which is so \ncritical to bringing our economy back on a pathway to recovery. It also \nfocused on tax relief for middle-income Americans and for small \nbusinesses which are responsible for creating most of the jobs in this \ncountry. It had an appropriate focus on infrastructure, which many of \nus agree is an area that can create jobs. It also had a trigger in \nthere, a hard trigger that said when you have two consecutive quarters \nof economic growth, the spending would cease or would terminate. In \nother words, when we start to get our way out of the recession, we \nwould actually bring some fiscal responsibility to this debate.\n  What troubles me about where we are going with this particular bill \nright now is it does not have that. In fact, much of the spending in \nhere is long term and extends well beyond the so-called period we are \nlooking at in terms of getting some stimulus into the economy. Many of \nthe commitments that are made, many of the obligations will be \nobligations we are going to experience for months and years to come. \nMuch of the spending in the bill is on what we call mandatory spending; \nin other words, spending that will be factored into the baseline and \nthat we are going to be responsible for going into the future.\n  Senator McCain's amendment would have addressed that issue. It would \nhave brought some fiscal responsibility to this proposal. \nUnfortunately, it was defeated. But that being said, there are lots of \nthings in here that still I think the average American, when they look \nat this, they will wonder: What is Washington doing, and why are they \nspending money on these sorts of things?\n  I am looking here at another proposal: $750 million for the \nreplacement of the Social Security Administration's National Computer \nCenter. Now, that is almost a billion dollars we are talking about, and \nyou have to ask the question: What does this do to create jobs? How is \nit that this in any way stimulates anything other than perhaps some \njobs in a government agency in Washington, DC? We have $2.5 billion to \nturn Federal buildings into green buildings; $1 billion for the U.S. \nCensus; $850 million in new subsidies for Amtrak; $650 million in \nadditional funds for digital TV conversion boxes; $645 million for new \nand repaired facilities at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration; $448 million for the headquarters of the Department of \nHomeland Security in Washington; $300 million for new cars for \ngovernment workers; $228 million to the State Department for \ninformation technology upgrades; $125 million for the Washington, DC, \nsewer system; $20 million for the removal of fish barriers. These are \nall things that are included. I forgot this one: $3 million tax benefit \nfor golf carts, electric motorcycles, and ATVs, provided they don't \nexceed 25 miles per hour. These are all things that are in this \nlegislation, and I think it would be very hard to convince the majority \nof the American people these have anything to do with stimulus.\n\n  Furthermore, as the Senator from Tennessee has very appropriately \npointed out on many occasions, with some of the spending in here, what \nthe States are asking for in terms of assistance--because many of them \nhave shortfalls in their budget. My State is an example of Medicaid now \nconstituting a bigger portion of our State's budget. It was 15.83 \npercent of the State's budget in 2000, and in 2008 it was 23.33 percent \nof the budget--a dramatic increase. What we are talking about is \nsending a lot more money out there. I have heard the Senator from \nTennessee talk about it as the States asking for a life raft, and we \nare sending them the yacht from Washington, DC--\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. And we are going down to the bank and borrowing the \nmoney in their name?\n  Mr. THUNE.--to do it, almost eight times the amount of money they \nwould need just to cover additional enrollment due to the downturn. \nEight times the amount the States would need to get that done is what \nwe are going to be shipping out there and, as the Senator from \nTennessee mentioned, borrowing from future generations and piling on to \nthat $35,000 that every man, woman, and child in America already owes \nas their part or their share of the Federal debt.\n  This is a very bad direction, in my view, to be heading for the \ncountry. I think we have had some opportunities to improve the bill, to \nmake it better. We have had some alternatives offered. The McCain \nalternative which the Senator mentioned was one that I think, again, \nwas very well balanced, focused on housing and tax relief and \ninfrastructure and had the kind of fiscal responsibility and discipline \nin it that makes sure a lot of the spending doesn't go on ad \ninfinitum--forever.\n  So I would concur with the points and the arguments that have been \nmade by my colleague from Tennessee and say that we ought to be \nthinking not just about today but about the next generation because we \nhave always had a history in this country--for 200 years Americans have \nsacrificed to make the next generation's lives better, to create a \nbetter life for our children and grandchildren. We are asking our \nchildren and grandchildren to sacrifice for us. That is a reversal of \n200 years of American history. For generation after generation after \ngeneration, we have attempted to build a better, brighter, more \nprosperous future for our children and grandchildren. What we are \nessentially asking them to do is to loan us $1 trillion to do these \nthings--some of which I mentioned and that I think are just completely \noutside the realm of anything that fits within the mission of job \ncreation or stimulating the economy--at enormous cost to them because \nit is going to pile additional debt on top of the $35,000 they already \nowe, their share of the Federal debt we have today.\n  So I hope in the end people will come to the realization that this is \na mistake and that we will see the necessary votes to defeat it and \nperhaps go back to the drawing board and put something together that \nreally does, in fact, address the fundamental problem we are facing in \nthe country right now, to get the focus back on housing, to get the \nfocus back on the American people and families and small businesses, \nand to make sure we are doing it in a fiscally responsible way.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from South Dakota. I imagine my 30 \nminutes has expired, but seeing none of my colleagues, I ask unanimous \nconsent for up to 10 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota \nfor his eloquent words. The numbers being thrown around are so huge--\nand numbers get thrown around so often in Washington, DC--that it is \nsometimes hard to distinguish between $1 million and $1 trillion or $1 \nbillion or $10.\n  One thing I was thinking of as the Senator from South Dakota was \nspeaking, I believe he said as much as 10 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct of the United States would be the size of this year's Federal \ndeficit. What that means is, this country--even in these\n\n[[Page S2188]]\n\nbad times--is such a marvelous country that we will produce about 25 \npercent of all of the money in the world just for Americans, 5 percent \nof the people in the world. So what we are saying is, just this year we \nare going to run up a debt of 10 percent of 25 percent of all of the \nmoney in the world and add it to the national debt we already have and \nwhich we already know we are going to be increasing because of the \nresponsibilities we have to try to help fix housing and encourage the \nfinancial institutions to support the efforts that the President is \nmaking to get the economy moving again.\n  What we are asking is, why would we spend the whole piggybank on a $1 \ntrillion piece of legislation that isn't targeted to create jobs when \nwe have so many other pressing responsibilities for this limited amount \nof borrowed money--namely, fixing housing and getting lending moving \nagain? That is where we would put our attention. So we have a lot of \nquestions about the bill.\n  As the Senator from South Dakota said, Republicans offered our \nlegislation, which was voted down, and it focused on housing, it \nfocused on letting people keep more of their own money and on a limited \namount of spending for targeted, job-creating infrastructure projects. \nThat saved $500 or $600 billion which could have been reserved for \nhousing, for lending, or to reduce the debt. But this bill, I am \nafraid--and we will know more about it as it comes--is mostly spending \ninstead of mostly stimulus. Not enough of the jobs come quickly enough \nto make as much difference as this borrowed money should make. Even \nmost of the tax cuts in the bill aren't stimulative. They may be \nwelcome, they may leave 13 more dollars in your paycheck each week. But \nis running up the debt this much more worth that? This is a lot of \nmoney--according to one report, more than the Federal Government spent \nin the entire New Deal, more than we spent in Iraq, more than we spent \nin Afghanistan, and we should spend this money carefully.\n  As the Senators from South Dakota and Arizona have pointed out, what \nhappens after 2 years? The Senate rejected our amendment that said once \nthe economy recovers, the new spending stops so we don't continue to \nrun up an unimaginable debt.\n  States are having trouble and in a shortfall. Tennessee has a $900 \nmillion shortfall this year. But we are sending Tennessee, according to \nthe latest estimates--even with the cuts and the compromise--about $3.8 \nbillion. We are establishing policy without even thinking about it. In \nthis legislation, which has never been to the authorization committees, \nwe are having possibly the largest, I believe, Federal education bill \nin our history in terms of dollars. We are having one of the largest \nhealth care bills. We are having one of the largest energy bills. That \nis not the way we make energy, education, and health care policy--just \nby passing an appropriations bill with a huge amount of money.\n  We are very disappointed about the lack of bipartisanship. We respect \nour new President. We want him to succeed because if he succeeds, our \ncountry succeeds. We expected that in this first major piece of \nlegislation, a number of us would sit down on both sides of the aisle \nand compare our notes and say: Let's go forward. We know the Democrats \nhave the majority and we have the minority, and so more of their ideas \nare going to be included than more of our ideas, but 58 Democrats and 3 \nRepublicans is not a bipartisan effort. That is not the way we do \nthings around here.\n\n  The way we do things in a bipartisan way around here is when we had \nthe Energy bill in 2005 and Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman \nworked side by side. All ideas were considered. We had our votes. It \ntook weeks and we got a big result. Another example is when we passed \nthe America COMPETES Act and we worked side by side, or even with a \ncontentious area such as intelligence surveillance when Senator Bond \nand Senator Rockefeller worked side by side and we came to a conclusion \ntogether. The American people gained more confidence in what we could \ndo and in the result that we came to. I am afraid in this case we have \nnot had that kind of bipartisanship.\n  What I fear is that this is not a good sign for the future because \nthis is the easy piece of legislation. This is the first major proposal \nfrom the President. This is just a spending bill, albeit a massive \nspending bill. Next comes health care and controlling entitlements and \nwhether we want to authorize more money to take bad assets out of banks \nand to help housing. Next comes whether we want to pass this version of \nclimate change or that version of climate change. All of these are \ndifficult pieces of legislation.\n  I have said on this floor before that President Bush technically did \nnot have to have broad-based congressional support to wage the war in \nIraq because he was the Commander in Chief. So he went ahead, and it \nmade the war more difficult. It made his Presidency less successful. \n``We won the election, we will write the bill'' is not a recipe for \nresolving a difficult problem or for a successful Presidency.\n  I would hope we can either do as the South Dakota Senator said, which \nis start over again on this bill and retarget it, make it temporary, \nmake it timely, and save hundreds of billions of dollars while focusing \non housing and lending. That somehow we can get the Congress on track \nwith the President so that when we say bipartisan, we do bipartisan, \nand we don't have an attitude that says, in effect: We won the \nelection; we will write the bill.\n  Unless the Senator from South Dakota has additional comments--I am \nfinished with mine, so I yield the floor and yield to him.\n  Mr. THUNE. Who controls the time, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Senators are authorized to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to use up to that \namount of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Again, to my colleague from Tennessee, I thank him for his \nleadership on this issue and particularly for bringing to the forefront \nof the debate the housing issue which, as so many have mentioned \nalready, really is an integral, essential part of the solution. If we \ndon't deal with that, then I think we are not going to be able to lead \nour country out of the recession. I don't think anybody will dispute \nthe fact that housing played a very important role in where we are \ntoday, and I think trying to recover is going to require a good amount \nof focus and attention on that issue which, in this bill, is very \nlight. In fact, if you look at what is included in the bill--let me \nsee--1 percent of the Senate bill goes toward fixing housing. Even the \n$15,000 new home buyer credit that was reportedly cut in half in the \nfinal version of the bill, I am told--and I don't know the answer to \nthis because I have not seen the final bill, nor, I don't think, have \nany of us seen the details in it--that entire housing tax credit may, \nin fact, be gone which would eliminate any commitment to helping to \nrepair that aspect of our economy--the housing sector of the economy--\nwhich I think is going to be so important in helping us to recover.\n  So 1 percent of the Senate bill goes toward housing currently, 2.3 \npercent of the Senate bill goes toward small business tax relief, and, \nas I mentioned before, small businesses create two-thirds or three-\nfourths of all of the new jobs in our economy. It seems to me at least \nthat ought to be a very proper and important focus of this legislation.\n  Of course, some of the alternatives we voted on last week, one of \nwhich was the McCain alternative which we referenced earlier, did \ninclude a significant amount of incentive for small businesses to \ninvest and to create jobs. I offered a couple of tax amendments to a \ncouple of alternatives to the bill which really did focus on tax relief \nfor middle-income families and for small businesses. That, of course, \nwas defeated as well.\n  I guess my point is, the bill as we have it in front of us is going \nto be very much oriented toward spending, and spending on government \nprograms and spending which, in many cases, doesn't go away; that isn't \ntemporary, that, in fact, makes obligations and commitments and \nliabilities well into the future. We talked about up to about $200 \nbillion of funding in the bill being what we call mandatory spending; \nin other words, spending that is built into the baseline, that isn't \ntemporary, and it is hard to see how that\n\n[[Page S2189]]\n\nfits into the definition of temporary, targeted, and timely, which was \nthe criteria that was set out by the President and by the Democratic \nleadership in developing this bill in the first place.\n  The Senator from Tennessee, when he touched upon the amount of money \nhis State of Tennessee will receive and what the State's need is--and I \nwould repeat what I said earlier, that under this bill, we are not \ngiving States what they have estimated their amount is to cover the \nincreased Medicaid enrollment due to the economic downturn.\n  We are giving them--if you can believe this--almost eight times the \namount of money they would need to cover additional enrollment due to \nthe economic downturn. Why? States, of course, aren't going to refuse \nit. Which Governor out there will turn down additional resources? It is \nestimated that States would need about $11 billion in additional \nfunding to cover enrollment-driven growth in State Medicaid Programs.\n  Under this bill, we provide $87 billion with absolutely no strings \nattached and no requirements that States get their own spending and \nfraud and abuse under control. I hope we have pointed out--and we will \ncontinue to point out--the ways in which the funding under this bill is \nbeing spent. Again, I mention some of the particular earmarks here, \nmuch of which go to Government agencies: $20 million for the removal of \nfish barriers; $300 million for new cars for Government workers; $645 \nmillion for new and repaired facilities at the NOAA; and $750 million \nfor the new computer center for the Social Security Administration.\n  It is hard to argue that these things are stimulus. Perhaps they are \nneeded and, in fact, perhaps ought to be debated, but it ought to be \ndone in the regular order, handled through the normal annual \nappropriations process, not included in a bill that is being sold to \nthe American people as stimulating the economy and creating jobs. There \nis little in here I can see that meets that definition.\n  I want to make a final point with regard to the whole issue of job \ncreation, because the CBO, in a letter dated February 11, 2009, clearly \ndescribes the false economic theories behind this Government spending \nbill. The CBO letter encompasses the majority of the economists' views \non this legislation. Specifically, the letter states that beyond the \nyear 2014, this legislation is estimated to reduce gross domestic \nproduct by up to two-tenths of 1 percent. The reduction in GDP is \ntherefore estimated to be reflected in lower wages, rather than lower \nemployment. Workers will be less productive because the capital stock \nis smaller. The legislation's long-run impact on output also would \ndepend on whether it permanently changed incentives to work or save. \nThe legislation would not have any significant permanent effects on \nthose incentives.\n  Those are quotes from the CBO letter that came out last week. Even \nthe most optimistic CBO projection states that long-run GDP growth will \nincrease by zero percent. Even the most optimistic projection is built \non an assumption that all of the relevant investments, on average, \nwould add as much to output as would a comparable amount of private \ninvestment.\n  The Government spending included in the House and Senate bills \ndoesn't change GDP at all due to Government spending crowding out \nprivate investment.\n  Most of us would agree--I think most of us on this side would agree--\nthat we are much better served in terms of creating economic growth and \njobs, in seeing that the jobs are created in the private sector, and \nthat we are providing the necessary incentives for investments in new \njobs. This bill is very light on the types of incentives that would \nlead small businesses to go out and invest and do the sorts of things \nthat actually will create jobs and help us recover and build a better \nand more prosperous future for our children and grandchildren which, as \nI said earlier, in my view, is in serious jeopardy because of this \nlegislation--primarily because of the enormous amount of borrowing it \nincludes and how much it adds to the debt for every man, woman, and \nchild in America, and $35,000 is that share of the debt. Under this \nbill, that would grow $2,700 per every man, woman, and child in \nAmerica.\n  What we are doing to future generations is wrong, it is not fair to \nthem. This Government needs to learn to live within its means. We need \nto think about building and sacrificing so that our children and \ngrandchildren and future generations will have a brighter future. That \nis the way it has always been in this country. It is part of our \nculture and ethic that we work hard and sacrifice so that future \ngenerations can have a brighter and better future. This completely \nturns that whole history, that legacy, we have as a nation on its head \nby asking future generations to sacrifice for us. That is the wrong \nthing to do.\n  I hope we will reject this legislation and go back to the drawing \nboard and do something that is effective and creates jobs and does work \nand will give the American taxpayer a good return on their investment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues and \ndiscuss the spending package that will be back in front of us--the $800 \nbillion but, with interest, probably $1.2 trillion, which will be in \nthe package, and it will all be borrowed--every cent of it. We don't \nhave that money presently. So we are going to be borrowing it to do \nthis.\n  A couple of things strike me. One, we learned last fall--and there is \nan old saying that is true in government and certainly with individuals \nas well, which is ``haste makes waste.'' I grew up with that saying. \nPeople say, look, if you hurry at this and you don't get it right, you \nare going to have to do it again. We saw that last fall with TARP. We \nput in $750 billion because they said we have to do it now and we have \nto do it fast. But at the end of the day, that haste made waste. The \nTreasury Department went pillar to post, saying we are going to do this \nor we are going to do that, and they ended up spending the money. Now \nwe are looking at TARP II and the banks still need help. I have a lot \nof people back home saying: What happened to the first hundreds of \nbillions of dollars you gave the banks? Haste makes waste. We saw it \nthen.\n  There is no reason for us to rush to get this wrong on the stimulus \npackage. Yes, we need a stimulus package. My State needs a stimulus \npackage. This country needs it. We need a stimulus package, not a \nspending bill. If we slow down a little bit--I think we should refer \nthis back to the Committees on Finance and the Appropriations and put a \nrequirement on it that every dollar spent must yield at least $1.50 in \neconomic activity over and above what is spent.\n  We should make it a stimulus bill, not a spending bill. We have not \ndone that. We are hastily putting this forward. I believe, tragically, \nwe will be wastefully putting it out. There will be a number of \nprograms that can use the funds, I have no doubt about that. But if the \ntarget is to get this economy off its knees and moving forward, we have \nto hit that target and not a multiple set of targets, and not a set of \nspending targets that are not stimulative in nature.\n  There is another saying that President Reagan was fond of using, and \nit was that there is nothing so permanent as a temporary Government \nprogram. That was his experience and it has been mine as well. Once \nsomething gets started, it is hard to stop, because it gets a \nconstituency built up around it, and people build up their expectations \nand infrastructure around it. When you go to eliminate it once it has \nstarted, it is like, wait a minute, now this has a multiplier impact on \na broader cross-section of individuals. That is why there is nothing so \npermanent as a temporary Government program.\n  I think that is probably why some people are looking at starting \nthings under the guise of stimulus that are, in actuality, starting new \nFederal spending programs with the hope that infrastructure builds up \naround it and in future years, when it goes to be cut, people will say \nyou cannot do this because it will have this multiplier impact. That is \nthe history of the Federal Government and its growth.\n  According to a CBO analysis, if most of the new spending programs \nenacted under the proposed stimulus were to become long-term spending \nprograms--and that is our history and what we have seen in the past--\nthe cost of the\n\n[[Page S2190]]\n\nstimulus package would rise to $2.5 trillion over the next decade, and \n$3.3 trillion if you include interest payments on that debt. We are \nborrowing every cent. You are looking at long-term spending in the $3.3 \ntrillion category. If you do and you look at a rough outline of this, \nyou are going to move the Federal Government from about 20 percent of \nthe economy, which it has been, up to 25 and possibly 30 percent of the \neconomy. At what time do you come to the tipping point? And that is \nbefore you add in the baby boomers retiring and the increased costs in \nMedicare, and when that baby boomer generation is retired and using the \nGovernment programs instead of paying into them. You will get to a \ntipping point where people cannot afford the tax structure that is \nneeded underneath that. That is not wise for us to do.\n  In this stimulus bill, we will take the Federal debt in private hands \nrelative to our gross domestic product from below 40 percent of GDP to \nmove it well over 60 percent of GDP. So that will be like saying I have \na job and I make $100,000 a year, and I borrowed $40,000 that I am \npaying on, and now I am going to jump it to $60,000. You are looking at \nthat in this soft economy and saying, is that a smart thing to do? Most \npeople would say, no, that is not the right thing to do. You want to \ntry to stimulate things, not harm them.\n  Finally is this thought: I don't believe that hastily constructed \nbills such as this one being sold as stimulative is a plan to help our \neconomy weather this recession. It strikes me as a highly leveraged, \nspeculative bet on larger Government and massive long-term spending as \na cure to our economic woes. We have seen what the aftermath of highly \nleveraged speculative bets can bring. That is what we have gotten into \nin the first place, where you have had highly speculative leveraged \nevents taking place in the housing market and expanding into credit \ncard use, into automobile loans. A number of homes were bought with 100 \nor 110 percent borrowing, and they thought the appreciation would pay \nfor that. Those were completely leveraged events. That doesn't bring \neconomic prosperity; it brings bubbles. I don't think you are even \ngoing to see that with this one. You are going to see long-term costs. \nWe are going to see speculative debt with the Government using our \nchildren as leverage. Is that the way we want to go?\n\n  Clearly, the people in my State believe no, and they believe we need \na stimulus package, and that we need to work together on a bipartisan \npackage. We should take it through the regular order, through the \nAppropriations Committee and the Finance Committee, and hold hearings \non it, look at what actually works, set a criteria on this. When we had \nthis very rapid, hastily put together TARP legislation--and everybody \nis mad about that now--we didn't hold hearings on it. We did it quickly \nand in closed sessions. Out pops the package, and now we are back at \nit. I think we will be back at this one also if we don't do what we \nneed to do. But only our ammo box will be empty. We are not going to \nhave anything in it, because haste makes waste. We rush out there \ntrying to get it done and we don't work the process and work together \non it. We are not going to hit the target and that will be sad for the \nAmerican public.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there has been a generous amount of \ndiscussion on the floor today about the economic recovery package that \nhas been put together and about the dire conditions of our economy. If \nyou listen, they have been described in so many different ways--\nfinancial crisis, deep recession, economic trouble, a wreck, a dire \ncondition--and I suspect almost anybody who has been experiencing \ntrouble in the workplace as a result of this rather steep economic \ndecline would understand all of those terms.\n  I have been listening to the debate on the floor of the Senate, and I \nhad to come to see if we could add a little clarity to what has caused \nall this. It is pretty hard to describe a remedy unless you understand \nwhat has caused it.\n  I understand from a lot of discussion a bit ago that there are a lot \nof people who don't want to do anything or they want to do something \nmuch less or they are not sure. In any event, I was thinking of how \nmany people in the Senate lined up to help the banks. The Treasury \nSecretary said we have to pass legislation to help the big Wall Street \nbanks. He said we have to pass a 3-page bill in 3 days for $750 \nbillion. Boy, there was a big-old traffic jam trying to get up here to \nthe well to vote in favor of that legislation, helping out all the big \nbanks with hundreds of billions of dollars. Now we are talking about \nhelping someone else out, helping out folks who need jobs, and all of a \nsudden, there is a big problem. Mr. President, $700 billion to bail out \nbig banks and steer this economy in the ditch--that is OK, big traffic \njam to do that, but some money to help put people get back on payrolls, \nno, that is deficit spending, we are told.\n  I showed this chart the other day on the floor of the Senate. There \nwere 35 jobs available in Miami for firefighters, and 1,000 people \nshowed up on the sidewalk and lined up to apply.\n  For some, it may be easy to come to the floor of the Senate and talk \nabout the 598,000 people who lost their jobs last month, the 1 million \npeople who lost their jobs in the last 2 months, and the 3.6 million \npeople who lost their jobs since this recession began. But name 1, name \n10, name 1,000, name 1 million or look at their picture and see the \nfaces of people who want to work but cannot because they were told \ntheir jobs no longer exist. Then ask whether this is important, and ask \nyourself: What are you going to do about it? What do you think the \nremedy is? What do you think the priority ought to be with respect to \nputting people, such as these people, back to work: giving them an \nopportunity with a job or lining up in the well of the Senate to say to \nthe big banks: Here I come; here is $700 billion. Big difference, in my \njudgment.\n  The difficulties we face in this country today are not some natural \ndisaster. This is not Hurricane Katrina that came raging through our \ncountry. This is not some disaster over which we had no control. This \nis an economy which is collapsing and has very serious trouble as a \nresult of specific things that have been done that have been \nirresponsible.\n  How on Earth do you describe a solution unless you are willing to \nadmit what has caused it? Let me go through some of it. It is not a \nquestion of pointing fingers, it is just a matter of deciding, let's be \nstraight about where we are and how we got here. They will write in the \nhistory books about this era and this age. We studied the Gay Nineties. \nWe studied the Roaring Twenties. Somebody will study this age, this age \nof excess, this carnival of greed in the history books in the future.\n  So how did we get here? Let me describe it by saying we got, in my \njudgment, several fundamentally flawed policy changes that happened \nover a long period of time.\n  Trade. First of all, you cannot suggest this problem we have does not \nlay right on the doorstep of those who have allowed this trade deficit \nin this country to rise to $700 billion to $800 billion a year, buying \n$2 billion more each day than we sell abroad and racking up a giant \ndeficit for this country that we must repay to other countries. Most of \nthe Members of this body have been perfectly willing to be brain dead \non that subject for a long time. Trade doesn't matter, the deficits \ndon't count. Don't worry about jobs going overseas, don't worry about \nunfair trade agreements, just ignore it and just keep chanting about \nfree trade. That is one big mistake that has been made for a very long \ntime and no more so than during the past 8 years of the past \nadministration.\n  With a trade deficit of $700 billion to $800 billion a year, add to \nthat budget deficits. I know what they say about the budget deficit in \nthe newspaper. OMB puts out a number. I think the\n\n[[Page S2191]]\n\nlast administration said it is some $450 billion. That is not true at \nall. It is not $450 billion. The question is how much did we have to \nborrow last year. That is the impact. It is between $700 billion and \n$800 billion, even more depending on whose counting. So with an economy \nof $14 trillion or so, a $700 billion to $800 billion trade deficit, a \nbudget deficit of somewhere around $700 billion to $800 billion, that \nis 10-percent or so indebtedness in 1 single year.\n  But it is not just the fact we have this budget deficit that has been \nso out of whack ever since the last administration took office--and by \nthe way, they inherited a budget surplus. We had a big debate on the \nfloor of the Senate, and those now saying: Let's not do much to remedy \nthis economy, were standing on the floor of the Senate saying: We want \nto get rid of the budget surplus; we want very big tax cuts for a very \nlong time, most of which will go to the very wealthy. Some of us said: \nLet's be careful, let's be conservative. No. Katy, bar the door. They \npassed their legislation. We ran into very big budget deficits in a \nvery big hurry.\n  Trade deficits, budget deficits--and by the way, a budget deficit \nthat was, in part, constructed by deciding to fight a war and not \npaying for it. Can you imagine, fighting a war and saying we are going \nto charge every penny. We say to the American people: You go shopping. \nThat is what President Bush said: Your job is to go shopping. We are \ngoing to fight this war. We are going to spend $10 billion, $12 billion \na month, and we don't intend to pay a penny of it. Some of us who \nwanted to pay for part of it were told: We will veto the legislation if \nyou try. He said: I will veto the legislation if you try.\n  Trade deficits and budget deficits have weighed this economy down in \na very significant way. And the very folks who have come today to talk \nabout spending and deficits are the ones who supported all along a \nfiscal policy that created the most significant budget deficits in the \nhistory of this country.\n  Those are not the only two things. They are significant--trade \ndeficit, a budget deficit, reckless fiscal policy. They are \nsignificant, but something else happened, something very significant, \nand I talked about it frequently on the floor of the Senate. The same \npeople who are so concerned about these issues now joined forces to \nsay: You know what, we need to modernize America's banking system. It \nis way old-fashioned, way out of date. We put in place all kinds of \nthings since the Great Depression to prevent banks from being \nmodernized, and we need to have one-stop shopping. We need to let banks \nget involved in real estate investments again. We need banks to get \ninvolved in securities investments again. And so they passed--yes, the \nCongress did; incidentally, there was bipartisan support for it--a \npiece of legislation called the Financial Services Modernization Act. \nIt got rid of old-fashioned things that were put in place after the \nGreat Depression and helped create the big bank holding companies that \ncould get involved in securities, real estate, and all kinds of risk \nventures attached to banking which we had prevented for 80 years.\n  All of a sudden, we saw the pyramid created, the big holding \ncompanies, and it was Katy, bar the door. What we saw was the buildup \nof unbelievable leveraged debt in these institutions and a substantial \namount of risk brought into America's banking system.\n  Almost immediately, that system allowed greed to permeate. Here is \nhow it manifested itself in one significant part of the contributor to \nthis economic malaise, and that is the housing bubble and the subprime \nloan scandal. I have spoken about it at great length--I am sure people \nare tired of hearing it--the subprime loan scandal. We know people who \nwere cold-called by brokers to say: We know you are paying a 7-percent \ninterest rate. We will give you a 2-percent interest rate, and by the \nway, you don't have to pay any principal; 2-percent interest rate and \nno principal, and you don't have to document your income to us. No-doc \nloan, no principal, 2-percent rate. They put people in subprime loans \nnot telling or emphasizing that it is going to reset in 2 years to 10 \npercent or 11 percent and you can't prepay because there is a \nprepayment penalty for doing it.\n\n  They larded up a whole lot of securities because they wrapped these \ninto securities with bad loans, bad mortgages, and then sold them \nupstream to mortgage banks, hedge funds, investment banks. They were \nall fat and happy, and that included the rating agencies that would \ntake a look at that security and say: That is a good security; that is \nAAA. They were all in on the take. By ``the take,'' I mean infected \nwith greed. So we had the housing bubble. We had all of these mortgages \nout there.\n  Consider this: A $14,000-a-year strawberry picker buying a $720,000 \nhome placed by a broker who got a big bonus for placing the mortgage \nwithout any chance of that person being able to make payments. But that \nmortgage then becomes a mortgage wrapped into a security sold to a \nhedge fund, rated as a security as AAA, sold to an investment bank. Now \nall of a sudden you have brokers who are happy because they are making \nmassive amounts of money; you have the mortgage banks, they love it, \nthey are making lots of money; hedge funds, they are making so much \nmoney they can't count it.\n  By the way, the top hedge fund manager a year and a half ago earned \n$3.7 billion. By my calculation, that is $300 million a month, about \n$10 million a day.\n  Honey, how are you doing at work?\n  I am doing pretty well, $10 million a day. I make as much in 3 \nminutes as the average American worker does in a year.\n  They were all happy, all making massive amounts of money. The problem \nis, they built a pyramid. The scheme of this pyramid is not much \ndifferent from Mr. Madoff, who apparently allegedly got away with a $50 \nbillion Ponzi scheme. This scheme was not much different. All of a \nsudden, it began to collapse.\n  Huge trade debt, big federal debt, reckless fiscal policy, fighting a \nwar and not paying for it, charging every penny, in fact, insisting on \ncontinuing tax cuts even during the war, and then this unbelievable \nbanking scandal by removing the protections that existed since the \nGreat Depression and saying to the big banks: You can create holding \ncompanies, you can attach risk, such as securities and other issues, \nand it will be just fine. You can do that. And so they did. All of it \nwas built on leverage--trade debt, budget debt, leverage debt in the \nprivate sector, almost unparalleled in the history of this country. \nThen the tent pole began to come down. All of a sudden, we discover a \nvery serious problem.\n  To describe how significant the money that was being paid was, there \nwas a discussion in the last couple of days in the Congress about maybe \ndoing what President Obama suggested; that is, to those big companies \nthat got bailout funds, for the top 25 people in those companies, their \ncompensation should be limited to half a million dollars a year. It is \ninteresting, when they tried to do that, my understanding is there was \na budget cost to that of something close to $10 billion. Why would \nthere be a budget cost? Because they were all making so much money that \nthe income tax they would pay as a result of that money was so \nsignificant that you had a $10 billion budget cost if you limited the \nincome of the top people on Wall Street in these firms to $500,000 a \nyear. That is almost unbelievable to me. But having done some work to \nstudy how much income exists in those areas, that is exactly true.\n  There was an investigative story in the Washington Post about the \nfailure of one of the largest investment banks. They described the top \ntrader in that organization, a person trading securities and the person \nwho was in charge of risk management. It turns out they carpooled every \nday from Connecticut to New York. It wasn't very hard to have the top \ntrader deal with his best friend risk manager and get things done \npretty easily. The top trader, they said, was making $20 million to $30 \nmillion a year. So that company turns out to be loaded with toxic \nassets, as were most of the other institutions engaged in exactly the \nsame business because they were making so much money.\n  Now we are told the taxpayers have to come to the rescue of these \nbanking institutions. So $700 billion has been voted in what is called \nthe Troubled Asset Relief Program, TARP. I did not support that \nlegislation. I didn't think\n\n[[Page S2192]]\n\nthe Treasury Secretary had the foggiest idea what he was doing, and I \nthink history shows that to be the case.\n  But one of the questions I think needs to be asked at this moment, \nis: Is there a requirement that we bail out these specific banks? Is \nthat some divine right of existing institutions, to come to the \nGovernment to say: We are in trouble, you need to help us. Well, what \nhas happened is the Government has allowed them to become so big they \nare referred to as being too big to fail. That is an actual specific \ncategory at the Federal Reserve Board--too big to fail. Despite the \nfact that they are bailing them out, our Government--the Federal \nReserve Board and the Treasury, which have said these institutions are \ntoo big to fail, and have in fact failed and need taxpayer money to \nbail them out--our Government is actually pursuing mergers to make them \nbigger. It is unbelievably ignorant, in my judgment, as a policy \nmatter. But I think it is important for us to ask some basic questions \nhere. Do we care about too big to fail; and should we, at some point, \ndecide to take apart those institutions and create different entities, \nsmaller institutions?\n  I understand we can't tomorrow decide there will not be any major \nbanking institutions in this country. Our country can't function like \nthat. Credit is critical to every business in this country. I know many \nprofitable Main Street businesses that are having great difficulty \nfinding credit from established credit sources they have had for \ndecades. So I understand the urgency and the need for credit from \nbanking institutions. My only observation is this: If we are pushing \n$700 billion after failed institutions in order to try to make them \nwell, even as we are saying to them, we want you to become bigger, and \nwhen, in fact, they are already too big to fail, I am saying that \ndoesn't add up to me. I think maybe we should have a discussion here in \nthis Congress about whether there is some inherent right to preserve \ninstitutions, or whether those that are too big to fail should be \nperhaps taken apart and create institutions that will better serve this \ncountry's interest.\n  Now, some say there are only two choices in the future as we try to \ntake a look at financial reform. And by the way, there is very little \naction on that at this point, and I believe it ought to go concurrent \nwith all the discussion about trying to put people back to work and so \non. But it seems to me the two choices are: You go back to a world in \nwhich you had Glass-Steagall and separation of banks from other \ninherently risky things, such as securities and real estate. And I \nbelieve we should do that. That means banks essentially become very \nmuch like a utility. That is the way it was. They were regulated, but \ngenerally performing traditional banking functions and making money. \nThen risky enterprises are over here, regulated in a different way but \nnonetheless able to engage in substantial amounts of risk with \nsecurities, real estate, and other items.\n  We have to make that choice, and the sooner the better. I think to \nignore that is to suggest, as some are now doing, that what we are \ngoing to do is we are going to have taxpayer money chase current \ninstitutions that have failed, and perhaps even make them bigger when \nthey are already too big to fail. That makes no sense to me at all.\n  And that brings me to this issue today of the economic recovery plan \nthat has been negotiated. I don't think anyone comes willingly to this \neither starting line or finish line with this kind of a plan to say, I \nam pleased to be here. But I do think this: I see all of the energy of \npeople who rush to try to help the big banks with $700 billion, and \nthen see so much concern about trying to help people who are out of \nwork, and I say: Wait a second; maybe we have our priorities wrong \nhere. I believe that the economic engine in this country works best \nwhen people have something to work with, when American families have a \njob to go to, a job that pays well and allows them to take care of \ntheir family. I think that is a percolating-up kind of strategy with \nthe economic engine, and I think it is perfectly appropriate and \nimportant. In fact, I think it is essential for us to worry about \ntrying to put people back to work during a very deep recession.\n  No one can say that what happened last month doesn't matter. You \ncan't say that 598,000 people coming home at night and telling their \nloved ones they lost their job doesn't matter to this place. If it \nmattered to this place that the biggest banks in the country were \nhaving some difficulty, and they had to get $700 billion, why doesn't \nit matter that we care a little bit about the people who lined up in \nMiami, FL, a thousand of them, trying to get a little shot at 35 \nfirefighting jobs? This too ought to matter. It is not unfair, as some \nhave suggested last week when I showed this chart, and said I was \nplaying on sympathy. This isn't sympathy. This is reality. Isn't it \nimportant that we talk a little about reality and a little less about \ntheory here in the Chamber of the Senate? The fact is these people got \nup, stood in line, because they need a job, and we ought to be able to \ndo something about that, to try to put people back to work and give \nthis economy a lift.\n  I think it is pretty clear that no one knows exactly what the \nmedicine is or the menu is to try to make this economy well and healthy \nonce again. But this legislation we are going to be considering \ncontains a couple of things that I put in during this past week when it \nwas considered. One is very simple: If we are going to put people back \nto work building roads and dams and bridges and so on and so forth, \nputting people on payrolls to do these projects that will invest in \nAmerica's infrastructure, then let's try to buy American products while \nwe do it so that we are putting people on factory floors to produce \nthose products. I am talking about steel and iron and manufactured \nprojects.\n  When I suggested that we buy American for the major purchases that we \nare going to make to put people back to work, I did that because I know \nwhen we buy those products we will put our people back to work in those \nfactories. But you would have thought I was talking the most radical \nkind of talk in the world, by the reaction of some--you are going to \nupset the international balance of trade. That is absurd. We are \nalready so out of balance in trade. We are $700 billion to $800 billion \nin red in trade. At any rate, my legislation is here. So as we try to \nput people back to work and invest in our infrastructure to create \njobs, we should buy American. It is common sense.\n  The second amendment I put in this piece of legislation is different \nthan anything that has been required with all the other money that has \nbeen shoved out the door by the Federal Reserve Board, by the Treasury \nDepartment, by the FDIC, and, yes, with TARP, supported by the \nCongress, and that is a provision that says: I want accountability. If \nyou get money from this economic recovery package, you have to report \nto us on a quarterly basis that says: Here is who I am, here is the \nmoney I got, here is how I used it, and here is how many jobs I \ncreated. That kind of accountability, demanding that kind of reporting, \nis essential for my support for this bill. And that is in this piece of \nlegislation because I put it there last week.\n  Now, one final point, if I might. I understand, as I have said many \ntimes, that in most ways the issue of trying to promote economic \nrecovery in this country is not about some menu. It is not about a menu \nof tax cuts or more spending. It is not about a menu of M1B or anything \nof that sort in fiscal or monetary policy. It is about trying to give \nthe American people some increased confidence about the future. That is \ncritical in order to have an expansion of our economy. People have to \nfeel confident about the future in order to act on that confidence--to \nbuy a suit, buy a new washing machine, buy a car, buy a home, take a \ntrip. It is the kind of things people do when they are working and they \nfeel good about the future and their job is secure. They do things that \nexpand the economy.\n  When people aren't confident, they do the exact opposite, and that \ncauses a contraction of the economy. That is where we are today. People \naren't confident about the future. I understand that. I mean, I think \nall of us know why. They have seen the most significant era of greed \nperhaps since the 1920s, and they do not like it. They have seen a \ncollapse of the housing bubble, they have seen big investment bankers \nget rich, they have seen all these things--the scandals--and it is hard \nto be confident. They have seen the country fight a war without paying\n\n[[Page S2193]]\n\nfor it. Some people have given their lives. So I understand that we \nhave a lack of confidence. The question is not whether that exists; the \nquestion is what do we do about it? Do we decide to do something about \nit? And if so, what?\n  I have described often the response of Mark Twain when asked if he \nwould engage in a debate at this organization, and he said: Oh yes, if \nI can take the negative side. They said, but we haven't even told you \nthe subject yet. He said: Oh, the subject doesn't matter. The negative \nside will take no preparation.\n  So I understand how easy it is to simply be opposed to everything. \nThe question now, however, is: What do we do to lift this country? What \ndo we do to help lift this country out of this deep recession and give \npeople some confidence that we are on the right road? Perhaps a trade \npolicy that begins to insist on some balance in trade so we are not \ndeep in the red; a budget policy that at some point says you can't \nspend what you don't have on what you don't need. You have to have some \nbalance in fiscal policy and you have to recognize that. And you have \nto have a policy on banking and finance that says we're not going to \nallow you to do this anymore. We are not going to merge the safety and \nsoundness of banking with speculation and risk in real estate and \nsecurities. We are not going to do it. If we would take those steps, it \nseems to me we would give some substantial confidence to the American \npeople.\n\n  Passing the legislation that is going to be proposed today or \ntomorrow--the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act--is not the \neasiest thing, I understand, because it is counterintuitive to somehow \nbelieve that the way out, when you are deep in debt, is to spend some \nmoney. Well, I understand that is counterintuitive. Yet all of the \nlessons we have learned are that you have to prime the pump to put \npeople back on a payroll. If you have half a million people a month \nlosing their jobs, you have to find a way to put people back on the \npayroll and to inspire some confidence in the economy again.\n  I have heard discussions today about, well, I worry about this piece \nor that piece, and people won't go back to work. I am telling you, I \nthink there are a lot of things in this bill that will put people back \nto work.\n  I chair the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water. We have \n$4.6 billion in this with the Corps of Engineers, and the Corps of \nEngineers will be repairing mostly bridges and water projects--that are \ndesigned, engineered, and ready to go. They will be being hiring \ncontractors who will be hiring workers. The fact is there will be a lot \nof jobs created with this package--we believe 3.5 to 4 million jobs. \nThat is going to make a difference, I believe.\n  Having described in some cases our disagreements, let me say that I \ndo think every single person in this Chamber wants the same thing for \nthis country. We perhaps have different approaches to how to get there, \nbut we all want this country to prosper, the economy to be lifted and \nto recover, for people to go back to work, and for us to have the kind \nof future that we expect for our children. I believe that is possible. \nIf I didn't believe it was possible, I would hardly be able to go to \nwork in the morning.\n  Let me tell one story, if I might--I have mentioned it before, a \ncouple of weeks ago--and some people have heard of this. I talked about \nthis guy named Ken Mink from Kentucky, because it is so inspiring. It \nis so indicative of people in this country who think we can do anything \nand they can do anything.\n  Ken Mink, from a news report I read, was 73 years old. He was out in \nthe back yard shooting baskets, and he came in and said to his wife: \nHoney, it is back. She said what is back? He said: My shot. My \nbasketball shot is back. No matter where I shoot in the back yard, I \ndon't miss. So he sat down that night and wrote applications to \ncolleges--junior colleges--at age 73. He got into a junior college and \ntried out for the basketball team, at age 73, and made the basketball \nteam. About a month and a half ago, he made two points in a college \nbasketball game. The oldest man, by 40 years, ever to score at a \ncollege basketball game, at age 73. I was thinking about that the other \nday, and I thought: What a wonderful inspirational story, of somebody \nwho didn't understand what he couldn't do. Who says you can't play \nbasketball at age 73 for a junior college some place in Kentucky?\n  My point is: I think that represents the story of our country. We \nhave so many stories of people who, against the odds, do things that \nmake this a better place. And if we work together and believe in \nourselves, and believe in what we have accomplished in decades past and \nwill accomplish in the future, this country is going to be fine. So we \nare going to get through this week, and hopefully we will give some \nboost to this economy, and after which I believe we will see an economy \nthat provides more jobs and begins to expand and provides opportunity \nfor American families once again.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bennett and Mr. Wyden pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 426 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements \non Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, in the course of debating the economic \nstimulus legislation, every Senator I have talked to has been \ninterested in trying to find savings to keep down the cost of the \neconomic stimulus bill. I have come to the floor this afternoon because \nit appears that when the Senate debates the final stimulus legislation, \nit is not going to include a bipartisan provision to protect taxpayers, \na bipartisan provision which would require that Wall Street companies \nthat recently paid excessive bonuses be required to pay those bonuses \nback to the taxpayers.\n  Taxpayers in this country were horrified several weeks ago to learn \nabout the fact that recently Wall Street companies that had received \nTARP financing--TARP, of course, being the Troubled Asset Relief \nProgram--had just paid $18 billion in bonuses. Once that news became \npublic, everybody in Government spoke out against the bonuses. \nEverybody lined up in front of the television cameras to say the \nbonuses were wrong. Everybody said that it was outrageous and \nunacceptable for these Wall Street bonuses to have been paid when these \ninstitutions were receiving billions and billions of dollars of \ntaxpayer money.\n  After the news, three of us on the Senate Finance Committee--a \nbipartisan group--said we were going to do more than say the bonuses \nwere wrong; we were going to take steps to make sure the bonuses were \nactually paid back. So we came together and put forward a bipartisan \nproposal. We collaborated with law professors across the country and \nhad the Joint Committee on Taxation, under the able leadership of \nEdward Kleinbard, review the financial underpinnings of the proposal, \nand they found that our modest approach that would allow taxpayers to \nbe paid back the excessive amount of the cash bonuses would generate \n$3.2 billion for American taxpayers--just a fraction of what had been \npaid out. We felt it was a modest proposal. We felt it was a bipartisan \nproposal.\n  The fact is, nobody would oppose our idea in broad daylight, but it \nnow seems that when the ink is dry on the final legislation, the \ntaxpayers of this country are still going to get soaked. It is not \nright. It is not right because taxpayers in this country have been \ntaking a beating with their health care costs and their fuel costs and \ntrying to figure out how to stay in their homes.\n  Companies normally pay bonuses when they are doing well. That wasn't \nthe case with these Wall Street financial firms. Here is the math. The \nWall Street firms took $274 billion in taxpayer money. When they \nweren't doing well, they paid $18 billion in bonuses, but they couldn't \npay the taxpayers $3.2 billion of the amount paid--the excessive amount \npaid--in cash bonuses when the taxpayers are being hit in\n\n[[Page S2194]]\n\ntheir wallets, as we all have seen every time we are home and talking \nto our constituents.\n  The arguments of the financial firms don't add up to me, and they \naren't going to add up to the millions of taxpayers whose money has \ngone to the financial firms. The taxpayers deserve to see in this \nstimulus legislation that somebody was actually standing up for them; \nthat it wasn't just about speeches; it wasn't just about saying \nsomething was wrong; it was about backing up those words and taking \nconcrete action to protect taxpayers.\n  So I have come to the floor more than anything else to make it clear \nthat I am a persistent guy, and I am going to stay at this until there \nis a better accounting for our taxpayers' money, until Congress puts a \nstop to these kinds of actions where financial firms take taxpayers' \nmoney and give the citizens of this country a runaround. This needs to \nend, and it needs to end now. It means concrete action has to be taken. \nThat means more than speeches.\n  We know in the days ahead these financial firms are likely to come \nback to the Congress of the United States and say they need additional \nsums of money to deal with the toxic loans that are on their books. How \ncan one have confidence about giving these firms additional money when \nthey have just paid bonuses during these tough times and they have \nfought--I know for a fact--against a reasonable provision to require \nthat these bonuses be paid back.\n  I intend to stay at this. It concerns me greatly that we didn't have \na recorded vote here on the floor of the Senate on this provision. I \nknew that nobody would oppose this in broad daylight, but I had no idea \nthere would be such an aggressive effort behind the scenes to kill a \nmodest step to protect taxpayers, and particularly to find savings in \nthis legislation. For days now, Senators of both political parties have \nbeen talking about ways to hold down the costs. A bipartisan group of \nSenators found a way--a reasonable way--to save more than $3 billion, \naccording to the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  It is time to put a stop to financial firms taking taxpayers' money \nand using the money to pay bonuses to many of the same people \nresponsible for the current financial crisis. I am old enough to know \nthat normally you pay bonuses when you do well. That is what the \nAmerican economy is all about. That is what capitalism is all about. \nSomehow, some of these institutions think they ought to be able to \nprivatize their gains and socialize their losses. That is not right, \nand it wasn't right to kill this modest provision to force the \nrepayment of the excessive amount of these Wall Street bonuses.\n  So I intend to come back to the floor of the Senate on this subject. \nI will do everything I can to get a fair shake for the taxpayers of \nOregon and the taxpayers of this country. I wish this bonus recovery \nprovision was in the stimulus legislation that will be voted on here in \nthe Senate. I regret greatly that it is not. I am going to stay with \nthis until the taxpayers recover this money that shouldn't have been \npaid out in the first place.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, I wish to speak on the pending matter, \nwhich is the so-called stimulus plan, with great concern about where we \nare. As we hear, the plan has been agreed to and the package is being \nput together; however, we have yet to see it. So I am going to make \nsome assumptions about the things I hear that may or may not be \nincluded in it.\n  It appears we have some clear idea of some things that definitely \nwon't be a part of this package. The fact is that as we approach this \nproblem--and this is a serious problem for our Nation--the President \ntalked about a timely, targeted, and temporary spending package. The \nPresident talked about it being timely because we needed to get the \nmoney out the door now so that it would get into the mainstream of \ncommerce, so that it could get into the economy so that we could avoid \na deep and long-lasting recession. It also needed to be targeted \nbecause it made no sense to do those things that would spend money but \nnot create jobs, not create economic activity; the types of tax cuts \nthat are geared toward creating more jobs in the marketplace, not \nsimply to give money to people that may or may not ultimately be spent. \nIt needed to be temporary because we all know that Government spending \nin excess during a time of a recovery, when the Government should not \nbe overspending, should not be overheating the economy, could lead to a \nslowdown of the recovery because it would increase inflation.\n  So that is why, when the President made those comments, I was \nexcited. I was positive. I was very positive in thinking this is \nexactly what our country needed at this point in time. However, we have \nfound that as this has evolved through the Halls of Congress, that is \nnot what we are getting. We are getting an unfocused spending plan \nwhich spends money on things that are far afield from shovel ready, \nready-to-get-out-the-door types of projects, but which is really an \nunfocused spending measure that, in my view and in the view of many \nothers, spends too much at a time when we can hardly afford to be \noverspending needlessly, but it also does not spend on that which is \ndesigned to create the jobs America desperately needs today.\n  In my view, there are ways we could have crafted a package. I made a \nproposal because I do believe that to simply oppose what the President \nproposes and what the majority of this body and across the hall have \nput together is--it is not enough to just say no, don't do it. We have \na responsibility to be responsible and offer alternatives, to offer a \nproposal, because at this point in time we know we are in deep and \nserious economic times. So the key to this is oppose but propose.\n  The fact is that some of us did attempt mightily to see if we could \nnot come to a bipartisan compromise, a spending package that would have \nspent about $650 billion--a very big package of spending. But the \nspending would have been focused on what I believe would have gotten \nout the door quickly. We also know it would have been good to spend on \nthings that we needed to spend the money on anyway. In fact, military \nreset, the resetting of equipment that has been damaged or lost in the \nlong struggles in Iraq and Afghanistan would have been a great way for \nus to be spending it--those things that we have to spend money on \nanyway but at the same time be doing so now in a manner that gets it \nout the door in a hurry.\n\n  We have the infrastructure in place for military purchases of \nequipment. That would have helped. We could have also done more in the \ninfrastructure field. I think this plan is not big enough as it relates \nto the building of highways and bridges. The fact is that the Presiding \nOfficer well knows the need for bridges. In Minnesota, there is a \ntremendous need for infrastructure. I wanted to see more bridges. \nAcross this Nation, we have bridges that are failing and need to be \nrebuilt, and more highways and bridges and infrastructure in that sense \nwould have been the right way to approach it.\n  Obviously, a part of the package should also be tax cuts geared to \njob creation. There is a difference between giving money to the people \nwho would use it to pay down debt or hoard and hold it because they are \nfearful of what is coming in the economy. I believe in more focused tax \ncuts, such as payroll deduction or the corporate tax rate being \nreduced, which ultimately is America's small businesses that will put \nAmerica back to work. Giving those small businesses a tax break would \nhave encouraged them to get people back on the rolls of the employed.\n  My largest disappointment of all is that this plan fails to address \nthe problem that got us into this mess in the first place. Why did the \nPresident and my Governor appear in Fort Myers a couple of days ago? \nBecause that is the foreclosure capital of America, and that is where \nmore houses are being foreclosed than anyplace else in Florida. I was \nspeaking with a group of government officials from Charlotte County, a \nlittle north of Fort Myers, where there is 11 percent unemployment and \na terrible problem with foreclosures. They said: Please do something \nabout foreclosures. If we can stop houses from being foreclosed, we can \ndo two very important things. We can keep a family in their home and \nkeep that family whole; we can keep that street from having a \nforeclosed house, and we\n\n[[Page S2195]]\n\nkeep that community from yet declining further and further in the \nprices of homes.\n  In addition, we also do something else; we sustain home values in a \nway that will help yet another foreclosure from occurring as the \ndeclining spiral of housing prices continues to go downhill.\n  The second one I would have loved to have seen in this package--and I \nam disappointed to know it is not in there--is the proposal by Senator \nIsakson, which is to give a $15,000 tax credit to anybody who purchases \na home--not just first-time home buyers but anybody. We know one of the \ngreat problems in the housing market today is that there is an enormous \ninventory of unsold homes, many the result of foreclosures. If we \nencourage potential home buyers by giving them a significant tax break, \nthey would get into the marketplace and make the decision to buy, and \nwe could begin then to stave off this continuing cycle of declining \nhome prices, stalled sales, and more foreclosures.\n  I know when the President went to Fort Myers, he went there because \nthere is a foreclosure problem. If there wasn't a foreclosure problem \nin Fort Myers, there would not be double digit inflation in Lee County \nand Charlotte County. I know my Governor wishes to see this package \npassed. I don't know that my Governor understands all of the details in \nthe package. There will be nothing here to help with Florida's housing \neconomy, which is the No. 1 problem we have today. Until we address the \nhousing problem, we are not going to bring Florida back to economic \nhealth.\n  There is not enough largess that can come to Florida from the Federal \nGovernment to fill the coffers of the State's needs. We need for \nFlorida's economy to get back on its feet. We need tax cuts so that the \ntaxpayers have more money to spend, and we need to work on the housing \nproblem. We need to work on the overall economy of the country so that \ntourism comes back to our State. All of these things working in unison \nwill bring America back to economic health.\n  This package, unfortunately, misses the mark. One of the great \ndangers in it is that at the cost of almost just a hair under $800 \nbillion, there are not enough additional hundreds of billions that we \ncan safely spend. We have to get it right, because some of us in the \nBanking Committee this week heard from the Secretary of the Treasury, \nwho told us to get ready, another almost $2 trillion more is going to \nbe asked of you for the financial institutions. At the end of the day, \nthis is very costly. At some point, continued Government spending isn't \ngoing to cut it. So that is why it is so important that this package be \ngotten right.\n  I hate to oppose this package, because I would have loved for us to \nhave come up with something that was a truly bipartisan package--not \njust a way of getting three votes but a way of, in fact, working \ntogether and getting the best thinking of both sides and working on \nsomething that was bipartisan. Not working in that fashion has caused \nsome of us to oppose this package. I hate doing that. I wanted to work \nwith President Obama. I wish our new President well, and I hope the \npackage succeeds and has the desired effect. In my conscience, I cannot \nsupport it because I don't feel it will do what this economy currently \nneeds or that it will do what in fact all of us need to work together \ntoward doing, and that is getting our country back on the road to \nrecovery.\n  With great regret, I will not be able to support this package. I look \nforward to seeing the final outcome because we have not all read the \nbill yet. I will analyze it again to see if the component parts are \nthere that will allow me to support it. But it appears clear to me, in \nthe information we have, that that in fact will not be the case. I am \nincreasingly disappointed, but at the same time my hope is that it will \nsucceed because, at this moment, at this juncture in history, we need \nfor our country to be successful, so that Americans can get back to \nwork and our Nation can get back to prosperity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I have been listening to the remarks of \nthe Senator from Florida. I find myself in agreement with him. I want \nto elaborate a little bit. For that reason, I ask unanimous consent \nthat my 10 minutes be extended to 15 minutes should I need that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Inhofe pertaining to the introduction of S.J. \nRes. 10 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to express my opposition to the \nconference report that has been granted and put together accompanying \nthe American recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, more commonly known \nas the stimulus package.\n  When I spoke on the floor last week about my disappointments in the \nSenate version of the stimulus bill, I did not think the bill would get \nmuch worse in conference. In fact, I harbored some hope it would \nactually improve. Unfortunately, I was wrong.\n  What we have seen emerge from the conference weakens the stronger \nprovisions of the Senate bill and worsens the less effective \nprovisions.\n  Many Utahans have called and written me to express their concerns \nabout this stimulus package and the process by which it has been \nlegislated. They are rightly worried about the consequences of an \neconomic stimulus package that, with interest, will cost taxpayers well \nover $1 trillion. That is just the beginning, by the way. They are \nparticularly worried it will be ineffective in saving or creating jobs.\n  Last year, President Obama's campaign was based on ``hope not fear.'' \nThat is until he needs fear to help him pass a bill, as Charles \nKrauthammer of the Washington Post points out. The pressure is on the \nmajority to convince the American people this is the right economic \npackage.\n  On Tuesday, President Obama spoke to the American people, not about \nthe audacity of hope but rather to instill fear into Americans. He said \nat that time:\n\n       A failure to act will only deepen the crisis as well as the \n     pain of Americans.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       The Federal Government is the only entity left with the \n     resources to jolt our economy.\n\n  While I do not disagree with these statements, it is wrong to use \nfear to force the completion of an unbalanced, largely partisan package \nthat the Congressional Budget Office estimates will create at most 1.9 \nmillion jobs by the end of 2011 and leave us with a lower gross \ndomestic product in 10 years than if we do nothing at all.\n  Keep in mind, the head of the Congressional Budget Office is a \nDemocratic appointee.\n  It is clear we are in an economic recession and that action is needed \nto stimulate the Government. I think every one of our colleagues agrees \nwith this. What troubles me is the misperception about why most \nRepublicans are opposed to this bill. The President and many of our \nDemocratic colleagues have unfairly implied that Republicans prefer to \ndo nothing. That is absolutely not true. Yes, we are opposed to this \nbill, but we are not opposed to stimulating the economy. We simply want \nto do it in the most effective and least wasteful way as possible. We \ndo not want to see us make a $1 trillion mistake, and this is a $1 \ntrillion-plus mistake.\n  Yet we Republicans were shut out of negotiating the final conference \nreport, which is something President Obama vowed to the American people \nhe would change. According to President Obama's Presidential campaign \nWeb site, change.gov, he vowed to ``end the practice of writing \nlegislation behind closed doors.''\n  Specifically he said he would `` . . . work to reform congressional \nrules to require all legislative sessions, including committee mark-\nups, and conference committees, to be conducted in public.''\n  That certainly did not happen here. I believe this bill could be much \nmore effective and so does President Obama. At his Tuesday press \nconference, he admitted as much when he said:\n\n       I cannot tell you for sure that everything in this plan \n     will work exactly as we hope.\n\n  That concerns me. If we plan to spend an amount equal to the 15th\n\n[[Page S2196]]\n\nlargest economy in the world, we ought to make sure the stimulus plan \nis drafted in the most effective way possible.\n  For example, many economists say the make work pay tax credit \nprovision in the plan, which will give workers roughly $15 more a week \nin each paycheck, will largely be ineffective in stimulating the \neconomy. It is not going to help the economy. Yet it is a tremendous \ncost, around $150 billion, that could have easily been spent on \nsomething that would help the economy, create jobs. I suggested the \nresearch and development tax credit by making that permanent. I cannot \nbegin to tell you how that would keep our unqualified lead in the high-\ntech world.\n  My objection to this bill is not based on the fact it includes \nspending, it is because it lacks an effective balance of spending and \ntax relief.\n  If we look closely at the bill, we will see that much of what the \nmajority lists as tax relief is actually spending. In other words, \nthose who do not pay any income taxes, as well as State and local \ngovernments, are receiving money through the Tax Code. How can there be \ntax relief to those who do not pay taxes? That is more taxes for those \nwho do. Tax relief from what? I am not saying those who do not pay \nincome taxes should not benefit from this stimulus package. I am saying \nif you are going to give money to people who do not pay taxes, call it \nwhat it is--it is spending, it is not tax relief.\n  Like I say, I would far rather would have had a permanent research \nand development tax credit, which would cost about only two-thirds of \nwhat they are going to spend on this so-called make work pay provision \nthat would create millions of jobs in America and throughout the world.\n  In fact, when one adds up all the provisions in the bill, more than \n70 percent is spending and less than 30 percent is real tax relief. \nWhere is the balance? Even worse, only one-half of 1 percent of this \nbill--one-half of 1 percent of this bill--is devoted to tax relief to \nhelp struggling businesses keep their doors open. One-half of 1 \npercent--that is pathetic. We know small business produces most of the \njobs. Yet this is what we are doing. Moreover, the bill fails to \nadequately address the housing crisis. Unfortunately, the $15,000 tax \ncredit for home buyers, which is one of the few bipartisan amendments \naccepted into the Senate bill during the Senate debate, has now been \nwatered down drastically. So has the other major bipartisan amendment \nadded on the Senate floor--the deduction for interest on a new auto \nloan. And one of the few provisions to help struggling companies keep \ntheir doors open--the expanded period for carryback net operating \nlosses--has been erased from the conference report, except for small \nbusinesses.\n\n  Now, I have some news for my Democratic colleagues. Small businesses \nare not the only companies that are laying off workers. Allowing \ncompanies to get quick refunds of taxes previously paid was one of the \nfew smart and efficient provisions in the Senate bill, designed to \ndirectly save jobs. Now that has been whittled down to a mere shadow of \nwhat it was.\n  I worry that my friends on the other side of the aisle are looking \nthrough rose-colored glasses, spectacles tinted by spending priorities, \nsuch as expanding Government programs, which they hope will stimulate \nthe economy. They are trying to convince America that spending millions \non Government vehicles will somehow stimulate the economy. They refuse \nto listen to even the President's Chair of the Council of Economic \nAdvisers, Christina Romer, who in a study determined that every dollar \nof Government spending increases the gross domestic product by $1.40, \nwhile every dollar of tax relief increases the gross domestic product \nby $3. That is what the study says. The President's own Chair of the \nCouncil of Economic Advisers says that $1 of Government spending equals \na $1.40 increase in GDP, but if you do it in tax relief, $1 will give \nyou a $3 increase in GDP. Doesn't take too many brains to figure out it \nis far better to do it the second way.\n  The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that the Senate \nversion of this so-called stimulus package would only save or create \nbetween 600,000 and 1.9 million jobs by the end of 2011. At a cost of \n$1.2 trillion, including interest, the cost to the taxpayer for each \njob saved or created under the plan is at least $632,000 and as much as \n$2 million if that goes up. We are spending taxpayer money to create \none job at the rate of $632,000 per job.\n  Now that the Senate bill has been scaled back significantly, this \njob-creation estimate is almost sure to go down significantly. We can \ndo better than this, Mr. President. This is not good enough for \nGovernment work. With the amount of money spent in this bill, you could \ngive every man, woman, and child in America $4,000. I think Utahns and \nall Americans would put $1.2 trillion to better use than what this bill \ndoes.\n  A large share of this stimulus bill will go to States to implement \ntemporary programs. When that funding runs out, what do we tell all of \nthose employees who were hired and now have to be let go? Will we say: \nSorry, this is just a temporary job. Who are we kidding? This makes \nabout as much sense as denying an undefeated football team the chance \nto play in the national championship game. I know that sounds a little \nbit like sour grapes since the University of Utah was the only \nundefeated team this last year but had absolutely zero chance to play \nin the national championship game.\n  The majority knows the American people want to see more tax relief in \nthis stimulus bill. A February 9 poll conducted by the Rasmussen Report \nfound that 62 percent of U.S. voters want the plan to include more tax \nrelief and less Government spending. It appears as if the more time \nAmericans have to review this bill, the less they like it. That is \ncertainly the case for me.\n  While time is of the essence, we cannot afford to get this wrong. The \nstakes are too high. Yet President Obama has chosen to break the theme \nof his Presidential campaign and use fear to hurriedly pass this flawed \neconomic stimulus package. Now, I am not sure I can blame him for that \nbecause he is stuck with what the people up here have done to him and \nto what he said he would do. So I suppose he was limited to using fear \nto get this package passed. I have a lot of respect for him. I \npersonally have helped him, and I intend to help him more. But, gee \nwhiz, this is pathetic.\n  Mr. President, we Republicans realize the severity of this economic \nsituation. We recognize the need to stimulate the economy with a \nbalanced stimulus package that has an appropriate mix of spending and \nreal tax relief. We want to create jobs and spur economic growth. But \nhaste makes waste, and, like many of my constituents, I believe our \nefforts are about to be wasted--squandered on a stimulus bill that will \nstimulate more criticism and feeling of futility than the economy.\n  The great American poet and abolitionist John Greenleaf Whittier \nwrote:\n\n       For of all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are \n     these: ``It might have been!''\n\n  And while those words were written more than a century ago, they can \ncertainly be applied now to Congress. Faced with serious recession, we \nneed to do our very best to get the economy moving again. Instead, it \nlooks as if this body will settle for a partisan bill that could well \nfail to do the job our Nation requires. We should do better. We could \ndo much better. The American people need us to do much better. And if \nthis legislation passes, many of us will one day shake our heads at the \nopportunity lost and wonder aloud about what might have been.\n  I have told a few people over the last number of weeks who have \nblamed both parties for what has gone on here over the last number of \nyears that I have been here 33 years and there hasn't been 1 day in the \nSenate that I can point to where a fiscal conservative majority has \nbeen in control of the Senate--not 1 day in 33 years--because there are \nalways enough liberal Republicans, combined with the mostly all liberal \nDemocrats, to do just about anything they want to in spending. It is \ndiscouraging, I have to admit. We have won some battles because we have \noutworked the other side or we have had a President who has made a \ndifference on some issues, no question about it. But not 1 day that I \ncan recall where, if you count the liberals on our side and the \nliberals on the Democratic side and you put them together--it is \nusually only five or six, really, on our side--we always have the \nmajority on\n\n[[Page S2197]]\n\nthe other side. That is why President Bush was hammered all the time \nfor his spending programs when, in fact, his budgets were at all times \nless than what we ultimately passed here in both Houses.\n  Mr. President, I would like to now take a few minutes to talk about \nthe health care provisions in this so-called stimulus package or, more \nappropriately, the next installment of the ``Socialized Health Care for \nAll Act of 2009.'' Democrats hate to hear that. They think it is \nterrible to hear the word ``socialism.''\n  President Obama recently made the media rounds stating that any delay \nin passing this Government spending package would be inexcusable and \nirresponsible. Well, today I am going to highlight certain health care \nprovisions in this Trojan horse legislation that, in the President's \nown words, should be classified as inexcusable and irresponsible.\n  First and foremost, let me make this point again, even though I am \nstarting to sound like a broken record. Reforming our health care \nsystem to ensure that every American has access to quality, affordable, \nand portable health care is not a Republican or Democratic issue, it is \nan American issue. When we are dealing with 17 percent of our total \neconomy, it is absolutely imperative that we address this challenge in \nan open and bipartisan process.\n  Think about it. We are going to talk about this for just a minute. \nJust like the partisan SCHIP exercise preceding this bill, this \nstimulus legislation is another example of the Democrats justifying the \ncurrent economic turmoil to simply expand our entitlement programs and \nmake the Federal Government bigger. More and more Americans are being \npushed into Government-run health care programs. Special interests have \ntaken priority over families; politics, of course, over policy.\n  In this time of national crisis, we should have come together as one \ngroup to write a responsible bill for the American families who are \nfaced with rising unemployment and dropping home values. Instead, the \nother side has simply chosen to turn this into a government-expansion \nexercise and a grab-bag of favors for the liberal special interests.\n\n  I continue to hope that the other side's promise of change was more \nthan a campaign slogan that did not expire on November 4, 2008. Let's \nall remember: Actions speak louder than words.\n  Let me start with the COBRA provisions in this package. The Senate \nversion of the stimulus includes more than $20 billion in subsidies for \nhealth insurance premiums for those who have lost their jobs in these \ntough economic conditions. However, this subsidy will only go to those \nAmericans who had access to COBRA coverage through their employers.\n  Now, let me put this inequity into perspective. If you worked for a \nlarge employer, such as Lehman Brothers or Bear Stearns in New York \nCity, which had access to a COBRA qualified group health plan, you will \nget help under this bill. But mom-and-pop stores in Salt Lake City that \ncould not afford a group health plan for their hard-working employees, \nthey get nothing. Not a thing. Now, let me repeat again--nothing. This \nis not only unfair, it is unconscionable.\n  That is not all. It gets worse. Both the Senate- and the House-passed \nlanguage gave the same COBRA subsidy--50 percent and 65 percent \nrespectively--regardless of one's income threshold. Look at this chart. \nYou probably recognize the fellow on the left. This is Richard Fuld, \nthe former CEO of the now-bankrupt Lehman Brothers, who made almost \nhalf a billion dollars in salary, bonuses, and stock options since the \nyear 2000. He is going to get the same level of subsidy for his health \ninsurance premiums as the laid-off construction worker on the right \nhere in Utah.\n  I worked with Senator Grassley to write an amendment that would have \napplied income testing to this provision to target this taxpayer-funded \nhelp to those who needed it the most. We income test Medicare Part B \nfor our seniors, so why not do the same for these subsidies? \nUnfortunately, it was not included in the Senate package.\n  Another concern Americans need to be mindful about is the impact of \nthis massive COBRA subsidy on our Nation's employers, who are already \nstruggling to meet their payroll needs.\n  By the way, just so everybody understands what COBRA means, if you \nget fired or the business ends or you have to leave the business, you \nhave a right under COBRA to continue the insurance, but you have to pay \nfor it rather than your employer.\n  Even though employers are not explicitly liable for the COBRA \nsubsidies in this legislation, they will suffer from this phenomenon of \nadverse selection. A number of COBRA-eligible individuals have premiums \nthat exceed those of active workers. Studies have shown that the \naverage COBRA premiums are at 145 percent of active worker premium \npayments. According to a study by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the 10-year \nimpact of this provision on employers, even when limited to those in \nthe 55-to-64 age group, could be up to $65 billion. Economics 101 \ndictates that these additional costs will simply be passed on to \nemployers, which in return will result in lower wages and more layoffs. \nThis is not exactly what would qualify as ``stimulus'' in my book--\nspending, sure, but definitely not stimulus.\n  Let me shift my attention to the comparative effectiveness provision. \nThe idea behind this concept is simple: Compare the effectiveness of \nmedical treatments and procedures so payers, providers, and patients \ncan make smart choices. Sounds good. However, the difficulty arises \nwhen you decide to compare on the basis of what is cheaper rather than \nwhat works well. Both the House- and the Senate-passed versions \nprovided $1.1 billion for comparative effectiveness, including a $400 \nmillion slush fund to be used by the Secretary at his or her \ndiscretion. Once again, this is a topic of bipartisan interest and \nconcern that should have been discussed in the context of comprehensive \nreform.\n  We can all agree that a one-size-fits-all approach is the wrong \napproach for the American health care system. Based on our own personal \nexperiences, we know that what works best for one does not always work \nthe same for the other. Allowing comparative effectiveness on the basis \nof cost can have disastrous consequences not only on innovation of \nlifesaving treatments but also in the delivery of quality care.\n  On this chart, for example, we see Jack Tagg, a former World War II \npilot, who in 2006 suffered from a severe case of macular degeneration. \nThe regional health board that utilized cost-based comparative \neffectiveness rejected his request for treatment citing high cost, \nunless the disease hit his other eye also.\n  It took 3 years to overturn that decision. Now let's just all \nremember that a family member with cancer in an intensive care unit \nwould probably neither have the time nor the resources to appeal such \nan egregious decision. We need to remember the real implications of \nthese provisions--not simply in terms of political spin and special \ninterests--but in terms of its impact on real people who are our \nmothers, fathers, husbands, wives, brother and sisters--children.\n  During the Finance Committee consideration of the stimulus \nlegislation, Senators Baucus, Enzi, Conrad, and I discussed the \nimportance of getting the comparative effectiveness provision right.\n  I believe that comparative effectiveness must focus on clinical \neffectiveness, not cost, and it should maintain patient choice and \ninnovation. Failure to do so could have disastrous consequences.\n  As I have already said multiple times, I am disappointed that \nDemocrats have decided to use the stimulus legislation to address \nhealth care reform in a partisan and piecemeal manner. Health IT--\ninformation technology--is another perfect example. It is an area of \nconsensus that should have been part of a comprehensive and bipartisan \nhealth care reform dialogue.\n  It is my hope that the Health Information Technology Standards \nCommittee that is created in this legislation will take into account \nthe work of States like Utah that already have adopted statewide HIT. \nstandards for the exchange of clinical data. Utah is much further down \nthe road than other States in this area. Therefore, when the committee \nis making recommendations for HIT standards, it is my hope that the \nwork of States like Utah will be taken into account and seriously\n\n[[Page S2198]]\n\nconsidered by the HIT Standards Committee members. Utah has been a \nnational leader in this area and I believe that its work in this area \nshould be used as a template when national HIT standards are developed.\n  In addition, as we incentivize physicians, hospitals and other health \ncare providers to use electronic health records--EHR, it is important \nthat we provide assistance for them with both the purchase and \nmaintenance of EHR systems. I have heard from one Utah physician in \nOgden who paid over $8,000 for software only to discover that the \nsoftware simply does not work. This is unacceptable. Therefore, if we \nare going to incentivize health providers to use electronic health \nrecords, we need to make sure that providers will have assistance in \nchoosing, implementing and using electronic health records.\n  Utah has been a leader in physician EHR implementation as a result of \nits participation in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services--\nCMS--Medicare Care Management Performance--MCMP demonstration project \nwhich was created through the Medicare Modernization Act. The \ndemonstration provided incentive funding to Utah physicians for \nadopting EHRs and offered these doctors support and assistance with \ntheir EHRs systems. In the bill we are considering, I included language \nto ensure that health providers in Utah and across the country will \ncontinue to receive that assistance. Without such assistance, many \npractices will move forward with a commitment to adopt EHRs, but will \nnot choose the right product for their needs or could have difficulty \nusing the system.\n  Another concern that has been brought to my attention by Utah health \ncare providers is that the maintenance of effort provision in this \nlegislation only applies to eligible State and local governments and \nnot to State and local health care providers. This is a real concern in \nUtah. My State, like others across the Nation, is experiencing economic \ndifficulties and, as a result, is contemplating reducing provider \npayments. I am deeply concerned about the impact this provision could \nhave not only on providers but patient access to quality health care.\n  Finally, I would like to briefly address the enforcement provisions \ncontained in section 13410 of this legislation relating to the State \nattorneys general. When adopting rules to implement the health \ninformation technology provisions in this act, I would urge Secretary \nof HHS to include rules to require the States to notify the HHS \nSecretary as to any outside groups that will have contracts to assist \nwith the enforcement of these provisions. I appreciate the opportunity \nto work with my colleagues on this important issue.\n  I look forward to working together to transform our sick-care system \ninto a true health care system. However, the other side at this time \nseems focused on transforming it into a socialized welfare system \nthrough this Government-spending bill. I continue to hold deep hope in \nmy heart that we will soon move beyond these beltway games and work \ntogether to fix Main Street and make sure that our Nation continues to \nbe the shining city on the hill.\n  Let me just make one other comment. When our bill went over to the \nHouse--the House bill was passed too--I happened to notice that the \nwelfare reform program that we worked so hard on in the mid-1990s, that \nPresident Clinton vetoed twice until he finally decided that it was \nworthwhile and signed it, has been greatly modified in this bill. I may \nbe wrong in this because I have not read that section, but I have had \nindications that that section basically has changed our welfare reform \nlaw. It basically put, within a short time thereafter, two-thirds of \nthe people who had been on welfare to work, many of those people second \nand third generations on welfare. They found out that they could work \nand get the self-esteem that comes from being able to work, while still \nhaving a welfare system to care for those who can't care for themselves \nbut would if they could.\n  My understanding is they have changed the rules now where people can \nstay on welfare their whole lifetime. I hope that has been changed. I \nhave not looked at this final version, but I hope that has been \nchanged. If not, let me make a prediction. For most all of my time in \nthe Senate, the percentage of GDP that our Federal Government has \nrequired is somewhere between 18 and 20 percent. If this bill goes \nthrough and there is another $2 or $3 trillion in spending, without \nbeing done right, we are talking about Europeanizing America. We are \ntalking about the percentage of GDP going up as high as 39 percent--\naccording to the economists I talked to. That would be disastrous.\n  Some are so crude that they suggest that is the plan of our more \nliberal friends on the other side because the more they get people \ndependent on the Federal Government, the more they think the Democratic \nParty is the only one that is going to take care of them.\n  We prefer a little different approach to it. We prefer to help those \nwho can't take care of themselves but would if they could, to help them \nin every way we possibly can. We have difficulty--at least I do--\nhelping those who can help themselves but will not.\n  I hope that provision is no longer in this bill, but I strongly \nsuspect it is. If that is so, we will have done the American economy \ntremendous harm.\n  I am concerned about this. I can't vote for this bill, but I would \nhave liked to have voted for a really good bill that really provided \nappropriate tax relief and made it possible to expand jobs in such a \nway as to bring this economy back to the greatest economy in the world, \nbar none, without question, and without question of its future \ngreatness.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wanted to spend a few minutes this \nevening talking about what we think, what we think--I am going to \nemphasize that--because nobody has seen the bill that I understand we \nare supposed to vote on tomorrow morning, that spends almost $700 plus \nbillion. We have not seen the bill. We have not seen the report \nlanguage. And I can assure you that this Senator is not about to vote \non this bill until he has read the bill and we will do due diligence to \ndo that, if we ever get a copy of the bill.\n  But I wanted to talk about a couple of things that are important that \nwe think are in the bill, and it has to do with health care. I have a \nlittle bit of experience in that. I have practiced medicine now for 28, \n29 years. I find parts of this bill that I know when it is explained to \nthe American public, they will agree with me, it is ludicrous.\n  Let me tell you the first part of the bill. There is $20 billion in \nthis bill to pay hospitals and doctors to buy health IT. Now, at the \nbeginning you would say, well, what is wrong with that? We want \nelectronic medical records. We want to see the benefits that come from \nthe economy of scale, the increased productivity that comes from IT to \nhelp us in health care.\n  Where this bill does not understand what is happening out there is \ndoctors will buy health IT, and hospitals will improve--they all have \nhealth IT right now, by the way--will improve their health IT once \nthere is a program out there that is interoperable with the rest of the \nprogram. The reason doctors are not buying programs for electronic \nmedical records has nothing to do with a lack of money, it is this very \nsimple reason: They know if they buy it now they get to buy it again, \nbecause none of the computers in health IT talk to each other. They \nwill not talk.\n  The way to make them talk is called an interoperable standard. And a \ngood example for you to compare, think about where we had ATMs. How did \nwe make an ATM, where you can go anywhere in the country if you have a \ncredit card that allows you to get cash and go into any ATM in this \ncountry and get cash. How did we do that? How did ATMs come about? They \ncame about because the private sector, the banking industry, created an \ninteroperable standard first. Because they had the interoperability \nstandard, where every bank could make sure that they could talk to \nevery other bank, they put in ATMs.\n\n[[Page S2199]]\n\n  All of a sudden, voila, anywhere in the world today, if you have \nmoney in the bank and you have an ATM card, you can get money out of \nthe bank. They did not build the ATMs first, they did not have the \nGovernment buy the ATMs before they had the standard set.\n  People say, well, we have taken care of that in this bill. We are \ngoing to have the Government decide what the interoperable standard is. \nWell, the Government has been working for 6 years to develop an \ninteroperability standard. They are at least doing it through a private \nconsortium now, and 80 percent of that standard has been accomplished. \nIt will be completed in 2011. But it will not be completed the way this \nbill is written, because we are going to pull it all back from this \npublic-private consortium and we are going to have some bureaucrats at \nHHS decide what the standard is going to be.\n  There are a lot of problems with that. One is nobody at HHS knows \nthat information. No. 2 is, everything that is out there in the market \ntoday is now put at risk, so you are going to absolutely stop private \ninvestment in this area that is so much needed.\n  So what we are going to do is we are going to allow bureaucrats to \ndecide what is it going to be. We are going to eliminate companies that \nhave great ideas, because they are not going to be in the mix, and we \nare going to accept a standard that is not going to be the best \nstandard.\n  The way HHS has it set up now with a public-private consortium was a \npoor way to do it, but at least it has got it 80 percent of the way \nthere. We are going to backtrack on it. Just so you know, we are so \ngood at spending money. We have spent $780 million already of your \nmoney trying to get this, that we are going to now throw down the \ntoilet so we can start over and have bureaucrats exactly decide what \nthe standard is going to be.\n  Well, I will predict to you, everything else we do in IT in the \nFederal Government, 50 percent of the money we waste. That is what our \nstudies show. We waste $32 billion a year on IT programs that never \nwork, out of a $64 billion budget for IT programs alone. So we are \ngoing to waste a ton of money.\n  But that is not the important thing in this bill. We are going to \ngive every doctor in the country, no matter how much money they make, \nif they do not have electronic medical records, we are going to give \nthem $60,000 to buy an electronic medical record.\n  Now, it would seem to me that with the incomes of the average \nphysician being over $200,000, the last place we want to give $60,000 \nto buy a piece of software that is not going to work, that is going to \nhave to be replaced anyway, is to those who are in the upper income in \nthis country.\n  But that is probably not as important as we are going to give for-\nprofit hospitals and the profitable non-profit hospitals $11 million \neach to buy electronic medical record software that still will not talk \nto the doctors who bought it and we gave $60,000.\n  The total cost of this, and what we are doing, is going to be in \nexcess, by the time all of the problems are solved and all of the \ndefects are figured out, and all of the wasted money, of $100 billion. \nThis bill is going to waste $100 billion.\n  Now, tell me for a minute why we would give some of the most \nprofitable companies in the country, the for-profit hospitals and the \nnot-for-profit hospitals who last year made in excess of $6 billion--\nthat is the not-for-profit hospitals made in excess of $6 billion \nbesides doing the charity care that they did--why are we going to give \nthem $11 million each to accomplish something that cannot be \naccomplished?\n  I will tell you why we are going to do it. Because some Congressman \nor some Senator said the way you solve this problem is to throw money \nat it. They haven't thought it through. There has been no development \non or recognition of what is needed, which is an interoperable \nstandard. What should we have done? Seven years ago when we started \ndown this process, there were three great programs out there: one at \nMayo--I am talking big programs--one at Cleveland Clinic, and one at \nKaiser Permanente. What should we have done? We should have bought all \nthree of those, created the ability for those three programs to talk to \neach other and given it away. We would have spent about $20 or $30 \nmillion, maybe $100 million, maybe $200 million, but not $100 billion. \nSo again, Washington has messed it up. The very thing we are hoping to \nfix we are going to ruin. As we do it, we are going to waste $100 \nbillion, and $30 billion of that total is in this bill.\n  The other interesting thing is none of this money starts rolling out \nuntil the middle of next year.\n  I am told I have 1 minute remaining. I ask unanimous consent for 2 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. That is one of the problems with this bill.\n  Let's talk about the big problem. As a practicing physician, I know \nwhat physicians are taught. First, do no harm. Second, listen to your \npatient, and they will tell you what is wrong with them. Third, if it \nhas already been done, don't do it again. That is what they are taught. \nWith that comes years of experience, clinical judgment, and in-depth \nknowledge about people and their disease. In this bill is a statement \nthat says: We are going to develop, through a large slush fund at \nHealth and Human Services, a model called comparative effectiveness. \nThere is nothing wrong with comparing effective outcomes. There is \nnothing wrong with trying to use clinical data to move us in a better \ndirection. But that is not what this is about. This is comparative \neffectiveness to control cost.\n  I warn the American people tonight, if this bill goes through, we are \nwell on the way to absolute government control of the patient-doctor \nrelationship, because we are going to assume that there is no way that \na doctor can make a better decision than a computer. I will give two \nexamples that happened in the last 5 years in my practice, two people \nwho came in who had no clinical signs, had no indications other than my \nknowing them for years and developing a suspicion that something was \nwrong. They didn't come with a complaint. Their complaint was something \nelse. I ordered MRIs on both patients. They were both denied by their \ninsurance company. I arranged for both of them to get MRIs. Both had \ndeadly brain tumors. They never would have fit in the comparative \neffectiveness or the cost control mechanism that we are setting up with \nthis so we can control Medicare costs. This is the first step for the \ngovernment to start rationing the very care it says it wants to give to \nthe American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. The American people better pay very close attention to \nthis bill. If you are on Medicare today or if you are 55 years of age, \nyou better be plenty afraid of the language in this bill, because it is \nsetting up the basis with which the Government will decide what kind of \ncare you get. We are going to use a chart. If you don't fit in the \nchart, you are out of luck. You are going to lose the ability for \nclinical skills to make a difference in your life. Talk to the people \nof Great Britain where cancer cure rates are lower than ours because \nthey don't have access to treatments Americans have today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Udall of New Mexico pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 433 are located in today's Record under ``Statements \non Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the economic stimulus \nplan, and I rise in dismay. I am dismayed because we are about to spend \n$786 billion--or whatever the latest figure is that keeps changing \nalmost by the hour--one of the most expensive bills this or any other \nCongress has ever seen that will not truly stimulate anything. I am \nalso dismayed that in doing so we are placing an almost insurmountable \nfiscal yoke across the next generation's shoulders.\n  Yesterday, I became the proud grandfather of two twin granddaughters. \nIt saddens me to know the result of the\n\n[[Page S2200]]\n\nvotes we cast, I assume, tomorrow--and the ultimate cost of this bill--\nis going to be borne by those two little girls in their lifetimes and \nnot by my generation in ours. We are saddling this next generation of \nour children and grandchildren with an unbelievable debt for the \npurpose of trying to stimulate the economy when, in fact, there is \nvirtually nothing in this bill that truly is going to stimulate the \neconomy in the current crisis we are in.\n  Georgians and Americans are struggling. They need jobs. They need \nfood on the table. They need to be able to go to bed at night knowing, \nat the very least, they have the blessing of a roof over their heads.\n  But provisions in the bill that could have truly helped Americans, \nsuch as a $500-per-worker tax credit, have been so watered down that \nnow the experts say that particular provision is going to provide about \n$13 more per week in workers' pockets. That is not a stimulus plan.\n  I commend my good friend and my colleague, Senator Isakson from \nGeorgia, who worked to put an idea in this bill, a housing tax credit \nthat we know would have stimulated the economy and revived the \nplummeting housing market.\n  Now, why are we in this economic crisis we are in today? If you ask \nany economist to point to one thing that has put us in this crisis, \nevery single one of them--Republican and Democratic economists, \nconservative and liberal economists, Independent economists--every one \nof them will tell you the housing crisis is the No. 1 issue that put us \ninto this crisis.\n  Unfortunately, the bill that came out of the House, the bill that \noriginally came out of the Finance Committee in the Senate, contained \nnot one single provision, in either bill, that was focused on \naddressing this issue of the housing crisis.\n  Under Senator Isakson's proposal that was an amendment to the bill on \nthe floor of the Senate, a $15,000 home buyer tax credit would have \nbeen given to anyone who purchased a home during the next year. That \nwould have had a very positive effect on the economy. How do we know \nthat? We know that because Congress passed a similar housing tax credit \nin 1975, when we were in the midst of another declining housing \nindustry situation in a crisis that was not as severe as this one but \nstill in a crisis. What we found then was that particular provision \nturned around America's sagging economic fortunes.\n  I know families across the country were waiting for this tax credit \nto pass. I have heard from Georgians over and over again, over the last \nseveral weeks, who are looking for a new home to buy, but they, \nfrankly, have been waiting on the proposal because they have been \nreading about it.\n  I got a call from a radio talk show host in my home State today who \nmade the statement to me, before we started the interview: Tell me \nabout Senator Isakson's tax credit provision. Where does it stand \nbecause I am looking for a home to buy and my realtor called me and \nsaid: Look, you can afford to pay a little bit more because here is \nwhat is going to be the result of your buying this house: a $15,000 tax \ncredit.\n  Now, with the way this provision has been watered down, it may as \nwell not even be in there. It is unfortunate. This was a bipartisan \namendment, an amendment that was talked about on both sides of the \naisle by Senators in this Chamber, and was agreed to without even \ncalling for a vote because everybody recognizes the housing sector has \nto be fixed and that this would play a major role in fixing that \nsector.\n  All week we have read in the papers and heard from a majority of our \ncolleagues that this bill is a compromise. Well, let me say this: This \nbill is no compromise. When deals of this magnitude are struck in \nclosed-door, back-room sessions, when the White House talks to this \nside of the aisle but does not truly listen, you do not have a \ncompromise.\n  It is pretty clear the White House has not listened to this side of \nthe aisle in crafting this final proposal that apparently is in the \nprocess of being agreed to. My Republican colleagues have offered \nproposal after proposal to create jobs, to fix the real crux of our \neconomic troubles--the housing crisis--and to lend a hand to laid-off \nworkers who are suffering through no fault of their own. Instead, we \nare spending money we do not have on projects or programs that are not \nneeded.\n  What taxpayers are getting instead is a bloated Government giveaway \npacked with pet projects. Let me say there has been a lot of \nconversation coming from the White House, as well as on the floor of \nthe Senate, that this bill does not contain earmarks. Well, anybody who \nsays that simply has not read the bill. This bill is packed with as \nmany earmarks as I have seen in any bill that has come into this body \nin the time I have been here. There is earmark after earmark in here, \nand we are going to talk some more about that before this bill is voted \non, presumably tomorrow.\n  The American people know something needs to be done, and I agree that \nit does. But this legislation is not what is needed to address the \nhousing crisis, put hard-earned dollars back in our citizens' pockets \nto spend as they wish, and put Americans back to work.\n  Our side of the aisle offered a very targeted combination of spending \nand tax reductions in the McCain amendment. A truly bipartisan effort \nby the majority and the Senate as a whole would have passed that \namendment, and we could be headed down the road of reaching a \nbipartisan agreement on the issue of trying to solve this economic \ncrisis. Unfortunately, that amendment was not agreed to because it was \nnot voted on in a bipartisan way.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for his \nexcellent comments about the housing proposal offered by our colleague, \nSenator Isakson. I thought it was a good idea when he first brought it \nup. It would have pleased me if that had been included at the time \nPresident Bush sent out those checks a year ago that had no real \npermanent benefit, and I thought it should have been included then. I \nwas very much supportive of it when he brought it forward later, last \nweek, and I thought we had adopted it. But it looks like it is going to \nbe taken out or so reduced it will not have the same effect.\n  The advantage of that was it would target the real problem we have; \nwhich is the housing supply that is growing. The growing supply of \nunoccupied housing causes the price of everyone's home to decline. We \nknow it had to decline some because we had a bubble in housing. But \nthere is a danger when home prices fall below what the real market \nvalue is. When they fall too low, it does begin to have serious \nramifications in the economy.\n  Similar to Senator Chambliss, I thought Senator McCain's proposal had \nsome real infrastructure spending, some targeted tax reductions that \nwould put money in people's pockets immediately but would not \nnecessarily be permanent, and we could shut that off without creating a \nbureaucracy. I thought that was a real good piece of legislation. It \ncost about half the cost of this legislation.\n  So there are some things we could do. I was certainly prepared to \nconsider other options and other alternatives. But, as it is, there has \nbeen very little input into this bill. Right now, we still have not \nseen it. There was talk about trying to vote on it tonight. That is \nunthinkable: to have a 700-plus page piece of legislation, spending \nalmost $800 billion, and people who have not read it are going to vote \non it? Surely, that will not happen. It is not a good process, in my \nview.\n  I am disturbed about it, and I think the financial soul of our \ncountry is at stake. If this becomes a pattern, if this becomes the way \nwe do business and the way we spend money and throw money around, it \nseems to me, too much in a political way, rather than in a stimulative \nway, we will say to our constituents and to the world: The United \nStates does not have its house in order, it is not a safe place to put \nmoney, and there is no certainty about what will happen next because \nunpredictable Government actions may dwarf the natural economic forces \nthat people relied on in the past to make their investments. So I am \nworried about that.\n\n  I would share something here. When you get the Government spending a \nlarge amount of money, it creates a lot\n\n[[Page S2201]]\n\nof problems. Our economy has always been less dominated by Government \nspending than the European economies, at least Germany and France in \nparticular. They have had Government spending that represents as much \nas 45 or 50 percent of their gross domestic product. It is a huge \nportion of their economy. Their unemployment rate has always tended to \nbe higher than ours, and their growth has not kept up with ours.\n  One other thing happens when the Government injects itself into the \neconomy; and that is, it has a tendency to corrupt the Government \nitself. We have had a lot of criticisms about lobbyists, that we have \ntoo many lobbyists. Lobbyists have too much influence, and we should \nhave fewer lobbyists and they should have less influence. But as the \nsize and power of the Government expands, I think it is only natural \nthat one would expect companies worth billions of dollars would feel a \nnecessity to have more lobbyists. This is a Washington Times piece not \nlong ago dealing with the $700 billion Wall Street bailout, and it \nshows some of the things that were happening. During the fourth \nquarter, Citigroup had $1.28 million in lobbyist expenses. In the third \nquarter, they had $1.39 million in lobbyist expenses. People say, well, \nthat is unbelievable. That is a lot of money. There are 1,000 million \ndollars in a billion. That is how many 1 billion is, 1,000 million. \nDuring that time, Citigroup gets $45 billion from the U.S. Government. \nSo what is that? Forty-five billion is forty-five thousand million. So \nit is probably a pretty good idea, from the company's point of view, to \nspend $1 million on lobbyists. That is a pretty good bargain. That is \nall I am saying. The bigger the Government, the more the Government \ngets interfaced with what has historically been a private sector that \nwe didn't stick our nose in. Historically, the companies paid taxes, \nthey obeyed the law, and the Government didn't subsidize winners and \nlosers in the banking industry.\n  So AIG, they actually got, I think now, over $100 billion. They spent \n$390,000 in fourth quarter expenses. General Motors, look at that: \n$3,320,000. They got money out of this Wall Street financial bailout \nthat nobody ever thought they could get. They got the Government to \ngive them $10 billion. So I guess they consider $3 million in lobbying \nexpenses to be a pretty good bargain. Those are some of the dangers \nwhen we stick our nose into matters that we out not to meddle in.\n  Once again, I wish to share this chart because I think it is \ninstructive of the situation in which we find ourselves. Back in 2004, \nPresident Bush had the biggest deficit up to that time since World War \nII--maybe ever, in terms of real dollars. It was $413 billion. That is \nwhen he was criticized so aggressively, as many of my colleagues will \nremember, for reckless spending and running up the deficit. I thought a \nlot of that criticism was valid, but we had a war going on and we had \nsome other things. We didn't contain spending as well as we should \nhave. The recession that occurred was biting into revenue, and we ended \nup with a $413 billion deficit, the biggest we had ever had. It dropped \nin 2005 to $318 billion, it dropped to $248 billion in 2006, and in \n2007 the deficit dropped to $161 billion. It was definitely heading in \nthe right direction. That represented only 1.2 percent of GDP. This 3.6 \npercent of GDP for the deficit was the highest in about 30 years, since \nthe recession in 1980, as I recall.\n  So what about 2008, the last fiscal year, ending September 30 of \n2008. We sent out the $150 billion in checks to Americans in the hope \nthat it would do something good for the economy. People blamed the \nPresident for it. I think he deserves blame for it because it didn't \nwork. However, the President has no authority whatsoever to spend a \ndime that Congress doesn't give him. He had to come to Congress and ask \nfor that money. The Democratic leadership supported it and moved the \nbill forward, and we sent out the checks. That, plus the economic \nslowdown, caused the 2008 deficit. Last September 30, it was $455 \nbillion, the largest ever.\n  What about this year? Our own Congressional Budget Office has done \nsome analysis. And I would just say that the CBO is a nonpartisan \ngroup. We just elected a new Director. He was basically selected by the \nDemocratic majority. The Republican members of the Budget Committee \nliked him. We thought he was an honest, capable man, and we voted for \nhim. So we got a new Director. He is, I believe, an honorable person, \ngives us good numbers, as the previous Director did. So the CBO \nestimates, without the stimulus, the deficit ending September 30 of \nthis year will be $1.3 trillion. That will represent 8.3 percent of \nGDP, the highest ever.\n  Now we are about to pass another almost $800 billion stimulus package \non top of that. It all would not get spent in 2009. It is not all going \nto get spent before September 30 of this year, so of that 800 they are \nscoring about 232 to be spent in this year, meaning the total deficit \nwould be $1.4 trillion, three times--three times--the size of the \nhighest deficit we have ever had in history.\n  I have to tell my colleagues, Gary Becker, the Nobel Prize-winning \neconomist, and another one of his associates, just wrote an op-ed in \nthe Wall Street Journal. He questioned this stimulus package. He used \ncareful language. He said normally in a stimulus package, for every \ndollar you expend, you hope to get a dollar and a half of growth. He \nsaid in their opinion, because of the nature of this legislation--I \nwill say the political nature of it rather than the stimulus nature of \nit--they conclude each dollar spent will produce less than a dollar of \nstimulus.\n  So we are adding another $800 billion on to our debt total for very \nlittle benefit. When you go to next year, they are expecting it to be \nanother $1 trillion deficit and the year after that, $640 billion. By \nthe way, these 2 years at least have $70 billion more which will be \nadded because we are going to fix the AMT, the alternative minimum tax. \nIt costs $70 billion to fix it, and we do it every year, and that is \nnever scored until we fix it. So that will be added on to both of \nthose. Also, physicians are set to get a 20-percent reduction next year \nin their physician payments. Why do we do that? Well, we passed a law a \nlong time ago that would call for that. We have long since recognized \nwe can't cut our doctors' pay that way, we can't cut them 20 percent. \nEvery year, we put the money back in. It is about $30 billion, I \nbelieve, a year. That doesn't score in these numbers. So you can assume \nthe deficit next year will be at least about $100 billion higher than \ncurrent estimates. Those are gimmicks we use to hide the real nature of \nthe deficit.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, interest in the \nstimulus bill alone over the next 10 years will amount to $326 billion, \nand that includes the first 2 years when all is not yet spent. It will \nactually be about $40 billion a year thereafter once it all gets spent. \nThat is a huge thing. That is $400 billion every decade. Who is going \nto pay it? Our children and grandchildren. There is no plan to pay this \noff. So this is not a minor matter.\n  Finally, our own Congressional Budget Office, after studying this \npackage, concluded these things: It would have a temporary stimulus \neffect in the first 2 to 3 years, but over a 10-year period, they \nconclude the gross domestic product would grow less if the legislation \nwere enacted than if we didn't pass anything. They project that over a \n10-year period it would hurt the economy--not a lot, but it would be \ndown. Why? Because when we borrow $1 trillion from the private economy \nto pay this debt, it crowds out private people who may want to borrow \nmoney and create jobs.\n  Secondly, you have to pay the interest on it every year; we have to \npay $40 billion a year in interest. How much is $40 billion? That is \nthe amount of the entire Federal highway budget each year, $40 \nbillion--a lot of money. Now we are going to add that every year, just \nin interest, which we will be paying indefinitely. Some people have \nsaid--even some conservatives have said deficits don't matter. Wrong. \nDeficits do matter.\n\n  Finally, I would just point out these facts about why the bill is not \neffective to do what it says it wants to do, which is to create jobs. \nIt is simple arithmetic. We wrote this chart when the bill was $826 \nbillion. It actually came out of the Senate at $838 billion. We are \nhearing it is going to come out less than that, and that we will end up \nwith about $789 billion. So we don't know. Apparently, they are still \narguing over what to spend and how to spend the\n\n[[Page S2202]]\n\nmoney. The interest on that version, according to CBO, would run $347 \nbillion, give or take a billion or two, over the next decade.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So that totals over $1.1 trillion. You divide that out \nper taxpayer, per person who pays taxes--don't think that something can \nbe created for nothing. To inject $800 billion into the economy today, \nwe have to borrow it. How much does that mean that the average American \nis assuming as new debt? Well, what we conclude is--just from simple \narithmetic--it is about $8,400 per taxpayer. Think about that. Just \nlike that, we are going to pass a bill that over 10 years will cost \nover $1.1 trillion and increase the average taxpayer's share of the \ndebt by about $8,400. It is like adding it to your mortgage or \nsomething.\n  If it produces 3.9 million jobs, which is the high end of what the \nCongressional Budget Office says it would create--the goal for those \npushing the legislation say they want to create 4 million jobs. That is \nthe high side of what--it is higher, actually, than what CBO, our own \nbudget office, tells us it will create. So 3.9 million jobs, that costs \n$300,000 per job. Do the arithmetic.\n  Is that a good deal for America? Is that worth burdening us with \n$8,400 each? What if it came out on the low side? What if it only \ncreated 1.3 million jobs, which was the low side that CBO scored--1.3 \nto 3.9? That would be $900,000 per job.\n  Mr. President, I would say that, yes, we can do some things to \nimprove this economy, but we are moving a political agenda; we are \nmoving programmatic ideas. A lot of people might like to see some of \nthese things become law, but they don't want to go through the entire \nbudget process, to compete and debate. They just stick these programs \ninto this emergency stimulus bill that goes straight to the debt, none \nof which is paid for, and then it is all debt. I don't think it is a \ngood idea.\n  Good people might disagree, but I firmly believe it is not a good \nidea for my constituents. My phones are ringing off the hook against \nit. I don't believe it is good for my children, my grandchildren, or \nyours.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I understand we are in morning business \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, what we are debating in the Senate is \nabout fighting for the economic future of America.\n  Dr. King talked about the ``fierce urgency of now'' in the context of \na struggle for civil rights. We have to remember the fierce urgency of \nnow when we are tackling the worst economic crisis our country has seen \nin generations.\n  We have to understand the urgency for the 3.6 million Americans who \nhave lost their job since December 2007--almost 600,000 in the last \nmonth alone. It is an urgent situation when millions of American \nfamilies are in danger of losing their homes. It is a dire situation \nwhen State budgets are stretched so thin they have to watch school \nbuildings crumble. It is an emergency situation when local communities \nare forced to consider cutting police or firefighters who protect their \nresidents. It is an immediate crisis when a young girl needs an \noperation but her parents cannot afford health insurance. The Dow lost \n40 percent in a year's time. Businesses are closing. Life savings are \nbeing drained.\n  Even for the hard-working Americans who still have their jobs, \npensions, and health care, there is still a lot of fear out there that \ntheir careers and health insurance aren't secure; that the job loss or \nforeclosure that hit their neighbor might knock on their door next. Yet \nin the midst of all of that, I hear so many of my colleagues basically \nsaying: Oh, no, do nothing.\n  Without bold and decisive action, the country faces the possibility \nof a prolonged economic collapse rivaling the worst we have ever seen.\n  In a crisis this severe, the Federal Government has the \nresponsibility to step in and to stabilize the economy and lay the \ngroundwork for recovery. We are not just talking about the financial \nrecovery of individuals; we are talking about the renewal of a nation.\n  We have before us a tremendous opportunity to strengthen the 21st-\ncentury economy, to make investments so the private sector can create \nthe innovations that will help our country prosper in the future, to \ntransition away from fossil fuels and stop sending our money abroad, \nenhance America's energy security and meet the climate crisis that \nthreatens our planet.\n  We have an opportunity very soon to vote on a bold plan to create and \nmaintain more than 3.5 million jobs in America and 100,000 in my home \nState of New Jersey, helping workers damaged by this crisis and laying \nthe foundations for economic growth well into the future.\n  Is the bill we are considering perfect? No. But in my many years of \nlegislating, I have never seen a perfect bill. People are losing their \njobs, their homes, and their life savings. The unemployment rate in New \nJersey is the highest it has been in a decade and a half. More \nAmericans are filing first-time jobless claims than any time in a \nquarter of a century. This isn't a time for delay, and it isn't a time \nfor games or political posturing. It is time for quick, bold action. \nThis is a complicated piece of legislation, so I will take a little \ntime to lay out its most important provisions.\n  First, this bill brings tax relief to the middle class--about $230 \nbillion worth of tax cuts. In the Finance Committee, I introduced an \namendment to save over 1 million New Jerseyans from the alternative \nminimum tax, saving families up to $5,600.\n  That AMT tax was originally designed to ensure that the wealthiest \nAmericans could not use creative accounting to avoid all taxes, but it \nwas never intended to hit the middle class as hard as it is hitting \nthem now. If we don't act, millions of taxpayers could wake up next tax \nseason to realize they owe more in taxes even though their income \nhasn't changed.\n  The cornerstone of this legislation, in terms of tax relief, is a \nmaking work pay credit--the credit that is available to those who are \nworking. The average working family--95 percent of all working \nfamilies--are going to get a tax cut of up to $800 to put money back \ninto their pockets to support their families and, at the same time, \ncreate demand for goods and services in this economy that will be \nprovided largely by the private sector that creates other jobs for \nthose who provide those goods and service.\n  It expands the earned-income and child tax credit to help low-income \nworking families get through these difficult times. Those are the \nindividuals who need money, and when they have it, they spend it in an \neconomy that also creates demand for goods and services, created \nlargely by the private sector. In fact, 90 percent of all of the jobs \ncreated under this bill will be from the private sector. It supports \ntax incentives for businesses to make new investments and hire new \nemployees.\n  This recovery package would not just create jobs; it will create a \nnew generation of green jobs. What we are considering today is a green \nrecovery package, which will help change the direction of our economy \nfor one based on fossil fuels to one based on clean renewable energy. \nIt makes important investments in building efficiency, renewable fuels, \nclean vehicles, and green job training. It makes a massive investment \nin weatherizing homes, which will reduce emissions while bringing down \nenergy costs. All along the way, each of those initiatives creates a \ndifferent sector of the job marketplace that Americans will be able to \nfulfill.\n  Just like the rest of it, the energy piece of this legislation isn't \nperfect. I would have liked to have seen more support for mass transit. \nThey are facing major budget crises and have to consider service \ncutbacks, just as ridership is growing and climate change is \naccelerating. Transit funding is essential if we are going to meet our \nemissions goals, get cars off the streets, and keep efficient \ntransportation affordable.\n\n[[Page S2203]]\n\n  The Federal Government has been dragging its feet on energy security \nand climate change for too long. Our local governments have been \nleading the way. That is why I am proud to have created the energy \nefficiency and conservation block grant in 2007, along with Senator \nSanders, to help fund and reward them for that work. I am thrilled \nthis Economic Recovery Act contains substantial funding for these \ngrants, including tens of millions of dollars for New Jersey. Cities \nand communities across the country can use the funding to promote \nefficiency, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and invest in renewable \nenergy and the jobs that will go along with that in doing that work.\n\n  A municipality could work to insulate office buildings, install \nfluorescent light bulbs, install solar panels, invest in LED lighting \nfor traffic signals or purchase more efficient municipal vehicles. Of \ncourse, what a municipality would do for energy efficiency in New \nJersey would be different from what one might do in Alaska or Arizona. \nSo the funding allows for flexibility.\n  There is strong support for solar energy, including a manufacturing \ntax credit and tax incentives for homeowners to install solar panels. \nThat is good news for New Jersey, which is the second-biggest solar-\nproducing State in the country and where the solar cell was invented.\n  The support for energy efficiency is complemented by important \ninvestments in infrastructure. With this recovery plan, we can start \nbuilding and rehabilitating scores of roads, bridges, and bypasses.\n  We have the chance to secure a stream of funding to start \nconstruction on the ARC rail tunnel, to ease commutes across the \nHudson, reduce traffic, and clean our air. Most important, those kinds \nof projects put people to work. Not only the construction people but \nthe engineers and architects, the clerical workers in their office, and \neverybody who creates supplies for these jobs at their places of work, \nand the transportation that brings it to the job site. This is how we \ncreate all of these jobs, and they're mostly in the private sector.\n  We understand a major part of helping the economic recovery is \nallowing workers who have lost their jobs to keep their families \nafloat, develop the skills necessary to maintain long-term employment \nand find new jobs.\n  This economic recovery package makes exactly this type of bold \ninvestment. It helps States close gaps in their unemployment programs. \nIt rewards States for innovative reforms, providing benefits to more \nthan 500,000 workers a year who are now falling through the cracks of \nthe unemployment program. It stimulates the broader economy as every \ndollar put into the hands of temporarily displaced workers and their \nfamilies generates $1.64 in economic growth, whether it is spent on \nhousing, groceries, or other basic necessities.\n  For those who have fallen on the hardest of times--who have been laid \noff and haven't been able to find work and are having trouble putting \nfood on the table or keeping a roof overhead--the recovery package \nincludes important support for food assistance, as well as housing \nprograms that will help prevent foreclosures, rehabilitate homes, and \nprovide emergency housing in New Jersey.\n  This legislation that we are talking about is not only recovery but \ninvestment. This legislation also means about $4 billion for worker \ntraining and employment services. The labor market has fundamentally \nchanged. If we are going to stay competitive in our State and country, \nwe need to invest in human capital and give our workers the skills to \nthrive in the 21st-century economy.\n  Preparing those students and workers and those who will prepare them \nfor the high-tech, high-paying jobs means investing in education at \nevery level. That is also not only going to lay the foundation for \nlong-term economic growth but give immediate opportunities for jobs as \nwell. These are ways in which we, in fact, can modernize our schools. \nAt least 205 New Jersey schools will have the opportunity to modernize \nthemselves with the technology necessary and the laboratory necessary \nfor preparation for this 21st-century economy. It is an investment that \ncould mean the difference between a crumbling schoolroom and a science \nlab that prepares a child for a career in biomedical engineering.\n  I was raised in a tenement, poor, the son of immigrants, the first in \nmy family to go to college. I know I would not be standing in the \nSenate today if it weren't for the Federal Government's support and \nthose opportunities. Whether it is our public education program or in \ncollege through the Pell grants and the opportunities in the American \nopportunity tax credit to make college more affordable, it will produce \na workforce that can compete anywhere in the world and be able to \ncapture the new jobs created under this bill.\n  Any parent in America knows the challenges of affording health care, \neven if you haven't lost your job. Families working in low-wage or even \nmoderate-wage jobs struggle every month just to pay the bills, not to \nmention the medical bills on top of that. Those who have recently lost \njobs are pretty much out of luck. Unfortunately, a child's illness \ndoesn't always wait for a good-paying job with health care to come \nalong.\n  That is why we have included provisions in this bill to help States \ncontinue to provide health coverage to those children and families they \nare serving. For those who lose their jobs and their health insurance \nwith it, we have included a tax break to help them pay for the COBRA \ncoverage they are eligible for in between jobs.\n  I will end where this whole crisis began, in housing. This bill \nincludes provisions that will allow more families to get tax relief \nwhen they buy a home, provide additional funding for those who recently \nlost their home, and provide additional funding for a provision I \nauthored to help children affected by a home foreclosure stay in \nschool.\n  This plan may be detailed; the investments it makes may be diverse. \nBut we are not talking about just throwing money haphazardly. We \nunderstand every dollar in the plan belongs to the American taxpayer. \nThey deserve assurances that their money is invested wisely. So we are \ngoing to ensure unprecedented transparency, oversight, and \naccountability to the plan so Americans can see not only how their \nmoney is being spent, but also the results of their investments.\n  This includes requiring the President to report quarterly on the \nplan's progress, as well as establishing an oversight panel to review \nthe management of taxpayer dollars.\n  We have had a vigorous debate in the legislation. That is part of our \ndemocracy and it is always welcome. It has been troubling to me to see \nsuch a bad case of amnesia in some of my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle. I think it would make every American who loss his or her \njob in this recession cringe to hear that some of my Republican \ncolleagues want to repeat the policies that helped create this crisis \nin the first place.\n  Republican policies dominated the last Presidency over the last 8 \nyears and dominated Congress for a good part of that period of time. \nAll of a sudden, they are guardians of fiscal responsibility, after \ntaxing the middle class while passing capital gains and dividend tax \ncuts aimed at the wealthy, after turning President Clinton's record \nsurpluses into President Bush's record deficits and doubling the \nnational debt to more than $11 trillion--$11 trillion. If we did \nabsolutely nothing, if President Obama did absolutely nothing, he will \nhave inherited a $1.2 trillion debt. I hear these voices now of fiscal \nresponsibility. Where were they when they were driving this enormous \ndeficit to the Nation?\n\n  Now, to top it all off, they added amendment after amendment that \nadded to the debt, and then they turned around, after adding to the \ndebt and complaining about it, and voted against the package because \nthey said it adds too much to the Federal debt. Only in Washington can \none believe that.\n  Finally, I hope our Republican colleagues are not of the belief that \nby hoping this package does not succeed they will achieve political \nvictory because, in essence, they would be voting and betting against \nan American economic recovery, against the American people's hopes and \ndreams and aspirations to live a better life.\n  I fear, after reading some of the articles today, that is exactly \nwhere they are: no plan to meet the economic challenges we have, \ncomplain about the\n\n[[Page S2204]]\n\nplan that is there, and then ultimately find ourselves in a set of \ncircumstances in which they are betting against the American people and \nthis economic recovery. That is not only bad politics, it is pad policy \nfor the Nation. I hope they will see the light when it comes time to \nvote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, first, let me say to my distinguished \ncolleague from New Jersey, I sincerely appreciate his passion about \nthis problem. I think everyone on this side of the aisle likewise feels \nas passionately about the difficulties facing the American people \ntoday. There is no one who believes this is not a problem. There is no \none here who does not feel the empathy every one of us should feel \nabout Americans who are losing their jobs and about Americans who are \nunderemployed.\n  There are over 92 percent of Americans employed, but there are over 7 \npercent who are not. The fact that 92 percent are employed in no way \ndenigrates the fact that we have a substantial and a high rate of \nunemployment.\n  With all due respect to my colleague from New Jersey, he made \nreference to the fact that there are people encouraging that we do \nnothing. I don't know who that person is. I have not run into them yet. \nIt is not anyone on this floor that I know of.\n  I think this problem is so serious and I believe my Republican \ncolleagues believe this problem is so serious that it does not only \ndeserve something be done but that something major be done, something \naggressive be done, and something quickly be done.\n  With all due respect, I strongly disagree with his characterization \nthat there is anyone on this side of the aisle who hopes this plan does \nnot succeed. We pray every day that this package does succeed. It has \nto succeed. If it does not, this country is going to be in very serious \ntrouble.\n  Let there be no mistake about it, this is clearly a Democratic plan. \nThe people who are saying this is a bipartisan plan are flat wrong. \nThis is a Democratic plan. I hope it works. I pray that it works. I \npray that we will be able to come out here one day in the very near \nfuture and say congratulations to the Democrats for putting together \nthis package and putting it to work so that we turn this economy \naround. The Democrats own this plan.\n  Having said that, I urge, and my colleagues on this side of the aisle \nurge, that this is not just a single path that is going to take us out \nof the problem we have. Indeed, it is going to take more than just \nspending. Just spending has not worked in the past. It did not work at \nthe time of the Great Depression. It did not work for Japan in the \nnineties. It did not even work for us last year when this Congress gave \n$600 to every individual to go out and spend. It did not even put a \nblip on the screen as far as helping the downturn in the economy.\n  The real problem, the systemic problem is the frozen credit markets. \nIt is not Government spending that is going to get us out of this \nsituation; it is the spending by the great American people, by the \ngreat American consumer, by businesses large and businesses small. It \nis their spending that will get us out of the deep hole we are in.\n  With all due respect to my good friend from New Jersey, I would like \nto see as much passion about attacking the problem with the banking \nsector and the frozen credit markets that we are seeing for this \nspending of $800 billion which, when all is said and done, will turn \nout to be $1.2 trillion when we include the interest that is going to \nhave to be paid.\n  I congratulate the good Senator for referring to the work done in the \nhousing sector. With all due respect, I urge it is not enough. This \nSenate added an excellent provision to this particular package. It was \ntaken out when the conference committee met, and that portion that was \ntaken out reduced in half what needed to be done to help stimulate the \nhousing sector.\n  Mr. President, you heard my distinguished colleague from New Jersey \ntalk about the amount people will be able to use to go out and get a \nhome. It was reduced in the conference committee. It was cut virtually \nin half. On top of that, it only allows for first-time buyers, which \njust does not make sense. If we are trying to stimulate the housing \nsector, why just first-time house buyers? Everyone should be given this \nopportunity to go out and to purchase a new home or a previously \noccupied home and should get the credit.\n  With all due respect, what this Senate did was taken out in the \nconference committee. I would like to see the same passion as the other \ntwo paths--that is, attacking the frozen credit market and the housing \nsector--that we keep seeing from the other side as far as the spending \nof this $800 billion.\n  I close with this. I asked this on the floor the other day: Why $800 \nbillion? It is really important that history knows why America settled \non $800 billion. There is no doubt this is going to pass. The Democrats \nwill vote together on this. Three Republicans have shown they are going \nto vote with them. And there is no doubt this is going to pass. But we \nneed, America needs, America requires an explanation of why $800 \nbillion.\n  I heard the President of the United States say earlier this week: \nThat is not just a number I pulled out of the air. I take him at his \nword. If it was not just pulled out of the air, it was carefully \nconstructed with a formula. I want to see that formula. America wants \nto see that formula. Historians are going to need to see that formula \nbecause if it works, we are going to need that formula in the future \nagain someday. If it does not work, we need to look at that formula and \nsee if we can figure out why it did not work.\n  Somebody, please, deliver us that formula so we know how the number \nof $800 billion was reached. It could be $50 billion. It could be $200 \nbillion. It could be $600 billion. It could be $1.5 trillion. We don't \nknow. But if we have that formula, we Republicans can help fine-tune \nthat formula to either spend more if more needs to be spent based on \nthe formula or to spend less if less can be spent and if we can save \nthis money. We are strapping our children, grandchildren, and great \ngrandchildren with a horrendous debt. They are going to be paying this \nback. The money will have to be borrowed probably from China. They are \nthe ones who usually put up the money for this. Future generations are \ngoing to be working to pay back the Chinese Government $800 billion. \nFuture generations have the absolute right to know how this \nadministration and how the Democratic Party constructed a formula that \nspent $800 billion. It is only fair.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have been listening to the criticisms of \nthe recovery and reinvestment plan from the other side of the aisle, \nand I have tried to put them into categories so I can address them and \nconsider them. The first complaint appears to be that this is an $800 \nbillion stimulus package which will add to our deficit.\n  There is no question about the premise. The facts are right. It is \n$800 billion, and it will add to our deficit. But I find it interesting \nthat the Republicans who are criticizing this come from the same party \nwhich, over the last 8 years, saw America's national debt double from \n$5 trillion to $10 trillion and they went along with all of it. When \nthe President wanted a war and did not want to pay for it, which added \nto the debt of the country, they voted for it. The final cost was about \n$800 billion, and it is still accumulating. When the President wanted \ntax cuts in the midst of a weak economy, which added to the deficit--\nand cuts that went primarily to the wealthiest people--his Republican \nParty supported him and no questions asked.\n  In fact, the argument for many years was that deficits don't matter, \nwhen President Bush was in the White House, during that 8-year period \nof time. Now deficits do matter. It is an accumulated debt of America. \nIt has a lot of negative impact on our economy. But for a party which \nignored this reality for so many years to come and tell us now, in the \nmidst of the worst economic crisis in modern times, that\n\n[[Page S2205]]\n\nwe have to be so careful of the deficit we cannot address this economic \ncrisis, is a little hard to take. That is the first point.\n  The second point is they criticize this package for costing too much, \nwhen in fact on two separate occasions Republican Senators offered \namendments to this package which added to the costs dramatically. In \nthe Senate Finance Committee, the Republican Senator from Iowa offered \nan amendment that added $70 billion in cost to this package. It passed \nwith the support of both parties, I will add. At the end of the day, \nthe package cost $70 billion more, and the Senator from Iowa said he \ncouldn't vote for the final work product because it was too expensive. \nHe had authored an amendment that added $70 billion in cost and then \nsaid he couldn't vote for the package because it was too expensive.\n  Another Senator, from Georgia, added an amendment on the floor--I \nthought it was a thoughtful amendment--that added in cost $11 billion \nto $30 billion, by some estimates, to give incentives for people to buy \nhomes. It makes sense. We need help in the housing market. Yet this \nadded expense on the bill, this added amendment, which we adopted, \ncould not win that Senator's support. He too was critical of the final \nproduct: It cost too much.\n  So it is hard to follow why so many Republican Senators are \ncriticizing the President's attempt to get this economy back and moving \nforward, because they are saying it cost too much, when they introduced \nand passed amendments which added to the cost of the package. It \ndoesn't follow.\n  And the third point, made by the Republican leader, who came to the \nfloor today and criticized the compromise--the final bill here that we \nwill consider probably tomorrow night--said they cut back on some of \nthe tax cuts for working families.\n  It is true. The President's original proposal was $500 for \nindividuals, I think it was up to $70,000 or $80,000 in income, and \n$1,000 for families. Then when we had to cut back in the cost of the \noverall bill to win the support of several Republican Senators, the \nPresident offered to make a cutback in that area. So when we try to cut \nback in the cost of the bill to win Republican support, we are \ncriticized for those cutbacks; and when the bill comes to the \ncommittee, or to the floor, Republican Senators add amendments that add \ncost to the bill and then tell us it costs too much. It is hard to \nfollow their logic. I can't.\n  I am glad that it appears, with our fingers crossed, that there will \nbe at least 60 Senators tomorrow when we vote on this bill that will do \nsomething about the state of our economy. This President has inherited \nthe worst economic crisis of any President since Franklin Roosevelt's \nin 1933. This situation is terrible. It is no Great Depression, thank \ngoodness, but it is terrible. We have lost jobs all over America--\n500,000 jobs in the month of December--and 36,000 of them, \nincidentally, in my home State of Illinois. That is 1,200 jobs a day we \nhave lost in my State in December, I am afraid a like number in the \nmonth of January, and there is no end in sight.\n  The President has stepped up and said: We cannot let the American \neconomy slide into this spiral that is going to create so much hardship \nfor workers losing their jobs and businesses closing. We have to do \nsomething. We need a solution. We can't stand back and watch the parade \ngo by. We have to step in and try to stop the negative impact of this \neconomic crisis.\n  Most Americans--in fact, the overwhelming majority of Americans--\nbelieve the President is right in trying to solve this problem. He has \nsaid, and they understand, this may not be a 100-percent solution. At \nthe end of the day, we may need to do more or something different. But \nthe alternative is to do nothing, and that seems to be the position of \nmany Senators who are opposing this. They want to wait. They want to \nwait and see if this economy gets better or they want to return to the \nold-time religion. What is the old-time religion? It is what we tried \nlast April. When the economy was softening, President George W. Bush \ncame to us and said: I know the solution. I know how to get us out of \nthis problem. It is a tax cut.\n  Well, if you have been around Congress for a while, you know that \nwhen it comes to the Republican Party, the answer to every challenge, \nevery issue, every circumstance is a tax cut. We have a surplus. Is the \neconomy booming? Cut taxes. Do we have problems. Is the economy \ncratering? Cut taxes. Well, tax cuts do have value, but in certain \ncircumstances they may not work effectively. And we found out last \nApril that our $150 billion package--and I think that was the number--\nthat President Bush asked for, enacted by the Democratic Congress, \ndidn't work. I believe it was $300 to individuals and $600 to families. \nIt may have helped an individual family put some money in savings or \npay off a credit card, but at the end of the day, when you step back \nand look at the big picture--the macroeconomic picture--it didn't work. \nThe economy continued to slide downhill.\n  So the magic elixir of tax cuts, which we hear consistently from the \nRepublican side, even during this crisis, is one that has been tried \nand failed.\n  We included tax cuts in this package in an effort to try to win over \nsome Republican votes. It didn't work very well. We got no Republican \nsupport in the House and only three Republican Senators who stepped up \nin the Senate and said they would support it.\n  What we are trying here is something that is dramatically different; \nnot just tax cuts for working families, which they need, but injecting \nmoney into the economy. Why do we need to have the government spending \nmoney in this economy? Because Americans are not spending enough of \ntheir own money. We anticipate that this year Americans will spend \nabout $1 trillion less on goods and services than they ordinarily \nwould.\n  We have a gross domestic product of about $14 trillion a year. Well, \nthat is about 7 or 8 percent of it that won't be spent this year. And \nwhen you cut back in that much spending, when people are not buying the \nthings they buy--refrigerators and cars and homes and clothing, and all \nthe rest--jobs are lost, businesses contract, and our recession gets \ndeeper. So the President said: Let's put this money into a stimulus or \nrecovery package that will inject new life into this economy and try to \nget it moving forward again.\n  It turns out economists--conservatives, liberals, most economists--\nhave said it is worth a try. Historically, it has worked; we should do \nit now. And the President went further. He said that our goal will be \ncreating or saving 3\\1/2\\ million jobs over the next 2 years. That is \nan ambitious goal, and I hope we can reach it.\n  I know those on the other side criticize it. They say: You know what, \nwhen you take the total cost of this bill and divide it into the number \nof jobs, it is a fantastic amount of money for each job. But they have \nforgotten one basic thing: That new worker in Illinois or in Iowa is \nnot only going to get a paycheck, that worker is going to spend the \npaycheck. And when the worker spends the paycheck downtown, the people \nwho work at that shop have a job, too. And the people who work at the \nshop with the job take a paycheck home, and they will go to another \nshop and spend the paycheck. It moves through the economy over and over \nagain. So to argue that we are spending so much money for a single job \noverlooks the obvious, overlooks Economics 101. I think I learned this \nin Georgetown in one of the first classes. It is called the multiplier. \nThat says if I go out and spend a dollar at shop, then maybe 80 cents \nof that is going to be spent by a worker there, and on and on. So the \ndollar may turn out to be worth a lot more in terms of the economic \nactivity.\n\n  That is the President's goal, to create enough jobs and save enough \njobs to breathe life into this economy to start people moving forward \nagain with confidence in making purchases. That is the bottom line.\n  It also provides, this bill we are going to consider tomorrow, 40 \npercent in direct relief to working and middle-class families. I talked \nabout the President's tax cuts. He focuses on the working and middle-\nclass families. I think it is the right thing to do. It is about $400 \nan individual, $800 for a family. That will give them a helping hand.\n  It also doubles the renewable energy generating capacity of our \ncountry over 3 years. Is there anyone who doubts the President's \nposition that if we are going to have a strong economy over a long term \nwe need to have more\n\n[[Page S2206]]\n\nenergy independence, we need to have more renewable sustainable sources \nof energy right here in our country? This bill, this stimulus package, \ninvests in energy for America's future--good energy, reliable energy, \nenergy that we do not have to bargain with OPEC to have in future years \nto build our economy.\n  It invests $29 billion in the Clean Energy Finance Authority and \nrenewable tax credits. This is a way to encourage the renewable energy \nsector. In my State of Illinois, in the State of Iowa and a lot of \nother States, you see the wind turbines when you drive down the \nhighway. In one section of central Illinois are 240 wind turbines that \nwill generate enough clean electricity to supply the electricity needs \nof Bloomington-Normal, a large--at least by Illinois downstate \nstandards--metropolitan area. More and more of these need to be built. \nSolar panels, using wind energy, geothermal sources, all of these are \nclean, thoughtful, homegrown, and make us less dependent on energy \nsources from overseas.\n  There is also a dramatic investment, $150 billion, in infrastructure. \nInfrastructure is a generic word that does not paint a very specific \npicture. We are talking about roads and bridges and highways. We are \ntalking about making certain that what we have in our State and States \nacross the Nation is in good repair and safe, and is expanding \nopportunities for the economy to grow by building these roads and \nbridges for the future. It is money well spent, as far as I am \nconcerned.\n  And health care, too. The first casualty for unemployed workers is \nusually health insurance, so we want to help the families facing \nunemployment with the costs of health insurance. That to me is money \nwell spent. These families need the peace of mind to know that if \nsomebody gets sick they have a doctor they can go to and a medical bill \nthat at least will get a helping hand to be paid.\n  There is $25 billion for school construction--no, not for new \nbuildings but modernizing schools. If you bring energy efficiency to a \nschool, it is going to reduce the cost to the school district and to \nthe property taxpayers who sustain that district.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. In addition to that, we are going to try to make sure \nthis bill moves us forward when it comes to health care. One of the \nthings we need to do in America, which we have done in the Veterans' \nAdministration, is start putting medical records on computers. The \nimportance of that is obvious to anyone who has visited a modern \nhospital. You know if a doctor has access to all of your medical \nrecords on computer, or a nurse, that they are more likely to make a \nbetter diagnosis, come up with better treatment, save money in the \nprocess and have a safer outcome. So if we are going to move toward a \nhealth care system ready for this century, we need to bring the \nInternet into the hospital room and into the hospital setting. This \nbill makes the investment to do that. It is a critically important \ninvestment and it is the starting point I think in moving toward the \nhealth care system we need to provide for Americans.\n  There will be critics. Many of them want to do nothing, let the \neconomy solve its own problems. But most of them are not students of \nhistory. The last President facing a major economic crisis, who said \nlet's ride it out, was Herbert Hoover. Herbert Hoover, a Republican \nPresident during the Great Depression, said things will get better, the \neconomy will cure itself, the market is a miracle. Guess what happened. \nMore and more people lost jobs, more businesses failed, the stock \nmarket cratered and Franklin Roosevelt rode to the rescue.\n  We have to understand that standing back and watching this economy \ncrater is unacceptable. This President was elected last November 4 to \nbring real change to this town in the way we do business and real \nchange to this economy so we have a fighting chance for excellence in \nthe 21st century. I think he has the right approach.\n  Let me add another element. There is a big section of this bill that \ndemands accountability. All of us, whether we voted for or against \nPresident Bush's attempts to help the economy--all of us were \nfrustrated at the end of the day that so few dollars could be accounted \nfor. We gave them $350 billion. At the end of the day we wanted an \naccounting--those who voted for it and for the taxpayers. We couldn't \nget it. We still don't know what happened to the money.\n  This bill is different. This bill not only is going to provide \ninspectors general in each of the departments to watch the money as it \nis being spent, accountability through the States and through the local \nunits of government, but Web sites as well for taxpayers to follow the \ncourse of this bill. It is a new level of openness and transparency we \nhave not seen before and it is long overdue. I am glad it is there. I \nthink that kind of openness is what the American taxpayers want to see, \ntoo.\n  They want solutions, they do not want political squabbling. They want \nto have people working together here rather than like in the House of \nRepresentatives, where no Republicans would even support the idea of a \nstimulus package. They want accountability, transparency--so they know \ntheir Federal tax dollars are being spent wisely--and they want honesty \ntoo. This President has been honest from the beginning and he said: I \nbelieve this will work. The best minds in the economy tell me this will \nwork. If it does not, we are going to try something that does. We are \ngoing to be honest with you about the outcome here.\n  That is the best we can ask from our leaders, that they give it their \nbest effort, good-faith efforts to solve our problems and be honest \nwith us if they do not succeed. We need to succeed. There is too much \nat stake here.\n  I have seen it in Illinois. We have seen it all across this country. \nThis particular proposal for Illinois is one I am excited about, \ncreating or saving 148,000 jobs over the next 2 years. We need it. As I \nmentioned, we lost 36,000 jobs in December. We need to do something to \nstop this outflow of jobs.\n  A making work pay tax cut of up to $800 will affect about 5 million \nworkers and their families in my State; 156,000 families are going to \nbe eligible for an American opportunity tax credit, which makes college \naffordable. When I talk to college presidents, they tell me: I am \nworried. Kids are coming into the dean's office and saying: Dad's \nbusiness is going down or Mom lost her job. I may not be able to finish \nhere.\n  Let's give these families a helping hand, a tax credit so these kids \ncan stay in school. If these young people end up dropping out of school \nwith a mountain of student loans and no degree, that's the worst \npossible outcome. This will help us avoid it.\n  An additional $100 a month in unemployment insurance for those who \nlost their job doesn't sound like much to most families, but for these \nfolks $100 means an awful lot.\n  We are providing funding sufficient to modernize 412 schools in \nIllinois so our children have the labs and classrooms and libraries and \nenergy efficiency they need.\n  We are doubling the renewable energy generating capacity. I think \nthere will be more wind turbines that will be installed in my State. \nThere will be some happy farmers renting their plots of land for that \nand some communities that will have cleaner energy sources.\n  This is a bill that looks forward. To those looking in the rearview \nmirror of what we tried last year and want to try it again--we gave \nthem their chance and it didn't work. It is worth a try now. I am glad \nthree Republican Senators stepped forward and said they are willing to \ngive this President a chance. It shows the kind of bipartisan \ncooperation we need more of.\n  I hope at the end of the day even more will vote for this and I hope \nthe next time we debate an important issue on the floor that more \nSenators from both sides of the aisle will come together to solve the \nproblems the American people face and do the job they sent us here to \ndo.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have seen a whirlwind of activity on \nthis so-called economic stimulus package.\n  We began by watching the partisanship in the House prevail, where the\n\n[[Page S2207]]\n\nHouse passed a package strictly along party lines. No House Republican \nvoted for it. And 11 Democrats joined the Republicans in voting no.\n  Then we had a mark-up in the Senate Finance Committee, the committee \nthat I am ranking member on. Over 200 amendments were filed. Some \namendments were agreed to, like the amendment I filed for a 1-year \nalternative minimum tax ``AMT'' patch.\n  But many others, specifically Republican amendments, failed or were \nnever brought to a vote.\n  Unfortunately, there was a tacit agreement among the Democratic \nmembers of my committee to vote no on any Republican amendment, \nregardless of the merits. Those on my side of the aisle did not find \nthat very bipartisan.\n  Then a floor debate in the Senate ensued. It lasted a full week. I am \nhappy that the debate gave many Members on my side of the aisle an \nopportunity to discuss how this legislation could be improved. I was \ndismayed, however, on the process. For example, there were a number of \namendments that I filed that were never given a fair vote.\n  Bottom line, they were blocked. I was not the only Republican Senator \nthat got locked out of the process.\n  And speaking of process, let me briefly discuss how this conference \ncommittee process worked. Or shall I say did not work. It was not a \nconference that permitted bipartisan negotiations.\n  I have often used the following analogy to define bipartisanship. It \nis an analogy that married couples can understand. That analogy comes \nfrom the example of Barbara and Chuck Grassley going to buy a car. If I \nbuy the car and take it to Barbara that is not a truly marital \ndecision. If we both go to the dealership and agree on the car, then \nthat is truly a joint marital decision.\n  The same logic applies to bipartisan legislating. If Senator Reid \nshows me a deal that has been done by Democratic conferees, which he \nwas courteous enough to do Wednesday morning, without my participation \nas the leading Republican tax writer, that's not bipartisan. There is \nno ``bi'' in that partisan.\n  So let no one be mistaken that this conference agreement is the \nresult of bipartisan negotiations. While Republicans were courteously \nconsulted at the member and staff level, we were never at the \nnegotiating table. Speaker Pelosi best described the bottom line on the \nprocess.\n  She said: ``Yes, we wrote the bill. Yes, we won the election.'' That \nquote comes right out of the front page of the Washington Post, dated \nFriday, January 23, 2009.\n  Now, one can argue that all that I have just described is water under \nthe bridge. We now have a conference agreement that both Houses of \nCongress are on the verge of approving. I will be voting against the \npackage.\n  But before I cast my vote I wanted to take this time to applaud the \ninclusion of specific proposals in this conference agreement that I \nadvocated for. While being locked out of the process, I am happy to see \nthat my commonsense proposals were ultimately included in this final \nbill.\n  The first commonsense proposal is placing income limits on the \nsubsidy for COBRA benefits. As the provision was originally drafted, \nwhich provided involuntarily terminated workers a subsidy to help pay \nfor their health insurance, there were no income limits on the \neligibility for the subsidy.\n  I want to remind my friends in the media that the House passed this \nprovision with no income limits. The Senate Finance Committee approved \nthis provision with no income limits. And the Nelson-Collins \nsubstitute, which garnered 61 votes in the Senate, was passed with no \nincome limits.\n  That means if the original provision that cleared so many legislative \nhurdles made it into law, Wall Street CEOs and hedge fund managers, who \nmade millions of dollars while running our economy into the ground, \nwould have received a taxpayer-funded subsidy to pay for their health \ninsurance.\n  In my opinion, this is outrageous. Just last week the Obama \nadministration released guidelines for capping compensation paid to \nexecutives whose financial institution receives taxpayer dollars \nthrough the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The COBRA subsidy provision \nwas in clear contradiction to our President's policy.\n  During the Senate Finance Committee mark-up, however, I offered an \namendment that would have placed income limits on the eligibility for \nthe COBRA subsidy. When I offered my amendment, some Democratic \ncommittee members rebuffed my efforts with trumped up charges that the \nIRS would not be able to administer income limits. It appeared that my \nDemocratic friends on the committee, who voted in favor of the \nchairman's mark, wanted to give the taxpayer-funded subsidy to Wall \nStreet CEOs and hedge fund managers. But in the end, Chairman Baucus \ngave me a commitment to at least look at an income cap.\n  So I filed an amendment during the floor debate. And I continued \npressing the point both publicly and privately. I was disappointed that \nmy amendment was never given a fair vote.\n  Simply put, my amendment provided that if a worker who was \ninvoluntarily terminated from their job earned income in excess of \n$125,000 for individuals and $250,000 for families during 2008, this \nworker would not be eligible to receive the subsidy.\n  Some Members of this body asked me why I set these limits at $125,000 \nand $250,000. It is simple. When candidate Obama was campaigning to be \nPresident Obama, he continually said that he wanted to raise taxes on \nfamilies making over $250,000 a year. Why? Because then, candidate \nObama felt that these people are too ``rich'' to pay lower taxes.\n  So it logically followed that if these families are too ``rich'' to \nreceive a tax benefit in the form of lower taxes, are these people not \ntoo ``rich'' to receive a taxpayer-funded subsidy for health insurance?\n  I applaud the inclusion of income limits for the COBRA subsidy. \nAlthough, the income limits are set at $145,000 and $290,000, I am \nhappy that my work was the reason it was added during the conference \ncommittee.\n  The second proposal included in this final conference agreement is \nsomething that is of vital importance to workers who have been \ndisplaced by trade. I am talking about the temporary reauthorization of \nthe Trade Adjustment Assistance Act, or TAA.\n  At the beginning of this year, I engaged with Chairman Baucus and our \ncounterparts on the Ways and Means Committee, Chairman Rangel and \nRanking Member Camp, to see if we could work out a compromise to \nreauthorize the trade adjustment assistance programs that we could all \nsupport.\n  That engagement led to weeks of intensive negotiations. They were not \neasy negotiations. But they were truly bipartisan and bicameral \nnegotiations. And they resulted in a compromise that I am proud to \nsupport.\n  That is the way the process should work. I wish the rest of the \nprovisions in the conference report had been developed in such a \nbipartisan way. If they had, we would have seen more Republican support \nfor this conference report.\n  Hopefully, the majority will not repeat the partisan process that \nproduced this conference report.\n  I want to highlight some of the reasons why I support our compromise \non trade adjustment assistance.\n  The fact is, the current trade adjustment assistance program is not \ndoing enough to help American workers. It is outdated, overly rigid, \nand fails to incorporate appropriate oversight and accountability at \nthe State and Federal level.\n  Our compromise addresses each of those concerns.\n  First, it extends the benefits of the program to service workers. \nServices now account for almost 80 percent of our economy. It doesn't \nmake sense to exclude service workers from eligibility for trade \nadjustment assistance if they lose their job due to trade.\n  If a call center in the United States is closed and the operation \nmoved to India, for example, those workers are not currently eligible \nfor trade adjustment assistance. Our compromise changes that.\n  But it does so in a way that preserves the requirement that there be \na causal link between trade and the loss of a job. Our compromise \ntreats manufacturing workers and service workers the same, if trade \ncontributed importantly to the workers' job loss, then they may be \neligible for adjustment assistance.\n  We also improved the program by interjecting much more flexibility, \nso\n\n[[Page S2208]]\n\nthat individual workers are empowered to decide for themselves how best \nto respond if they lose their jobs.\n  Workers can choose between full-time and part-time training, or full-\ntime work with limited wage insurance. Trade-impacted workers can even \ntake advantage of training and case management services before they \nlose their jobs.\n  Our compromise increases the funding for worker retraining to \naccommodate these expansions in the pool of potentially eligible \nworkers and the array of benefits that are made available to eligible \nworkers.\n  But it does so in a way that protects against inefficient spending of \ntaxpayer dollars. For example, for the first time, we have capped \nfunding for administrative expenses at an amount equal to 10 percent of \ntraining funds. I insisted on that.\n  In addition, our compromise requires changes in the way the Secretary \nof Labor allocates and distributes funds, so that States that do not \nneed additional funds are not building up their kitties at the expense \nof States that need those funds now.\n  We also require States to implement control measures to ensure that \nthe data they collect and report is accurate and timely. The Department \nof Labor needs accurate data in order to administer the trade \nadjustment assistance program efficiently.\n  And we require the Department of Labor to collect and post the data \non the Department's Web site, to increase transparency and make the \ninformation more readily accessible to the public.\n  I am confident that the compromise legislation that it have helped to \ncraft will provide immediate and long-term benefits for workers in Iowa \nand across the United States.\n  Separately, our compromise reauthorizes the trade adjustment \nassistance for firms program, and it improves and reauthorizes the \ntrade adjustment assistance for farmers program.\n  The farmers program was enacted as part of the Trade Act of 2002, and \nit has not operated as planned.\n  We have made it easier for farmers to demonstrate that they are \neligible for benefits under the program, and we have redirected those \nbenefits to focus on developing and implementing business plans to \nbetter adjust to imports.\n  We also established a trade adjustment assistance for communities \nprogram to help entire communities respond to the pressures of \nglobalization. One component of that program is a new community college \nand career training grant program which I have been working to develop \nover the past few years.\n  This is a timely, targeted, and temporary grant program to help \neducational institutions develop and offer the most appropriate courses \nto retrain trade-impacted workers.\n  The program will improve and expand the educational opportunities \navailable to eligible workers. It is an investment in the long-term \ncompetitiveness of the American workforce.\n  Mr. President, I have already noted that our compromise is the result \nof a bipartisan effort that reflects the work of four offices.\n  There are portions of the amendment that I might have done \ndifferently if it were solely up to me.\n  But that is the nature of compromise. And the overall policy embodied \nin this amendment is a good one that will do a lot of good for a lot of \nAmericans, in Iowa and across the United States.\n  Equally important, if we enact this amendment into law, it will help \nunlock the trade agenda so we can progress with other important \npriorities.\n  Chief among those is implementation of the Colombia trade agreement, \nwhich is my top trade priority.\n  And then we need to turn to our other trade agreements with Panama \nand South Korea as well.\n  We need to level the playing field so that our exporters, service \nsuppliers, and farmers can increase their sales to foreign countries.\n  It is more important than ever.\n  We have had a social compact on trade for over 45 years.\n  One side of that compact is to address them of trade-displaced \nworkers, and we are doing that with the compromise I have helped to \nnegotiate on trade adjustment assistance.\n  The other side is to open up new markets for U.S. exports. That was a \ndriving principle when President Kennedy established the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance program.\n  President Obama should hold true to that principle by doing \neverything he can to create new export opportunities, starting with \nimplementation of our pending trade agreements.\n  A pro-growth trade agenda should be integral to our economic recovery \nstrategy. I stand ready to work with the President and my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to accomplish that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the conference report for H.R. 1, the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, includes provisions \nthat would modernize and expand the trade adjustment assistance program \nto reflect today's economy. This has been my highest trade priority. It \nhas been the priority of workers and labor unions. And it has been the \npriority of the business community. We all recognize the importance of \npassing a TAA bill that helps American workers, firms, farmers and \ncommunities.\n  Earlier this week, I received letters of support from the following \ngroups: AFL-CIO; Change to Win; United Auto Workers; United \nSteelworkers; Trade and American Competitiveness Coalition with over 50 \nbusinesses; and the Information Technology Industry Council. I ask \nunanimous consent that a few of these letters of support be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                Change to Win,\n\n     Washington, DC, February 11, 2009.\n     Hon.

Nancy Pelosi,\n     Speaker of the House,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     House Minority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressional Leaders and Conferees: Change to Win's \n     seven affiliated unions and more than six million members \n     urge you to include the Baucus-Grassley-Rangel-Camp Trade \n     Adjustment Assistance amendment in the American Recovery and \n     Reinvestment Act conference report.\n       This amendment will bring many long-needed improvements in \n     the TAA program, such as extending assistance to workers in \n     services-related industries, increasing access to wage \n     insurance and health insurance benefits, and expanding \n     training. This bipartisan, bicameral compromise is an \n     important part of our economic recovery and should be \n     incorporated into the recovery package.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Christopher Chafe,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 February 9, 2009.\n     Hon.

Nancy Pelosi,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Reid: This week the \n     House and Senate are expected to have a conference on the \n     proposed American Economic Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The \n     UAW wishes to share with you and the other conferees our \n     views on several important provisions in this legislation.\n       The UAW strongly supports the core elements of the House \n     and Senate bills, including the provisions that would:\n       Give tax relief to 95% of working families, amounting to \n     $500 for individuals and $1,000 for couples;\n       Increase spending on infrastructure, energy efficiency, and \n     health care information technology;\n       Provide fiscal relief for states and localities through an \n     increase in FMAP and other mechanisms; and\n       Extend assistance to the unemployed through an extension \n     and expansion of UI benefits and COBRA.\n       We believe these initiatives will create millions of jobs \n     and provide an immediate stimulus for our economy, while also \n     helping to alleviate the impact of the current recession on \n     the most vulnerable Americans. Many of these measures also \n     represent important investments that will lay the basis for \n     long-term economic growth.\n       The UAW applauds the inclusion of provisions in the House \n     and Senate bills that would encourage investment in advanced \n     technology vehicles and their key components, while also \n     providing assistance to the struggling domestic auto \n     industry. This includes funding for advanced battery \n     manufacturing, the purchase of fuel efficient vehicles by the \n     federal government, and the purchase and manufacturing of \n     plug-in hybrids, as well as monetization of banked tax \n     credits and restoration of the tax deduction for interest and \n     taxes related to the purchase of vehicles. We urge you to \n     retain these provisions in the final conference report.\n       In addition to these elements, the UAW urges you to include \n     in the final conference report:\n       The stronger Buy American language in the Senate bill; \n     these provisions will help to ensure that taxpayer funds are \n     used to create jobs for American workers and to stimulate the \n     U.S. economy, rather than being sent overseas;\n       The TAA reform package that has been agreed to by Senators \n     Baucus and Grassley and Representatives Rangel and Camp; \n     these historic reforms will provide vital assistance to \n     workers who have lost their jobs due to trade, and correct \n     numerous longstanding deficiencies in the TAA program;\n       The more expansive provisions in the House bill that would \n     provide health care to more laid off workers both through an \n     expansion of Medicaid and through a 65% subsidy under COBRA; \n     and\n       The provisions in the House bill that would provide greater \n     spending for school construction and assistance to states and \n     localities; in addition to generating jobs and boosting the \n     economy, these measures would provide important investments \n     in education and other vital social programs.\n       The UAW believes it is critically important that Congress \n     act quickly to approve the proposed American Recovery and \n     Reinvestment Act. Thank you for considering the points \n     discussed above as you fashion the final conference report on \n     this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Alan Reuther,\n                                             Legislative Director.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I have always been a steadfast supporter \nof Federal funding for museums and the arts in New York and across the \ncountry. When I voted in favor of Senator Coburn's amendment No. 309 to \nH.R. 1, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, I thought the \namendment was only targeted to casinos and golf courses and was not \naware it also included museums and other cultural centers. The arts \ncommunity knows they have had--and will certainly continue to have--my \nfull support.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the papers from the House will be here \nmomentarily, within the next few minutes. Senator McConnell and I have \nspoken a number of times during the day. We believe it is fair that \nMembers have an opportunity to study this big document. The basic \ndocument people have already read but, of course, that is what the \nconference is about. They change things. So this should be here in a \nshort time. This will give Members all night to look at this. Senator \nMcConnell and I talked a few minutes ago. We will come in tomorrow at a \nreasonable hour, spend all day debating this. This would give people \nthe opportunity to read all the papers. Then we would vote sometime \nlate tomorrow afternoon or in the early evening. I have talked to \nSenator McConnell. He has been certainly more than fair. As everyone \nknows, Senator Kennedy is ill. He came here earlier this week, and it \nwould be to his health advantage not to have to come back tomorrow. \nSenator McConnell has agreed that is, in fact, the case. It doesn't \nchange the vote count, but it means we can set a definite time which is \nvery helpful.\n  In addition, Senator Brown's mother died. The celebration of his \nmother's life starts tomorrow. Senator Brown has agreed to leave for, I \ndon't know what it would be called in his religious belief, a viewing, \nand people will come and greet his family. It is a very large extended \nfamily. They will do that. That would be completed around 8 tomorrow \nnight. So we are going to keep the vote open for Senator Brown until he \narrives tomorrow night. This is not the first time we have done this.\n  I have announced we will hold our votes to 15 minutes, plus we give \nMembers 5 minutes' leeway. After that, the vote is closed. But we have \nalways said that on a close vote, we would keep the vote open until \neverything is done. Everyone understands that when one's mother dies, \nwe have to be a little more understanding of the situation. This is \nvery difficult for Sherrod Brown to go home because he has to turn \nright around and come back here the same night. He is going to fly here \nand fly back the same night so he can be at the funeral Saturday \nmorning. I appreciate Senator McConnell and all Senators working toward \ndoing this. We will come in at some reasonable time and enter a \nunanimous consent request that I am confident will be granted so we can \ndo this. We are going to close shortly and come back in the morning at \nan agreed-upon time with the minority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/12/senate-section/article/S2209-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2209-S2210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NAACP\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the 100th anniversary \nof the founding of the National Association for the Advancement of \nColored People, NAACP, and to congratulate this remarkable organization \non its historic achievements.\n  In the summer of 1908, a race riot took place in Springfield, IL, my \nhometown and the hometown of President Abraham Lincoln. A mob of White \nresidents destroyed homes and businesses owned by African Americans, \nand forced thousands of Black residents to flee Springfield. Two \nprominent Black men were lynched within half a mile of the home \nPresident Lincoln had owned and within 2 miles of his grave.\n  One of these two men was William Donnegan, a longtime resident of \nSpringfield who was a friend of President Lincoln and the cobbler who \nmade the President's boots. The mob went to Mr. Donnegan's home, cut \nhis throat and lynched him in a school yard across the street.\n  These tragic events were widely reported at the time and shocked the \nNation. It seemed clear that if African Americans living in President \nLincoln's hometown could be attacked, then such violence could happen \nanywhere in the Unites States.\n\n[[Page S2210]]\n\n  A group of brave individuals responded to these events by \nestablishing the NAACP 100 years ago today, turning tragedy into hope \nfor a better future. The founders of the NAACP issued a call to the \nNation on President Lincoln's birthday in 1909, urging their fellow \nAmericans to take stock of the progress since the Emancipation \nProclamation and to measure how well the country had lived up to its \nobligation to ensure that each and every citizen was afforded equal \nopportunity and protection.\n  Less than 50 years after the end of the Civil War, the founders of \nthe NAACP concluded that President Lincoln would be tremendously \ndisappointed by the situation in 1909: the disenfranchisement of \nAfrican Americans in several States between 1890 and 1908, the failure \nof the Supreme Court to strike down these disenfranchisement \nprovisions, the segregation in trains and other public places, and \nattacks on African Americans, even in his hometown of Springfield, IL.\n  In 1909, Springfield held a banquet to celebrate President Lincoln's \ncentennial. Booker T. Washington was invited to speak at this banquet, \nbut declined to come to the city where race riots had taken place only \n6 months before. Not a single African-American resident of Springfield \nwas invited to this banquet. Black residents of Springfield held their \nown commemoration at the nearby African Methodist Episcopal Church, \nwhere the Reverend L. H. Magee expressed his disappointment at the \nexclusion of African Americans from the official commemoration of the \nLincoln Centennial and predicted that by the bicentennial in 2009 \nAmericans would have banished prejudice.\n  Over the last 100 years, the NAACP has been at the forefront of the \nstruggle for equality. The NAACP led the fight to desegregate public \nschools, culminating in the Supreme Court's 1954 Brown v. Board of \nEducation decision, and played a central role in the passage of the \n1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Thanks to the \nhard work of the NAACP and many others, we have taken tremendous steps \nsince the tragic events that led to its creation.\n  Tonight, at Springfield's bicentennial banquet in honor of President \nLincoln, the minister of the African Methodist Episcopal Church will \ndeliver the benediction and President Barack Obama will be the keynote \nspeaker. President Obama's election and so much else that we treasure \nabout America today is possible in part because of the vision and \nleadership of Abraham Lincoln and shows that there is still within us a \npassionate longing to be the America that President Lincoln believed we \ncould and must become.\n  A hundred years later, I believe the founders of the NAACP might \nconclude that President Lincoln would be proud about many things in our \ncountry. But I think they would also remind us that there is still much \nto be done in the struggle for equality for all persons. I am reassured \nin knowing that the NACCP will continue to lead the fight to ensure \npolitical, educational, social and economic equality for all persons.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the 100th \nanniversary of the founding of the National Association for the \nAdvancement of Colored People, NAACP, one of our Nation's oldest and \nmost influential civil rights organizations.\n  Founded on February 12, 1909, the NAACP's original and primary goal \nwas to secure for African Americans the rights that our Constitution \nguarantees under the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments. The NAACP played a \nleading role in the civil rights movement in the mid-20th century, \nstirring the conscience of our nation against segregation and \ninstitutionalized racism. Today, the NAACP continues its work to \neliminate racial prejudice, and the organization has expanded its \nendeavors to ensure equal access to political, educational, social and \neconomic advancement for all Americans.\n  Throughout its 100-year history, the NAACP has effected change at all \nlevels of society and politics, working tirelessly through organizing, \nadvocacy, and judicial action. From a small group of determined \ncitizens in the early 1900s to an organization with over a half-million \nmembers and supporters today, the NAACP has established itself \nthroughout America and the world as a leading champion for civil and \nhuman rights.\n  I am proud to be a lifetime member of the NAACP. I share its desire \nto ensure economic fairness and social justice in this country, and I \nam pleased to congratulate the NAACP on the occasion of its 100th \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/12/senate-section/article/S2210-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SOUTHEAST ARIZONA LAND EXCHANGE AND CONSERVATION ACT OF 2009\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, yesterday I was pleased to join with Senator \nMcCain to introduce the Southeast Arizona Land Exchange and \nConservation Act, which has been introduced in previous Congresses and \nhas been modified only slightly from the version introduced last year. \nThis bill is a culmination of several years of negotiation with local \nand State stakeholders and other interested parties.\n  Let me briefly explain the new provisions in this bill. First, a \nprevious version of this bill would have placed 822 acres of Federal \nland, including the Apache Leap, in a conservation easement to ensure \nthat these sensitive lands were protected. This modified bill goes a \nstep further by keeping the Apache Leap under the control of the Forest \nService, thereby providing Federal protection in perpetuity. In \naddition, I am pleased to announce that representatives from Resolution \nCopper have agreed to add an additional 110 acres of privately owned \nland adjacent to the federally owned portion of the Leap in this \nversion of the land exchange.\n  Besides addressing concerns with Apache Leap, this modified bill also \nwould provide for continued acorn gathering by the Apache tribes at the \nOak Flat campground, and transfer additional private lands that will \nalso serve this purpose.\n  In summary, this land exchange would preserve highly sought after \nland that is important for wildlife habitat, cultural resources, \nwatershed and land-management objectives; promote outdoor recreation \nand tourism; and generate economic opportunities for state and local \nresidents in the copper triangle region in Arizona. It is good for our \nenvironment and our economy. At a time when our economy is in desperate \nneed of new jobs, this land exchange could create more than a thousand \njobs at its peak, and generate more than $10 billion in total Federal, \nState, county and local tax revenues. The mine could also meet as much \nas a quarter of the U.S. demand for copper in the future.\n  I urge my colleagues to approve the legislation at the earliest \npossible date.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/12/senate-section/article/S2210-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2210-S2222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SELECT COMMITTEE ON ETHICS RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

No provisions of the Senate Code \n     of Official Conduct shall apply to or require disclosure of \n     any act, relationship, or transaction which occurred prior to \n     the effective date of the applicable provision of the Code. \n     The Select Committee may initiate an adjudicatory review of \n     any alleged violation of a rule or law which was in effect \n     prior to the enactment of the Senate Code of Official Conduct \n     if the alleged violation occurred while such rule or law was \n     in effect and the violation was not a matter resolved on the \n     merits by the predecessor Select Committee.\n       (h) The Select Committee shall adopt written rules setting \n     forth procedures to be used in conducting preliminary \n     inquiries and adjudicatory reviews.\n       (i) The Select Committee from time to time shall transmit \n     to the Senate its recommendation as to any legislative \n     measures which it may consider to be necessary for the \n     effective discharge of its duties.\n       Sec. 3.

But if \n     either the Chairman or Vice Chairman continues to believe \n     that the member is ineligible, while the member believes that \n     he or she is not ineligible, the matter shall be promptly \n     referred to the Committee. The member shall present his or \n     her arguments to the Committee in executive session. Any \n     contested questions concerning a member's eligibility shall \n     be decided by a majority vote of the Committee, meeting in \n     executive session, with the member in question not \n     participating.\n       (3) A member of the Committee may, at the discretion of the \n     member, disqualify himself or herself from participating in \n     any preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review pending before \n     the Committee and the determinations and recommendations of \n     the Committee with respect to any such preliminary inquiry or \n     adjudicatory review.\n       (4) Whenever any member of the Committee is ineligible \n     under paragraph (1) to participate in any preliminary inquiry \n     or adjudicatory review, or disqualifies himself or herself \n     under paragraph (3) from participating in any preliminary \n     inquiry or adjudicatory review, another Senator shall be \n     appointed by the Senate to serve as a member of the \n     Committee solely for purposes of such preliminary inquiry \n     or adjudicatory review and the determinations and \n     recommendations of the Committee with respect to such \n     preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review. Any member of \n     the Senate appointed for such purposes shall be of the \n     same party as the member who is ineligible or disqualifies \n     himself or herself.\n       (5) The President of the Senate shall be given written \n     notice of the ineligibility or disqualification of any member \n     from any preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review, or other \n     proceeding requiring the appointment of another member in \n     accordance with subparagraph (k)(4).\n       (6) A member of the Committee staff shall be ineligible to \n     participate in any Committee proceeding that the staff \n     director or outside counsel determines relates specifically \n     to any of the following:\n       (A) the staff member's own conduct;\n       (B) the conduct of any employee that the staff member \n     supervises;\n       (C) the conduct of any member, officer or employee for whom \n     the staff member has worked for any substantial period; or\n       (D) a complaint, sworn or unsworn, that was filed by the \n     staff member.

In any such \n     case an absent member's vote may be announced solely for the \n     purpose of recording the member's position and such announced \n     votes shall not be counted for or against the motion.\n       (2) On matters other than matters listed in paragraph \n     (m)(1) above, the Committee may order that the record be held \n     open for the vote of absentees or recorded proxy votes if the \n     absent Committee member has been informed of the matter on \n     which the vote occurs and has affirmatively requested of the \n     Chairman or Vice Chairman in writing that he be so recorded.\n       (3) All proxies shall be in writing, and shall be delivered \n     to the Chairman or Vice Chairman to be recorded.\n       (4) Proxies shall not be considered for the purpose of \n     establishing a quorum.\n       (n) APPROVAL OF BLIND TRUSTS AND FOREIGN TRAVEL REQUESTS \n     BETWEEN SESSIONS AND DURING EXTENDED RECESSES: During any \n     period in which the Senate stands in adjournment between \n     sessions of the Congress or stands in a recess scheduled to \n     extend beyond fourteen days, the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     or their designees, acting jointly, are authorized to approve \n     or disapprove blind trusts under the provision of Rule XXXIV.\n       (o) COMMITTEE USE OF SERVICES OR EMPLOYEES OF OTHER \n     AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS: With the prior consent of the \n     department or agency involved, the Committee may (1) utilize \n     the services, information, or facilities of any such \n     department or agency of the Government, and (2) employ on a \n     reimbursable basis or otherwise the services of such \n     personnel of any such department or agency as it deems \n     advisable. With the consent of any other committee of the \n     Senate, or any subcommittee, the Committee may utilize the \n     facilities and the services of the staff of such other \n     committee or subcommittee whenever the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman of the Committee, acting jointly, determine that \n     such action is necessary and appropriate.\n\n     RULE 2: PROCEDURES FOR COMPLAINTS, ALLEGATIONS, OR INFORMATION\n\n       (a) COMPLAINT, ALLEGATION, OR INFORMATION: Any member or \n     staff member of the Committee shall report to the Committee, \n     and any other person may report to the Committee, a sworn \n     complaint or other allegation or information, alleging that \n     any Senator, or officer, or employee of the Senate has \n     violated a law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, or any \n     rule or regulation of the Senate relating to the conduct of \n     any individual in the performance of his or her duty as a \n     Member, officer, or employee of the Senate, or has engaged in \n     improper conduct which may reflect upon the Senate. Such \n     complaints or allegations or information may be reported to \n     the Chairman, the Vice Chairman, a Committee member, or a \n     Committee staff member.\n       (b) SOURCE OF COMPLAINT, ALLEGATION, OR INFORMATION: \n     Complaints, allegations, and information to be reported to\n\n[[Page S2216]]\n\n     the Committee may be obtained from a variety of sources, \n     including but not limited to the following:\n       (1) sworn complaints, defined as a written statement of \n     facts, submitted under penalty of perjury, within the \n     personal knowledge of the complainant alleging a violation of \n     law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, or any other rule \n     or regulation of the Senate relating to the conduct of \n     individuals in the performance of their duties as members, \n     officers, or employees of the Senate;\n       (2) anonymous or informal complaints;\n       (3) information developed during a study or inquiry by the \n     Committee or other committees or subcommittees of the Senate, \n     including information obtained in connection with legislative \n     or general oversight hearings;\n       (4) information reported by the news media; or\n       (5) information obtained from any individual, agency or \n     department of the executive branch of the Federal Government.\n       (c) FORM AND CONTENT OF COMPLAINTS: A complaint need not be \n     sworn nor must it be in any particular form to receive \n     Committee consideration, but the preferred complaint will:\n       (1) state, whenever possible, the name, address, and \n     telephone number of the party filing the complaint;\n       (2) provide the name of each member, officer or employee of \n     the Senate who is specifically alleged to have engaged in \n     improper conduct or committed a violation;\n       (3) state the nature of the alleged improper conduct or \n     violation;\n       (4) supply all documents in the possession of the party \n     filing the complaint relevant to or in support of his or her \n     allegations as an attachment to the complaint.\n\n        RULE 3: PROCEDURES FOR CONDUCTING A PRELIMINARY INQUIRY\n\n       (a) DEFINITION OF PRELIMINARY INQUIRY: A ``preliminary \n     inquiry'' is a proceeding undertaken by the Committee \n     following the receipt of a complaint or allegation of, or \n     information about, misconduct by a Member, officer, or \n     employee of the Senate to determine whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred.\n       (b) BASIS FOR PRELIMINARY INQUIRY: The Committee shall \n     promptly commence a preliminary inquiry whenever it has \n     received a sworn complaint, or other allegation of, or \n     information about, alleged misconduct or violations pursuant \n     to Rule 2.\n       (c) SCOPE OF PRELIMINARY INQUIRY:\n       (1) The preliminary inquiry shall be of such duration and \n     scope as is necessary to determine whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, on behalf of the Committee \n     may supervise and determine the appropriate duration, scope, \n     and conduct of a preliminary inquiry. Whether a preliminary \n     inquiry is conducted jointly by the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman or by the Committee as a whole, the day to day \n     supervision of a preliminary inquiry rests with the Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (2) A preliminary inquiry may include any inquiries, \n     interviews, sworn statements, depositions, or subpoenas \n     deemed appropriate to obtain information upon which to make \n     any determination provided for by this Rule.\n       (d) OPPORTUNITY FOR RESPONSE: A preliminary inquiry may \n     include an opportunity for any known respondent or his or her \n     designated representative to present either a written or oral \n     statement, or to respond orally to questions from the \n     Committee. Such an oral statement or answers shall be \n     transcribed and signed by the person providing the statement \n     or answers.\n       (e) STATUS REPORTS: The Committee staff or outside counsel \n     shall periodically report to the Committee in the form and \n     according to the schedule prescribed by the Committee. The \n     reports shall be confidential.\n       (f) FINAL REPORT: When the preliminary inquiry is \n     completed, the staff or outside counsel shall make a \n     confidential report, oral or written, to the Committee on \n     findings and recommendations, as appropriate.\n       (g) COMMITTEE ACTION: As soon as practicable following \n     submission of the report on the preliminary inquiry, the \n     Committee shall determine by a recorded vote whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Committee \n     may make any of the following determinations:\n       (1) The Committee may determine that there is not such \n     substantial credible evidence and, in such case, the \n     Committee shall dismiss the matter. The Committee, or \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman acting jointly on behalf of \n     the Committee, may dismiss any matter which, after a \n     preliminary inquiry, is determined to lack substantial \n     merit. The Committee shall inform the complainant of the \n     dismissal.\n       (2) The Committee may determine that there is such \n     substantial credible evidence, but that the alleged violation \n     is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de minimis \n     nature. In such case, the Committee may dispose of the matter \n     by issuing a public or private letter of admonition, which \n     shall not be considered discipline and which shall not be \n     subject to appeal to the Senate. The issuance of a letter of \n     admonition must be approved by the affirmative recorded vote \n     of no fewer than four members of the Committee voting.\n       (3) The Committee may determine that there is such \n     substantial credible evidence and that the matter cannot be \n     appropriately disposed of under paragraph (2). In such case, \n     the Committee shall promptly initiate an adjudicatory review \n     in accordance with Rule 4. No adjudicatory review of conduct \n     of a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate may be \n     initiated except by the affirmative recorded vote of not less \n     than four members of the Committee.\n\n        RULE 4: PROCEDURES FOR CONDUCTING AN ADJUDICATORY REVIEW\n\n       (a) DEFINITION OF ADJUDICATORY REVIEW: An ``adjudicatory \n     review'' is a proceeding undertaken by the Committee after a \n     finding, on the basis of a preliminary inquiry, that there is \n     substantial cause for the Committee to conclude that a \n     violation within the jurisdiction of the Committee has \n     occurred.\n       (b) SCOPE OF ADJUDICATORY REVIEW: When the Committee \n     decides to conduct an adjudicatory review, it shall be of \n     such duration and scope as is necessary for the Committee to \n     determine whether a violation within its jurisdiction has \n     occurred. An adjudicatory review shall be conducted by \n     outside counsel as authorized by section 3(b)(1) of Senate \n     Resolution 338 unless the Committee determines not to use \n     outside counsel. In the course of the adjudicatory review, \n     designated outside counsel, or if the Committee determines \n     not to use outside counsel, the Committee or its staff, may \n     conduct any inquiries or interviews, take sworn statements, \n     use compulsory process as described in Rule 6, or take any \n     other actions that the Committee deems appropriate to secure \n     the evidence necessary to make a determination.\n       (c) NOTICE TO RESPONDENT: The Committee shall give written \n     notice to any known respondent who is the subject of an \n     adjudicatory review. The notice shall be sent to the \n     respondent no later than five working days after the \n     Committee has voted to conduct an adjudicatory review. The \n     notice shall include a statement of the nature of the \n     possible violation, and description of the evidence \n     indicating that a possible violation occurred. The Committee \n     may offer the respondent an opportunity to present a \n     statement, orally or in writing, or to respond to questions \n     from members of the Committee, the Committee staff, or \n     outside counsel.\n       (d) RIGHT TO A HEARING: The Committee shall accord a \n     respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends \n     disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate or \n     before it imposes an order of restitution or reprimand (not \n     requiring discipline by the full Senate).\n       (e) PROGRESS REPORTS TO COMMITTEE: The Committee staff or \n     outside counsel shall periodically report to the Committee \n     concerning the progress of the adjudicatory review. Such \n     reports shall be delivered to the Committee in the form and \n     according to the schedule prescribed by the Committee, and \n     shall be confidential.\n       (f) FINAL REPORT OF ADJUDICATORY REVIEW TO COMMITTEE: Upon \n     completion of an adjudicatory review, including any hearings \n     held pursuant to Rule 5, the outside counsel or the staff \n     shall submit a confidential written report to the Committee, \n     which shall detail the factual findings of the adjudicatory \n     review and which may recommend disciplinary action, if \n     appropriate. Findings of fact of the adjudicatory review \n     shall be detailed in this report whether or not disciplinary \n     action is recommended.\n       (g) COMMITTEE ACTION:\n       (1) As soon as practicable following submission of the \n     report of the staff or outside counsel on the adjudicatory \n     review, the Committee shall prepare and submit a report to \n     the Senate, including a recommendation or proposed resolution \n     to the Senate concerning disciplinary action, if appropriate. \n     A report shall be issued, stating in detail the Committee's \n     findings of fact, whether or not disciplinary action is \n     recommended. The report shall also explain fully the reasons \n     underlying the Committee's recommendation concerning \n     disciplinary action, if any. No adjudicatory review of \n     conduct of a Member, officer or employee of the Senate may be \n     conducted, or report or resolution or recommendation relating \n     to such an adjudicatory review of conduct may be made, except \n     by the affirmative recorded vote of not less than four \n     members of the Committee.\n       (2) Pursuant to S. Res. 338, as amended, section 2 (a), \n     subsections (2), (3), and (4), after receipt of the report \n     prescribed by paragraph (f) of this rule, the Committee may \n     make any of the following recommendations for disciplinary \n     action or issue an order for reprimand or restitution, as \n     follows:\n       (i) In the case of a Member, a recommendation to the Senate \n     for expulsion, censure, payment of restitution, \n     recommendation to a Member's party conference regarding the \n     Member's seniority or positions of responsibility, or a \n     combination of these;\n       (ii) In the case of an officer or employee, a \n     recommendation to the Senate of dismissal, suspension, \n     payment of restitution, or a combination of these;\n       (iii) In the case where the Committee determines, after \n     according to the Member, officer, or employee due notice and \n     opportunity for a hearing, that misconduct occurred \n     warranting discipline less serious than discipline by the \n     full Senate, and subject to the provisions of paragraph (h) \n     of this\n\n[[Page S2217]]\n\n     rule relating to appeal, by a unanimous vote of six members \n     order that a Member, officer or employee be reprimanded or \n     pay restitution or both;\n       (iv) In the case where the Committee determines that \n     misconduct is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de \n     minimis nature, issue a public or private letter of \n     admonition to a Member, officer or employee, which shall not \n     be subject to appeal to the Senate.\n       (3) In the case where the Committee determines, upon \n     consideration of all the evidence, that the facts do not \n     warrant a finding that there is substantial credible evidence \n     which provides substantial cause for the Committee to \n     conclude that a violation within the jurisdiction of the \n     Committee has occurred, the Committee may dismiss the matter.\n       (4) Promptly, after the conclusion of the adjudicatory \n     review, the Committee's report and recommendation, if any, \n     shall be forwarded to the Secretary of the Senate, and a copy \n     shall be provided to the complainant and the respondent. The \n     full report and recommendation, if any, shall be printed and \n     made public, unless the Committee determines by the recorded \n     vote of not less than four members of the Committee that it \n     should remain confidential.\n       (h) RIGHT OF APPEAL:\n       (1) Any individual who is the subject of a reprimand or \n     order of restitution, or both, pursuant to subsection \n     (g)(2)(iii), may, within 30 days of the Committee's report to \n     the Senate of its action imposing a reprimand or order of \n     restitution, or both, appeal to the Senate by providing \n     written notice of the appeal to the Committee and the \n     presiding officer of the Senate. The presiding officer shall \n     cause the notice of the appeal to be printed in the \n     Congressional Record and the Senate Journal.\n       (2) S. Res. 338 provides that a motion to proceed to \n     consideration of an appeal pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be \n     highly privileged and not debatable. If the motion to proceed \n     to consideration of the appeal is agreed to, the appeal shall \n     be decided on the basis of the Committee's report to the \n     Senate. Debate on the appeal shall be limited to 10 hours, \n     which shall be divided equally between, and controlled by, \n     those favoring and those opposing the appeal.\n\n                    RULE 5: PROCEDURES FOR HEARINGS\n\n       (a) RIGHT TO HEARING: The Committee may hold a public or \n     executive hearing in any preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory \n     review, or other proceeding. The Committee shall accord a \n     respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends \n     disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate or \n     before it imposes an order of restitution or reprimand. (See \n     Rule 4(d).)\n       (b) NON-PUBLIC HEARINGS: The Committee may at any time \n     during a hearing determine in accordance with paragraph 5(b) \n     of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate whether to \n     receive the testimony of specific witnesses in executive \n     session. If a witness desires to express a preference for \n     testifying in public or in executive session, he or she shall \n     so notify the Committee at least five days before he or she \n     is scheduled to testify.\n       (c) ADJUDICATORY HEARINGS: The Committee may, by the \n     recorded vote of not less than four members of the Committee, \n     designate any public or executive hearing as an adjudicatory \n     hearing; and any hearing which is concerned with possible \n     disciplinary action against a respondent or respondents \n     designated by the Committee shall be an adjudicatory hearing. \n     In any adjudicatory hearing, the procedures described in \n     paragraph (j) shall apply.\n       (d) SUBPOENA POWER: The Committee may require, by subpoena \n     or otherwise, the attendance and testimony of such witnesses \n     and the production of such correspondence, books, papers, \n     documents or other articles as it deems advisable. (See Rule \n     6.)\n       (e) NOTICE OF HEARINGS: The Committee shall make public an \n     announcement of the date, place, and subject matter of any \n     hearing to be conducted by it, in accordance with Rule 1(f).\n       (f) PRESIDING OFFICER: The Chairman shall preside over the \n     hearings, or in his absence the Vice Chairman. If the Vice \n     Chairman is also absent, a Committee member designated by the \n     Chairman shall preside. If an oath or affirmation is \n     required, it shall be administered to a witness by the \n     Presiding Officer, or in his absence, by any Committee \n     member.\n       (g) WITNESSES:\n       (1) A subpoena or other request to testify shall be served \n     on a witness sufficiently in advance of his or her scheduled \n     appearance to allow the witness a reasonable period of time, \n     as determined by the Committee, to prepare for the hearing \n     and to employ counsel if desired.\n       (2) The Committee may, by recorded vote of not less than \n     four members of the Committee, rule that no member of the \n     Committee or staff or outside counsel shall make public the \n     name of any witness subpoenaed by the Committee before the \n     date of that witness's scheduled appearance, except as \n     specifically authorized by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     acting jointly.\n       (3) Any witness desiring to read a prepared or written \n     statement in executive or public hearings shall file a copy \n     of such statement with the Committee at least two working \n     days in advance of the hearing at which the statement is to \n     be presented. The Chairman and Vice Chairman shall determine \n     whether such statements may be read or placed in the record \n     of the hearing.\n       (4) Insofar as practicable, each witness shall be permitted \n     to present a brief oral opening statement, if he or she \n     desires to do so.\n       (h) RIGHT TO TESTIFY: Any person whose name is mentioned or \n     who is specifically identified or otherwise referred to in \n     testimony or in statements made by a Committee member, staff \n     member or outside counsel, or any witness, and who reasonably \n     believes that the statement tends to adversely affect his or \n     her reputation may--\n       (1) Request to appear personally before the Committee to \n     testify in his or her own behalf; or\n       (2) File a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     testimony or other evidence or statement of which he or she \n     complained. Such request and such statement shall be \n     submitted to the Committee for its consideration and action.\n       (i) CONDUCT OF WITNESSES AND OTHER ATTENDEES: The Presiding \n     Officer may punish any breaches of order and decorum by \n     censure and exclusion from the hearings. The Committee, by \n     majority vote, may recommend to the Senate that the offender \n     be cited for contempt of Congress.\n       (j) ADJUDICATORY HEARING PROCEDURES:\n       (1) NOTICE OF HEARINGS: A copy of the public announcement \n     of an adjudicatory hearing, required by paragraph (e), shall \n     be furnished together with a copy of these Rules to all \n     witnesses at the time that they are subpoenaed or otherwise \n     summoned to testify.\n       (2) PREPARATION FOR ADJUDICATORY HEARINGS:\n       (A) At least five working days prior to the commencement of \n     an adjudicatory hearing, the Committee shall provide the \n     following information and documents to the respondent, if \n     any:\n       (i) a list of proposed witnesses to be called at the \n     hearing;\n       (ii) copies of all documents expected to be introduced as \n     exhibits at the hearing; and\n       (iii) a brief statement as to the nature of the testimony \n     expected to be given by each witness to be called at the \n     hearing.\n       (B) At least two working days prior to the commencement of \n     an adjudicatory hearing, the respondent, if any, shall \n     provide the information and documents described in divisions \n     (i), (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (A) to the Committee.\n       (C) At the discretion of the Committee, the information and \n     documents to be exchanged under this paragraph shall be \n     subject to an appropriate agreement limiting access and \n     disclosure.\n       (D) If a respondent refuses to provide the information and \n     documents to the Committee (see (A) and (B) of this \n     subparagraph), or if a respondent or other individual \n     violates an agreement limiting access and disclosure, the \n     Committee, by majority vote, may recommend to the Senate that \n     the offender be cited for contempt of Congress.\n       (3) SWEARING OF WITNESSES: All witnesses who testify at \n     adjudicatory hearings shall be sworn unless the Presiding \n     Officer, for good cause, decides that a witness does not have \n     to be sworn.\n       (4) RIGHT TO COUNSEL: Any witness at an adjudicatory \n     hearing may be accompanied by counsel of his or her own \n     choosing, who shall be permitted to advise the witness of his \n     or her legal rights during the testimony.\n       (5) RIGHT TO CROSS-EXAMINE AND CALL WITNESSES:\n       (A) In adjudicatory hearings, any respondent and any other \n     person who obtains the permission of the Committee, may \n     personally or through counsel cross-examine witnesses called \n     by the Committee and may call witnesses in his or her own \n     behalf.\n       (B) A respondent may apply to the Committee for the \n     issuance of subpoenas for the appearance of witnesses or the \n     production of documents on his or her behalf. An \n     application shall be approved upon a concise showing by \n     the respondent that the proposed testimony or evidence is \n     relevant and appropriate, as determined by the Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman.\n       (C) With respect to witnesses called by a respondent, or \n     other individual given permission by the Committee, each such \n     witness shall first be examined by the party who called the \n     witness or by that party's counsel.\n       (D) At least one working day before a witness's scheduled \n     appearance, a witness or a witness's counsel may submit to \n     the Committee written questions proposed to be asked of that \n     witness. If the Committee determines that it is necessary, \n     such questions may be asked by any member of the Committee, \n     or by any Committee staff member if directed by a Committee \n     member. The witness or witness's counsel may also submit \n     additional sworn testimony for the record within twenty-four \n     hours after the last day that the witness has testified. The \n     insertion of such testimony in that day's record is subject \n     to the approval of the Chairman and Vice Chairman acting \n     jointly within five days after the testimony is received.\n       (6) ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE:\n       (A) The object of the hearing shall be to ascertain the \n     truth. Any evidence that may be relevant and probative shall \n     be admissible unless privileged under the Federal Rules of \n     Evidence. Rules of evidence shall not be applied strictly, \n     but the Presiding Officer shall exclude irrelevant or unduly \n     repetitious testimony. Objections going only to the weight \n     that should be given evidence will not justify its exclusion.\n\n[[Page S2218]]\n\n       (B) The Presiding Officer shall rule upon any question of \n     the admissibility of testimony or other evidence presented to \n     the Committee. Such rulings shall be final unless reversed or \n     modified by a recorded vote of not less than four members of \n     the Committee before the recess of that day's hearings.\n       (C) Notwithstanding paragraphs (A) and (B), in any matter \n     before the Committee involving allegations of sexual \n     discrimination, including sexual harassment, or sexual \n     misconduct, by a Member, officer, or employee within the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee, the Committee shall be guided \n     by the standards and procedures of Rule 412 of the Federal \n     Rules of Evidence, except that the Committee may admit \n     evidence subject to the provisions of this paragraph only \n     upon a determination of not less than four members of the \n     full Committee that the interests of justice require that \n     such evidence be admitted.\n       (7) SUPPLEMENTARY HEARING PROCEDURES: The Committee may \n     adopt any additional special hearing procedures that it deems \n     necessary or appropriate to a particular adjudicatory \n     hearing. Copies of such supplementary procedures shall be \n     furnished to witnesses and respondents, and shall be made \n     available upon request to any member of the public.\n       (k) TRANSCRIPTS:\n       (1) An accurate stenographic or recorded transcript shall \n     be made of all public and executive hearings. Any member of \n     the Committee, Committee staff member, outside counsel \n     retained by the Committee, or witness may examine a copy of \n     the transcript retained by the Committee of his or her own \n     remarks and may suggest to the official reporter any \n     typographical or transcription errors. If the reporter \n     declines to make the requested corrections, the member, staff \n     member, outside counsel or witness may request a ruling by \n     the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly. Any member or \n     witness shall return the transcript with suggested \n     corrections to the Committee offices within five working days \n     after receipt of the transcript, or as soon thereafter as is \n     practicable. If the testimony was given in executive session, \n     the member or witness may only inspect the transcript at a \n     location determined by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly. Any questions arising with respect to the processing \n     and correction of transcripts shall be decided by the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (2) Except for the record of a hearing which is closed to \n     the public, each transcript shall be printed as soon as is \n     practicable after receipt of the corrected version. The \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, may order the \n     transcript of a hearing to be printed without the corrections \n     of a member or witness if they determine that such member or \n     witness has been afforded a reasonable time to correct such \n     transcript and such transcript has not been returned within \n     such time.\n       (3) The Committee shall furnish each witness, at no cost, \n     one transcript copy of that witness's testimony given at a \n     public hearing.

Depositions may be taken at any time during a \n     preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review or other proceeding. \n     Deposition notices shall specify a time and place for \n     examination. Unless otherwise specified, the deposition shall \n     be in private, and the testimony taken and documents produced \n     shall be deemed for the purpose of these rules to have been \n     received in a closed or executive session of the Committee. \n     The Committee shall not initiate procedures leading to \n     criminal or civil enforcement proceedings for a witness's \n     failure to appear, or to testify, or to produce documents, \n     unless the deposition notice was accompanied by a subpoena \n     authorized for issuance by the Committee, or the Chairman and \n     Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (3) COUNSEL AT DEPOSITIONS: Witnesses may be accompanied at \n     a deposition by counsel to advise them of their rights.\n       (4) DEPOSITION PROCEDURE: Witnesses at depositions shall be \n     examined upon oath administered by an individual authorized \n     by law to administer oaths, or administered by any member of \n     the Committee if one is present.

If a witness objects to a \n     question and refuses to testify, or refuses to produce a \n     document, any member of the Committee who is present may rule \n     on the objection and, if the objection is overruled, direct \n     the witness to answer the question or produce the document. \n     If no member of the Committee is present, the individual who \n     has been designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly, to take the deposition may proceed with the \n     deposition, or may, at that time or at a subsequent time, \n     seek a ruling by telephone or otherwise on the objection from \n     the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Committee, who may refer \n     the matter to the Committee or rule on the objection. If the \n     Chairman or Vice Chairman, or the Committee upon referral, \n     overrules the objection, the Chairman, Vice Chairman, or the \n     Committee as the case may be, may direct the witness to \n     answer the question or produce the document. The Committee \n     shall not initiate procedures leading to civil or criminal \n     enforcement unless the witness refuses to testify or produce \n     documents after having been directed to do so.\n       (5) FILING OF DEPOSITIONS: Deposition testimony shall be \n     transcribed or electronically recorded. If the deposition is \n     transcribed, the individual administering the oath shall \n     certify on the transcript that the witness was duly sworn in \n     his or her presence and the transcriber shall certify that \n     the transcript is a true record of the testimony. The \n     transcript with these certifications shall be filed with the \n     chief clerk of the Committee, and the witness shall be \n     furnished with access to a copy at the Committee's offices \n     for review. Upon inspecting the transcript, within a time \n     limit set by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, \n     a witness may request in writing changes in the transcript to \n     correct errors in transcription. The witness may also bring \n     to the attention of the Committee errors of fact in the \n     witness's testimony by submitting a sworn statement about \n     those facts with a request that it be attached to the \n     transcript. The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, \n     may rule on the witness's request, and the changes or \n     attachments allowed shall be certified by the Committee's \n     chief clerk. If the witness fails to make any request under \n     this paragraph within the time limit set, this fact shall be \n     noted by the Committee's chief clerk. Any person authorized \n     by the Committee may stipulate with the witness to changes in \n     this procedure.\n\n   RULE 7: VIOLATIONS OF LAW; PERJURY; LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS; \n   EDUCATIONAL MANDATE; AND APPLICABLE RULES AND STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\n       (a) VIOLATIONS OF LAW: Whenever the Committee determines by \n     the recorded vote of not less than four members of the full \n     Committee that there is reason to believe that a violation of \n     law, including the provision of false information to the \n     Committee, may have occurred, it shall report such possible \n     violation to the proper Federal and state authorities.\n       (b) PERJURY: Any person who knowingly and willfully swears \n     falsely to a sworn complaint or any other sworn statement to \n     the Committee does so under penalty of perjury.

Field hearings of the full Committee, and any \n     subcommittee thereof, shall be scheduled only when authorized \n     by the Chairman and ranking minority member of the full \n     Committee.\n       5.

This paragraph may \n     not be construed as authorizing counsel to coach the witness \n     or to answer for the witness. The failure of any witness to \n     secure counsel shall not excuse the witness from complying \n     with a subpoena.\n       7.

Mr. President, I rise today to mark the 75th anniversary of \nthe Export-Import Bank of the United States, this country's official \nexport credit agency. Its mandate is to create and support jobs here in \nthe United States by financing U.S. exports that might otherwise be \nlost because private sector financing is unavailable or to meet the \ncompetition of foreign governments' export credit agencies that are \nsupporting their exporters to secure the deal. Obviously, the work of \nEx-Im Bank is especially relevant in difficult economic times such as \nwe are currently experiencing, because U.S. exports equal U.S. jobs.\n  The Export-Import Bank falls under the jurisdiction of the Senate \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, and I am aware of the \nmany positive effects it has had for U.S. manufacturers. In the past 5 \nyears, it has helped at least 75 companies in 43 communities in \nConnecticut finance over $700 million in exports. These export sales \ncreate and sustain high-paying manufacturing and other jobs related to \nexports.\n  Ex-Im Bank is also accustomed to stepping in when times are hard. It \nwas founded on February 12, 1934, in order to help facilitate exports \nduring the Great Depression. Since then, it has supported over $400 \nbillion in U.S. exports that would not have gone forward without it--\nexports that support U.S. jobs.\n  Just after World War II, Ex-Im Bank became a precursor of the \nMarshall Plan, authorizing over $2 billion for the reconstruction of \nEurope. In more recent times, Ex-Im Bank has stepped in to assist U.S. \nexporters during the Mexican debt crisis of the 1980s and the Asian \ndebt crisis of the 1990s.\n  Don't confuse this with foreign aid. Ex-Im Bank charges for its \nservices and is self-financing, and is therefore not a drain on U.S. \ntaxpayers. Ex-Im Bank makes credit judgments on the basis of reasonable \nassurance of repayment, and has a historical default rate under 2 \npercent. Over 80 percent of Ex-Im Bank's transactions directly benefit \nsmall businesses, which are the most effective generators of jobs in \nour economy.\n  Over the past 75 years, Ex-Im Bank has responded in difficult times \nto the problems of U.S. exporters. In this time of economic hardship, \nwe need government institutions like the Ex-Im Bank to provide strong \nleadership in responding effectively and efficiently to the challenges \nfacing U.S. exporters, large and small.\n  I am happy to join with leaders from across the political spectrum in \nwishing the Export-Import Bank of the United States well on its 75th \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/12/senate-section/article/S2226-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2226-S2228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Thank you for asking for the opinions from residents of the \n     great state of Idaho. Clearly only one answer for this . . . \n     do something now! We all know that it will take a couple of \n     years to implement; however, we must remember this is for the \n     long term. I believe that nuclear and hydroelectric is the \n     way of the future, and the cleanest approach.\n       My husband and I are long-haul truckers, and pay over \n     $1,400 per day to fuel. Yes, there are other countries that \n     pay more, but we have not prepared ourselves for ``mass \n     transit'' in the United States, and we are also, in my \n     opinion, very spoiled with our cars.\n       Most Americans do not stop to realize what impact all of \n     this madness will have on them. It is not just ``fuel costs'' \n     at the gas pump; it is the big picture of the fuel costs. I \n     have seen all the corn fields in Iowa and Midwest that have \n     been bought out by foreigners. Our country is literally \n     vanishing before our eyes, and ``fuel'' does not even touch \n     the surface of our internal problems.\n       Let us stop selling off America and do for ourselves, \n     quick. We could be a self-sufficient country, and get back \n     some of our power that we have so easily sold off.\n       Thank you for your considerations.\n     DiAnne, Boise Valley.\n                                  ____\n\n       We are in our early 70s retired and on a fixed income. We \n     now plan every trip to town (16 Miles one way) to do senior \n     things and shop. Our costs are going up on every area: food, \n     medications (Plan D ran out this month June; paying 100 \n     percent now for the rest of the year). We have had to pull \n     money out of savings every year since retirement. Gas and \n     diesel is a joke and you people in Washington, DC are out of \n     touch with reality. Open up our reserve and kill the profit \n     takers. Open up by Federal Law our Drilling and harvesting \n     our own oil products while working on other alternative fuel \n     sources. We citizens know what is happening; why do not you? \n     Stop being lawyers and start being citizens and do what is \n     right for the USA.\n       The environmentalists are OK along with the civil liberty \n     union folks but once in a while you have to make decisions \n     they are not going to be happy about for the good of the \n     country. You should all now know corn to fuel is not the \n     answer.--We need to build refineries back here in our own \n     country along with our manufacturing jobs. Do something right \n     and open up our own reserves and give us citizens a chance to \n     enjoy our retirement after 60 years of work. Thank you for \n     reading my letter.\n     Marvin and Gloria, New Meadows.\n                                  ____\n\n       Please do not support off-shore drilling and exploration \n     for additional domestic oil. Sure, Idaho is a big state and \n     we have to drive from here to there, but finding us more \n     domestic oil is not the solution. Even if we starting \n     domestic oil exploration today, I understand we would not be \n     producing that oil for many more years, and that would not \n     solve our immediate self-induced crisis today.\n       Conservation is not a ``personal virtue''--conservation is \n     key to reducing our oil consumption, and Idahoans have a long \n     history of conserving when it is necessary. Unfortunately, we \n     got lulled into a false sense of security and prosperity by \n     cheap oil prices for many years, and thought we could drive \n     our\n\n[[Page S2227]]\n\n     SUVs inexpensively forever. We chose to ignore the warnings \n     that we would eventually run out of cheap oil.\n       And, nuclear energy is not the alternative, not if the \n     nuclear waste is going to continue to be stored in Idaho.\n       Better use of funding: mass transit (even in Idaho) and \n     renewable energy sources, not domestic oil exploration.\n     Becki, Hailey.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am retired (66 years old) and live with my wife. We have \n     carefully budgeted our retirement for a home, cars and a dog. \n     We find ourselves keeping our air conditioner off until it is \n     unbearable. We do not travel because of the high gas prices \n     and our children cannot afford to come see us. We keep the \n     lights off and use a couple of fans during the day. Food \n     prices are up forcing us to use some of our food storage and \n     rotation. We pay twice as much for food then we did last year \n     and electricity and gas are prohibited and there is no \n     leveling off in sight. House market is down and we cannot \n     even sell our house if we are forced to. It appears the \n     government wants to force greater taxes on Social Security \n     without factoring in that we paid into for many years and a \n     decrease of Social Security and other high costs will cause \n     us buying less food, gas, and electricity use. We need some \n     relief and quick decisions on solving these problems now. I \n     am for drilling, building new refiners, obtaining other \n     sources energy with protection of wildlife. We can do it.\n     James, Eagle.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for the opportunity to sound off my concerns \n     regarding the rising oil prices. The rising cost of gasoline \n     affects my family not only with the higher cost to fill our \n     van but prevents us from spending our dollars in ways that we \n     would prefer: family trips, clothing and shoes, an occasional \n     TV update. This is the first year in our 11-year marriage \n     that my husband and I have been able to enroll our children \n     (we have 4) into extracurricular programs (karate and \n     swimming lessons) and we will now need to cancel one or both \n     due to the higher cost of driving to and from work. Food \n     costs have skyrocketed, making it difficult to feed our \n     family in a healthy way. It surprises me to see that the less \n     healthy foods are less expensive than healthy options like \n     fresh vegetables and fruit. Hamburger with a higher fat \n     content is much cheaper than a more healthy option. Like all \n     families, we make accommodations--we buy much less snack \n     foods, sodas and breads to allow us to purchase basics such \n     as chicken, hamburger, some vegetables and a few fruits. \n     There are no evening or weekend excursions to the movies, \n     Boondocks Entertainment Center or the water park. We will be \n     unable to travel around Idaho this year to show the kids how \n     wonderful their state is. Our heating bill this coming winter \n     is something I am afraid to think of.\n       Many families that we know have lost jobs from Micron cuts \n     and now Albertson's cuts putting their very families into \n     jeopardy for homelessness and hunger, let alone higher gas \n     prices. With higher prices in everything and wages not \n     increasing to accommodate the rise, crime is also on the rise \n     and police departments are facing even higher costs than we \n     are because they are unable to do their jobs properly which \n     will reflect in a very negative way despite the fact that it \n     is not their fault. The elderly and people with disabilities \n     are affected by higher gas prices in the same ways as the \n     rest but additionally with higher taxi fares and reduced bus \n     routes preventing them from getting to medical appointments, \n     Social Security Administration appointments and other \n     appointments or events critical to their well-being.\n       Solutions that we can think of: We believe in the nuclear \n     options and hydrogen powered cars. We believe in increasing \n     the use of solar power and wind power--especially in Idaho. \n     These need to be priorities in Washington. Our dependence on \n     oil hurts the USA in many ways other than basic dollars--such \n     as our very credibility. It would also be prudent of our \n     Congressmen to encourage their state counterparts to \n     encourage and develop public transportation options, \n     especially in rural areas. It is an expense that would \n     eventually pay off.\n       Thank you for your time.\n     Ginny, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       What can we do about the rising cost of fuel in this \n     country? Once the economic power country of the world is now \n     in a very sad situation. Opec is dictating what we pay for \n     oil and we are standing still letting it happen. Some of the \n     politicians are suggesting tax the oil companies on the huge \n     profits. Really who would wind up paying for that tax? The \n     consumer that is who.\n       Here are some suggestions, which I am sure you have heard:\n       1. Start using our reserves now and begin using pumps that \n     are standing idle. We have the oil in reserve to cut off \n     importing Opec country oil and put the squeeze on them.\n       2. Begin drilling ANWR and forget about the \n     environmentalists crying about it. They will soon realize we \n     have to do this before it is too late. At the same time stop \n     exporting oil we now drill in Alaska and use it here at home.\n       3. Give the big oil companies incentives to build new \n     refineries in the form of tax credits etc. Maybe if we use \n     our oil and they build new refineries the supply would \n     increase. I have a hard time dealing with the saying ``supply \n     and demand.'' Why should we be paying nearly the minimum wage \n     for a gallon of gasoline. Why should people have to worry \n     about buying fuel or food. This is The United States of \n     America, and it is time our reputation of being the economic \n     leader of the world return to us.\n       I have a small business and the cost of having products \n     shipped to me is eating away at my profit margin. I cannot \n     continue to have to raise my prices and get sales in my type \n     of business.\n       I am sure a person of your level does not even have to \n     worry about what you spend on food and fuel but the majority \n     of this country does and we cannot sit still and wonder when \n     this is going to end. It is up to our elected leaders to step \n     up and do something about it now. The American dream is not \n     the American nightmare. Mr. Craig has been on the news and \n     had some good ideas. All of you in Washington need to band \n     together as one and do something to fix the situation. When \n     9/11 happened Republicans and Democrats united together as \n     one and again it is time that you do that.\n     Terry.\n                                  ____\n\n       You asked how high fuel prices have affected our lives.\n       1. I am a sales rep and travel S. Idaho & E. Oregon. Since \n     April 15th I have driven 13,000 miles. I am sure that I have \n     spent over $600.00 since then on gas. I knew that I could no \n     longer afford my Toyota Sequoia. So I downsized to a Honda \n     Accord. I now get 27 MPG's. I have had to make a tough \n     decision. I now have to ask my customers if they will be \n     spending over $2,000. Otherwise I can no longer afford to \n     make the trip. What I would be making off the sale would \n     basically be going back into gas making me nothing. It is not \n     fair to my customers. They no longer get the personalized \n     customer service they deserve. The company I work for does \n     not reimburse us for fuel, food, and hotel. My customers have \n     also had an increase in shipping costs.\n       2. My husband switched jobs. He was driving 60 miles round \n     trip 5 days a week. The cost to fill up his diesel truck is \n     over $100.00 now (it used to cost $60.00 2 years ago). He now \n     works closer to home being able to make the tank last 2-3 \n     days longer now.\n       3. I now run errands once a week. I conserve gas by making \n     one trip into town. I could halfway understand the high cost \n     of fuel if the gas companies (Chevron, Texaco, etc.) were \n     posting huge losses in their profits. But they are not. They \n     are posting some of the largest profits in history.\n       Everyone is feeling the pinch. Something must be done and \n     fast. Thanks for your time.\n       Cheerfully,\n     Alyson.\n                                  ____\n\n       I firmly believe that our answers will not be found simply \n     by extending our addiction to oil. Saying that drilling in \n     the Alaskan wilderness or off the coast of Florida will fix \n     our problem is akin to saying that the cure for an alcoholic \n     is to go to a bar with a larger selection of drinks. We, as a \n     nation, must eliminate our need for the limited resource that \n     is oil.\n       We have spent, by conservative estimates, over $550 billion \n     on the Iraq war during the last five years. By ending the war \n     and spending even \\1/4\\ of that amount solely on alternative, \n     renewable energy resources, we would be off of oil in a \n     decade and the Mideast would no longer mean anything of \n     consequence to us except as a coalition of countries to which \n     we could sell food and goods.\n       President Kennedy made up his mind to lead us to the moon \n     in a decade, and he made it our national goal. We succeeded \n     in that national goal. It is now your turn, Senator Crapo, to \n     lead us toward our new national goal. Clean renewable energy \n     that will forever take us out of the shackles in which \n     limited oil has us bound. Imagine how this goal affects us by \n     taking us out of war during the next ten years. Boosting our \n     economy by injecting money into ground breaking research and \n     industry. Helping to balance our budget by eliminating the \n     need for at least another $550 billion of war funding and \n     directing the remaining dollars to technology that builds \n     our country. It would help level the trade imbalance by \n     reducing our imports of foreign oil and increasing our \n     exports of food, technology, energy, etc. Our economy is \n     built up, the dollar is strengthened and our independence \n     is safeguarded while we maintain our role as a world \n     leading nation.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to be heard,\n                                                Brian, Twin Falls.\n       P.S. I also believe that nuclear energy is not the answer \n     as it sacrifices the long-term future for a short-term gain. \n     Leaving the nuclear waste problem to our children and \n     grandchildren is simply the wrong thing to do. We are greater \n     than that. Be part of the long term answer, Senator Crapo; do \n     not be a hostage to re-election politics. Be great, do the \n     right thing and let history show that you held future \n     generations in the highest regard and laid the foundation for \n     the enormous success those generations will create.\n                                  ____\n\n       I currently pay about $9.25 a day to get to and from work. \n     That is nearly double what I paid this time last year. I have \n     not had a pay raise in about two years. Its only obvious that \n     gas and food prices are causing a strain on our way of life \n     in the current economy. Its like I am making less now than I \n     was before.\n       I believe our main focus should be to recover the valuation \n     of the dollar on the international market. At the time of \n     this\n\n[[Page S2228]]\n\n     email, the dollar is at 73.544. Oil prices have gone straight \n     up because the value of the dollar is way down from its \n     typical 100.000 mark. Drilling for more oil would certainly \n     help our economy in the short run, but without the focus \n     being on the valuation of the dollar, we are just applying \n     band-aids. I believe that America should apply working \n     solutions that reinvigorate American pride. Businesses need \n     tax breaks to survive the current shaky economy. Businesses \n     that deal strictly with products made in the USA should be \n     rewarded quite a bit more beyond generalized tax breaks. The \n     rebuilding of our economy needs to focus on the true roots of \n     our economic engine.\n     Bob.\n                                  ____\n\n       First off, I want to thank you for taking the time to \n     listen to the average American on how high energy prices are \n     affecting our daily lives.\n       My husband and I are getting close to retirement age. My \n     husband is in his 60s, Viet Nam vet and very proud of the \n     fact he was able to serve his county. I am 56. We live in a \n     small rural community, surround by farm ground, population \n     600. Both my husband and I commute to work--I have about 25 \n     miles, he has about 17. I understand that it is our choice to \n     live ``out in the country,'' but the choice was made to start \n     up a business in our little town; my husband opened up a \n     small engine repair shop. Things were clicking along great \n     for a few years. We weren't setting the world on fire, but \n     life was good, until the economy took a downward turn. We had \n     to close our shop and my husband went back to into the \n     workforce resulting in the commute.\n       I would say we have an average income, the two of us \n     bringing in approx $50,000. We do not own a lot of fancy \n     things, do not drive fancy cars, and we are just average down \n     home folks. As the price of fuel begins to climb, I see the \n     extra we set aside for our ``retirement'' dwindle, it now \n     fills the gas tank so we can go to work to pay the bills to \n     put gas in the gas tank. The circle continues with no end. I \n     worry about the ``golden'' years; will there be enough for us \n     to actually retire and when we do retire will there be enough \n     money to live on and enjoy a few things in life that we \n     worked so long and hard for. Such as travel, that now does \n     not seem to be in our future. We will not be able to afford \n     it. I worry about my children and their children, and their \n     future, will they be able to afford food, medical and fuel \n     for their cars.\n       In our community, the rumbling at the local coffee shop is \n     the talk of the high energy cost, how it is starting to \n     affect all aspects of our lives, the farmers are struggling, \n     many are selling out because they just cannot make it. We \n     must make a change in our country to continue to be the \n     greatest, strongest, self supporting, independent county we \n     once were.\n       For you in Congress, I urge you not to forget the everyday \n     people, there has to be way to work though this crisis. We \n     support off shore drilling, increase domestic oil production, \n     build refineries, study alternative fuel such as wind energy \n     and lastly tax credits on renewable energy. Environmentalists \n     have a place in our world, but the extremes they have taken \n     have tied our hands at making the USA self supportive as we \n     can and should be. Please urge your fellow Senators to work \n     for and with you on this much-needed cause.\n       Again, thank you for your continued support for Idahoans.\n     Gail, Melba.\n                                  ____\n\n       I hear cries for drilling. We should be hearing a challenge \n     from a President. Do you remember when John F. Kennedy issued \n     the following challenge ``within the decade we will put a man \n     on the moon''? Well--I was hoping that President Bush would \n     have cemented his name in history with a similar challenge--\n     something like ``I challenge the Nation to effectively become \n     energy self-sufficient and efficient inside of the decade'' \n     but no--we just continue to hear--we need oil.\n       I personally say--get off of foreign oil now. The \n     technology the world is benefiting from came from JFK's \n     challenge and think of all of the new technology if a \n     President were to stand up and issue a challenge in the \n     current era. Thanks for listening.\n     Joe, Nampa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/12/senate-section/article/S2228-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          TRIBUTE TO ERIC BOE\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, today I recognize an exceptional \nGeorgian, COL Eric Boe. Eric grew up in Atlanta and graduated from \nHenderson High School in Chamblee in 1983. A distinguished graduate \nwith honors from the U.S. Air Force Academy, Eric earned his bachelor \nof science in astronautical engineering and subsequently a masters of \nscience in electrical engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology.\n  Eric has served his country with distinction. He has been an F-4E \npilot, a T-38 instructor pilot, F-15C flight commander, and a test \npilot for the F-15 and UH-1N, logging over 4,000 flight hours in 45 \ndifferent aircraft. Additionally, Eric flew 55 combat missions over \nIraq in support of Operation Southern Watch.\n  In 2008, Eric was selected by NASA as a pilot and served in the \nAstronaut Office Advanced Vehicles Branch, Station Operations Branch, \nand Space Shuttle Branch as well as the Exploration Branch. In 2005-\n2006, Eric served as NASA Director of Operations at the Gagarin \nCosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Russia.\n  On November 14, 2008, Eric made his first trip to space serving as \nthe pilot on STS-126 Endeavour. The Endeavour launched from NASA's \nKennedy Space Center with no delays or issues and docked with the \nInternational Space Station on November 16, 2008. The successful 16-day \nmission, which completed 250 orbits of Earth covering over 6 million \nmiles, expanded the living quarters of the international space station \nand included four space walks by members of the Endeavour crew.\n  Eric has been recognized with numerous awards and honors. Serving as \na Cadet in the Georgia Wing of the Civil Air Patrol, Eric earned the \nSpaatz Award, the highest award given to Civil Air Patrol cadets. \nFurther, Eric has received various military decorations such as two \nMeritorious Service Medals, two Air Medals, five Aerial Achievement \nMedals, the three Air Force Achievement Medals, and the Air Force \nCommendation Medals, three Outstanding Unit Awards, and the Combat \nReadiness Medal.\n  I want to acknowledge the achievements of the entire STS-126 \nEndeavour crew and congratulate them on their successful mission. As a \nfellow Georgian, I want to especially thank Eric for his outstanding \nservice to our nation as a combat pilot and astronaut. His love of \ncountry and dedication are an inspiration, and he is a role model and \nan example of leadership of which we can all be proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/12/senate-section/article/S2228-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:28 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 448.

A bill to impose a temporary moratorium on the phase out of \nthe Medicare hospice budget neutrality adjustment factor; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce the Medicare Hospice Protection Act, which will place a one-\nyear moratorium on a final rule issued by the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, CMS, reducing payments to hospice providers and \nensure Medicare beneficiaries' access to hospice care.\n  More than 1.3 million Americans depend on hospice for high quality \nand compassionate end-of-life care each year. Unfortunately, on October \n1, 2008, CMS issued a final rule to reduce hospice reimbursement rates \nin Medicare. This reduction of the hospice wage index will take $2.1 \nbillion out of hospice care for Medicare beneficiaries over the next 5 \nyears.\n  The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, MedPAC, is currently \nexamining the payment system for hospice care. We must allow MedPAC to \ncomplete this important review of the hospice Medicare benefit and make \npayment recommendations, which is expected in 2009. The Hospice \nProtection Act, introduced by myself and Senators Harkin, Wyden, \nRoberts, and Rockefeller, will maintain access to hospice care for \nseniors.\n  Hospice is an efficient and cost-effective health care model. Hospice \nprovides individuals at the end of their lives, as well as their \nfamilies, with comfort and compassion when they are needed most. \nHospice care enables a person to retain his or her dignity and maintain \nquality of life during the end of life. An independent Duke University \nstudy in 2007 showed that patients receiving hospice care cost the \nMedicare program about $2,300 less than those who did not, resulting in \nan annual savings of more than $2 billion.\n  In April 28, 2008, just before the Notice of Proposed Rule Making was \nreleased, a bipartisan group of more than 40 Senators wrote to \nSecretary Leavitt and asked him to stop further action and wait for \nMedPAC recommendations on hospice payment issues. On July 28, 2008, \nbefore the final rule was released, Senators Harkin, Wyden, Roberts and \nI wrote to White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolton, to urge him to \nstop the regulation from being finalized and to consider the burden \nthat this regulation will put on the hospice community.\n  Access to quality compassionate hospice care is critical for Medicare \nbeneficiaries. I ask my fellow Senators to join me in support of the \nHospice Protection Act and to work toward its swift passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW (for herself, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. \n        Collins, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Chambliss, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n        Cochran, Ms. Landrieu, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Cardin, \n        Mr. Kerry, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Inouye, \n        Mr. Begich, Mr. Casey, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Carper, Mr. \n        Wyden, and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 422. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and \nthe Public Health Service Act to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and \ntreatment of heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases \nin women; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a critical \nhealth issue affecting too many women: heart disease, a disease that \nsurprisingly affects more women than men.\n  As women, we tend to be great at taking care of everyone around us--\nour children, our spouses, our aging parents. Unfortunately, we do not \ndo nearly as well taking care of ourselves sometimes. I suspect we all \nknow women who have been to their doctors or to emergency rooms \nexhibiting symptoms of heart attack, only to be told they were \nsuffering from ``stress'' or indigestion.\n  For women, there are a lot of misconceptions about heart disease, but \nhere are the facts.\n  Heart disease and stroke actually kill more women each year than men.\n  Heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases are the \nleading cause of death for women in the United States and in Michigan. \nAccording to the Michigan Department of Community Health, a third of \nall deaths in women are due to cardiovascular disease.\n  One in three adult women has some form of cardiovascular disease.\n\n[[Page S2231]]\n\n  Minority women, particularly African American, Hispanic and Native \nAmerican women, are at even greater risk from heart disease and stroke.\n  These reasons are why Senator Lisa Murkowski and I are reintroducing \nthe HEART for Women Act in the Senate today to turn these startling \nstatistics around. Our bill is a three-prong approach to fighting heart \ndisease by raising awareness, strengthening research, and increasing \naccess to screening programs for more women. I am so pleased that \nnearly a quarter of the Senate is joining us today in sponsoring this \nlegislation, and that that Congresswomen Lois Capps and Mary Bono Mack \nare introducing companion legislation in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that support material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                American Heart Association, February 12, 2009.\n\n     Heart Disease and Stroke. You're the Cure.\n\n     Hon. Debbie A. Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Lisa Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow and Senator Murkowski: On behalf of \n     the American Heart Association and our approximately 22 \n     million volunteers and supporters nationwide, we applaud you \n     for your re-introduction of the HEART for Women Act.\n       As your legislation recognizes, too many American women and \n     their healthcare providers still think of heart disease as a \n     ``man's disease,'' even though about 50,000 more women than \n     men die from cardiovascular diseases each year. And \n     unfortunately, while we as a nation have made significant \n     progress in reducing the death rate from cardiovascular \n     diseases in men, the death rate in women has barely declined \n     (17 percent decline in men versus a 2 percent decline in \n     women over the last 25 years). Even more alarmingly, the \n     death rate in younger women ages 35 to 44 has actually been \n     increasing in recent years.\n       The American Heart Association and its American Stroke \n     Association division is a strong supporter of the HEART for \n     Women Act because it would improve the prevention, diagnosis, \n     and treatment of heart disease, stroke, and other \n     cardiovascular diseases in women and ultimately help end the \n     disparity that women face. Your legislation is particularly \n     important in the current economic recession, where Americans \n     are losing their jobs and their health insurance coverage and \n     women may be foregoing needed screening that could aid in the \n     early identification and treatment of heart disease and \n     stroke.\n       More specifically, your legislation would: 1) authorize the \n     expansion of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's \n     WISEWOMAN program, which provides free heart disease and \n     stroke screening and lifestyle counseling to low-income, \n     uninsured and underinsured women, to all 50 states; 2) \n     educate women and healthcare professionals about the risks \n     women face from cardiovascular diseases; and 3) provide \n     clinicians and their women patients with better information \n     about the efficacy and safety of new treatments for heart \n     disease and stroke.\n       Thank you again for your leadership on this important \n     legislation. We look forward to working with you to get the \n     HEART for Women Act enacted into law in this Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               David A. Josserand,\n                                            Chairman of the Board.\n                                     Timothy J. Gardner, MD, FAHA,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Dec. 29, 2008]\n\n Women's Heart Disease: It's the Leading Killer, but Patient Care Lags \nThat for Men--as Cardiac Science Advances, Women Find Treatment Lagging\n\n                           (By Judith Graham)\n\n       Heart disease is the leading cause of death for women in \n     the U.S., yet a wealth of data shows female cardiac patients \n     receive inferior medical care compared with men.\n       Too many physicians still discount the idea that a woman \n     could be suffering from heart disease, delaying or denying \n     needed medical interventions, experts note. Most community \n     hospitals in the U.S. still are not following guidelines for \n     treating women with heart attacks. And primary care doctors \n     don't do as much as they could to emphasize prevention.\n       As a result, women are failing to reap the full benefits of \n     enormous advances in cardiovascular medicine.\n       The point was underscored this month by a study published \n     in the journal Circulation finding that women who have heart \n     attacks receive fewer recommended treatments in hospitals \n     than men, including aspirin, beta blocker medications, \n     angioplasties, clot-busting drugs and surgeries to re-\n     establish blood flow. Women with the most serious heart \n     attacks, known as STEMIs, were significantly more likely to \n     die at a hospital than men.\n       ``We need to do a better job of defining women's symptoms \n     and treating them aggressively and rapidly, as we do for \n     men,'' said Dr. Hani Jneid, the study's lead author and \n     assistant professor of medicine at the Baylor College of \n     Medicine in Houston.\n       In Israel, when guidelines have been applied much more \n     rigorously, the mortality difference between the sexes all \n     but disappeared, according to a July study in the American \n     Journal of Medicine.\n       Outside hospitals, too few internists, family doctors, \n     obstetricians and gynecologists are implementing \n     recommendations for preventing heart disease in women, \n     experts say. Eighty percent of heart attacks in women could \n     be prevented if women changed their eating habits, got \n     regular exercise, managed their cholesterol and blood \n     pressure, and followed other preventive measures.\n       Although death rates from cardiovascular disease have \n     fallen, the condition killed 455,000 women in 2006, according \n     to data from the American Heart Association. Heart disease \n     causes about 72 percent of cardiovascular fatalities; the \n     rest are strokes and other related conditions.\n       The next decade could see major advances as scientists \n     better understand how the biology of heart disease differs in \n     women, said Dr. Joan Briller, director of the Heart Disease \n     in Women program at the University of Illinois Medical Center \n     at Chicago.\n       Already, for example, researchers have learned that plaque \n     deposits tend to be spread more widely in women than in men, \n     resulting in fewer big blockages in the arteries. That means \n     standard therapies such as angioplasty are often less \n     effective in women. Also, women metabolize certain heart \n     drugs at a different rate than men.\n       Women should learn about the symptoms of acute heart \n     disease--which can differ from those in men--respond promptly \n     if they sense something is wrong, and ``find physicians who \n     care about them,'' said Dr. Annabelle Volgman, medical \n     director of the Heart Center for Women at Rush University \n     Medical Center.\n       ``Ask your doctor: Are you familiar with the guidelines for \n     the prevention of heart disease in women published in 2007? \n     Do you follow them? If they say 'no,' find yourself another \n     doctor,'' she said.\n       These Chicago-area women learned the importance of that \n     advice the hard way:\n       Elizabeth Hein of Chicago was 27 when she began feeling a \n     tight, squeezing feeling in her chest, ``like a bone was \n     stuck in my heart,'' she said.\n       When it didn't go away, Hein visited her primary-care \n     doctor. ``You're young and healthy; don't worry,'' she \n     remembers him saying. Take aspirin, he advised.\n       The disturbing sensation sent Hein to the doctor four more \n     times over the next six months. She was fine, he repeated. \n     Hein was in good shape and running 3 to 5 miles daily.\n       One day at work, Hein felt numbness spread up her arm and \n     into her neck. Breathing became difficult. ``I'm sitting \n     there thinking my doctor doesn't believe anything is wrong; \n     what should I do?'' said Hein, now 38.\n       At a nearby hospital, Hein remembers, a triage nurse \n     briefed a skeptical emergency room doctor on her \n     electrocardiogram.\n       ``She's too young. It can't be a heart attack,'' she heard \n     the doctor say behind a curtain.\n       When he examined Hein, he asked what drugs she took. \n     (Cocaine can simulate heart attack symptoms.) After several \n     hours, the doctor sent Hein home. She later learned from her \n     primary-care physician that she had, indeed, had a heart \n     attack.\n       ``My overwhelming feeling was relief: Finally he \n     acknowledged something was really wrong,'' said Hein, who \n     soon changed doctors.\n       ``If your doctor won't listen, fire him and find one who \n     will,'' she said.\n       That lesson was brought home painfully three years ago when \n     Hein's mother began to suffer lower back pain and fatigue. \n     Her Minnesota doctor sent her to a masseuse. A month later, \n     when she returned to the doctor because she was retaining \n     water, he reportedly told her: ``You're an older woman. It's \n     normal.''\n       Weeks later, Mabel Hein died of a massive heart attack.\n       ``They missed it because they dismissed her too,'' her \n     daughter said. ``What I tell other women now is don't let it \n     happen to you.''\n       In March 2007, a screening test told Michelle Smietana of \n     Gurnee her blood pressure and cholesterol levels were \n     excellent.\n       ``I thought that's fantastic, no problems there,'' said \n     Smietana, 35.\n       Eight hours later, she was in a hospital emergency room \n     with a heart attack.\n       It began at dinner with a friend, when the computer \n     specialist felt an achy pain at the right shoulder blade. By \n     the time she got to her car, the feeling had crept up into \n     her throat, where it settled in the soft spot under her chin.\n       ``At first I thought I'd hurt a muscle. Then I thought: `Am \n     I having an allergic reaction?' '' Smietana said. ``All the \n     time, I felt, whatever this is, I really don't like it.''\n       Doctors at an urgent care center sent Smietana to Condell \n     Medical Center after a test for a cardiac marker came back \n     positive. There Smietana received aggressive treatment and \n     ultimately discovered that a prolonged coronary artery spasm \n     had interrupted blood flow through her narrower-than-usual \n     arteries.\n\n[[Page S2232]]\n\n       ``My first reaction was a weird feeling of shame, because I \n     was only 33 and this wasn't supposed to be happening,'' \n     Smietana said. ``Then, I felt kind of guilty, because I'm a \n     little heavy and a little underexercised.''\n       Moving on from the episode was terrifying, she said. \n     ``Because it came out of nowhere, you're not sure if it's \n     going to come back again and if you'll survive the next \n     time,'' she said.\n       She credits three months of cardiac rehabilitation with \n     defeating that fear and learning how to move again and take \n     better care of herself.\n       Today, Smietana tells women: ``If your body tells you \n     something doesn't feel right, listen to it and take it \n     seriously. I did and I got lucky.''\n       Helen Pates' grandmother died in her sleep of a massive \n     heart attack around age 40. Her mother also suffered from \n     heart disease, as did several maternal relatives.\n       All this was detailed in her medical records. Yet when \n     Pates developed persistent fatigue and occasional bouts of \n     nausea, not one of seven Chicago doctors she consulted \n     ordered cardiac exams.\n       Instead, they scanned her liver, her brain, her \n     gastrointestinal tract. ``They all said the same thing: \n     `We're not finding anything. You have a demanding career, a \n     busy life. It's probably stress-related,' '' said Pates, who \n     lives in Chicago and manages money for people with high net \n     worth.\n       Then in 2005 Pates awoke at 3 a.m. with excruciating pain \n     on the left side of her back and severe shortness of breath. \n     Crawling out of bed, she managed to drive to Rush University \n     Medical Center.\n       A few hours later, surgeons told Pates she had a large \n     aortic aneurysm--a bulge in her body's main blood vessel--\n     that was about to rupture. Doctors inserted a stent that \n     caused the aneurysm to shrink and eventually vanish.\n       Within three months Pates' energy began to return, and a \n     year later she was feeling like herself again.\n       Now 43, Pates said she's upset so many doctors dismissed \n     her symptoms.\n       ``As a woman, you need to stay on top of your health,'' she \n     said. ``Make yourself a priority. And if you have a family \n     history, like I did, and don't feel well, ask your doctor if \n     you could be having problems with your heart.''\n       The first time Debbie Dunn collapsed, doctors diagnosed \n     pneumonia. A high fever, they said, had caused her cold \n     sweats and thumping heart.\n       The next three times Dunn felt on the verge of collapse, \n     her heart racing wildly, medical providers told her she was \n     having panic attacks.\n       Eventually a cardiologist gave her a new diagnosis: \n     supraventricular tachycardia, an abnormally rapid heart \n     rhythm. ``It's benign,'' Dunn says he told her.\n       For years, Dunn visited the cardiologist occasionally but \n     primarily relied on a technique he taught her to control \n     symptoms. Still, more and more often, she said, ``My heart \n     felt like tennis shoes in the drier doing flip-flops.''\n       In 2002, at a restaurant with her husband, Dunn felt what \n     she calls a ``ripping, burning sensation above my breast.'' \n     Her left arm went numb, then started to ache.\n       At a nearby hospital, after hours of waiting, a nurse \n     casually told Dunn she'd had a massive heart attack. A \n     cardiologist said her heart was profoundly damaged and \n     operating at about 30 percent of capacity. Dunn was \n     prescribed medications but felt perpetually exhausted.\n       ``I tried to be a good mom, a good wife, and go back to my \n     activities but I couldn't keep up,'' said Dunn, 52. Her \n     cardiologist prescribed another medication for inflammation, \n     but it didn't help either.\n       A turning point came when Dunn read an article in O \n     magazine on women and heart disease. Seeing herself in the \n     story, she went to see Oprah Winfrey's cardiologist. In the \n     physician's office, having a cardiac stress test for the \n     first time, Dunn had another heart attack.\n       Today, the Libertyville resident has a pacemaker. \n     Channeling anger over her mistreatment into activism, Dunn \n     runs a support group for women with heart disease at \n     Glenbrook Hospital in Glenview and Condell Medical Center and \n     is starting another at Lake Forest Hospital.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Tester, Mr. Begich, Mr. Bingaman, \n        Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Feingold, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n        Menendez, Ms. Murkowski, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Thune, Mr. Vitter, \n        Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Burr):\n  S. 423. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize \nadvance appropriations for certain medical care accounts of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs by providing two-fiscal year budget \nauthority, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, this is an important day for Congress, for \nveterans, and their families. Today we take another step towards \nsecuring timely, predictable funding for the Veterans Health Care \nsystem. Our plan will create a transparent funding process that will \nyield sufficient, on-time funding that will enable VA to care for \nveterans more effectively.\n  Historically, VA's health care system has been plagued by \nunderfunding. Only a few years ago, VA reported a shortfall of over $1 \nbillion dollars. VA has had to come back to Congress repeatedly to get \nsupplementary funding for health care costs. Fortunately, in the past \ntwo years, we have begun to change course, by providing record-funding \nto meet the increased needs of veterans and their families.\n  Even with sufficient funding, however, the money for VA has been \nprovided late in 19 of the past 22 fiscal years. Sometimes, the \nappropriations have come as late as February, when VA needed the funds \nto spend in the preceding October.\n  Funding levels and the timing of funding depend on the federal \nappropriations process--a process vulnerable to partisan posturing and \nlast minute changes.\n  This means that the largest health care system in the country--to \nwhich millions of wounded and indigent veterans turn to for care--does \nnot know what funds it will receive, when it will be funded, or, in \nreality, whether vital programs will receive funding at all. This is no \nway to finance a national health care system with such a sacred \nobligation.\n  Today we suggest a better option. I am proud to introduce the Senate-\nversion of the Veterans Health Care Budget Reform Act. This bill would \nrequire that veterans' health care be funded one-year in advance of the \nregular appropriations process.\n  Unlike Medicare and Medicaid, veterans' health care would not be \nfunded as an entitlement: Congress would still review and manage \nfunding, as necessary, so as to maintain oversight.\n  By knowing what funding they will receive one year in advance, VA \nwould be able to plan more efficiently, and better use taxpayer dollars \nto care for veterans.\n  In addition to improving timeliness, this bill will deliver a more \ntransparent funding process. A GAO audit and public report to Congress \non VA funding would be provided annually.\n  I am proud to join a number of our nation's leading veterans' \norganizations, and a bipartisan team of supporters from the House and \nSenate in calling for this bill's passage. Joining me as cosponsors on \nthis bill are Senators Snowe, Johnson, Rockefeller, Sanders, Tester, \nBegich, Bingaman, Boxer, Feingold, Landrieu, Lautenberg, Menendez, \nMurkowski, Stabenow, Thune, Vitter, and Mr. Schumer.\n  Now is the time to secure timely, predictable veterans' health care \nfunding. Mr. President, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 423\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Health Care Budget \n     Reform and Transparency Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Title 38, United States Code, authorizes the Secretary \n     of Veterans Affairs to furnish hospital and domiciliary care, \n     medical services, nursing home care, and related services to \n     eligible and enrolled veterans, but only to the extent that \n     appropriated resources and facilities are available for such \n     purposes.\n       (2) For 19 of the past 22 fiscal years, funds have not been \n     appropriated for the Department of Veterans Affairs for the \n     provision of health care as of the commencement of the new \n     fiscal year, causing the Department great challenges in \n     planning and managing care for enrolled veterans, to the \n     detriment of veterans.\n       (3) The cumulative effect of insufficient, late, and \n     unpredictable funding for the Department for health care \n     endangers the viability of the health care system of the \n     Department and impairs the specialized health care resources \n     the Department requires to maintain and improve the health of \n     sick and disabled veterans.\n       (4) Appropriations for the health care programs of the \n     Department have too often proven insufficient over the past \n     decade, requiring the Secretary to ration health care and \n     Congress to approve supplemental appropriations for those \n     programs.\n       (5) Providing sufficient, timely, and predictable funding \n     would ensure the Government meets its obligation to provide \n     health\n\n[[Page S2233]]\n\n     care to sick and disabled veterans and ensure that all \n     veterans enrolled for health care through the Department have \n     ready access to timely and high quality care.\n       (6) Providing sufficient, timely, and predictable funding \n     would allow the Department to properly plan for and meet the \n     needs of veterans.\n\n     SEC. 3. TWO-FISCAL YEAR BUDGET AUTHORITY FOR CERTAIN MEDICAL \n                   CARE ACCOUNTS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS \n                   AFFAIRS.\n\n       (a) Two-Fiscal Year Budget Authority.--\n       (1) In general.--Chapter 1 of title 38, United States Code, \n     is amended by inserting after section 113 the following new \n     section:\n\n     ``Sec. 113A.

A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \neliminate discrimination in the immigration laws by permitting \npermanent partners of United States citizens and lawful permanent \nresidents to obtain lawful permanent resident status in the same manner \nas spouses of citizens and lawful permanent residents and to penalize \nimmigration fraud in connection with permanent partnerships; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to reintroduce the Uniting \nAmerican Families Act. This legislation will allow U.S. citizens and \nlegal permanent residents to petition for their foreign same-sex \npartners to come to the United States under our family immigration \nsystem. I thank Senators Whitehouse, Kerry, Schumer, Feingold, Wyden, \nCardin, Menendez, Murray, Brown, Akaka, and Lautenberg for their \nsupport of this legislation. I hope that the Senate will act to \ndemonstrate our Nation's commitment to equality under the law by \npassing this measure.\n  I am also grateful that Congressman Nadler is introducing this same \nmeasure in the House of Representatives. Congressman Nadler has been a \nsteady champion of this legislation, and I commend his efforts.\n  When the marker for the Senate's comprehensive immigration \nlegislation was introduced at the beginning of this Congress, I said \nthat among the changes needed in our immigration laws is equality for \ngay and lesbian Americans. The burdens and benefits of the laws created \nby the elected officials who represent all Americans should be shared \nequally, and without discrimination. With an historic election behind \nus, and the promise of a more just, peaceful, and prosperous world \nahead of us, let us begin to break down the barriers that still remain \nfor so many American citizens.\n  Under current law, committed same-sex foreign partners of American \ncitizens are unable to use the family immigration system, which \naccounts for a majority of the green cards and immigrant visas granted \nannually by the United States. As a result, gay Americans who are in \nthis situation must either live apart from their partners, or leave the \ncountry if they want to live with them legally and permanently. \nAccording to the most recent census, there are approximately 35,000 bi-\nnational, same-sex couples living in the United States. It is all but \ncertain that many of these couples will eventually be forced to make a \nchoice with which no American should be faced--to choose between the \ncountry they love and the person they love.\n  Some have expressed concern that providing this equality in our \nimmigration law will lead to more immigration fraud. At best these \nconcerns are misguided, and at worst they are a pretext for \ndiscrimination. This bill retains strong protections against fraud \nalready in immigration law. To qualify as a permanent partner, \npetitioners must prove that they are at least 18-years-old and are in a \ncommitted, financially interdependent relationship with another adult \nin which both parties intend a lifelong commitment. They must also \nprove that they are not married to, or in a permanent partnership with, \nanyone other than that person, and are unable to contract with that \nperson in a marriage cognizable under the Immigration and Nationality \nAct. Proof could include sworn affidavits from friends and family and \ndocumentation of financial interdependence. Penalties for fraud would \nbe the same as penalties for marriage fraud--up to five years in prison \nand $250,000 in fines for the U.S. citizen partner, and deportation for \nthe foreign partner. Discrimination based upon sexual orientation \nshould play no role in guarding against those who seek to abuse our \nimmigration laws.\n  Like many people across the country, there are Vermonters whose \npartners are foreign nationals and who feel abandoned by our laws in \nthis area: Vermonters like Gordon Stewart who has come to talk to me \nabout the unfairness of our current laws, or a committed, loving couple \nof 24 years in Brattleboro, VT, who travel back and forth between \nVermont and England, and who wish nothing more than to be able to be \ntogether in the United States. This bill would allow them, and other \ngay and lesbian Americans throughout our Nation who have felt that our \nimmigration laws are discriminatory, to be a fuller part of our \nsociety. The promotion of family unity has long been part of Federal \nimmigration policy, and we should honor that principle by providing all \nAmericans the opportunity to be with their loved ones.\n  The idea that immigration benefits should be extended to same-sex \ncouples is not a novel one. Many nations have come to recognize that \ntheir respective immigration laws should respect family unity, \nregardless of a person's sexual orientation. Indeed, 16 of our closest \nallies--Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, \nGermany, Iceland, Israel, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South \nAfrica, Sweden and the United Kingdom--recognize same-sex couples for \nimmigration purposes.\n\n[[Page S2234]]\n\n  I would ask all Senators to take heed of what my friend, Congressman \nJohn Lewis has said about discrimination against gay and lesbian \nAmericans, when he wrote in 2003: ``Rather than divide and \ndiscriminate, let us come together and create one nation. We are all \none people. We all live in the American house. We are all the American \nfamily. Let us recognize that the gay people living in our house share \nthe same hopes, troubles, and dreams. It's time we treated them as \nequals, as family.'' Congressman Lewis is right. I hope all Senators \nwill join me in supporting equality for all Americans and their loved \nones.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 424\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nprovide for the establishment of a traceability system for food, to \namend the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspections \nAct, the Egg Products Inspection Act, and the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act to provide for improved public health and food safety \nthrough enhanced enforcement, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, recent events involving E. coli- and \nsalmonella-tainted foods demonstrate once again that our country's food \ninspection, tracking, and safety system is unable to adequately protect \nAmerican consumers. At a time when too many Ohioans are struggling to \nput food on their tables, it is simply unacceptable that they also have \nto worry about the safety of that food.\n  The most recent food-borne illness outbreak was identified as a \nsalmonella contamination linked on January 12, 2009 to the Peanut \nCorporation of America's, PCA, plant in Blakely, GA. Since October of \nlast year, this salmonella outbreak has sickened 600 people in 43 \nstates. More an 1,900 products have been recalled--representing one of \nthe largest food recalls in our Nation's history. Yesterday, the \nnationwide death toll rose to nine. Ohio has reported 92 cases linked \nto this outbreak and two deaths, including this week's death of a \nMedina woman.\n  Unfortunately, the current salmonella outbreak is not the only food-\nborne illness outbreak to have plagued our Nation in recent years. Just \nlast year, Nebraska beef, an Omaha slaughterhouse, issued a recall of \n5.3 million pounds of meat after widespread reports indicated that its \nmeat was tainted with the sometimes-deadly strain of E. coli 0157:H7 \nbacteria. Health officials confirmed that 21 Ohioans, and 45 people in \ntotal, were made ill by this outbreak.\n  The current salmonella outbreak--taken alone--is a tragedy. The \ncurrent salmonella outbreak--taken in combination with recent beef, \nspinach, and jalapeno pepper disease outbreaks, which have sickened and \nkilled many--is evidence of a complete break-down in our nation's food \nsafety system.\n  More can--and must--be done to improve the safety of our food supply. \nIt is for this reason that I am introducing legislation today to \naddress some of the major problems plaguing the Food and Drug \nAdministration and the United States Department of Agriculture, the \nFederal agencies tasked with overseeing and protecting our nation's \nfood supply.\n  The bill I am introducing today, the Food Safety and Tracking \nImprovement Act, closely mirrors legislation that I introduced in the \n110th Congress, and would give the Federal Government the authority it \nneeds to protect American consumers. It would give the Government the \nauthority to recall tainted food and the tools to track the source of \nfood outbreaks. Most importantly, it would save lives by ensuring a \nswift and thorough Federal response to contamination outbreaks.\n  I think most Americans would be alarmed to learn that the. Federal \ngovernment does not currently have the authority to issue a mandatory \nrecall of contaminated food. Instead, America's food safety system \nrelies on voluntary recalls and self-policing by industry. The top \npriority for both USDA and FDA should be to protect the public's \nhealth--a mission that will sometimes require swift and decisive action \nthat, let's face it, may not be to industry's liking.\n  In the most recent outbreak, PCA was identified as the source of the \nsalmonella outbreak on January 12, 2009. While PCA issued a voluntary \nrecall of a limited number of peanut butter products the next day, it \nwasn't until 16 days later that PCA expanded its recall to encompass \nall peanut and peanut products processed at its Georgia facility.\n  In the Nebraska Beef case, had USDA been able to issue a mandatory \nrecall once it became clear that consumers' safety was at risk, unsafe \nfood would have been taken off of the shelves quicker and fewer \ncitizens would have purchased and consumed the contaminated meat.\n  We will never know how many more people consumed dangerous foods in \nthe 16 days that PCA kept its products on the market, or in the weeks \nthat Nebraska Beef decided to keep selling its products. But we do know \nthat allowing private companies to unilaterally decide whether or not \nto recall their products is not in the best interest of our country. We \nmust provide the relevant Federal agencies with mandatory recall \nauthority so that they can act swiftly and efficiently to ensure that \nthe public's safety is not compromised.\n  It is vital that FDA have the authority to remove dangerous products \nfrom grocery store shelves, from school cafeterias, and from nursing \nhome dinner trays as soon as regulators believe a threat exists. It is \nalso vital that we establish a Federal program to allow for quick and \naccurate tracing of tainted food back to the source of the problem. If \nthe United States Postal Service can track a package from my office in \nWashington to my office in Cincinnati, we should be able to do the same \nfor food products.\n  My legislation would provide $40 million over three years for the FDA \nto set up a national traceability system for all food under its \njurisdiction. This system would allow the Federal government to quickly \nidentify the origin of contaminated food and would be developed by an \nAdvisory Committee comprised of consumer advocates, industry leaders, \nand relevant representatives from FDA and USDA. The Committee would \ndetermine which tracking mechanisms, such as tracking numbers, \nelectronic barcodes, and Federal databases, should be employed to \nprotect consumers.\n  I have partnered in these initiatives with Representative Diana \nDeGette, a close colleague of mine in the House, who has long been an \nadvocate of providing our food safety regulators with these much-needed \npowers.\n  The time to reform our Nation's food safety system is now. We cannot \nwait for another peanut or beef or spinach disaster. It is the \nresponsibility of FDA and USDA to protect our nation's food supply and \nit is the responsibility of the United States Congress to ensure that \nthese agencies have the tools and authority they need to do their job. \nI urge all of my colleagues to join me in support of the Food Safety \nand Tracking Improvement Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNETT:\n  S. 426. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for progressive indexing and longevity indexing of Social \nSecurity old-age insurance benefits for newly retired and aged \nsurviving spouses to ensure the future solvency of the Social Security \nprogram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S2237]]\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we are awaiting the conference report on \nthe stimulus package. The papers and the airwaves are full of the fact \nthat this will be the largest expenditure we have made in peacetime \nperhaps in our history.\n  I think it well, as we wait for the details of the package, for us to \npause for a moment and take a longer look, beyond the recession, beyond \nthe financial circumstances we are facing at the moment, and look down \nthe road at what we are facing as a nation as a whole.\n  So I am going to make a historic pattern today and then introduce, at \nthe end, a bill I believe is necessary for us to deal with our \nfinancial problems. Let's go back a moment in history to the year 1966. \nWhy do I pick 1966? Because that was the year we significantly expanded \nthe entitlement spending in the United States. That was the year we \nadopted Medicare as a Federal program.\n  As you see from the chart, at that time the mandatory spending \nconstituted 26 percent of the budget. By ``mandatory,'' I mean spending \nthat we have to do. People are entitled to receive that money whether \nwe have the money or not; it is mandatory under the law.\n  The largest portion of the mandatory spending in 1966 was Social \nSecurity.\n  We were paying roughly 7 percent of our budget for interest. We had \nnondefense discretionary spending which was 23 percent. The big item, \nthe big ticket item that dominated the budget in 1966 was defense. It \nconstituted 44 percent of Federal spending in 1966.\n  Let's see what has happened since that time. Let's see where we are \ntoday. In fiscal 2008, this is where we are. The mandatory spending has \ngrown from 26 percent to 54 percent. Interest costs are roughly the \nsame. They were 7 percent; now they are 8. Nondiscretionary spending \nhas shrunk to 17 percent. Defense discretionary, even though we are in \na wartime, is 21 percent. It is clear the mandatory spending is taking \nover control of the Federal budget. And interest costs, of course, are \nmandatory. We owe those interest costs.\n  If you add the two together, 54 and 8, you get 62 percent of the \nFederal budget beyond the control of Congress. That is, when we pass \nthe appropriations bills, when we make our decisions what to spend \nmoney for, we are spending money in the minority; whereas, 62 percent \nmajority is out of our control. When you take away the defense spending \nand assume that has a semimandatory aspect to it and put defense \nspending in the mix, that means the Congress only has control of 17 \npercent of the budget, an amazing change in the roughly 40 years from \n1966 until today.\n  What does the future look like? I must make the point that every \nprojection we make around here is wrong. Every projection is an \neducated guess. But the educated guess of what will happen 10 years \nfrom now is that mandatory spending will have grown to 61 percent and \ninterest costs to 10 percent. That is 71. The Congressional Budget \nOffice won't make a guess as to the divide between defense and \nnondefense discretionary spending. So all discretionary spending will \nbe 29 percent, if we divide it in half, as it has historically been. \nThat means the Congress, just 10 years from now, will only control 10 \npercent of the Federal budget. All the rest of it will be on automatic \npilot. That is a startling thing to look forward to.\n  So as we talk about the stimulus package, we need to pause and pay a \nlittle attention to the entitlement spending that will go on and the \nkind of spending that will be built up, and we are adding to that with \nthis stimulus.\n  Here it is in the projections of what it will be. It constitutes a \nwave. Indeed, it has been referred to almost as a tsunami of spending. \nIt is broken down into the three primary sources of mandatory spending, \nthe three biggest entitlements. At the bottom is the one that is the \nbiggest now, and that is Social Security. But Social Security does not \ngrow as fast as the next one, which is Medicare. And then on top of \nthat is Medicaid. One can see this tsunami of spending will take our \nmandatory spending, which at the moment is less than 10 percent of GDP, \nup to more than 20 percent of GDP.\n  Let me show another chart that illustrates the same point in a \nslightly different way. You have the same entitlements. We have added \nin this chart discretionary spending. The solid line across is the \naverage revenue of the Federal Government. It is recorded in percentage \nof GDP. We have historically had a revenue average of 18.4 percent of \nGDP. As we can see in 2007, the expenditures were slightly above that \nline. The largest portion of the expenditure was the combination of \ndefense and nondefense discretionary spending. But the projection, as \nyou go out, you see that at some point the entitlements will take over \nevery dime we take in. The largest portion of it will be Medicare. \nSocial Security will still be there. Medicaid will still be there. \nDiscretionary spending will shrink even further as a percentage of what \nwe are dealing with.\n  Why is this happening? Is this some kind of a plot that somebody is \ninvolved in? No. This is a result of the demographic changes that are \noccurring in our country. This chart summarizes it with the headline: \n``Americans Are Getting Older.''\n  If you go back to 1950, the percentage of Americans who were age 65 \nor older was about 7 percent. It grew, the percentage, at a relatively \nslow level and then actually began to shrink. Why did it begin to \nshrink, the percentage of Americans 65 and over? This is a reflection \nof the Great Depression. People had fewer children in the Great \nDepression. So it follows that 65 years later, there were fewer people \nwho were of retirement age. But following the Great Depression, you had \nthe Second World War and then, when people came home from war, you had \nwhat historians refer to as the baby boom. All of those who came as a \nconsequence of that are called the boomers.\n  Starting in 2008, which is now history, the line started upward in a \ndramatic fashion. In the next 20 years, we are going to see something \nhappen that has never happened in American history. In the next 20 \nyears, the percentage of Americans who are over 65 is going to double. \nThat is what is driving all the numbers I put up before, all the \nchanges in entitlement spending. These people are already born. This is \nnot a projection that depends on guesses. This is something we can be \nsure of because the demographics of these folks are already there.\n  Now the projection is that 20 years from now, when the baby boomers \nfinish retiring, the rate of increase will slow down again and go back \nto the somewhat gentle rate it was before we got into this situation. \nBut that is the reality we are dealing with. In the next 20 years, the \npercentage of Americans who are 65 or over is going to double.\n  Let's look at some of the detail behind these demographics. Seniors \nare living longer. Not only are we going to get more of them, but they \nare living longer. That is why that trend is not going to turn down \nonce the baby boomers have been absorbed. If you go back to 1940, after \nyou reached 65 in 1940, if you were a male, your life expectancy was \nanother 12 years, female 13. The chart shows how it has changed. Now if \nyou are male and you reach 65, your life expectancy is another 16 \nyears. If you are female, it is another 19 years. And roughly a short \ndecade away, a male will go to 18 and female to 21. That means all the \nentitlement programs geared toward our senior citizens are going to be \ntapped into for many more years than was the case when they were put in \nplace.\n  If we go back to the history of Social Security, we realize Social \nSecurity was something of a lottery. When Social Security started in \nthe 1930s, roughly half of American workers did not survive until they \nwere 65. So it was a lottery with 100 percent of the people paying in \nand only 50 percent taking anything out. Those who paid in got nothing \nfor having done so. Those who survived to 65 got the benefit of their \nsurvival. Now you see they are living longer today, something like 75 \nor 80 percent of workers who join the workforce at age 20 are still \nalive at 65, so the lottery doesn't work anymore. Instead of half the \npeople paying into the lottery, not getting anything out, you have more \nthan three-quarters of the people who pay into the lottery getting \nsomething out. Then, once they get it, they get it for longer. The life \nexpectancy of Americans is going up, as was shown in the last chart. \nThis\n\n[[Page S2238]]\n\nshows the trend lines for male and female.\n  Again, in 1940, the life expectancy of Americans who had reached 65 \nwas, for males, about 75. When we get out into the future, it will be \n86. Put those two facts together. More people survive to 65 and, then, \nmore people who get into the pool over 65 stay there for more years.\n  All this means that the financial structure of Social Security is \nsimply unsustainable. Social Security cannot deal with these \ndemographic changes. This is not a Republican plot or a Democratic \nplot. This is the demographics of the reality of the fact that \nAmericans are healthier, living longer, and surviving to older age. So \nyou get this reaction to the Social Security situation.\n  We go to the next chart that shows how Social Security works, in \nterms of the lottery I was discussing. In 1945, the program was still \nin its infancy. So this is a bit of a distortion. There were 42 people \nworking and paying into the program for every one retiree drawing out. \nAs the program matured and more and more of the workers retired, this \nnumber very appropriately came down. By 1950, there were still 17 \nworkers paying into the program for every one retiree drawing out. \nToday there are three workers paying into the program for every one \ndrawing out. With the demographic realities I described in the previous \ncharts, we are looking at a time when there will be two workers for \nevery retiree. That means, if the retiree is going to take out $1,000 a \nmonth, each worker has to be putting in $500 a month in order to make \nthat happen and for a long period of time. This is how we have dealt \nwith this demographic change throughout our history. We have dealt with \nit by raising taxes. Every step along the way, as the number of workers \nto retirees has gone down, the amount of taxes every worker pays has \ngone up.\n  Here is the history of the payroll tax increases: In 1937, you paid \ntaxes on $3,000. That was it. Now it is $106,000. It has gone up and up \nall the way through.\n  This is unsustainable. You cannot continue to deal with the \ndemographic changes in Social Security by simply ratcheting up the \ntaxes. You have to do something to stabilize Social Security in a way \nthat it will be there for our children and our grandchildren.\n  There is a reported survey--I have seen it many places, but I have \nnever seen the source--that says a poll shows that among the young \npeople in America, more believe in the existence of UFOs than believe \nSocial Security will be available for them when they retire. I have \ngrandmothers come up to me spontaneously on the streets in Utah and \ntell me how concerned they are their children and grandchildren will \nnot have Social Security. I have people entering the workforce who come \nto me and say: Senator, my biggest question is, Will Social Security be \nthere for me? And, increasingly, people are sure it is not.\n  The legislation I introduce today is geared to make sure Social \nSecurity will be there for our children and our grandchildren and that \nit will be there at roughly the same level it is for us; that is, they \nwill not have to accept significantly less than we accept in order to \nmake this program work.\n  How do we do that in the face of this demographic challenge? How is \nthat possible? Well, one of our colleagues in the Senate for many \nyears, Senator Pat Moynihan of New York, had the answer. Senator \nMoynihan looked back on how Social Security benefits were calculated, \nand he said: We calculate the increase in Social Security benefits on \nthe wrong base. I do not want to get too technical, but the term that \napplies is ``wage-based'' increases for cost of living. Senator \nMoynihan pointed out the cost of living is not going up as rapidly as \nwages are. So if we would just adjust the base from wage base to cost-\nof-living base, a true cost-of-living base--that means we would slow \ndown the rate of growth in benefits, and in slowing down the rate of \ngrowth in benefits in that fashion, we would solve the problem. It \nwould become solvent.\n  That is fine. But what if you are someone who depends upon Social \nSecurity as your sole source of retirement? It was never intended that \nwould be the case when it was put in place, but it has become that way \nfor too many Americans. If they were to give up the benefit that comes \nfrom an overpayment--that is the form of wage-based adjustments--to go \nto the true payment of cost of increasing, which is the cost of the \nConsumer Price Index, it would hurt them. They would give up \nsignificant benefits. On the other hand, if you look at people such as \nWarren Buffett and Oprah Winfrey, they do not really need to have \nSocial Security go beyond the true increase in cost of living.\n  So the solution is to say, for those who are at the bottom of the \neconomic ladder, we keep Social Security benefits exactly as they are. \nFor Warren Buffett and Oprah Winfrey and those who are at the exact top \nend of the economic ladder, we take Senator Moynihan's idea and we put \nit in place and say: You will have to struggle by with a Social \nSecurity plan based on the actual increase in cost of living rather \nthan an inflated increase in cost of living.\n  What about those of us who are in between, the people at the bottom \nand the people at the very top? For those of us who fall in between \nthose two areas, we get a mix, a blend, if you will, of wage base or \ncost-of-living base. It is called progressive indexing. All of the \ndetails are available in hearings that have been held on this subject \nwhich I chaired when I was chairman of the Joint Economic Committee and \nin other publications that have addressed this question.\n  What will this do to the actual benefits of the people in Social \nSecurity? We have asked the Social Security Administration to tell us. \nNow, again, these are projections, and as projections, they are subject \nto some kind of challenge. But they are the best analysis that people \ncan make.\n  We start out with people who are currently 55; that is, only 10 years \naway from the 65 retirement date, although Social Security, by the time \nthey get there, will be at 67. But what is going to happen to them \nunder the bill I am introducing?\n  As shown on this chart, the dark bar is what a 2009 retiree will get. \nThe red bar is what a 2019 retiree will get. These are in constant \ndollars; that is, an adjustment has been made for inflation. You see in \nevery instance, the 2019 retiree will get more than the 2009 retiree.\n  Now, this is for the low earner. These are the people who are at the \nbottom third of our economic structure. Then the medium earner, and the \nhigh earner. So you see, in every case, people are made whole and \nprotected.\n  This last chart is for the max earner, the maximum earner, who, quite \nfrankly, probably does not exist. That would assume that somebody \nentered the workforce at age 20, earned $106,000 a year the first year, \nand continued to earn that level going on up through his entire career. \nThe maximum he could possibly draw from Social Security: that would be \nthat one.\n  But 82 percent of Americans fall in these two categories. So for \nsomeone age 55, under this bill, they come out just fine. They have \nnothing they should worry about.\n  Well, what about somebody who is 45, a little bit younger? What \nhappens to them? Again, these are the estimates made by the Social \nSecurity Administration. Once again, the low earners, they do better \nunder the Bennett plan. The medium earners, they do better under the \nBennett plan. The high earners, virtually the same under the Bennett \nplan.\n  We can make the statement that we are going to hold everybody \nharmless. We will adjust Social Security in a way that makes it \nsolvent, while at the same time preserving the same level of benefits \nwe have for those of us who are currently drawing Social Security \nbenefits, and we can see the same level of benefits would be available \nto those who come after us.\n  We will reach out all the way to 2075 and see what the estimates are \nfrom the Social Security Administration. These are people who will be \nborn in 2010. It is a little hard to make a projection as to how much \nmoney they will have when they are not alive yet, but the projections \nare made.\n  Once again, under the bill I am introducing today, in 2075, the \npeople at the bottom will do substantially better comparing today's \nbenefit of $800 to the potential benefit of nearly $1,300 because they \nare the ones who are held harmless in the way Social Security benefits \nare currently calculated. So\n\n[[Page S2239]]\n\nthey will get a significant position of significantly greater benefit \nthan they do under current law. The medium earner--well, they also will \ndo better. The high earner also will do better. Even the max earner \nwill come out essentially the same.\n  Now, I cannot guarantee these numbers. You cannot guarantee with any \ncertainty what the numbers are going to be in 2075. But the fact is \nthat the Social Security Administration, looking over a past version of \nthis bill I have introduced, has said everyone can look forward with \nsome certainty--this is my description of it, not their words--everyone \ncan look forward with some certainty to seeing that his or her Social \nSecurity benefits will be roughly the same as the benefits that are \nbeing paid to retirees today, and the system will be solvent, not \nrequiring any increase in taxes throughout the life of the system.\n  We have had a lot of debates about Social Security, and we have had a \nlot of proposals about Social Security. To my knowledge, this is the \nonly one that can say the two things I have just said; that is, that \neverybody's benefit, wherever they fall on the economic continuum, will \nbe held at roughly the same level as today's benefit--in the case of \nthe low earners, substantially better--and it can be done without \nraising any taxes. That is why we call this the Social Security \nSolvency Act.\n  Let me go back to the charts I put up in the beginning to stress once \nagain the importance of bringing entitlements under control.\n  As shown on this chart, this is where we were in 1966 before \nentitlements started to get out of control. We in the Congress \ncontrolled 23 percent of the budget in nondefense discretionary \nspending and 44 percent of the budget in defense spending. So we \ncontrolled the majority. Today, we have shrunk that to the point where \nwe control only 17 percent of the Federal budget, with 21 percent for \ndefense spending, and the mandatory and interest costs have grown to a \nmajority--a significant majority. Looking ahead just 10 years, if we do \nnot do something about the entitlements, the mandatory spending will be \n61 percent, 71 percent when you add interest costs. If you divide \ndefense and nondefense in this historic pattern, we will only have 15 \npercent of the entire Federal budget under our control for nondefense \ndiscretionary spending.\n\n  We are talking about the largest single expenditure in our peacetime \nhistory. As we adopt it, we should do so against the backdrop of what \nwe are looking at in mandatory spending down the road and realize if we \nare going to be able to afford this stimulus package, we have to have \nthe courage to tackle mandatory spending at the same time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I simply want \nto say to Senator Bennett, my partner lo these many years in the \nbipartisan effort to fix health care, how much I appreciate his \nleadership on the Social Security issue.\n  I think everybody understands what the demographics are all about. In \nfact, the demographics on Social Security are very similar to the \ndemographics on health care. Yet Senator Bennett has been out there \nprosecuting the case of trying to bring the Senate together for a \nbipartisan approach on Social Security, just as we have sought to do on \nhealth care.\n  I want to let the Senator from Utah know how much I am looking \nforward to working with him on this issue. I think he knows there are a \nnumber of us who believe this is going to take a bipartisan effort. \nLike most of the big issues, if you are going to get an enduring \nreform, bring the country together, you have to take the pursuit that \nSenator Bennett has followed, which is to do your homework and get the \nfinancial underpinnings in place.\n  I commend my colleague for all his effort to zero the attention of \nthe Senate in on the Social Security question. I am looking forward to \nworking with him in partnership on this issue as well as continuing our \nhealth care effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nOregon for his kind words. He was not here when I put up one chart \nwhich has now been taken away that showed the tsunami of entitlement \nspending, consisting of a band of three programs. The largest portion \nof that tsunami band was made up of health care spending. I will \nconfess to having taken the easy route. Social Security is the easiest \none to fix because we can make the kinds of changes I described here \nthat go back to the effort started by Senator Moynihan.\n\n  Here is the chart. We can see Social Security is the easy one and \neventually the small one. Medicare and Medicaid are the ones that are \ngoing to overwhelm us. They are the most difficult ones to fix.\n  So I am honored to have the Senator from Oregon say what he has to \nsay because he has been the leader in recognizing that this challenge; \nthat is, the challenge of dealing with the health care costs, is the \ntougher challenge, but, as with most tough challenges, it is also the \none that will produce the biggest reward. It is where the biggest \nopportunity lies.\n  As I have said many times and repeated here on the floor of the \nSenate, one of the things I realized while working with the Senator \nfrom Oregon is that the best way to get all of these costs under \ncontrol and turn these lines downward is to get quality going in our \nhealth care program. The bill I have had the honor to cosponsor, along \nwith the Senator from Oregon, is focused on getting proper quality into \nour health care system.\n  If the Senator from Oregon is successful, with whatever help I can \ngive him along with those others who have joined us, he will have made \na significant contribution to our country, not only in terms of the \nbenefits that come from having done health care right but from the \neconomic impact of having done health care right. He will have made it \npossible for us to even consider such expenditures as a target in the \nstimulus package because this is the backdrop against which we are \ngoing to have to pay for those. So I thank the Senator from Oregon for \nhis kind words, but I thank him even more for his valiant effort and \nhis leadership on the whole issue of trying to deal with the health \ncare challenge.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I would close this discussion with Senator \nBennett by saying that I think, having listened to his comments with \nrespect to Social Security and knowing of our work together on health \ncare, if anything, we have seen during this last couple of weeks of \ndiscussion about the economic stimulus how important it is going to be \nto bring the Senate together in the months ahead in a bipartisan way to \ntackle these most significant economic questions. You are not going to \nfix Social Security and you are not going to fix health care on a \nnarrowly partisan approach. The Senator has made that clear with the \nideas he has advanced on Social Security.\n  It is a pleasure to team up with the Senator on health care. I look \nforward to joining with him in following up on the Social Security \nproposal he has made this afternoon. I thank him for his work.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I again stress how grateful I am to the \nSenator for his leadership and how happy I am to be one of his cadre of \nloyal followers on this issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CASEY (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 429. A bill to ensure the safety of imported food products for the \ncitizens of the United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with my \ncolleague Senator Grassley, the EAT SAFE Act of 2009. Our bill is an \nimportant piece of foodsafety legislation that brings common sense \nsolutions to give Americans peace of mind that the foods they eat and \ngive their families is safe to consume.\n  We continue to see major problems in our food safety systems. Most \nrecently, there was both contaminated salsa and a massive peanut butter \nrecall. Two years ago, there was the major recall of animal feed and \npet food that contained contaminated Chinese gluten. These examples \nhighlight the need for action to ensure the safety of both domestic and \nforeign food products. Ensuring the safety of food products and food \ningredients brought into this country from other nations has taken on a \ngreater urgency.\n\n[[Page S2240]]\n\n  A report issued in September 2007 by the Interagency Working Group on \nImport Safety stated that, ``aspects of our present import system must \nbe strengthened to promote security, safety, and trade for the benefit \nof American consumers.'' The EAT SAFE Act that we are reintroducing \ntoday is designed to address one of those critical aspects of the food \nand agricultural import system that, in the face of the mounting \nimported food safety crisis, has received little public focus. That \nissue is food and other agricultural products that are being smuggled \ninto the United States.\n  When many people think of food smuggling, they likely think of it as \nsomething that occurs when travelers attempt to bring small amounts of \nforeign food or agricultural products into the U.S. by concealing it in \ntheir vehicles, luggage, or other personal affects. While this type of \nsmuggling is unquestionably a problem that U.S. authorities must and do \naddress, the larger threat of smuggled food and agricultural products \ncomes from the companies, importers, and individuals who circumvent \nU.S. inspection requirements or restrictions on imports of certain \nproducts from a particular country.\n  The ways in which these companies, importers, and individuals \ncircumvent the system can happen in any number of ways. Many times \nsmuggled products are intentionally mislabeled and bear the \nidentification of a product that can legally enter the country. Other \ntimes, smuggled products gain import entry through falsifying the \nproducts' countries of origin. And, many times, products that have \npreviously been denied entry are later ``shopped around,'' that is, \npresented to another U.S. port of entry in the effort to gain \nimportation undetected.\n  Just some examples of prohibited products discovered in commerce in \nthe United States in recent years include duck parts from Vietnam and \npoultry products from China, both nations with confirmed human cases of \navian influenza; unpasteurized raw cheeses from Mexico containing a \nbacterium that causes tuberculosis; strawberries from Mexico \ncontaminated with Hepatitis A; and mislabeled puffer fish from China \ncontaining a potentially deadly toxin. These smuggled food and \nagriculture products present safety risks to our food, plants, and \nanimals, and pose a threat to our Nation's health, economy, and \nsecurity.\n  The EAT SAFE Act addresses these serious risks by applying common-\nsense measures to protect our food and agricultural supply. This \nlegislation authorizes funding for the U.S. Department of Agriculture \nand the Food and Drug Administration to bolster their efforts by hiring \nadditional personnel to detect and track smuggled products. It also \nauthorizes funding to provide food safety cross training for Homeland \nSecurity Agricultural Specialists and agricultural cross training for \nCustoms' Border Patrol Agents to ensure that those men and women \nworking on the front lines are knowledgeable about these serious food \nand agricultural threats.\n  In addition to focusing on increased personal and training, the EAT \nSAFE Act also seeks to increase importer accountability. The \nlegislation requires private laboratories conducting tests on FDA-\nregulated products on behalf of importers to apply for and be certified \nby FDA. It also imposes civil penalties for laboratories or importers \nwho knowingly or conspire to falsify imported product laboratory \nsampling and for importers who circumvent the USDA import reinspection \nsystem.\n  Finally, the EAT SAFE Act will also ensure increased public awareness \nof smuggled products, as well as recalled food products, by requiring \nthe USDA and FDA to provide this information to the public in a timely \nand easily searchable manner.\n  These commonsense measures are an important first step towards \nsafeguarding American's food and agricultural supply and ensuring our \nNation's health, economy, and security. I urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 429\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I rise to speak about the EAT SAFE \nAct which I am once again cosponsoring with Senator Casey.\n  It seems like all too often we have a new food safety problem. It \nmight be contaminated food right here at home, or tainted goods coming \nin from other countries.\n  Now, as everyone in this body knows, I am a family farmer. And I take \npride in the food that I grow on my farm that helps to feed the world. \nI have never met a farmer who didn't want to produce safe food.\n  Many of us in Congress are parents and grandparents. We are always \nlooking at the foods we buy to stock our shelves because we know it \nwill impact the health of our loved ones. And so, everyone in this body \nshould have the same goal in protecting our food supply.\n  That is why the senator from Pennsylvania and I have seen the \nimportance of introducing a bipartisan food safety bill.\n  As part of our national security, we require a safe and secure food \nsupply. The importers of food into the U.S. have a duty to make sure \nwhat they supply is safe. At the same time, with trillions of dollars \nworth of products being imported into the U.S. every year, we need to \nmake sure that our inspectors can handle the workload.\n  The EAT SAFE Act puts an emphasis on training and personnel. We \nauthorize funding for both the Food and Drug Administration and the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture to hire additional personnel to detect \nand track smuggled food and a agricultural products. The bill would \nalso crosstrain Department of Homeland Security border patrol agents \nand agricultural specialists on food safety since they are our first \nline of defense to imported threats.\n\n[[Page S2243]]\n\n  In addition, our bill requires private laboratories conducting tests \non FDA-regulated products on behalf of importers, to apply for and be \ncertified by FDA. It directs FDA to develop a determination, \ncertification, and audit process for these private laboratories, and \nauthorizes FDA to collect user fees to cover certification costs. \nFinally, it imposes civil penalties for laboratories and importers who \nknowingly falsify laboratory sampling results and for importers who \ncircumvent the USDA import reinspection system.\n  Consumer confidence in America's food supply has always been high. \nBut as each week passes with a recall on something in our fridges and \npantries, that consumer confidence is slipping.\n  I believe this bill helps alleviate the threats from imported \nproducts and puts reliability into private lab testing. FDA does not \nhave the resources as we have seen with the recent peanut products \nrecall to fully monitor all the threats against our food supply.\n  I hope the introduction of this bill will get the seeds planted on \nwhat is sure to be a comprehensive look at our Nation's food system. I \nurge my colleagues to join Senator Casey and me and support this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 430. A bill to amend the Public Works and Economic Development Act \nof 1965 to reauthorize that Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \nreauthorize the Economic Development Administration, EDA. EDA works \nwith partners in economically distressed communities to create wealth \nand minimize poverty by promoting favorable business environments to \nattract private investment and encourage long-term economic growth. \nAuthorization of EDA's programs expired on September 30, 2008. I \noriginally introduced this bill in July 2008 so that we could avert \nthis lapse in authorization. Unfortunately, my bill was never enacted, \nso I am reintroducing it today.\n  Unlike the majority of the spending in the so-called ``stimulus'' \nbill passed by the Senate earlier this week, EDA investments actually \nprovide economic benefits. In fact, studies show that EDA uses federal \ndollars efficiently and effectively, creating and retaining long-term \njobs at an average cost that is among the lowest in government. Knowing \nthat, I was pleased to see some funding for EDA included in that \nmassive spending bill; I only wish more of that bill had been \nlegitimate economic stimulus.\n  Last year, I was disappointed to see an Obama campaign document refer \nto EDA as wasteful and ineffective government spending and propose \ncutbacks in funding for the agency. While I, too, am committed to \neliminating wasteful spending, I couldn't disagree more with that \ncharacterization of EDA.\n  In my home State of Oklahoma, for example, EDA has worked long and \nhard with many communities in need to bring in private capital \ninvestment and jobs. Durant, Clinton, Oklahoma City, Seminole, Miami \nand Elgin are just some of the Oklahoma communities that have made good \nuse of EDA assistance. In fact, over the past six years, EDA grants \nawarded in my home state have resulted in more than 9,000 jobs being \ncreated or saved. With an investment of about $26 million, we have \nleveraged another 30 million in State and local dollars and more than \n558 million in private sector dollars. I would call that a wonderful \nsuccess story.\n  Particularly in these difficult economic times, we should be doing \nall we can to ensure the continuation of such successful programs, and \nreauthorization is an important step. I hope now-President Obama \nreconsiders the rhetoric of then-candidate Obama and recognizes the \neffectiveness and importance of this agency. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues here in the Senate, as well as in the House of \nRepresentatives, to reauthorize the programs of the Economic \nDevelopment Administration as quickly as possible.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 430\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Morris K. Udall Scholarship and \nExcellence in National Environmental and Native American Public Policy \nAct of 1992 to honor the legacy of Stewart L. Udall, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator McCain \nin introducing a bill to amend the Morris K. Udall Scholarship and \nExcellence in National Environmental Policy Act, both to enhance the \nUdall Foundation and to honor one of the foremost environmental \nvisionaries of American history, Stewart L. Udall.\n  The Morris K. Udall Foundation was established by Congress in 1992 to \nprovide federal-funded scholarships to the growing number of students \nin America who wish to become environmental professionals in the public \nand private sectors and importantly, to identify and educate new \ngenerations of leaders in Indian Country. By now, there are more than \n1,100 young Udall Scholars and Udall Native American interns around the \ncountry. The educational programs of the Foundation have earned \nnational significance and are among the most sought after on American \ncampuses.\n  In 1998, Foundation grew to include a new Federal environmental \nmediation program created by Congress. Named the U.S. Institute for \nEnvironmental Conflict Resolution, the agency has played a quiet \nleading role to find common ground on issues as diverse as Everglades \nRestoration to the joint tribal-federal management of the National \nBison Range Complex. The Institute's small in-house staff, often \nworking in partnership with members of its national roster of \nmediators, have handled important conflict resolution processes in \ncollaboration with many federal departments including Interior, \nDefense, USDA Forest Service, and Transportation. Now more than ever, \nthese skills are needed to move infrastructure projects and restore the \neconomy.\n  The Udall Foundation is also a founder and funder of the Native \nNations Institute, NNI, a graduate educator and policy center for \nIndian Country. NNI teaches a new way of governance on the reservations \nwhich embraces tribal identity as a core principle and smart business \npractices as a way to assist Indian nations rebuild their economies. In \nthe last 5 years, more than 2,000 Native American leaders have \nbenefitted from its courses. New leaders emerging from the Foundation's \neducation programs are beginning to take their places in Tribal \ngovernance.\n  The Udall Foundation's Parks in Focus aims to connect underserved \nyouth to nature through the art of photography. The Foundation \norganizes week-long trips, introduces members of local Boys & Girls \nClubs, many of whom have never before left their communities, to some \nof the most beautiful natural landscapes in the country; provides them \nwith Canon digital cameras to use and keep; and teaches the basics of \nphotography, ecology, and conservation while exploring national parks, \nwildlife refuges, and other public lands. The Foundation will be \nexpanding the Parks in Focus program significantly in the coming years.\n\n[[Page S2245]]\n\n  The proposed legislation includes additional resources for operations \nof this fine agency as well as renaming it the Morris K. Udall and \nStewart L. Udall Foundation, in recognition of the historic Interior \nSecretary's contributions.\n  Stewart Udall was Secretary of the Interior under Presidents Kennedy \nand Johnson, where his accomplishments earned him a special place among \nthose ever to serve in that post and have made him an icon in the \nenvironmental and conservation communities. His best-selling book on \nenvironmental attitudes in the U.S., The Quiet Crisis, 1963, along with \nRachel Carson's Silent Spring, is credited with creating a \nconsciousness in the country leading to the environmental movement.\n  Stewart's remarkable career in public service has left an indelible \nmark on the Nation's environmental and cultural heritage. Born in 1920, \nand educated in Saint Johns, Arizona, Udall attended the University of \nArizona for 2 years until World War II. He served 4 years in the Air \nForce as an enlisted B24 gunner flying 50 missions over Western Europe \nfor which he received the Air Medal with three Oak Leaf Clusters. He \nreturned to the University of Arizona in 1946 where he played guard on \na championship basketball team and attended law school. He received his \nlaw degree and was admitted to the Arizona bar in 1948. He married Erma \nLee Webb during this time. They raised 6 children.\n  Stewart was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Arizona \nin 1954. He served with distinction in the House for 3 terms on the \nInterior and Education and Labor committees. In 1960, President Kennedy \nappointed Stewart Udall Secretary of Interior. In this role, he oversaw \nthe addition of four parks, 6 national monuments, 8 seashores and \nlakeshores, 9 recreation areas, 20 historic sites and 56 wildlife \nrefuges to the National Park system. During his tenure as the Interior \nSecretary, President Johnson signed into law the Wilderness Act, the \nWater Quality Act, the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act and National Trails \nBill. Stewart also helped spark a cultural renaissance in America by \nsetting in motion initiatives that led to the Kennedy Center, Wolf Trap \nFarm Park, the National Endowments for Arts and the Humanities, and the \nrevived Ford's Theatre.\n  Stewart currently resides in Santa Fe, NM, and will turn 90 years old \nin the coming year.\n  The Udall Foundation is an exemplary organization doing remarkable \nwork and I am pleased to support additional resources to this agency. \nIn addition, Stewart displayed significant leadership in helping to \nenact much of the legislation that protects our environment and lands \ntoday as well as being one of the first people to point to problems in \nthe environment. For these and many other reasons, he deserves \ninclusion in the Foundation on par with his brother, Morris.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure swift passage \nof this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL, of New Mexico (for himself and Mr. Udall, of \n        Colorado):\n  S. 433. A bill to amend the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of \n1978 to establish a renewable electricity standard, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise to introduce \nlegislation to establish a Federal renewable electricity standard. \nBefore I talk about what that will do, let me tell you a little bit \nabout the people it will help.\n  Luna County, NM has a double-digit unemployment rate. More than half \nof its children live in poverty. It was in recession before our current \neconomic crisis. If nothing changes, it will be in recession long after \nthe rest of the country recovers. Now, let me be clear. Luna County \ndeserves help, but I'm not looking to spend a lot of money. We usually \nthink of economic development as something you pay for. But the \nproposal I am introducing today does not spend a dime. In fact, my plan \nwill generate tax revenue.\n  Luna County has something else worth noting. When you look at the \nUnited States on a map that measures solar thermal energy, Luna County \nis red hot. Like hundreds of small communities across our country, Luna \nhas immense untapped potential for renewable energy. If Luna can find a \nway to sell its sunlight, its future will be secure. But Luna has a \nproblem. America's energy markets do not value Luna's sunlight the way \nthey should. These markets ignore three critical things. First, growing \ndemand and stagnant supply mean rising prices for fossil fuels. The \nprice of natural gas has more than tripled since 1995. Unless we act, \nwe can expect more price spikes in the future, spikes that threaten the \neconomy. But it is easier for utilities to buy a little more natural \ngas than it is to invest in clean technologies. The result is that we \nare moving forward as if our energy use is sustainable, when we know it \nis not.\n  In most markets, this would be bad enough, but our energy markets \nhave two other problems. Americans care whether our energy comes from \nfarmers in Iowa or mullahs in Iran, but our markets do not. When we buy \nsolar energy from Luna County, we keep our money in this country, and \nwe make ourselves less dependent on countries such as Russia and Iran, \ncountries that have shown their willingness to use our dependence \nagainst us. America's energy markets also ignore global climate change. \nRight now a clean electron produced by the sun costs as much as an \nelectron produced by burning carbon. Our markets don't care whether the \nenergy we consume is leading to fewer farms and more forest fires. They \ndon't care whether our grandchildren will be able to live comfortably \non this Earth. They just don't care. And we are paying the price. Even \nthe most conservative economists will tell us that energy is a classic \ncase of market failure. The energy market ignores our economic \nsecurity, our national security, and the future of our world. \nEconomists call these things externalities. I call them the basis of \nour way of life.\n  So what do we do? I am proposing that we demand a little bit more \nfrom our utilities. Let's require that they produce 25 percent of their \nelectricity from renewable sources by 2025. Thanks in large part to \nSenator Bingaman, the Senate has already passed a similar proposal \nthree times. Last year I was proud to help pass a proposal such as this \nin the other body.\n  Renewable electricity standards have succeeded at the State level. In \nfact, more than 28 States have renewable standards, including the State \nof New Mexico. But a national RES has never become the law of the land. \nIt is time for Congress to make it so.\n  There are many reasons to support this plan. To start, it is good for \nconsumers. Scientists looking at a 20-percent standard concluded that \nit could save utility customers $31.8 billion. A 25-percent standard \nwould save even more. A renewable energy standard would also strengthen \nrural communities and provide new income for farmers and ranchers.\n  This plan will make America safer. The billions of dollars it will \ngenerate are dollars that cannot be used to hold our foreign policy \nhostage.\n  Most importantly, a national renewable standard will create hundreds \nof thousands of high-paying jobs, jobs that cannot be outsourced. Study \nafter study shows that shifting capital to renewable energy increases \njob creation. Not only will this plan stimulate job creation today, it \nwill put us on a path toward dominance in the industries of the future.\n  Some of my colleagues will probably say a renewable standard makes \nsense for sunny New Mexico, but it won't work for their States. I urge \nthem to take another look at their States. Scientists predict that \nFlorida could one day meet one-third of its energy needs by tapping the \npower of the gulf stream. Louisiana has wind energy potential offshore, \nand New Orleans has already begun to rebuild its economy by creating \njobs developing solar energy. Alaska has wind energy potential all over \nits coast and geothermal potential in the south. The State of Tennessee \nconcluded its existing investment in renewables could yield 4,500 jobs \nand additional investment could yield 45,000.\n  Everywhere we look, America has untapped renewable energy potential. \nBut for the sake of argument, let's say that Louisiana might have to \nimport some energy from Florida under a national renewable standard. \nLouisiana already\n\n[[Page S2246]]\n\nimports a big chunk of its energy. As consumption rises, more and more \nof Louisiana's energy comes from imports. Today those imports come \nlargely from natural gas, and 43 percent of the world's natural gas is \nunder Russia and Iran. So Louisiana is bidding up the price of a \ncommodity that is largely controlled by countries that don't like us. I \nwould rather buy hydropower from Florida than fossil fuels from Iran.\n  The choice is not between importing and not importing. It is between \nCharlie Crist and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. This is not a tough choice.\n  Of course, some people say they support a renewable standard, but not \nyet. They say America cannot afford to reduce our contribution to \nclimate change because the growth of China and India will drown out the \nimpact of our emissions reductions. This concern is very real, but it \nrepresents a failure of our moral imagination. If we are to have a \nfuture as a country and as a global community, we cannot see the \nworld's aspiring middle class as potential threats. We have to see them \nas potential customers. And we should be racing to develop the \ntechnologies they will need.\n\n  Waiting for China to address its emissions problem before we address \nours is like waiting for an opponent to finish the race before we start \nto lace up.\n  Right now, the world is engaged in a high-stakes competition; America \njust does not always admit it. As the world's citizens see the impact \nof climate change, we are demanding energy supplies that do not \nendanger our collective future. That means soon clean energy will not \nbe an alternative, it will be the standard. When that happens, \nwhichever country dominates the clean energy industry will be able to \ncreate jobs on a grand scale.\n  Do not take my word for it. The CEO of GE Energy has testified before \nthe Congress that ``wind and solar energy are likely to be among the \nlargest sources''--largest sources--``of new manufacturing jobs \nworldwide during the 21st Century.'' Think about what he said:\n\n       [W]ind and solar energy are likely to be among the largest \n     sources of new manufacturing jobs. . . .\n\n  We hear a lot of discussion on this floor about new manufacturing \njobs and us losing manufacturing jobs. Well, this is where the new \nmanufacturing jobs are going to be.\n  A growing chorus of economists and business leaders agree with what \nthis GE Energy CEO has said.\n  America cannot afford to let another country become the world's clean \nenergy leader. But right now we are falling behind. Countries that have \ndone much more to shape their energy markets have already created \nthriving green energy industries. With a population roughly one-quarter \nas large as America's, Germany has more than twice as many workers \ndeveloping wind energy technologies. Spain has almost five times as \nmany workers in the solar thermal industry as America. China has more \nthan 300 times as many.\n  America is not falling behind because our scientists are not smart \nenough. Some of the big ideas now powering the economies of Europe \noriginated right here. From 1970 to 1996, Los Alamos National Lab \ndeveloped a technique for cleanly and efficiently using the Earth's \nheat to generate electricity. Estimates indicated the technique could \neventually power the Earth for hundreds of years. But without market \nincentives to encourage continued development, progress stagnated. \nGermany took that technology and brought it to market in just 3 years. \nThey now have 150 geothermal plants nearing completion. Think of the \njobs that will create. Those could be our jobs. Those should be our \njobs.\n  A renewable electricity standard would let America catch up and take \nthe lead. We still have the world's most productive workers. We still \nhave the most creative entrepreneurs. Our culture encourages individual \ninitiative to solve tough problems. But if we want to win, we have to \nact now.\n  The American people are ready for this. I have driven to every county \nin New Mexico, and everywhere I saw innovation. I saw wind turbines \ngoing up in Little Texas. I saw the spot in Deming, NM, where the \nworld's largest solar plant will sit. At Mesalands Community College in \nTucumcari, NM, I saw a classroom in a wind turbine hundreds of feet \nover the desert. Even Luna County is starting to develop its resources. \nThey just need help.\n  The Federal Government is late to the party. We should be leading the \nclean energy revolution. Instead, our constituents are leaving us in \nthe dust. The private sector is working hard, but they need us to \ncreate a market that supports their efforts. They need a market that \nvalues our economic security, our national security, our environmental \nsecurity.\n  Mr. President, it is time for us to lead.\n  Now, you might have noticed that we New Mexicans are passionate about \nrenewable energy. As I said earlier, Jeff Bingaman has led on this \nissue for years. As I said earlier, he has passed a renewable standard \nin the Senate three times. I introduced this legislation today because \nI want to help Senator Bingaman win this fight. I look forward to \nworking with him and with all of you to get a renewable electricity \nstandard signed into law.\n  I am also pleased to be introducing this legislation with another \nSenator, a Senator with a very distinguished last name: my cousin, the \nsenior Senator from Colorado. We spent a decade in the other body \ntogether. And much of that time was spent working to pass a renewable \nelectricity standard. We were both attracted to his proposal because it \nreflects the kind of Western pragmatism that people in Colorado and New \nMexico like. I know this issue is important to both of us. I want to \nthank the Senator for continuing this effort with me, and for his \nsupport through the years.\n  Instead, our constituents are leaving us in the dust.

Res. 10. A joint resolution supporting a base Defense Budget \nthat at the very minimum matches 4 percent of gross domestic product; \nto the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am introducing today a joint resolution, \nS.J. Res. 10, with Congressman Trent Franks introducing the identical \njoint resolution in the House, which sets a minimum baseline for \ndefense spending.\n  By establishing a minimum defense base budget of 4 percent, this \ncountry can achieve two critical needs--national security and economic \ngrowth.\n  For the past few weeks, this Congress has been debating an economic \nstimulus plan. Defense spending, along with infrastructure spending and \ntax cuts, has a greater stimulative impact on the economy than some of \nthe provisions in there. In fact, I had amendments, which I will \ndescribe in a minute, that would have increased the percentage in this \nhuge bill, so that you would have maybe up to 10 percent for \ntransportation infrastructure and then defense--I will explain that in \nmore detail later.\n  Our level of defense spending must consider the resources needed to \nmeet current and future needs. In order to provide this stability, \nCongress needs to guarantee a not less than baseline in defense \nfunding, enabling the Pentagon to execute sustained multiyear program \ninvestments. Guaranteeing a\n\n[[Page S2247]]\n\nbaseline budget, not including supplemental, that sets the floor based \non our GDP is the best way to accomplish this.\n  At this point, I acknowledge that I had an experience back during the \nfirst hearing we had for the confirmation of then-Defense Secretary \nRumsfeld. I asked the question at that time: We have serious problems. \nWe don't know what our future needs are going to be. We may think we \nknow what they are going to be today--and we have a lot of smart \ngenerals who will tell us, but they are going to be wrong. I remember \nat that time I said that in 1994 someone testified and said in 10 years \nwe would no longer need to have a ground force, that everything would \nbe done from the air in a precision, clean way. That would be awfully \nnice, but that is not the way it happened. I said, recognizing that we \nneed to have the best of everything, what would be your recommendation? \nHe said that he made a study of this--it was not his, but he said that \nif you will go back and study it over the last 100 years, the average \namount of defense spending has been 5.7 percent of GDP. That was all \nduring the 20th century, for 100 years.\n  Now, we went down at the end of the 1990 to as low as 2.9 percent, \nand now we are at 3.6 percent. The problem is the predictability. It is \nnot there. We don't know in these systems what we can rely on. We know \nthe cost of closing down a manufacturing line, but we don't have the \npredictability we need.\n  There are some who think by cutting unnecessary weapons systems along \nwith reforming DOD's procurement process, we can reduce defense \nspending and still maintain a military level that could defend our \nNation and reach the minimum expectations of the American people. The \nproblem with that is that it doesn't happen that way. Yes, we need \nacquisition reform, I agree. But the overall budget outlays and the \nproblems we have--this alone will not rebuild our military.\n  We could eliminate weapons systems that are called low-hanging fruit. \nThat has already been done several years ago. I think we all remember--\nand some would rather forget--that after the Cold War, there were so \nmany in this Chamber who said we were in a position then where we did \nnot need the military because the Cold War was over. We talked about \nall kinds of schemes that would transfer previous military spending \ninto current spending for social programs. This is the way people were \nthinking at that time, that the Cold War is over. They had this \neuphoric attitude that we didn't need to continue a strong defense.\n  We have been trying to get past a bow wave created in the 1990s. As a \nresult, the amount of defense spending actually appropriated during \nthat 8 years, the 1990s, was $412 billion above the budget request. In \nother words, the budget request was $412 billion below what was \nsustained at the beginning of that 8-year period. This is what we are \npaying for now. Little did we know at that time that 9/11 would come, \nand that while we are trying to rebuild our military in terms of \nmodernization, force strength, we would be attacked and have to start \ndefending America and prosecuting a war.\n  I believe we should spend only as much as we need to ensure our \nnational defense--no more, no less. This joint resolution sets a \nminimum baseline for defense spending. By establishing a minimum \ndefense budget of 4 percent, this country can achieve two critical \nneeds--national security and economic health.\n  First, it will allow our military to develop and build the next \ngeneration of weapons and equipment. This is something we have been \nconcerned about--weapons and equipment that will be needed to maintain \nour national security over the next 40 years or more. The age of the \nlast KC-135R, when it retires, will be 70 years old, and the B-52 will \nbe even older than that. We are still doing this. We need this \ncontribution for more heavy equipment. Right now, we have gotten into a \nproblem of not developing them. They say the old KC-135R--we have a few \nmore years on that. If we started today on a new lift vehicle to \nreplace that, it would be several years before we would be able to have \nthese replaced.\n  The second thing is it will create and maintain jobs across America \nand sustain our military industrial base. Investing in our Nation's \ndefense provides thousands of sustainable American jobs and provides \nfor our national security at the same time. Experts estimate that each \n$1 billion in procurement spending correlates to 6,500 jobs.\n  Major defense procurement programs are all manufactured in the United \nStates with our aerospace industry alone employing 655,000 workers \nspread across 44 States. The U.S. shipbuilding industry supports more \nthan 400,000 workers in 47 States.\n  Establishing a minimum baseline defense budget will allow the \nDepartment of Defense and the services to plan for and fund acquisition \nprograms based on a minimum known budget through what we call our FYDP \nprogram.\n  We are no longer able to complete purchases of large acquisition \nprograms in 3 to 5 years. The KC-X will take over 30 years to complete \nonce its contract is awarded. We will still be flying these up until \nthat time.\n  Programming from a known minimum budget for the outyears will \ntranslate to less programming and more stability for thousands of \nbusinesses throughout the United States at decreased costs.\n  This week, I voted against this massive Government spending bill that \nprovided plenty in the way of more wasteful Government spending and \nlittle in the way of stimulative opportunities such as defense \nspending.\n  I offered two amendments. One would have increased defense spending, \nand without changing the top line of the bill that was before us, it \nwould change within it to have more defense spending and provide jobs. \nAt the same time, in this entire $900 billion--or whatever it ends up \nbeing--bill that we are prepared to vote on out of conference, only $27 \nbillion was in roads, bridges, and the things that Americans know we \nneed.\n  If we had that along with the additional amount or percentage that \nwould go to defense spending, it would equate to an increase of an \nadditional 4 million jobs. This is what we have heard President Obama \ntalking about for quite some time. That is one way to do it. At the \nsame time, we have something that is lasting.\n  We--and certainly the Chair knows this because she sits on the same \ncommittee, the Environment and Public Works Committee--we are going to \nbe doing a reauthorization of the highway bill. There is more we could \nhave done in this particular bill that is totally inadequate in terms \nof putting people to work. The amendments we offered were defeated.\n  Today Congressman Trent Franks and I are simultaneously offering a \njoint resolution to keep this country safe, restore our military to the \nlevel of capability and readiness the people of this country demand, \nand provide for sustainable jobs in almost every State in the country.\n  By voting for this joint resolution, we send a clear signal to our \nmilitary, to our allies, to our enemies--all alike--that we are \ncommitted to the security of this Nation and that we will not have to \ngo through something like we went through during the nineties.\n  One of the great heroes of our time is GEN John Jumper. Before he was \nChief of the Air Force, he stood in 1998 and made a very courageous \nstatement. He said now the Russians are cranking out through their SU-\n30s, SU-35s, a strike vehicle better than anything we have in this \ncountry. The best ones at that time were the F-15 and F-16. Had it not \nbeen for his statement as a wakeup call to the American people, China, \nthat bought a bunch of SU vehicles from Russia would have better \nvehicles than we were sending up with our fliers in potential combat. \nAll of a sudden, we were able to turn around and start programs such as \nthe F-22 and F-35 so we could be No. 1.\n  The American people assume all the time we are No. 1, and obviously \nwe are not. When the American people find out the best artillery piece \nwe have right now, which is called Paladin--it is World War II \ntechnology. You have to get out and swab the breach after every shot. \nIt is outrageous. Prospective enemies in the field would have better \nequipment than we would have.\n  The best way to do this and ensure this in the future is to have a \nbaseline. I am hoping we will get the support of enough Senators to get \nthis passed in both the House and the Senate since it is a joint \nresolution.\n  Lastly, let me address some of the points that were said by the \nSenator\n\n[[Page S2248]]\n\nfrom Florida. I agree with all his comments. He is a little nicer about \nit than I am, I guess. Don't lose sight of the fact that this is \nsupposed to be a stimulus bill, not a spending bill. But it is a \nspending bill.\n  We had people analyze what in this bill will stimulat the economy. \nThere are two things that can do it: the right types of tax relief. We \nknow this is true. We remember what happened during President Kennedy's \nterm and the recommendation he made when he said we have to have more \nrevenues to run our Great Society programs. The best way to increase \nrevenue is decrease marginal rates. He decreased marginal rates. \nBetween the years 1961 and 1968, our revenues increased by 62 percent. \nUnbelievable.\n  In the year 1980, the total amount of money that came from marginal \nrates was $244 billion. In 1990, it was $466 billion. It almost doubled \nin the decade when we had the greatest reductions in capital gains \nrates, in marginal rates, inheritance tax rates.\n  There are only two very minor items in this bill that address the tax \nsituation. One has to do with accelerated depreciation. Another is with \nloss carryback, increasing it from 2 years to 5 years, I believe it is. \nIf you add that together in terms of the cost that is in the bill, this \n$900 billion bill we are going to be passing, we have to keep in mind \nthat is a very small part. It amounts to about 3\\1/3\\ percent. The \nother way you can stimulate is to increase jobs.\n  I mentioned we had an amendment to increase jobs. It is outrageous \nthat there is only $27 billion worth of highway construction, road \nconstruction, and bridge construction that we desperately need in this \ncountry in this bill.\n  We have right now $64 billion worth of shovel-ready jobs that we \ncould actually produce in this country, and all we have is 3\\1/3\\ \npercent of the entire amount of $900 billion going to that type of \nprogram. That is where I come up with the conclusion that this bill is \n7 percent stimulus and 93 percent spending.\n  I have to tell you, back when the first $700 billion program came \nalong in October, yes, that came from our administration, a Republican \nadministration, a Republican Secretary of the Treasury. But also the \nDemocrats were all very enthusiastically behind it. I opposed it at \nthat time and said there are two problems with it. No. 1, this amount \nof money, $700 billion, is more money, it is the largest expenditure, \nlargest authorization in the history of the world, and we are giving \nit, No. 2, to a guy with no guidelines, without any kind of oversight.\n  We have seen now that has not worked. Now we have the second half of \nthat, and we find out yesterday the current Secretary of the Treasury \nis going to use it any way he wants. Again, no oversight. This was a \nhorrible mistake. That was the $700 billion last October.\n  Now we are faced with something far greater than that. I know it is \ngoing to go through. It is a Democratic bill. It is not a bipartisan \nbill. It is not a compromise. It is a Democratic bill. They took the \nHouse bill and the Senate bill and something will come from that. \nWhether it is closer to the House bill or the Senate bill, it does not \nmatter. It is going to be close to $900 billion, something we should \nnot have had.\n  We are thinking in new terms now. I used to say back during the $700 \nbillion, if you take the total number of families in America who are \nfiling tax returns and do your math, it comes to $5,000 a family. That \nwas bad enough. This bill comes to $17,400 a family over a 10-year \nperiod. That is what we have to start thinking about.\n  I am hoping the American people will look at this bill and realize \nthis gigantic spending bill follows a philosophy that you can spend \nyour way out of a recession. It has never happened before. It is not \ngoing to happen with this bill.\n  We want to do the very best we can. I know President Obama did not \nwant to go as far this way. I think the House and the Senate have \nsteered this into a bigger spending bill than he would have liked. I \nthink he would have liked more stimulants in this bill.\n  Let's do the best we can with it and then let's get busy and try the \nthings we know have worked in the past and will work in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/12/senate-section/article/S2248-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 38--COMMEMORATING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF PRESIDENT \n            ABRAHAM LINCOLN ON THE BICENTENNIAL OF HIS BIRTH\n\n  Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Burris, Mr. \nLugar, and Mr. McConnell) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                               S. Res. 38\n\n       Whereas President Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, \n     1809, to modest means, in a 1-room log cabin in Kentucky;\n       Whereas Abraham Lincoln spent his childhood in Indiana, \n     and, despite having less than a year of formal schooling, \n     developed an avid love of reading and learning;\n       Whereas Abraham Lincoln arrived in Illinois at the age of \n     21;\n       Whereas, while living in Illinois, Abraham Lincoln met and \n     married his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, built a successful legal \n     practice, served in the State legislature of Illinois, was \n     elected to Congress, and participated in the famous \n     ``Lincoln-Douglas'' debates;\n       Whereas Abraham Lincoln left Illinois 4 months after being \n     elected President of the United States in 1860;\n       Whereas Abraham Lincoln was the first member of the \n     Republican party elected President of the United States and \n     helped build the Republican party into a strong national \n     organization;\n       Whereas, after his election and the secession of the \n     southern States, Abraham Lincoln steered the United States \n     through the most profound moral and political crisis, and the \n     bloodiest war, in the history of the Nation;\n       Whereas, by helping to preserve the Union and by holding a \n     national election, as scheduled, during a civil war, Abraham \n     Lincoln reaffirmed the commitment of the people of the United \n     States to majority rule and democracy;\n       Whereas the Emancipation Proclamation signed by Abraham \n     Lincoln declared that slaves within the Confederacy would be \n     forever free and welcomed more than 200,000 African American \n     soldiers and sailors into the armed forces of the Union;\n       Whereas the Emancipation Proclamation signed by Abraham \n     Lincoln fundamentally transformed the Civil War from a battle \n     for political unity to a moral fight for freedom;\n       Whereas the faith Abraham Lincoln had in democracy was \n     strong, even after the bloodiest battle of the war at \n     Gettysburg;\n       Whereas the inspiring words spoken by Abraham Lincoln at \n     Gettysburg still resonate today: ``that these dead shall not \n     have died in vain;

with \n     charity for all'';\n       Whereas Abraham Lincoln became the first President of the \n     United States to be assassinated, days after giving a speech \n     promoting voting rights for African Americans;\n       Whereas, through his opposition to slavery, Abraham Lincoln \n     set the United States on a path toward resolving the tension \n     between the ideals of ``liberty and justice for all'' \n     espoused by the Founders of the United States and the ignoble \n     practice of slavery, and redefined what it meant to be a \n     citizen of the United States;\n       Whereas, in his commitment to unity, Abraham Lincoln did \n     more than simply abolish slavery;

This hearing will continue the \nSubcommittee's examination of financial institutions which are located \nin offshore tax havens and which use practices that facilitate tax \nevasion and other misconduct by U.S. clients. One of the banks featured \nin a July 2008 hearing on this topic is UBS, a major financial \ninstitution headquartered in Switzerland. The hearing will examine \nissues related to a John Doe summons served by the IRS on UBS seeking \nthe names of U.S. clients with UBS Swiss accounts that have not been \ndisclosed to the IRS. In July, UBS representatives estimated that about \n19,000 U.S. clients had about $18 billion in assets in such Swiss \naccounts. UBS stated at the July 2008 hearing that it would cooperate \nwith the IRS summons, but to date virtually none of the requested \ninformation has been provided to either the IRS or the U.S. Department \nof Justice which is also examining the matter. The hearing will examine \nthe status of the information exchange, the role of U.S.-Swiss tax and \nlegal assistance treaties, and the effect of Swiss secrecy laws on the \ninformation requests. A witness list will be available Friday, February \n20, 2009.\n  The Subcommittee hearing is scheduled for Tuesday, February 24, 2009, \nat 10:00 a.m., in room 342 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 17, the \nnomination of Leon Panetta to be Director of the CIA; that the \nnomination be confirmed and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; that no further motions be in order; that any statements \nrelating to the nomination be printed in the Record; that the President \nbe immediately notified of the Senate's action; and the Senate return \nto legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nomination considered and confirmed is as follows:\n\n\n                      central intelligence agency\n\n       Leon E. Panetta, of California, to be Director of the \n     Central Intelligence Agency.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today as chairman of the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence on the Senate's confirmation of Leon Panetta \nto be the next Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.\n  Mr. Panetta is well-known to many of us for his long, distinguished \nrecord of public service, including eight terms in Congress and service \nas a presidential chief of staff.\n  Mr. Panetta knows well the inner workings of government at the \nhighest levels. He has an impeccable reputation for integrity, and I am \nconfident that he is the right man at the right time to lead the CIA.\n  Leon Panetta is a product of my home State, California, born in \nMonterey. His parents, Carmelo and Carmelina, ran a local cafe and \nlater purchased a walnut ranch, which he still owns. He majored in \npolitical science at Santa Clara University, where he graduated magna \ncum laude in 1960.\n  In 1963, he received his JD from Santa Clara University as well. \nAfter law school, he served in the United States Army from 1964 to \n1966, and attended the Army Intelligence School.\n  In 1966, Mr. Panetta joined the Washington, DC, staff of Republican \nSenator Thomas Kuchel of California.\n  In 1969, he served as Director of the Office of Civil Rights in the \nOffice of\n\n[[Page S2254]]\n\nHealth, Education and Welfare in the Nixon Administration.\n  From 1970 to 1971, he worked as the executive assistant to New York \nCity Mayor John Lindsay. Afterward, he returned to Monterey, to private \nlaw practice.\n  In 1976, he ran and won election to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, and he served in the House for 16 years. During that \ntime, he also served as chairman of the Budget Committee.\n  In 1993, he joined the Clinton administration as head of the Office \nof Management and Budget. In July 1994, Mr. Panetta became President \nClinton's chief of staff.\n  He served in that capacity until January 1997, when he returned to \nCalifornia to found and lead the Leon and Sylvia Panetta Institute for \nPublic Policy at California State University Monterey Bay.\n  Mr. Panetta and his wife, Sylvia, have three sons and five \ngrandchildren.\n  It is very fair and safe for me to say that he has a reputation for \nintelligence and integrity.\n  In speaking with Mr. Panetta and President Obama multiple times, I am \nconvinced that Mr. Panetta will surround himself with career \nprofessionals, including Deputy Director Stephen Kappes. He has \ncommitted to keeping the senior leadership of the CIA in place, but at \nthe same time has vowed to bring new policies and new leadership to the \nAgency.\n  I know Mr. Panetta has immersed himself in CIA matters since being \nnominated, and his top priority, if confirmed, will be to conduct a \ncomplete review of all the Agency's activities.\n  Moreover, I strongly believe that the CIA needs a Director who will \ntake the reins of the Agency and provide the supervision and oversight \nso that this agency, which operates in a clandestine world of its own, \nmust have.\n  President Obama has made clear that his selection of Leon Panetta was \nintended as a clean break from the past--a break from secret detentions \nand coercive interrogations; a break from outsourcing its work to a \nsmall army of contractors; and a break from analysis that was not only \nwrong, but the product of bad practice that helped lead our Nation to \nwar.\n  President Obama said when announcing this nomination that this will \nbe a CIA Director ``who has my complete trust and substantial clout.''\n  This is a hugely important but difficult post. The CIA is the largest \ncivilian intelligence agency with the most disparate of missions.\n  It produces the most strategic analysis of the intelligence agencies \nand it is the center for human intelligence collection. It is unique in \nthat it carries out covert action programs, implementing policy through \nintelligence channels. The Intelligence Committee held confirmation \nhearings on Mr. Panetta's nomination on February 5 and 6.\n  Our responsibility was clear: to make sure that Leon Panetta will be \na Director who makes the CIA effective in what it does--but also to \nmake sure that it operates in a professional manner that reflects the \ntrue values of this country.\n  The committee did its work. It questioned Mr. Panetta on a broad \narray of issues he will confront as Director of the CIA, and it \nsubmitted followup questions, all of which were answered.\n  These questions, and Mr. Panetta's answers, can be found at the \nIntelligence Committee Web site.\n  I urge all Members of the Senate, as well as the public, to review \nthem in order to obtain a better understanding of his views about the \noffice to which he has been nominated.\n  I am pleased to report that yesterday the Intelligence Committee \nvoted unanimously to report favorably the nomination of Leon Panetta to \nbe the Director of the CIA. He has the confidence of the committee, and \nwe believe we will be able to work closely with him during his tenure.\n  Leon Panetta will mark a new beginning for the CIA as its next \nDirector.\n  He has the integrity, the drive and the judgment to ensure that the \nCIA fulfills its mission of producing information critical to our \nnational security, without sacrificing our national values.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/12/senate-section/article/S2254-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 48, submitted earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 48) honoring the sesquicentennial of \n     Oregon statehood.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  (Mr. BEGICH assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, we rise to offer this resolution in \nrecognition of a historic day for my STATE and the people of Oregon. On \nFebruary 14, 1859, 150 years ago, President James Buchanan signed the \nbill that admitted Oregon as the 33rd STATE to join this great union.\n  Mr. President, 150 years ago, there were barely 50,000 people living \nin Oregon. Pictures from that era show hearty men and women standing in \nmud streets in front of clapboard buildings. That would soon change as \nthousands migrated across the continent on the Oregon Trail, a trek \nthat would become synonymous with the American spirit.\n  Those who made that arduous journey were not nomads aimlessly \nwandering the land looking for a quick buck. They came with a purpose: \nto work hard and to make a new start in a new land. And what a new land \nit was. Oregon was graced by providence with endless forests, rivers \nteeming with fish, fertile valleys, majestic mountains, a dramatic \ncoast line, and rugged high deserts.\n  Today, more than 3,500,000 people live in Oregon, which continues to \nboast some of the NATION's most unique and beautiful forests, farm \nlands, mountains, coast line and high deserts. They still beckon to \nthose who seek a better life, much in the same way as those who endured \nthe Oregon Trail. In some parts of Oregon the tracks made by the \npioneers covered wagons are still visible, forever etched in the \nlandscape.\n  Oregon has its geographic icons such as the Columbia River, Crater \nLake, and Mount Hood. It has its great names: Wayne Morse, Mark \nHatfield, Tom McCall. It has been a national leader with innovations \nsuch as an initiative stem that dates back to the turn of the last \ncentury, a beach bill, a bottle bill and a statewide land use planning \nprocess to protect those things that brought people to Oregon in the \nfirst place.\n\n[[Page S2255]]\n\n  Over its 150-year history, Oregon has earned a reputation as a \nprogressive, forward thinking STATE. We Oregonians are not without our \nquirks, but we embrace them with enthusiasm and wear them with pride. \nWe have watched our economy change from one based on forestry and wood \nproducts to one that has become a leader in high-tech innovation, from \nwood chips to silicon chips. Millions of people around the world know \nof Oregon because of companies like Nike, Intel, and Columbia \nSportswear that call Oregon home.\n  As our STATE embarks on another 150 years, Oregon is already working \nto cultivate new economies grounded in alternative energy, green \nbuildings, and clean technology. Wind, geothermal, and wave energy are \neither already being generated in Oregon or will be soon. The solar \nenergy industry has recognized the quality of Oregon's workforce and is \nmoving to our STATE in a big way.\n  But as Oregon embraces the new economy and new technology, we have \nnot forgotten those places for which we have become famous. With the \nhelp of this body, thousands of acres of Oregon's most beautiful, \nrugged, and pristine areas are destined for permanent protection. The \nanticipated additions of the Lewis and Clark Mount Hood Wilderness, the \nCopper Salmon Wilderness, the Badlands Wilderness, the Spring Basin \nWilderness, and the Cascade Siskiyou National Monument guarantee future \ngenerations of Americans will see firsthand why Oregon was the NATION's \nfirst destination resort.\n  We are all aware that these are serious times that require our full \nand undivided attention if we are going to restore America's greatness \nas an economic power and rebuild our reputation with the rest of the \nworld. But at the same time, I believe there is value at looking back \nto celebrate a place which has done so much to help make this country \ngreat. Please join me at wishing the great STATE of Oregon a happy \nbirthday and many more to come.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Oregon's 150th \nbirthday. On February 14 of this year, we will begin a year-long \ncelebration of those who invested their lives in making Oregon a great \nplace to live, work, and raise a family.\n  I was born in Myrtle Creek, OR, the son of a sawmill worker and grew \nup in Roseburg, OR. I later moved to East Multnomah County with my \nfamily and am truly blessed to call Oregon my home and share all of its \nnatural beauty with my family.\n  There are so many diverse events that take place all across Oregon \nwhich give our State its unique character. The Shakespeare Festival \nheld in Ashland, OR, draws tens of thousands of people from all over \nthe country and is one of the oldest non-profit theater companies in \nthe world. The Pendleton Roundup, located in Eastern Oregon, is one of \nthe largest rodeos in the world and has been going strong for nearly \none hundred years.\n  Oregon is one of the most geographically diverse States in the \ncountry and people from all across the state love to celebrate the \ngreat Oregon outdoors. The Hood to Coast Relay, which starts at Mount \nHood and ends in Seaside Oregon, is the largest relay in the world. \nEvery year, Oregonians compete in six events at the Pole Peddle Paddle \nin Bend, OR, a relay race that begins at the top of Mount Bachelor and \nends on the grassy banks of the Deschutes River. The Pole Peddle Paddle \nconsists of a leg in alpine skiing/snowboarding, cross-country skiing, \nbiking, running, canoe/kayaking and a sprint to the finish line.\n  Each of these events and the many other cultural, artistic and civic \nfestivals held in the State--will have a special resonance this year as \nwe honor our sesquicentennial.\n  But even more than the beautiful vistas of Oregon or the countless \ncelebrations, Oregon is defined by the people who live there. I've \ntraveled all over the State and met so many amazing Oregonians who \ncontinue to carry on the legacy of innovation and hard work that has \ntransformed our State into an influential civic laboratory and high \ntech hub. Oregon has taken the lead on issues vital to our natural \nresources and led the way in producing of some of the finest goods in \nthe country. As a United States Senator, I couldn't be prouder to \nrepresent such a wonderful State, filled with people who are incredibly \nkind and welcoming.\n  I encourage my fellow Oregonians to commemorate Oregon's 150th \nbirthday by taking part in local celebrations of our culture and \nhistory and volunteering some of your time to a service project in your \ncommunity. I invite my colleagues here in the Senate, your \nconstituents, and citizens from around the world to come to Oregon this \nyear and experience all our wonderful State has to offer. Regardless of \nwhere you live whether you are in North Carolina or Texas or Europe or \nSouth America a world of opportunity awaits you in Oregon. Come see how \ntogether we can make Oregon's next 150 years even more memorable.\n  (Mr. MERKLEY assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and that any statements relating to the resolution be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
